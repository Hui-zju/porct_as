<TEXT>Comparison between submucosal tunneling endoscopic resection and video-assisted thoracoscopic enucleation for esophageal submucosal tumors originating from the muscularis propria layer: a randomized controlled trial.
BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Surgical resection is considered the first treatment option for submucosal tumors (SMTs) originating from the muscularis propria layer while submucosal tunneling endoscopic resection (STER) is proved to be a safe and effective method for treating SMTs.
This study aimed to compare video-assisted thoracoscopic enucleation (VATE) with STER for treating esophageal SMTs.
METHODS: Sixty-six patients with small esophageal SMTs were prospectively randomized from July 2014 to December 2015.
After exclusion of 8 patients, 58 subjects scheduled for STER or VATE were enrolled.
Clinicopathological, endoscopic, and adverse events (AEs) data were collected and analyzed between STER and VATE.
RESULTS: Forty-six males and 12 females with a mean age of 46.1 +/- 9.4 years were randomized to the STER (n = 30) and VATE (n = 28) groups, respectively.
Demographics and lesion features were similar between the two groups.
Median procedure time was shorter in the STER group than the VATE group (44.5 vs. 106.5 min, P &lt; 0.001); cost was lower in the STER group (4499.46 vs. 6137.32 USD, P = 0.010).
Median decrease in hemoglobin levels post-procedure was - 1.6 g/L in the STER group and 14.7 g/L after VATE (P = 0.001).
Lower postoperative pain scores were found in the STER group compared with the VATE group (2 vs. 4, P &lt; 0.001).
No recurrent or residual tumors were found in either group.
En bloc resection rates, complete resection rates, hospital times, and post-procedure AEs were similar between two groups.
The en bloc resection rates for SMTs &lt; 20.0 mm were 100% in both groups while STER achieved only 71.4% en bloc resection rate for SMTs &gt;/= 20.0 mm.
CONCLUSION: STER and VATE are comparably effective for esophageal SMTs; however, STER is superior to VATE with shorter operation time and decreased cost, and seems safer than VATE.
STER is recommended for SMTs &lt; 20.0 mm while VATE is recommended for SMTs with a transverse diameter &gt; 35.0 mm.
