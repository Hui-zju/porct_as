<TEXT>A randomized controlled trial to determine the role of intraoperative lumbar cerebrospinal fluid drainage in patients undergoing endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary adenomas.
BACKGROUND: Intraoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks are a frequent cause of morbidity in patients undergoing transsphenoidal surgery.
This prospective study was performed to examine the impact of intraoperative lumbar subarachnoid drainage (LSAD) on the incidence of this complication and on the extent of resection in patients undergoing endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary adenomas.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study was conducted in a single large academic medical center.
All patients with pituitary adenomas who had not undergone prior transsphenoidal surgery were eligible for inclusion in the study.
Patients were randomly assigned to undergo transsphenoidal surgery with intraoperative lumbar drain insertion (LSAD group) or no lumbar drain insertion (no LSAD group).
An otolaryngologist independently determined the occurrence of an intraoperative CSF leak.
Extent of tumor resection was determined by volumetric analysis of postoperative magnetic resonance images in patients with nonfunctional tumors or functional adenomas with a large suprasellar component.
RESULTS: Sixty patients were eligible for inclusion, of which 30 were assigned to the LSAD group and 30 to the no LSAD group.
There were no statistically significant differences in patient demographics, tumor pathology, or radiology between the two groups.
The LSAD catheter was successfully inserted in all patients in the LSAD group.
Intraoperative CSF drainage significantly reduced the incidence of CSF leak from 46.7% in the no LSAD group to 3.3% in the LSAD group (P &lt; 0.001).
However, there were no statistically significant differences in the incidence of postoperative CSF rhinorrhea between the two groups.
There were no major catheter-related complications.
There was no statistically significant difference in the extent of resection between the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Controlled intraoperative CSF drainage significantly reduces the incidence of intraoperative CSF leakage in patients undergoing endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary adenomas.</TEXT>
