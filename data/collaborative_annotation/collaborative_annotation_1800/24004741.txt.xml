<TEXT>A work-directed intervention to enhance the return to work of employees with cancer: a case study.
The purpose of this case study was to describe how the return-to-work process evolved in an employee with cancer in the Netherlands and how a work-directed intervention supported this process.
The patient was a 35-year old female employee diagnosed with cervix carcinoma.
After surgery, the patient experienced depression, fatigue, fear of recurrence, and low mental working capacity.
Communication with the occupational physician was difficult.
A social worker at the hospital provided three counselling sessions aimed to support return to work and sent letters to the occupational physician to improve the communication.
The support by the social worker helped the patient to resume work gradually and the sending of information from the treating physician and social worker improved the communication with the occupational physician.
This resulted in the patient being able to achieve lasting return to work.
This work-directed intervention was highly valued by the patient and could be an important addition to usual psycho-oncological care for employees with cancer.</TEXT>
