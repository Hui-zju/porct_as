<TEXT>Randomized phase II trial of S-1 and cisplatin versus gemcitabine and cisplatin in patients with advanced biliary tract adenocarcinoma.
BACKGROUND: We evaluated the efficacy and safety of a combination of S-1 and cisplatin (SP) versus gemcitabine and cisplatin (GP) as first-line therapy for advanced biliary tract adenocarcinoma (ABTA).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients were randomized to receive cisplatin (60 mg/m(2) intravenously [IV] on Day 1) plus S-1 (40 mg/m(2) bid orally on Days 1-14) or gemcitabine (1000 mg/m(2) IV at 10 mg/m(2)/min on Days 1 and 8) every three weeks.
The primary end point was six-month progression-free survival (PFS).
RESULTS: Of 96 eligible patients, 49 were randomized to GP and 47 to SP.
At a median follow-up time of 14.2 months, the six-month PFS rates were 43.8% and 34.7%, respectively [unadjusted HR (GP/SP) =0.85, 95% CI 0.52-1.36].
The median OS values in the GP and SP groups were 10.1 months and 9.9 months, respectively [unadjusted HR (GP/SP) =0.72, 95% CI 0.45-1.17].
Grade 3-4 toxicities in the GP and SP groups included neutropenia (49.0% vs. 31.8%), anemia (22.4% vs. 2.3%), thrombocytopenia (22.4% vs. 4.5%), and asthenia (4.1% vs. 2.1%).
CONCLUSION: Both GP and SP has comparable efficacy with favorable safety profile as first-line treatment for ABTA.
