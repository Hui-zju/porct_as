<TEXT>Influence of tumour burden on trastuzumab pharmacokinetics in HER2 positive non-metastatic breast cancer.
AIMS: Trastuzumab, an antibody binding to epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), has been approved to treat HER2-positive breast cancer in different settings.
This study aimed at evaluating the influence of tumour size on trastuzumab pharmacokinetics (PK) in non-metastatic breast cancer patients treated with short term pre-operative trastuzumab.
METHODS: Trastuzumab PK data were obtained from a multicentre, randomized and comparative study.
This antibody was administered pre-operatively to patients with localized HER2-positive breast cancer as a single 4 mg kg(-1) loading dose followed by 5 weekly 2 mg kg(-1) doses.
Trastuzumab concentrations were measured repeatedly using an ELISA technique.
Tumour size was evaluated at baseline using breast echography.
Trastuzumab pharmacokinetics were studied using a population approach and a two compartment model.
The influence of tumour burden on trastuzumab pharmacokinetics was quantified as a covariate.
RESULTS: A total of 784 trastuzumab concentrations were available from the 79 eligible patients.
Estimated parameters (interindiviual standard deviation) were central volume of distribution =2.1 l (23%), peripheral volume of distribution =1.3 l (38%), intercompartment clearance =0.36 l day(-1) , with an elimination half-life of 11.8 days.
Typical clearance was 0.22 l day(-1) (19%) and its value was increased with tumour size.
In patients with the highest tumour size, trastuzumab clearance was 50% [18%-92%] higher than in patients with the lowest tumour size.
CONCLUSIONS: In non-metastatic breast cancer patients, trastuzumab clearance increases with tumour size.
The elimination half-life of trastuzumab was shorter in the present population of patients than in metastatic breast cancer patients previously studied.</TEXT>
