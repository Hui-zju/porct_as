<TEXT><![CDATA[A phase II open-label randomized multicenter trial of TSU-68 in combination with S-1 and oxaliplatin versus S-1 in combination with oxaliplatin in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.
BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide.
The combination of oxaliplatin-based treatments (oxaliplatin plus infusional 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin [FOLFOX] or oxaliplatin plus capecitabine [CapeOX]) and bevacizumab is a standard chemotherapy regimen for metastatic CRC (mCRC).
However, several clinical studies that tested S-1 plus oxaliplatin (SOX) indicate that SOX is also a treatment option for mCRC.
TSU-68 is an oral compound that inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptor and platelet-derived growth factor receptor.
The recommended dose of TSU-68 + SOX was previously determined in a phase I study of mCRC patients.
The goal of this trial was to evaluate the efficacy of TSU-68 in combination with SOX.
METHODS: This open-label multicenter randomized phase II trial was performed in Korea.
Treatment-naive mCRC patients with a performance status of 0 or 1 were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either TSU-68 + SOX or SOX alone.
The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS).
RESULTS: A total of 105 patients (TSU-68 + SOX, 52 patients; SOX alone, 53 patients) were randomized.
The median PFS was 7.0 months in the TSU-68 + SOX group (hazard ratio [HR], 1.057) and 7.2 months in the SOX group (p = 0.8401).
The most frequent grade 3 and 4 adverse events were thrombocytopenia (9.6 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 26.4 % [SOX]), neutropenia (13.5 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 15.1 % [SOX]), and anemia (3.8 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 13.2 % [SOX]).
We observed a difference between the 2 groups for all grades of anemia (15.4 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 32.1 % [SOX]), diarrhea (30.8 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 47.2 % [SOX]), vomiting (50.0 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 26.4 % [SOX]), and chromaturia (23.1 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 0.0 % [SOX]).
Analysis using a Cox proportional hazard model showed that baseline interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels were associated with a survival benefit of TSU-68 (p = 0.012).
CONCLUSION: TSU-68 + SOX had a favorable safety profile.
However, TSU-68 did not have a synergistic effect on the efficacy of SOX.
The baseline serum IL-6 level could be a prognostic factor for TSU-68 efficacy.]]></TEXT>
