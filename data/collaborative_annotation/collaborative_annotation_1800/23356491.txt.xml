<TEXT>The efficacy and tolerability of adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine and Stanford V in older Hodgkin lymphoma patients: a comprehensive analysis from the North American intergroup trial E2496.
There is a lack of contemporary prospective data examining the adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine (ABVD) and Stanford V (SV; doxorubicin, vinblastine, mechlorethamine, vincristine, bleomycin, etoposide, prednisone) regimens in older Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) patients.
Forty-four advanced-stage, older HL patients (aged &gt;/=60 years) were treated on the randomized study, E2496.
Toxicities were mostly similar between chemotherapy regimens, although 24% of older patients developed bleomycin lung toxicity (BLT), which occurred mainly with ABVD (91%).
Further, the BLT-related mortality rate was 18%.
The overall treatment-related mortality for older HL patients was 9% vs. 0.3% for patients aged &lt;60 years (P &lt; 0.001).
Among older patients, there were no survival differences between ABVD and SV.
According to age, outcomes were significantly inferior for older versus younger patients (5-year failure-free survival: 48% vs. 74%, respectively, P = 0.002; 5-year overall survival: 58% and 90%, respectively, P &lt; 0.0001), although time-to-progression (TTP) was not significantly different (5-year TTP: 68% vs. 78%, respectively, P = 0.37).
Furthermore, considering progression and death without progression as competing risks, the risk of progression was not different between older and younger HL patients (5 years: 30% and 23%, respectively, P = 0.30); however, the incidence of death without progression was significantly increased for older HL patients (22% vs. 9%, respectively, P &lt; 0.0001).
Altogether, the marked HL age-dependent survival differences appeared attributable primarily to non-HL events.</TEXT>
