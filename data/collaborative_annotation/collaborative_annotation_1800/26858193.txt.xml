<TEXT>Safety of Everolimus in Patients Younger than 3 Years of Age: Results from EXIST-1, a Randomized, Controlled Clinical Trial.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the long-term safety of everolimus in young children with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)-associated subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA).
STUDY DESIGN: EXamining everolimus In a Study of Tuberous Sclerosis Complex-1 (EXIST-1) was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind phase 3 study with an open-label extension evaluating the efficacy and tolerability of everolimus in patients with TSC-associated SEGA.
Everolimus was initiated at 4.5 mg/m(2)/day and titrated to blood trough levels of 5-15 ng/mL. Post hoc analysis of safety data (adverse events [AEs]) was performed in a subgroup of patients aged &lt;3 years at everolimus initiation.
RESULTS: Eighteen patients (median age 1.82 years) were included; 16 were still receiving everolimus at the analysis cut-off date of January 11, 2013.
Median everolimus exposure was 31.1 months (range, 11.5-39 months).
One patient discontinued treatment because of AEs (ie, Acinetobacter bacteremia, increased blood alkaline phosphatase, and viral infection).
AEs were reported in all patients, but events were mostly grade 1/2 in severity; 12 patients (66.7%) experienced grade 3 events, and 2 patients (11.1%) reported grade 4 events.
The most common AEs were stomatitis, cough, pharyngitis, and pyrexia; no new safety issues were identified in this population.
Serious AEs were reported in 50% of patients; these were suspected to be medication related in 4 patients (22.2%).
CONCLUSIONS: Everolimus appears to be a safe therapeutic option for patients aged &lt;3 years with TSC-associated SEGA.
The small sample size in this subpopulation limits interpretation of the results; additional studies in the pediatric population are needed and are underway.
