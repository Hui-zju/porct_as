<TEXT>Turkish social attitudes towards to cancer prevention: a health belief model study.
This research was planned to reveal society's attitude towards cancer and early diagnosis using the health belief model.
This study was planned as descriptive research in Isparta.
A random sample of n=256 individuals of both genders was recruited at the largest shopping center.
As a means of collection tool, a survey consisted of two forms, the first designed for sociodemographic information and the second covering 29 questions suitable for the content of Health Belief Model.
Of the participants, 66.8% were female and 33.2% were male, and the average age was 33.3+/-11.0 years.
Some 46.1% partly thought that they may develop cancer, and 49.6% were afraid of this possibility.
As many as 50% indicated that cancer is an issue that comes from Allah.
A significant difference was found between not going for control unless feeling bad, and blood analysis for cancer screening (chi2=3.780 p= 0.03).
It was seen that in an area with a high rate of cancer, people's awareness of cancer prevention and early diagnosis and attitudes towards these are insufficient.</TEXT>
