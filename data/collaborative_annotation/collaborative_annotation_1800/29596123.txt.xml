<TEXT>Fast-Track Recovery Program After Major Liver Resection: A Randomized Prospective Study.
The objective of this study was to compare fast-track (FT) recovery protocol with the conventional one in patients treated with major liver resection by evaluating perioperative morbidity, length of hospitalization, and readmission rate.
Sixty-two patients suffering from malignant liver tumors were surgically treated from May 2012 to April 2014.
After randomization, they were prospectively divided into two groups: Group A patients (n = 32) followed FT recovery protocol and Group B patients (n = 30) were treated with the conventional (CON) protocol.
Postoperative morbidity, readmission rate, and median hospital stay in the two groups were studied.
Fast-track protocol was associated with a decreased complication (25%, p = .002), whereas the risk of postoperative morbidity was 2.4 times higher in patients treated with the CON protocol (60%, p = .002).
Readmission rate was not significantly different between the two groups (6.25%, p = .35).
Age (p = .382) and body mass index (p = .818) were not a suspending factor for following the FT protocol.
Overall length of stay (postoperative days) in the FT group was (mean +/- SD) 5.75 +/- .5 and in the CON group was 13.5 +/- 6.7 (p &lt; .001).
Fast-track recovery protocol seems to be safe and particularly efficient in patients undergoing major liver resections.</TEXT>
