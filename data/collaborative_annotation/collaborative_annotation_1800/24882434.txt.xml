BACKGROUND: Maintenance monotherapy with the PARP inhibitor olaparib significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) versus placebo in patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent serous ovarian cancer.
We aimed to explore the hypothesis that olaparib is most likely to benefit patients with a BRCA mutation.
METHODS: We present data from the second interim analysis of overall survival and a retrospective, preplanned analysis of data by BRCA mutation status from our randomised, double-blind, phase 2 study that assessed maintenance treatment with olaparib 400 mg twice daily (capsules) versus placebo in patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent serous ovarian cancer who had received two or more platinum-based regimens and who had a partial or complete response to their most recent platinum-based regimen.
Randomisation was by an interactive voice response system, stratified by time to progression on penultimate platinum-based regimen, response to the most recent platinum-based regimen before randomisation, and ethnic descent.
The primary endpoint was PFS, analysed for the overall population and by BRCA status.
This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00753545.
FINDINGS: Between Aug 28, 2008, and Feb 9, 2010, 136 patients were assigned to olaparib and 129 to placebo.
BRCA status was known for 131 (96%) patients in the olaparib group versus 123 (95%) in the placebo group, of whom 74 (56%) versus 62 (50%) had a deleterious or suspected deleterious germline or tumour BRCA mutation.
Of patients with a BRCA mutation, median PFS was significantly longer in the olaparib group than in the placebo group (11.2 months [95% CI 8.3-not calculable] vs 4.3 months [3.0-5.4]; HR 0.18 [0.10-0.31]; p<0.0001); similar findings were noted for patients with wild-type BRCA, although the difference between groups was lower (7.4 months [5.5-10.3] vs 5.5 months [3.7-5.6]; HR 0.54 [0.34-0.85]; p=0.0075).
At the second interim analysis of overall survival (58% maturity), overall survival did not significantly differ between the groups (HR 0.88 [95% CI 0.64-1.21]; p=0.44); similar findings were noted for patients with mutated BRCA (HR 0.73 [0.45-1.17]; p=0.19) and wild-type BRCA (HR 0.99 [0.63-1.55]; p=0.96).
The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events in the olaparib group were fatigue (in ten [7%] patients in the olaparib group vs four [3%] in the placebo group) and anaemia (seven [5%] vs one [<1%]).
Serious adverse events were reported in 25 (18%) patients who received olaparib and 11 (9%) who received placebo.
Tolerability was similar in patients with mutated BRCA and the overall population.
INTERPRETATION: These results support the hypothesis that patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent serous ovarian cancer with a BRCA mutation have the greatest likelihood of benefiting from olaparib treatment.
