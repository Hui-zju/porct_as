BACKGROUND: When treating indolent B-cell lymphoma, combining continuously administered oral phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors with immunochemotherapy has been associated with toxicity.
CHRONOS-4 (Phase III; NCT02626455) investigates the intravenous, intermittently administered pan-class I PI3K inhibitor copanlisib in combination with rituximab plus bendamustine (R-B) or rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) in patients with relapsed indolent B-cell lymphoma.
We report safety run-in results.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients aged >/=18 years with relapsed CD20-positive indolent B-cell lymphoma received copanlisib (45mg, increasing to 60mg if no dose-limiting toxicities) weekly on an intermittent schedule with R-B or R-CHOP.
Primary objective was to identify a recommended Phase III dose (RP3D).
We also assessed objective response, safety, and tolerability.
RESULTS: Ten patients received copanlisib plus R-B and 11 received copanlisib plus R-CHOP.
No dose-limiting toxicities were reported; RP3D was 60mg.
All patients had >/=1 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE), most commonly (all grade/grade 3/4) for copanlisib plus R-B: decreased neutrophil count (80%/50%), nausea (70%/0%), decreased platelet count (60%/10%), hyperglycemia (60%/50%); for copanlisib plus R-CHOP: hyperglycemia (82%/64%), hypertension (73%/64%), decreased neutrophil count (64%/64%).
Two and 8 patients had serious TEAEs with copanlisib plus R-B and R-CHOP, respectively.
Among evaluable patients, objective response rates were 90% (5 complete, 4 partial) and 100% (3 complete, 7 partial) with copanlisib plus R-B and R-CHOP, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Copanlisib is the first PI3K inhibitor to demonstrate safe, tolerable, and effective combinability with immunochemotherapy in patients with relapsed indolent B-cell lymphoma at full dose (60mg).
Further evaluation is ongoing.]]></TEXT>
