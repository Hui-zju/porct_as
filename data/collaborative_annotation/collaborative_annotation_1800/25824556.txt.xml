<TEXT>Effect of magnesium on functional outcome and paraclinical parameters of patients undergoing supratentorial craniotomy for brain tumors: a randomized controlled trial.
BACKGROUND: Several studies have demonstrated that magnesium (Mg) plays an important role in the prevention and treatment of central nervous system (CNS) insults.
In this study, we tested the effect of intravenous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) on the outcome of patients with brain tumors who underwent craniotomy.
The outcome was defined clinically as the Barthel index score and paraclinically as blood levels of NSE (neuron-specific enloase) and S100Beta protein.
METHODS: Sixty patients were randomly divided into two groups of 30 patients: the treatment and control groups.
In the treatment group, 5 g of MgSO4 in normal saline was infused in 6 h 2 days before surgery, and the same dosage was repeated the day before and during surgery.
The control group received placebo.
Serum S100Beta and NSE concentrations were measured at baseline before administration of magnesium, before surgery, and on the 2nd postoperative day.
The Barthel index score was evaluated and registered before surgery, 3, and 6 months after the operation.
RESULTS: The study results showed a significant change in S100Beta protein levels before and after surgery (p &lt; 0.05), but we could not find similar results for NSE protein and the Barthel index score.
There was a correlation between NSE protein and the Barthel index.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study revealed that administration of intravenous MgSO4 before and during surgery is safe and effective in reducing S100B protein levels in patients undergoing supratentorial craniotomy for brain tumors.
Further studies to elucidate the pathophysiology of brain injuries and role of magnesium are warranted.</TEXT>
