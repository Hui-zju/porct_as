<TEXT>Clinical practice patterns of lung stereotactic body radiation therapy in the United States: a secondary analysis.
OBJECTIVES: Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is a technique used to deliver high, ablative doses of radiation in a limited number of fractions to &gt;/=1 extracranial target(s).
Although recent studies have shown that SBRT provides effective local tumor control in medically inoperable early-stage lung cancer patients, its implementation in clinical practice is unknown.
METHODS: A random sample of 1600 American radiation oncologists was surveyed regarding lung SBRT usage, including year adopted, most common prescription, respiratory motion management, and target localization.
A biological equivalent dose (BED) was calculated using the linear quadratic model with alpha/beta=10.
Spearman rank correlation coefficients (r(s)) were calculated to identify factors associated with BED.
RESULTS: Of 1373 contactable physicians, 551 responses (40%) were received.
Of 510 evaluable responses, 275 physicians (54%) reported using lung SBRT, over half of whom adopted it in 2008 or later.
The most commonly reported prescriptions were 20 Gyx3 (22%), 18 Gyx3 (21%), and 12 Gyx4 (17%).
Three fraction regimens were most common (48%), with nearly all (89%) prescribing &gt;/=18 Gy/fraction.
The median BED was 132 Gy, with 95% of reported prescriptions having BED&gt;/=100 Gy.
Factors associated with increased BED included use of fiducial markers (r(s)=0.26, P&lt;0.001), use of planar imaging (r(s)=0.18, P&lt;0.01), and years of experience with lung SBRT (r(s)=0.13, P=0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: Lung SBRT has rapidly become a widely adopted treatment approach in the United States with a range of varying implementations.
Further research and additional prospective trials are necessary to optimize this novel approach.</TEXT>
