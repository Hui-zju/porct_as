<TEXT>Comparison of metabolic changes after neoadjuvant endocrine and chemotherapy in ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer.
Survival of breast cancer patients has improved, and treatment-related changes regarding metabolic profile deterioration after neoadjuvant systemic treatment (NST) become important issues in cancer survivors.
We sought to compare metabolic profile changes and the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) between patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT) and neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (NET) 3 years after the treatment.
In a prospective, randomized, phase III trial which compared 24 weeks of NCT with adriamycin and cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel and NET with goserelin and tamoxifen (NEST), 123 patients in the Asan Medical Center were retrospectively reviewed to evaluate metabolic changes, such as body mass index (BMI), blood pressure (BP), total cholesterol (TC), fasting glucose, and the NLR.
The mean age of patients was 42 years.
The changes in BMI, serum glucose, and TC during NST and after 3 years were significantly different between NCT and NET.
The proportion of overweight + obese group and the mean BMI were significantly increased during NCT (26.6% to 37.5%, 22.84 kg/m(2) to 23.87 kg/m(2), p &lt; 0.05), and these attributes found to have normalized at the 3-year follow-up.
In the NET group, BMI changes were not observed (p &gt; 0.05, all).
There were no differences in changes over time among in the Hypertension group during NCT and NET (p = 0.96).
The mean value of serum TC and fasting glucose significantly increased (&lt; 0.05, both) during NCT and decreased 3 years after NCT (p &lt; 0.05); however, no significant changes were observed in the NET group.
The NLR was increased from 1.83 to 3.18 after NCT (p &lt; 0.05) and decreased from 1.98 to 1.43 (p &lt; 0.05) after NET.
Compared with minimal metabolic effect of NET, NCT worsens metabolic profiles, which were recovered over 3 years.
The NLR was increased after NCT but decreased after NET.</TEXT>
