<TEXT>A randomized controlled trial of conventional fraction and late course accelerated hyperfraction three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy for esophageal cancer.
We compared the curative and side-effects in esophageal carcinoma treated by conventional fraction (CF) and late course accelerated hyperfraction (LCAF) three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy.
Ninety-eight patients were randomly assigned to two different radiotherapy model groups.
Fifty patients were treated using CF three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy at a total dose of 60-68 Gy; 2 Gy/F; 5 fractions/week (median 64 Gy), 48 patients were treated with LCAF (First CF-treated at the dose 40 Gy.
Later, LCAF-treated 1.5 Gy/F; 2 fractions/day; 21-27 Gy; a total dose of 61-67 Gy; median 64 Gy).
The data showed that the 1-, 2- and 3-year-survival rates in LCAF group were 79.2, 56.3, and 43.8%, compared to 74, 54, and 36% in CF group (P = 0.476).
The 1-, 2- and 3-year-local control rates in LCAF group were 81.3, 62.5, and 50%, compared to 78, 58, and 42% in CF group (P = 0.454).
In CF group, the incidence of radiation-induced esophagitis was lower than that in LCAF group (72 vs. 93.8%; P = 0.008) and there was no significant difference between rates of radiation-induced pneumonitis in CF and LCAF groups (10 vs. 6.25%; P = 0.498).
It was concluded that the 1-, 2- and 3-year-local control and survival rates of esophageal carcinoma patients treated with LCAF were slightly better than CF radiotherapy; however, the radiation side-effects in LCAF group were greater than those in CF group.</TEXT>
