<TEXT>Short-term outcomes of single-incision plus one-port laparoscopic versus conventional laparoscopic surgery for rectosigmoid cancer: a randomized controlled trial.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study is to evaluate the short-term outcomes of single-incision plus one-port surgery (SILS + 1) compared with conventional laparoscopic surgery (CLS) for colonic cancer.
BACKGROUND: At present, single-incision laparoscopic colectomy remains technically challenging.
The use of SILS + 1 as an alternative has gained increasing attention; however, its safety and efficacy remain controversial.
METHODS AND PATIENTS: Between April 2014 and July 2016, 198 patients with clinical stage T1-4aN0-2 M0 rectosigmoid cancer were enrolled.
The participants were randomly assigned to either SILS + 1 (n = 99) or CLS (n = 99).
The morbidity and mortality within 30 days, operative and pathologic outcomes, postoperative recovery course, inflammation and immune responses, and pain intensity were compared.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference in overall complications between the two groups (17.2 vs. 16.3%, P = 1.000).
The total operating time for the SILS + 1 group was significantly shorter (100.8 +/- 30.4 vs. 116.6 +/- 36.6, P = 0.002).
Blood loss was significantly greater in the CLS group (20 vs. 50, P &lt; 0.001).
Thirteen patients (14%) in the CLS group required additional postoperative analgesics, which was significantly more than four patients in the SILS + 1 group.
Notably, on postoperative day three, the visual analogue scale score of the CLS group was greater than that of the SILS + 1 group (1.3 +/- 1.1 vs. 1.7 +/- 1.3, P = 0.023).
Tumor diameter, pathologic stage, length of the proximal and distal margins, and number of lymph nodes harvested were similar, other values were also similar between the two groups.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that SILS + 1 might be safe and feasible for rectosigmoid cancer when performed by experienced surgeons.
It offers minimal invasiveness without compromising oncologic treatment principles.
