<TEXT>Randomized phase II study of tegafur-uracil/leucovorin versus tegafur-uracil/leucovorin plus oxaliplatin after curative resection of high-risk stage II/III colorectal cancer (SOAC-1101 trial).
PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial compared tegafur-uracil/leucovorin (UFT/LV) plus oxaliplatin (TEGAFOX) to UFT/LV as adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with high-risk stage II/III colorectal cancer.
METHODS: From 2010 to April 2015, 159 patients who underwent curative resection were randomly assigned to receive TEGAFOX (85 mg/m(2) oxaliplatin on days 1 and 15, 300 mg/m(2)/day UFT and 75 mg/day LV on days 1-28, every 35 days for five cycles) or UFT/LV.
The primary study endpoint was disease-free survival.
RESULTS: The 3-year disease-free survival rate was 84.2% in the TEGAFOX arm, versus 62.1% for UFT/LV.
The stratified hazard ratio for disease-free survival for TEGAFOX compared to UFT/LV was 0.338 (P &lt; 0.01).
The incidence of any-grade adverse events was significantly higher in the TEGAFOX arm (96.1%) than in the UFT/LV arm (76.6%; P &lt; 0.01).
The rates of any-grade neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase elevation, and peripheral sensory neuropathy were higher in the TEGAFOX group, whereas the incidence of grade &gt;/= 3 adverse events did not differ between the groups.
CONCLUSIONS: TEGAFOX is an additional adjuvant chemotherapy option for high-risk stage II/III colorectal cancer.
