<TEXT>Analysis of the relapse patterns and risk factors of endometrial cancer following postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy in a phase III randomized clinical trial.
OBJECTIVE: This study was to analyze patterns and risk factors of relapse after postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy for endometrial cancer.
METHODS: Among patients enrolled in a randomized phase III trial (JGOG2043) investigating the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy for endometrial cancer at a high risk of progression, the recurrent patients were studied.
Clinical information were collected, and correlation between relapse-related factors and clinicopathological factors were analyzed.
RESULTS: Among 193 patients analyzed, 50% had local relapse and 63% had distant relapse.
Local relapse involved regional lymph nodes in 30%, while distant relapse involved the abdominal cavity in 42%.
Imaging was used to confirm relapse in 83%, and the median disease-free interval (DFI) was 11.5 months.
Factors showing a significant correlation with DFI &lt;/=12 months were residual tumor at surgery (p &lt; 0.01), Grade 3 histology (p &lt; 0.01), and lymph node metastasis (p = 0.03).
In contrast, treatment with paclitaxel and carboplatin showed a significant correlation with DFI &gt;12 months (p = 0.04).
The median post-relapse overall survival (RS) was 23.9 months.
In multivariate analysis, CA125 &gt;/= 100 U/mL prior to relapse (p &lt; 0.01), distant metastasis (p &lt; 0.01), DFI &lt;/= 12 months (p = 0.02), and not performing para-aortic lymphadenectomy (p = 0.01) were independently related to poor RS.
CONCLUSIONS: Relapse of endometrial cancer following adjuvant chemotherapy often occurs by 1 year after treatment, with common relapse sites of the abdominal cavity and regional lymph nodes.
Among treatment-related factors, RS was correlated with DFI and para-aortic lymphadenectomy.</TEXT>
