BACKGROUND: Genomic tests may improve upon clinical risk estimation with traditional prognostic factors.
We aimed to explore how evidence on the prognostic strength of a genomic signature (clinical validity) can contribute to individualized decision making on starting chemotherapy for women with breast cancer (clinical utility).
METHODS: The MINDACT trial was a randomized trial that enrolled 6693 women with early-stage breast cancer.
A 70-gene signature (Mammaprint) was used to estimate genomic risk, and clinical risk was estimated by a dichotomized version of the Adjuvant!Online risk calculator.
Women with discordant risk results were randomized to the use of chemotherapy.
We simulated the full risk distribution of these women and estimated individual benefit, assuming a constant relative effect of chemotherapy.
RESULTS: The trial showed a prognostic effect of the genomic signature (adjusted hazard ratio 2.4).
A decision-analytic modeling approach identified far fewer women as candidates for genetic testing (4% rather than 50%) and fewer benefiting from chemotherapy (3% rather than 27%) as compared with the MINDACT trial report.
The selection of women benefitting from genetic testing and chemotherapy depended strongly on the required benefit from treatment and the assumed therapeutic effect of chemotherapy.
CONCLUSIONS: A high-quality pragmatic trial was insufficient to directly inform clinical practice on the utility of a genomic test for individual women.
The indication for genomic testing may be far more limited than suggested by the MINDACT trial.]]></TEXT>
