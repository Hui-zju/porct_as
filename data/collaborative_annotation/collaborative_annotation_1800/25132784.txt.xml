<TEXT>Efficacy of morning-only 4 liter sulfa free polyethylene glycol vs 2 liter polyethylene glycol with ascorbic acid for afternoon colonoscopy.
AIM: To compare the bowel cleansing efficacy of same day ingestion of 4-L sulfa-free polyethylene glycol (4-L SF-PEG) vs 2-L polyethylene glycol solution with ascorbic acid (2-L PEG + Asc) in patients undergoing afternoon colonoscopy.
METHODS: 206 patients (mean age 56.7 years, 61% male) undergoing outpatient screening or surveillance colonoscopies were prospectively randomized to receive either 4-L SF-PEG (n = 104) or 2-L PEG + Asc solution (n = 102).
Colonoscopies were performed by two blinded endoscopists.
Bowel preparation was graded using the Ottawa scale.
Each participant completed a satisfaction and side effect survey.
RESULTS: There was no difference in patient demographics amongst groups.
4-L SF-PEG resulted in better Ottawa scores compared to 2-L PEG + Asc, 4.2 vs 4.9 (P = 0.0186); left colon: 1.33 vs 1.57 respectively (P = 0.0224), right colon: 1.38 vs 1.63 respectively (P = 0.0097).
No difference in Ottawa scores was found for the mid colon or amount of fluid.
Patient satisfaction was similar for both arms but those assigned to 4-L SF-PEG reported less bloating: 23.1% vs 11.5% (P = 0.0235).
Overall polyp detection, adenomatous polyp and advanced adenoma detection rates were similar between the two groups.
CONCLUSION: Morning only 4-L SF-PEG provided superior cleansing with less bloating as compared to 2-L PEG + Asc bowel preparation for afternoon colonoscopy.
Thus, future studies evaluating efficacy of morning only preparation for afternoon colonoscopy should use 4-L SF-PEG as the standard comparator.</TEXT>
