<TEXT>Main outcomes of the Move More for Life Trial: a randomised controlled trial examining the effects of tailored-print and targeted-print materials for promoting physical activity among post-treatment breast cancer survivors.
BACKGROUND: Participation in physical activity can improve the health outcomes of breast cancer survivors.
To impact public health, broad-reaching sustainable interventions that promote physical activity are needed.
PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of two distance-based interventions for promoting physical activity among breast cancer survivors compared with a standard recommendation control.
METHODS: Breast cancer survivors who had finished 'active' cancer treatment were eligible to participate.
Participants (n = 330) were randomly assigned to receive one of the following mail-delivered interventions: three computer-tailored newsletters, a previously developed breast cancer-specific physical activity booklet or a pamphlet detailing the public health recommendations for physical activity (control).
Primary outcomes were self-reported moderate to vigorous aerobic activity and participant's self-reported resistance training activity at 4 months post-baseline.
Secondary outcomes were pedometer step counts, whether or not participants were meeting the physical activity guidelines, time spent in sedentary behaviour, fatigue and health-related quality of life.
RESULTS: Participants randomised into the tailored-print intervention group were three times more likely to commence resistance training and meet the resistance-training guidelines immediately after the intervention than participants allocated to the control group.
There were no other significant intervention effects.
CONCLUSION: Computer-tailored newsletters may be an effective strategy for enhancing resistance-based physical activity among breast cancer survivors.
The null findings relating to other outcomes may be due to ceiling effects (in the case of aerobic activity, fatigue and health-related quality of life) or the sensitivity of the measure used (in the case of sitting time).
These issues require further exploration.</TEXT>
