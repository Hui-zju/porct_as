<TEXT>Pilot, randomized trial of resistance exercise during radiation therapy for head and neck cancer.
BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility of a randomized trial of resistance exercise in patients with head and neck cancer receiving radiation.
METHODS: Fifteen patients with head and neck cancer receiving radiation were randomized to resistance exercise (using resistance bands) or control group.
Resistance exercise occurred at the radiation therapy site (weeks 1-6) and home (weeks 7-12).
RESULTS: No serious adverse events occurred related to resistance exercise.
Medium to large effect size differences favoring resistance exercise versus control group were noted for perceived fatigue at 6 weeks (smaller increase in fatigue for resistance exercise group; 7.4 vs 15.4, effect size [d] = -0.64), quality of life at 6 weeks (-7.0 vs -14.4, d = 0.52), and chair rise time (seconds) at 6 and 12 weeks (-1.6 vs 0.4, d = -.63 and -1.9 vs 0.1, d = -0.60, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Resistance exercise is safe and feasible in patients with head and neck cancer receiving radiation; a definitive trial is warranted.</TEXT>
