<TEXT>Assessing the Psychological Impact of Daily Bowel Preparation on Prostate Patients Who Receive Radiation Therapy.
PURPOSE: Evidence has shown that the prostate moves depending on filling of the rectum and, to a lesser extent, the bladder; many radiation therapy departments have adopted standardized bladder filling/rectal emptying protocols for radiotherapy treatment.
Daily treatments may be delayed until appropriate volumes are attained; the resultant psychological impact of these delays on patients is unknown.
The purpose of this study was to determine levels of anxiety, depression, distress, and bother related to bowel preparation for prostate cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy treatment.
METHODS: A prospective cohort analysis of prostate cancer patients undergoing external beam radiation therapy was completed.
Patients were assigned to one of three groups; Group A was standard of care, Group B was standard of care plus increased educational information regarding bowel preparation, Group C was standard of care plus increased educational information regarding bowel preparation plus an anti-flatulent medication.
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Distress Thermometer, and a Bowel Status Bother survey were completed by participants at the start of theircourse of radiation treatment, mid-way through, and at the end.
Analysis of variance testing was completed to determine differences in mean scores between the three groups.
RESULTS: Mean age of patients (N = 30) was 66 years; 50% of the participants had a university education; 80% were married.
Anxiety levels decreased over time in all groups (P = .039) with no difference between groups (P = 0.447).
Depression levels across time for each group remained low (P = .577).
Overall distress levels associated with bowel preparation were low among each group, and no significant differences were reported (P = .978).
All groups reported high rates of quality of life.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study indicate that collectively across three groups and over time, there were low levels of anxiety, depression, and distress from bowel preparation.
Amount, timing, quality, and approach to educational information are important factors to ensure patients feel prepared for their radiation therapy treatments.</TEXT>
