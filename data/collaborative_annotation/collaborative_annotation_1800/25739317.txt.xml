<TEXT>The UK HeartSpare Study (Stage IB): randomised comparison of a voluntary breath-hold technique and prone radiotherapy after breast conserving surgery.
PURPOSE: To compare mean heart and left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) doses (NTDmean) and positional reproducibility in larger-breasted women receiving left breast radiotherapy using supine voluntary deep-inspiratory breath-hold (VBH) and free-breathing prone techniques.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Following surgery for early breast cancer, patients with estimated breast volumes &gt;750 cm(3) underwent planning-CT scans in supine VBH and free-breathing prone positions.
Radiotherapy treatment plans were prepared, and mean heart and LAD doses were calculated.
Patients were randomised to receive one technique for fractions 1-7, before switching techniques for fractions 8-15 (40 Gy/15 fractions total).
Daily electronic portal imaging and alternate-day cone-beam CT (CBCT) imaging were performed.
The primary endpoint was the difference in mean LAD NTDmean between techniques.
Population systematic (Sigma) and random errors (sigma) were estimated.
Within-patient comparisons between techniques used Wilcoxon signed-rank tests.
RESULTS: 34 patients were recruited, with complete dosimetric data available for 28.
Mean heart and LAD NTDmean doses for VBH and prone treatments respectively were 0.4 and 0.7 (p&lt;0.001) and 2.9 and 7.8 (p&lt;0.001).
Clip-based CBCT errors for VBH and prone respectively were 3.0 mm and 6.5 mm (Sigma) and 3.5 mm and 5.4 mm (sigma).
CONCLUSIONS: In larger-breasted women, supine VBH provided superior cardiac sparing and reproducibility than a free-breathing prone position.</TEXT>
