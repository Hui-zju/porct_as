<TEXT>Inbag Morcellation Applied to the Laparoscopic Surgery of Leiomyoma: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of an endoscopic bag during laparoscopic morcellation of leiomyoma or myomatous uterus.
Materials and Methods: A total of 48 patients with symptomatic leiomyoma were randomized for laparoscopic morcellation in two groups: group A with a specific endoscopic bag or group B without any bag.
The primary outcome measure was the detection of smooth muscle cells from washing after power morcellation determined by peritoneal cytology and immunohistochemistry (IHC).
Results: Cytology and IHC from group A did not revealed any smooth muscle cells, while 29% of cases (7/24) from group B were positive (p = .009).
The duration of the surgical procedure was the same in both groups.
The duration of positioning the bag did not change significantly during the study.
Only in one case the use of the bag was difficult due to a low pneumoperitoneum.
Conclusions: The use of a morcellation bag is efficient to prevent the spread of smooth muscle cells during the morcellation of leiomyoma or myomatous uterus.
This study confirms the feasibility and the safety of the laparoscopic inbag morcellation versus open morcellation.</TEXT>
