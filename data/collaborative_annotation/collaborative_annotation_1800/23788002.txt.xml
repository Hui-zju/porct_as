<TEXT>Rapid incorporation of omega-3 fatty acids into colonic tissue after oral supplementation in patients with colorectal cancer: a randomized, placebo-controlled intervention trial.
BACKGROUND: The purpose of the study was to examine whether a preoperative supplement with omega-3 fatty acids (FAs) leads to their incorporation into colonic tissue in patients scheduled for colorectal cancer surgery.
This would be of interest because omega-3 FAs have potential beneficial (local) immunological effects that might benefit these patients.
METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, prospective, placebo-controlled, single-center intervention trial, patients referred for elective colorectal cancer surgery received either an omega-3 FA-enriched oral nutrition supplement (ONS) (200 mL twice daily) providing 2.0 g of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 1.0 g of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) per day or a standard ONS for 7 days before surgery.
Tissue samples from healthy colonic tissue (mucosa and muscular layer) were obtained during surgery, and tissue fatty acid composition was analyzed by gas chromatography.
RESULTS: EPA was significantly higher in colonic mucosa (P = .001) and in the colonic muscular layer (P = .004) in the omega-3 FA group compared with controls.
Patients in the omega-3 FA group also tended to have higher docosapentaenoic acid and DHA levels in colonic tissue.
CONCLUSIONS: EPA is incorporated rapidly into colonic mucosa and colonic muscular layer in patients given 3 g of omega-3 FA daily for 7 days before surgery for colorectal cancer.
This may lead to potential beneficially effects on (local) immune function, which might benefit these patients.</TEXT>
