<TEXT><![CDATA[Efficacy and safety of trastuzumab, lapatinib, and paclitaxel neoadjuvant treatment with or without prolonged exposure to anti-HER2 therapy, and with or without hormone therapy for HER2-positive primary breast cancer: a randomised, five-arm, multicentre, open-label phase II trial.
BACKGROUND: Dual blockade of HER2 promises increased pathological complete response (pCR) rate compared with single blockade in the presence of chemotherapy for HER2-positive (+) primary breast cancer.
Many questions remain regarding optimal duration of treatment and combination impact of endocrine therapy for luminal HER2 disease.
METHODS: We designed a randomised phase II, five-arm study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lapatinib and trastuzumab (6 weeks) followed by lapatinib and trastuzumab plus weekly paclitaxel (12 weeks) with/without prolongation of anti-HER2 therapy prior to chemotherapy (18 vs. 6 weeks), and with/without endocrine therapy in patients with HER2+ and/or oestrogen receptor (ER)+ disease.
The primary endpoint was comprehensive pCR (CpCR) rate.
Among the secondary endpoints, pCR (yT0-isyN0) rate, safety, and clinical response were evaluated.
RESULTS: In total, 215 patients were enrolled; 212 were included in the full analysis set (median age 53.0 years; tumour size = T2, 65%; and tumour spread = N0, 55%).
CpCR was achieved in 101 (47.9%) patients and was significantly higher in ER- patients than in ER+ patients (ER- 63.0%, ER+ 36.1%; P = 0.0034).
pCR with pN0 was achieved in 42.2% of patients (ER- 57.6%, ER+ 30.3%).
No significant difference was observed in pCR rate between prolonged exposure groups and standard groups.
Better clinical response outcomes were obtained in the prolongation phase of the anti-HER2 therapy.
No surplus was detected in pCR rate by adding endocrine treatment.
No major safety concern was recognised by prolonging the anti-HER2 treatment or adding endocrine therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed the therapeutic impact of lapatinib, trastuzumab, and paclitaxel therapy for each ER- and ER+ subgroup of HER2+ patients.
Development of further strategies and tools is required, particularly for luminal HER2 disease.]]></TEXT>
