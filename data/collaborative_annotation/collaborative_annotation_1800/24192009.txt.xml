<TEXT>Strategies to improve repeat fecal occult blood testing cancer screening.
BACKGROUND: A comparative effectiveness intervention by this team improved initial fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) rates from 3% to 53% among community clinic patients.
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and costs associated with a literacy-informed intervention on repeat FOBT testing.
METHODS: Between 2008 and 2011, a three-arm quasi-experiential comparative effectiveness evaluation was conducted in eight community clinics in Louisiana.
Clinics were randomly assigned to receive: enhanced care, a screening recommendation, and FOBT kit annually; a brief educational intervention where patients additionally received a literacy appropriate pamphlet and simplified FOBT instructions; or nurse support where a nurse manager provided the education and followed up with phone support.
In year 2, all materials were mailed.
The study consisted of 461 patients, ages 50 to 85 years, with a negative initial FOBT.
RESULTS: Repeat FOBT rates were 38% enhanced care, 33% education, and 59% with nurse support (P = 0.017).
After adjusting for age, race, gender, and literacy, patients receiving nurse support were 1.46 times more likely to complete repeat FOBT screening than those receiving education [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.14-1.06; P = 0.002] and 1.45 times more likely than those in enhanced care but this was not significant (95% CI, 0.93-2.26; P = 0.10).
The incremental cost per additional person screened was $2,450 for nurse over enhanced care.
CONCLUSION: A mailed pamphlet and FOBT with simplified instructions did not improve annual screening.
IMPACT: Telephone outreach by a nurse manager was effective in improving rates of repeat FOBT, yet this may be too costly for community clinics.</TEXT>
