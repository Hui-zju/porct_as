<TEXT>Memantine before Mastectomy Prevents Post-Surgery Pain: A Randomized, Blinded Clinical Trial in Surgical Patients.
BACKGROUND: Neuropathic pain following surgical treatment for breast cancer with or without chemotherapy is a clinical burden and patients frequently report cognitive, emotional and quality of life impairment.
A preclinical study recently showed that memantine administered before surgery may prevent neuropathic pain development and cognitive dysfunction.
With a translational approach, a clinical trial has been carried out to evaluate whether memantine administered before and after mastectomy could prevent the development of neuropathic pain, the impairment of cognition and quality of life.
METHOD: A randomized, pilot clinical trial included 40 women undergoing mastectomy in the Oncology Department, University Hospital, Clermont-Ferrand, France.
Memantine (5 to 20 mg/day; n = 20) or placebo (n = 20) was administered for four weeks starting two weeks before surgery.
The primary endpoint was pain intensity measured on a (0-10) numerical rating scale at three months post-mastectomy.
RESULTS: Data analyses were performed using mixed models and the tests were two-sided, with a type I error set at alpha = 0.05.
Compared with placebo, patients receiving memantine showed at three months a significant difference in post-mastectomy pain intensity, less rescue analgesia and a better emotional state.
An improvement of pain symptoms induced by cancer chemotherapy was also reported.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows for the first time the beneficial effect of memantine to prevent post-mastectomy pain development and to diminish chemotherapy-induced pain symptoms.
The lesser analgesic consumption and better well-being of patients for at least six months after treatment suggests that memantine could be an interesting therapeutic option to diminish the burden of breast cancer therapy.
