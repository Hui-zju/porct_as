<TEXT>[The first results of treatment for adult acute myeloid leukemia according to the AML-01.10 protocol of the Research Group of the Hematology Centers of Russia].
AIM: To give the preliminary results of the AML-01.10 Russian multicenter randomized trial to treat adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the basic principle of which is to use high-dose anthracycline antibiotics in induction/consolidation.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: By December 2011, 145 patients with AML had been randomized from 18 hematology centers of 15 cities and towns of the Russian Federation; the median age of all the patients was 44 years.
Seventy-one patients were analyzed in August 2011 (a 1.5-year follow-up).
RESULTS: The efficiency of 2 courses 7+3 using high-dose daunorubicin (60 mg/m2 per administration) and continuous infusion of cytarabine during the second course was high and comparable with that in the use of a high-dose HAM protocol as a second induction course and can achieve a complete remission in 74.6%.
The protocol toxicity evaluated from its early mortality (11.3%) and its death in complete remission (16.6%) was permissible, particularly by taking into consideration the multicenter pattern of the trial.
At the completion of analysis, 53 (68.8%) out of the 77 patients on whom the data on their vital status were available were alive.
In this follow-up period, the frequency of recurrences was 19.2% (10/52).
Only 3 (4.2%) patients out of the 71 patients in whom the efficiency of the protocol had been completely evaluated underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.
CONCLUSION: The total high dose (720 mg/m2) of anthracycline antibiotics, which is used in the period of induction and consolidation, determines the long periods of myelosuppression and intercourse intervals.
Protocol deviations (no course of consolidation therapy, lower-dose idarubicin during consolidation therapy, a course of low-dose cytarabine, between the courses of induction and consolidation chemotherapy, and very long intercourse intervals) were recorded in a total of 20 (28%) patients.</TEXT>
