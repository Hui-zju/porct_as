<TEXT>[Clinical study on platelet engraftment by thrombopoietin in patients with hematological malignancies after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation].
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of thrombopoietin (TPO) on platelet engraftment in hematological malignancies patients after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT).
METHODS: One hundred and twenty patients were enrolled in a multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled clinical trial, and were randomized into 4 treatment groups following allo-HSCT.
Group A was the control arm without TPO, while group B, C and D were trial arms with received 300 Uxkg(-1)xd(-1) of TPO starting from day +1, +4 and +7, respectively.
A total of 89 cases were evaluated, of which 22 cases in group A, 23 in group B, 20 in group C and 24 in group D. Efficacy evaluation (the time of platelet engraftment, the number of platelet transfusion) and safety evaluation \[adverse events, routine blood tests, liver and renal function, coagulation function and occurrence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)\] were observed.
RESULTS: The median platelet engraftment time in experimental groups (groups B, C and D) were on day (13.17 +/- 2.89), day (12.15 +/- 2.08), day (12.33 +/- 1.76), respectively, and that in control group was on day (14.82 +/- 5.05).
There was statistically significant difference between two groups (P = 0.029), There were no statistically significant difference in the average amount of platelet transfusion, platelet engraftment time, and platelet nadir value among the 3 experimental groups.
No significant adverse events were observed in experimental groups.
CONCLUSIONS: TPO administration following allo-HSCT for patients with hematologic malignancies appears to shorten platelet engraftment time.
TPO given starting from day +7 is effective and safe.</TEXT>
