<TEXT>TRAIL receptor agonist conatumumab with modified FOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab for first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer: A randomized phase 1b/2 trial.
BACKGROUND: In patients with previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), we conducted a phase 1b/randomized phase 2 trial to define the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab (mFOLFOX6/bev) with conatumumab, an investigational, fully human monoclonal IgG1 antibody that specifically activates death receptor 5 (DR5).
METHODS: Twelve patients were enrolled in a phase 1b open-label dose-escalation trial of conatumumab with mFOLFOX6/bev; thereafter, 190 patients were randomized 1:1:1 to receive mFOLFOX6/bev in combination with 2 mg/kg conatumumab, 10 mg/kg conatumumab, or placebo.
Therapy cycles were repeated every 2 weeks until disease progression or the occurrence of unacceptable toxicity.
RESULTS: In phase 1b, conatumumab with mFOLFOX6/bev was tolerated without apparent added toxicity over mFOLFOX6/bev alone.
In phase 2, conatumumab with mFOLFOX6/bev did not confer a benefit in progression-free survival when compared with placebo with mFOLFOX6/bev.
Toxicity was similar in all treatment arms.
Following treatment, similar increases in circulating caspase-3 levels were observed in all arms.
CONCLUSIONS: Conatumumab with mFOLFOX6/bev did not offer improved efficacy over the same chemotherapy with placebo in first-line treatment of patients with mCRC.
These data do not support further development of conatumumab in advanced CRC.</TEXT>
