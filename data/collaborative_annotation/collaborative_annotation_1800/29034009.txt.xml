BACKGROUND: Decitabine is a deoxycytidine nucleoside derivative inhibitor of DNA-methyltransferases, which has been studied extensively and is approved for myelodysplastic syndrome in adults but with less focus in children.
Accordingly, we conducted a phase 1 multicenter, randomized, open-label study to evaluate decitabine pre-treatment before standard induction therapy in children with newly diagnosed AML to assess safety and tolerability and explore a number of biologic endpoints.
RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were fully assessable for all study objectives per protocol (10 in Arm A = epigenetic priming induction, 14 in Arm B = standard induction).
All patients experienced neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.
The most common grade 3 and 4 non-hematologic adverse events observed were gastrointestinal toxicities and hypophosphatemia.
Plasma decitabine PK were similar to previously reported adult data.
Overall CR/CRi was similar for the two arms.
MRD negativity at end-induction was 85% in Arm A versus 67% in Arm B patients.
DNA methylation measured in peripheral blood over the course of treatment tracked with blast clearance and matched marrow aspirates at day 0 and day 21.
Unlike end-induction marrow analyses, promoter methylation in blood identified an apparent reversal of response in the lone treatment failure, 1 week prior to the patient's marrow aspirate confirming non-response.
Decitabine-induced effects on end-induction (day 35-43 following initiation of treatment) marrows in Arm A were reflected by changes in DNA methylation in matched paired marrow diagnostic aspirates.
CONCLUSIONS: This first-in-pediatrics trial demonstrates that decitabine prior to standard combination chemotherapy is feasible and well tolerated in children with newly diagnosed AML.
Pre-treatment with decitabine may represent a newer therapeutic option for pediatric AML, especially as it appears to induce important epigenetic alterations.
The novel biological correlates studied in this trial offer a clinically relevant window into disease progression and remission.
Additional studies are needed to definitively assess whether decitabine can enhance durability responses in children with AML.
