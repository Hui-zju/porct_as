<TEXT>Prognostic value of serum CA9 in patients with metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma under targeted therapy.
AIM: Carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9) has been found to be one of most powerful biomarkers for clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC).
The serum CA9 is detectable.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential prognostic role of serum CA9 in patients with metastatic clear-cell RCC patients under targeted therapy.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Serum samples came from the randomized phase 2 TORAVA trial.
All patients received a targeted therapy (arm A designed as experimental group: temsirolimus and bevacizumab combination; arm B: sunitinib; arm C: interferon-alfa and bevacizumab).
Seventy cases of metastatic clear-cell RCC were analyzed.
There were 49 males and 21 females.
The age ranged from 33.5 to 79.1 years with a median of 61.2 years.
Serum samples were collected before treatment.
Serum CA9 was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
The correlation of the serum CA9 levels with the clinical parameters, treatment response and overall survival was analyzed.
Overall survival estimates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by the log-rank test.
RESULTS: Serum concentrations of CA9 ranged between 0 and 897.3 pg/ml, with an average of 94.4+/-176.6 pg/ml.
There was no association between serum CA9 and clinical parameters such as Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (p=0.367) or Motzer classification (p=0.431).
The serum CA9 levels were lower in the response group (64.7+/-104.7 pg/ml) than the no-response group (108.2+/-203.8 pg/ml), but the difference was not statisticlly significant (p=0.366).
For the patient group overall, the Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed that high serum CA9 levels were significantly associated with shorter overall survival (hazard ratio=2.65, 95% confidence interval=1.19-5.92, log-rank test p=0.0136).
For the major group of patients treated with temsirolimus and bevacizumab, the Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed that high serum CA9 levels were significantly associated with shorter overall survival (p=0.0006).
CONCLUSION: Serum CA9 levels may be of clinical interest to predict the outcome for patients under targeted therapy for metastatic clear-cell RCC.
CA9 may be used to select patients with metastatic clear cell RCC for clinical trials.</TEXT>
