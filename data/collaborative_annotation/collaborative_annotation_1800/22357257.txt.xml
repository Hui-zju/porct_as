<TEXT><![CDATA[A randomised trial of primary tamoxifen versus mastectomy plus adjuvant tamoxifen in fit elderly women with invasive breast carcinoma of high oestrogen receptor content: long-term results at 20 years of follow-up.
BACKGROUND: Long-term analysis of a randomised trial in Nottingham comparing tamoxifen versus surgery as initial treatment demonstrated that in oestrogen receptor (ER)-unselected cases, surgery achieved better local control, with no difference in overall survival.
It was suggested that for patients with ER-rich tumours, local control and survival may be comparable.
We now present long-term follow-up of a randomised trial designed to address this clinical scenario.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and fifty three fit elderly (>/=70 years) women with clinically node-negative primary invasive breast carcinoma <5 cm of high ER content [histochemical (H) score >/=100] were randomised 2:1 to primary tamoxifen (Tam) (N = 100) or mastectomy with adjuvant tamoxifen (Mx + Tam) (N = 53).
RESULTS: With median follow-up of 78 months, there was no statistically significant difference in 10-year rates of regional recurrence (9.0% versus 7.5%), metastasis (8.0% versus 13.2%), breast cancer-specific survival (89.0% versus 86.8%) or overall survival (64.0% versus 66.0%) between Tam and Mx + Tam; however, local control was inferior with Tam (local failure rates 43.0% versus 1.9%; P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Irrespective of the degree of ER positivity, surgery achieved better local control.
However, there was excellent and similar survival in both groups.
Tam could be considered in those who are 'frail', refuse or prefer not to initially undergo surgery.]]></TEXT>
