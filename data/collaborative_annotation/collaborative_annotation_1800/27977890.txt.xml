BACKGROUND AND AIM: Colorectal endoscopic submucosal dissection (C-ESD) is recognized as a difficult procedure.
Recently, scissors-type knives were launched to reduce the difficulty of C-ESD.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combined use of a scissors-type knife and a needle-type knife with a water-jet function (WJ needle-knife) for C-ESD compared with using the WJ needle-knife alone.
METHODS: This was a prospective randomized controlled trial in a referral center.
Eighty-five patients with superficial colorectal neoplasms were enrolled and randomly assigned to undergo C-ESD using a WJ needle-knife alone (Flush group) or a scissor-type knife-supported WJ needle-knife (SB Jr group).
Procedures were conducted by two supervised residents.
Primary endpoint was self-completion rate by the residents.
RESULTS: Self-completion rate was 67% in the SB Jr group, which was significantly higher than that in the Flush group (39%, P = 0.01).
Even after exclusion of four patients in the SB Jr group in whom C-ESD was completed using the WJ needle-knife alone, the self-completion rate was significantly higher (63% vs 39%; P = 0.03).
Median procedure time among the self-completion cases did not differ significantly between the two groups (59 vs 51 min; P = 0.14).
No fatal adverse events were observed in either group.
CONCLUSIONS: In this single-center phase II trial, scissor-type knife significantly improved residents' self-completion rate for C-ESD, with no increase in procedure time or adverse events.
A multicenter trial would be warranted to confirm the validity of the present study.]]></TEXT>
