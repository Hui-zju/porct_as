<TEXT>Goserelin and bicalutamide treatments alter the expression of microRNAs in the prostate.
BACKGROUND: Although endocrine therapy has been used for decades, its influence on the expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) in clinical tissue specimens has not been analyzed.
Moreover, the effects of the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion on the expression of miRNAs in hormone naive and endocrine-treated prostate cancers are poorly understood.
METHODS: We used clinical material from a neoadjuvant trial consisting of 28 men treated with goserelin (n = 8), bicalutamide (n = 9), or no treatment (n = 11) for 3 months prior to radical prostatectomy.
Freshly frozen specimens were used for microarray analysis of 723 human miRNAs.
Specific miRNA expression in cancer, benign epithelium and stromal tissue compartments was predicted with an in silico Bayesian modeling tool.
RESULTS: The expression of 52, 44, and 34 miRNAs was affected &gt;1.4-fold by the endocrine treatment in the cancer, non-malignant epithelium, and stromal compartments, respectively.
Of the 52 miRNAs, only 10 were equally affected by the two treatment modalities in the cancer compartment.
Twenty-six of the 52 genes (50%) showed AR binding sites in their proximity in either VCaP or LNCaP cell lines.
Forty-seven miRNAs were differentially expressed in TMPRSS2:ERG fusion positive compared with fusion negative cases.
Endocrine treatment reduced the differences between fusion positive and negative cases.
CONCLUSIONS: Goserelin treatment and bicalutamide treatment mostly affected the expression of different miRNAs.
The effect clearly varied in different tissue compartments.
TMPRSS2:ERG fusion positive and negative cases showed differential expression of miRNAs, and the difference was diminished by androgen ablation.</TEXT>
