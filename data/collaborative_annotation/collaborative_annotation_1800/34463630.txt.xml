<TEXT>Usefulness of Smartphone Apps for Improving Nutritional Status of Pancreatic Cancer Patients: Randomized Controlled Trial.
BACKGROUND: Approximately 80% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients suffer from anorexia, weight loss, and asthenia.
Most PDAC patients receive chemotherapy, which often worsens their nutritional status owing to the adverse effects of chemotherapy.
Malnutrition of PDAC patients is known to be associated with poor prognosis; therefore, nutritional management during chemotherapy is a key factor influencing the outcome of the treatment.
Mobile apps have the potential to provide readily accessible nutritional support for patients with PDAC.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a mobile app-based program, Noom, in patients receiving chemotherapy for PDAC.
METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 40 patients who were newly diagnosed with unresectable PDAC from a single university-affiliated hospital in South Korea, and randomly assigned them into a Noom user group (n=20) and a non-Noom user group (n=20).
The 12-week in-app interventions included meal and physical activity logging as well as nutritional education feedback from dietitians.
The non-Noom user group did not receive any nutrition intervention.
The primary outcomes were the changes in the nutritional status and quality of life (QoL) from the baseline to 12 weeks.
The secondary outcomes included the changes in the skeletal muscle index (SMI) from the baseline to 12 weeks.
The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Core Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) and the Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA) were used as paper questionnaires to assess the QoL and nutritional status of the patients.
Intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were conducted.
Regarding the study data collection time points, we assessed the nutritional status and QoL at the baseline (T0), and at 4 (T1), 8 (T2), and 12 (T3) weeks.
Abdominal computed tomography (CT) imaging was conducted at the baseline and after 8 weeks for tumor response and SMI evaluation.
The skeletal muscle area (cm(2)) was calculated using routine CT images.
The cross-sectional areas (cm(2)) of the L3 skeletal muscles were analyzed.
RESULTS: Between February 2017 and January 2018, 48 patients were assessed for eligibility.
Totally 40 patients with pancreatic cancer were included by random allocation.
Only 17 participants in the Noom user group and 16 in the non-Noom user group completed all follow-ups.
All the study participants showed a significant improvement in the nutritional status according to the PG-SGA score regardless of Noom app usage.
Noom users showed statistically significant improvements on the global health status (GHS) and QoL scales compared to non-Noom users, based on the EORTC QLQ (P=.004).
The SMI decreased in both groups during chemotherapy (Noom users, 49.08+/-12.27 cm(2)/m(2) to 46.08+/-10.55 cm(2)/m(2); non-Noom users, 50.60+/-9.05 cm(2)/m(2) to 42.97+/-8.12 cm(2)/m(2)).
The decrement was higher in the non-Noom user group than in the Noom user group, but it was not statistically significant (-13.96% vs. -3.27%; P=.11).
CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study demonstrates that a mobile app-based approach is beneficial for nutritional and psychological support for PDAC patients receiving chemotherapy.
