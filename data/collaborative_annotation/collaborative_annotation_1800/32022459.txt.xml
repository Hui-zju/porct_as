<TEXT>First-line pembrolizumab for non-small cell lung cancer patients with PD-L1 &gt;/=50% in a multicenter real-life cohort: The PEMBREIZH study.
BACKGROUND: The KEYNOTE-024 trial demonstrated that pembrolizumab, a PD-1 inhibitor, significantly improves progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in selected patients with previously untreated advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with a PD-L1 tumor proportion score (TPS) &gt;/=50% and without EGFR/ALK aberrations.
The main aim of this study was to report the efficacy and safety profile of pembrolizumab in real-life conditions.
METHOD: This was a French retrospective multicenter longitudinal study of 108 consecutive patients with advanced NSCLC, a PD-L1 TPS &gt;/=50% and without EGFR/ALK aberrations who were treated by pembrolizumab, in first line.
Patient data were obtained from medical files.
RESULTS: The main characteristics of the cohort were: median age [range] 66.7 [37-87] years, 64.8% male, 23.1% with a performance status (PS) of 2, and 88.9% current or former smokers.
Eighty-seven percent had stage IV NSCLC at diagnosis, 9.2% untreated brain metastases at inclusion,.
With a median follow-up of 8.2 months, the median PFS was 10.1 months (95% CI, 8.8-11.4).
The objective response rate was 57.3% (complete response 2.7%, partial response 54.6%).
Disease control rate was 71.1%.
At 6 months, the OS rate estimated was 86.2%.
Treatment-related adverse events (AE) of grade 3 occurred in 8% of patients.
There were no grade 4 or 5 AEs.
CONCLUSION: In a real-life cohort of advanced NSCLC patients (including PS 2 and untreated brain metastases), with PD-L1 TPS &gt;/=50%, pembrolizumab demonstrates similar PFS to the pivotal clinical trial.</TEXT>
