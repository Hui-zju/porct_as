<TEXT>Long-term outcome of a phase 2 trial with nilotinib 400 mg twice daily in first-line treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia.
Nilotinib is a second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has been approved for the first-line treatment of chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia, based on the results of a prospective randomized study of nilotinib versus imatinib (ENESTnd).
Apart from this registration study, very few data are currently available on first-line nilotinib treatment.
We report here the long-term, 6-year results of the first investigator-sponsored, GIMEMA multicenter phase 2, single-arm trial with nilotinib 400 mg twice daily as first-line treatment in 73 patients with chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia.
Six-year overall survival and progression-free survival rates were 96%, with one death after progression to blast phase.
At 6 years, 75% of the patients were still on nilotinib.
The cumulative incidence of major molecular response was 98%; only one patient had a confirmed loss of major molecular response.
The cumulative incidence of deep molecular response (MR 4.0) was 76%.
Deep molecular response was stable (&gt;/= 2 years) in 34% of these patients.
Cardiovascular adverse events, mainly due to arterial thrombosis, occurred in 11/73 patients (15%), after 24 to 76 months of therapy.
They were more frequent in elderly patients, and in those with baseline cardiovascular risk factors.
None was fatal, although there was a relevant morbidity.
This is the study with the longest follow-up of a high dose of nilotinib (400 mg twice daily): it highlights the high efficacy and the cardiovascular toxicity of the drug (CTG.NCT.00481052).</TEXT>
