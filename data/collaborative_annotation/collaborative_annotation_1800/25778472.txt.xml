<TEXT>Comparison of volumetric and linear serial CT assessments of lung metastases in renal cell carcinoma patients in a clinical phase IIB study.
RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Accuracy of radiologic assessment may have a crucial impact on clinical studies and therapeutic decisions.
We compared the variability of a central radiologic assessment (RECIST) and computer-aided volume-based assessment of lung lesions in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The investigation was prospectively planned as a substudy of a clinical randomized phase IIB therapeutic trial in patients with RCC.
Starting with the manual study diameter (SDM) of the central readers using RECIST in the clinical study, we performed computer-aided volume measurements.
We compared SDM to an automated RECIST diameter (aRDM) and the diameter of a volume-equivalent sphere (effective diameter [EDM]), both for the individual size measurements and for the change rate (CR) between consecutive time points.
One hundred thirty diameter pairs of 30 lung lesions from 14 patients were evaluable, forming 55 change pairs over two consecutive time points each.
RESULTS: The SDMs of two different readers showed a correlation of 95.6%, whereas the EDMs exhibited an excellent correlation of 99.4%.
Evaluation of CRs showed an SDM-CR correlation of 63.9%, which is substantially weaker than the EDM-CR correlation of 87.6%.
The variability of SDM-CR is characterized by a median absolute difference of 11.4% points versus the significantly lower 1.8% points EDM-CRs variability (aRDM: 3.2% points).
The limits of agreement between readers suggest that an EDM change of 10% or 1 mm can already be significant.
CONCLUSIONS: Computer-aided volume-based assessments result in markedly reduced variability of parameters describing size and change, which may offer an advantage of earlier response evaluations and treatment decisions for patients.</TEXT>
