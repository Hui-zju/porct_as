<TEXT>[A group intervention to promote work ability in patients with head and neck cancer].
INTRODUCTION: Despite high distress the majority of head and neck cancer patients does not use any psycho-oncological counselling or psychotherapeutic support.
Additionally, patients with head and neck cancer have an increased risk of not returning to work compared to other cancer patients.
Therefore, we have developed a group intervention program which aims at improving work ability in patients with head and neck cancer as well as their quality of life, self-efficacy and psychological well-being.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a randomized controlled trial head and neck cancer patients either receive a group intervention or socio-legal counselling.
Male head and neck cancer patients with elevated levels of psychological and work-related distress are included.
The group intervention consists of eight sessions.
Groups are led by both a psychotherapist and a former head and neck cancer patient (peer).
Feasibility and acceptability of the group intervention were tested by means of a pilot group.
Each session was evaluated by pilot group participants.
Semi-structured interviews were used to assess relevance of content and practicability.
RESULTS: 113 patients were personally addressed, of which four patients participated in the pilot group.
Patients reported that the intervention fit very well with their daily life and expressed satisfaction with it.
Three patients emphasized the importance of the peer.
DISCUSSION: The presence of the peer as identification figure seems to be of crucial importance.
To increase recruitment numbers inclusion criteria will be modified and participation costs will be reduced.</TEXT>
