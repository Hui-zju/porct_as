<TEXT>Breaking bad news to patients with cancer: A randomized control trial of a brief communication skills training module incorporating the stories and preferences of actual patients.
OBJECTIVE: This study tested the effectiveness of a brief, learner-centered, breaking bad news (BBN) communication skills training module using objective evaluation measures.
METHODS: This randomized control study (N=66) compared intervention and control groups of students (n=28) and residents' (n=38) objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) performance of communication skills using Common Ground Assessment and Breaking Bad News measures.
RESULTS: Follow-up performance scores of intervention group students improved significantly regarding BBN (colon cancer (CC), p=0.007, r=-0.47; breast cancer (BC), p=0.003, r=-0.53), attention to patient responses after BBN (CC, p&lt;0.001, r=-0.74; BC, p=0.001, r=-0.65), and addressing feelings (BC, p=0.006, r=-0.48).
At CC follow-up assessment, performance scores of intervention group residents improved significantly regarding BBN (p=0.004, r=-0.43), communication related to emotions (p=0.034, r=-0.30), determining patient's readiness to proceed after BBN and communication preferences (p=0.041, r=-0.28), active listening (p=0.011, r=-0.37), addressing feelings (p&lt;0.001, r=-0.65), and global interview performance (p=0.001, r=-0.51).
CONCLUSION: This brief BBN training module is an effective method of improving BBN communication skills among medical students and residents.
PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Implementation of this brief individualized training module within health education programs could lead to improved communication skills and patient care.</TEXT>
