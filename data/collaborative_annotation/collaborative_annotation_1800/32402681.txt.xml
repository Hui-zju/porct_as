<TEXT><![CDATA[A Randomized Phase II Study of Perioperative Chemotherapy Plus Bevacizumab Versus Postoperative Chemotherapy Plus Bevacizumab in Patients With Upfront Resectable Hepatic Colorectal Metastases.
INTRODUCTION: Whether patients with resectable colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) gain a survival benefit from perioperative chemotherapy remains controversial.
The benefit of including bevacizumab in chemotherapy also remains unclear.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Seventy-six patients with CRLM were randomly assigned to either 6 cycles of FOLFOX (folinic acid, 5-fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin)/FOLFIRI (folinic acid, 5-fluorouracil, and irinotecan) with bevacizumab before and after surgery or 12 cycles after surgery.
Progression-free survival (PFS) was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by the log-rank test.
RESULTS: The median PFS of all patients was 37.4 months at 5.4 years follow-up, and the median overall survival (OS) was not reached.
The PFS between the perioperative group and the postoperative group did not reveal a statistical difference (P = .280).
The OS was significantly better in the perioperative group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.60; 95% confidence interval [CI],) 0.35-1.02; P = .049).
In subgroup patients with carcinoembryonic antigens (CEA) >/= 5 ng/mL or those with over 2 liver metastases, perioperative group had longer OS than postoperative group (CEA: HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.25-0.93; P = .030; number of liver metastases: HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.30-0.99; P = .049).
The largest liver metastases size, disease-free interval, and sidedness did not affect PFS or OS.
There was no difference between the 2 groups in postoperative complications with bevacizumab or adverse events during chemotherapy.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with resectable CRLMs, perioperative chemotherapy had no effect on PFS, but improved OS.
Patients with high CEA levels or over 2 liver metastases may benefit from perioperative chemotherapy.]]></TEXT>
