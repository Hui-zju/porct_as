<TEXT>Comparison of two contraceptive pills containing drospirenone and 20 mug or 30 mug ethinyl estradiol for polycystic ovary syndrome.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of 30 mug and 20 mug ethinyl estradiol (EE) among women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).
METHODS: In a randomized study, patients with PCOS, a history of six or fewer menstrual cycles in the previous 12 months, and abnormal body hair growth were enrolled at a center in Kolkata, India, between May 1, 2012, and January 31, 2014.
Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) using a computer-generated randomization table to receive an oral contraceptive pill containing 3mg drospirenone and either 30 mug EE or 20 mug EE.
Patients were followed up after 6 and 12 months.
The primary outcome was the absolute change in the free androgen index.
Participants were masked to group assignment but investigators were not.
Analyses were by intention to treat.
RESULTS: Overall, 112 patients were enrolled.
At 6 months, the free androgen index had decreased by 4.96+/-6.01 among patients receiving 30 mug (n=55) and by 4.81+/-6.03 among those receiving 20 mug (n=57; P=0.89).
At 12 months, the decrease from baseline was 5.23+/-5.79 with 30 mug and 4.99+/-5.86 with 20 mug (P=0.82).
CONCLUSION: Among patients with PCOS, an oral contraceptive pill containing 20 mug EE has similar effects on androgen levels to those of a pill containing 30 mug.
