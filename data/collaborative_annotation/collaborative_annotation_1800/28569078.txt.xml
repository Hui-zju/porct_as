<TEXT>Palonosetron compared with ondansetron in pediatric cancer patients: multicycle analysis of a randomized Phase III study.
AIM: To investigate across multiple cycles the efficacy and safety of palonosetron in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in pediatric cancer patients receiving highly or moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC/MEC).
PATIENTS &amp; METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to 10, 20 mug/kg palonosetron or 3 x 150 mug/kg ondansetron for up to four cycles of HEC/MEC.
RESULTS: In all on-study chemotherapy cycles, complete response rates were higher in patients in the 20 mug/kg palonosetron group than the ondansetron group.
Treatment-emergent adverse events were comparable between the palonosetron 20 mug/kg and ondansetron groups.
CONCLUSION: Over four cycles of HEC/MEC, 20 mug/kg palonosetron was an efficacious and safe treatment for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in pediatric cancer patients.</TEXT>
