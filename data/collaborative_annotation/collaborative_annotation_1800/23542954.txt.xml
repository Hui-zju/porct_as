<TEXT>Randomized controlled trial of a clinic-based survivorship intervention following adjuvant therapy in breast cancer survivors.
In 2006, the IOM released a report citing the importance of "survivorship plans" to improve quality of life and care coordination for cancer survivors, but little has been done to evaluate their efficacy.
Women with early-stage breast cancer were randomized within 6 weeks of completing adjuvant therapy to a survivorship intervention group (SI) or control group (CG).
All subjects were given the NCI publication, "Facing Forward: Life after Cancer Treatment." The SI also met with a nurse/nutritionist to receive a treatment summary, surveillance, and lifestyle recommendations.
Both groups completed questionnaires on the impact of cancer (IOC), patient satisfaction (FACIT-TS-PS), and assessment of survivor concerns (ASC) at baseline, 3 and 6 months.
Within and between group t tests and linear regression analyses were performed.
Among 126 women (60 CG, 66 SI), mean age was 54 years, 48 % were Hispanic, and the groups were well-balanced by baseline characteristics.
No significant differences between the CG and SI on the FACIT-TS-PS or IOC at 3 and 6 months were seen.
The ASC health worry subscale was lower (less worry) in the SI compared to CG (p = 0.02).
At all time-points, Hispanic women had higher (worse) health worry (p = 0.0008), social-life interference (p = 0.009), and meaning of cancer scales (p = 0.0004), and more trust in medical professionals (p = 0.03) compared to non-Hispanic women.
While the SI did not lead to significant improvements in most patient-reported outcomes, it was associated with decreased health worry.
Future interventions should determine the most efficient and effective method for delivering survivorship care plans.</TEXT>
