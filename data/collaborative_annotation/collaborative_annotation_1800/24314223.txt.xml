OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and side effects of induction chemotherapy with vinorelbine plus cisplatin (NP) or docetaxel plus cisplatin (TP) combined with concurrent chemoradiotherapy in treating locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).
METHODS: From January 2005 to December 2009, 146 patients with locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma treated in our department were randomized into NP group (76 patients) or TP group (70 patients).
Both groups received two cycles of induction chemotherapy and concurrent chemoradiotherapy.
After three weeks of induction chemotherapy, the patients received concurrent chemoradiotherapy.
The chemotherapy was recycled every three weeks.
Two groups were treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy.
RESULTS: The short-term efficacy of NP group was similar to that of TP group.
The 3-year overall survival rates, disease-free-survival rates, locoregional relapse-free survival rates and distant metastasis-free survival rates in the NP and TP groups were 84.2% and 82.9%, 71.1% and 74.3%, 89.5% and 91.4%, 81.6% and 77.1%, respectively (P > 0.05).
The occurrence rates of leucopenia, anemia and acute mucositis were significantly higher in the TP group than those in the NP group (P < 0.05).
The gastrointestinal toxicity, dermatitis and liver toxicity were similar in the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of NP regimen induction chemotherapy plus concurrent chemordiotherapy for advanced NPC is similar to that of TP regimen.
The toxicity of the NP regimen is lower than that of NP regimen, tolerable, and with a good compliance.]]></TEXT>
