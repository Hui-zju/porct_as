<TEXT>Evaluation of ipilimumab in combination with allogeneic pancreatic tumor cells transfected with a GM-CSF gene in previously treated pancreatic cancer.
Preclinical reports support the concept of synergy between cancer vaccines and immune checkpoint blockade in nonimmunogenic tumors.
In particular, cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) antibodies have been successfully combined with GM-CSF cell-based vaccines (GVAX).
Ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4) has been tested as a single agent in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) resulting in a delayed response at a dose of 3 mg/kg.
Our study evaluated ipilimumab 10 mg/kg (arm 1) and ipilimumab 10 mg/kg + GVAX (arm 2).
A total of 30 patients with previously treated advanced PDA were randomized (1:1).
Induction doses were administered every 3 weeks for a total of 4 doses followed by maintenance dosing every 12 weeks.
Two patients in arm 1 showed evidence of stable disease (7 and 22 wk) but none demonstrated CA19-9 biochemical responses.
In contrast, 3 patients in arm 2 had evidence of prolonged disease stabilization (31, 71, and 81 wk) and 7 patients experienced CA19-9 declines.
In 2 of these patients, disease stabilization occurred after an initial period of progression.
The median overall survival (OS) (3.6 vs. 5.7 mo, hazards ratio: 0.51, P = 0.072) and 1 year OS (7 vs. 27%) favored arm 2.
Similar to prior ipilimumab studies, 20% of patients in each arm had grade 3/4 immune-related adverse events.
Among patients with OS &gt; 4.3 months, there was an increase in the peak mesothelin-specific T cells (P = 0.014) and enhancement of the T-cell repertoire (P = 0.031).
In conclusion, checkpoint blockade in combination with GVAX has the potential for clinical benefit and should be evaluated in a larger study.</TEXT>
