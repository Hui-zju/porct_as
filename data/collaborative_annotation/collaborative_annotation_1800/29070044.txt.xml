BACKGROUND: The response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) varies by estrogen receptor (ER) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) statuses, with responses being lower in ER-positive, HER2-negative tumors as compared with ER-negative, HER2-positive or triple-negative tumors.
Neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (NET) is an attractive alternative to NAC for ER-positive, HER2-negative cancer.
However, a prior trial comparing NET with standard NAC in ER-positive tumor showed that the difference of response was not significant.
Studies demonstrated that the mTOR inhibitor everolimus could sensitize breast tumors to endocrine therapy.
A pilot open-label, randomized trial has been designed to evaluate the feasibility, efficacy and tolerability of neoadjuvant everolimus plus letrozole versus NAC in treating postmenopausal women with ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer.
METHODS: Forty postmenopausal women with non-metastatic ER-positive, HER2-negative invasive breast cancer with a primary tumor > 2 cm or positive axillary lymph node(s) proved by biopsy will be randomly (1:1) enrolled from Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital to receive neoadjuvant everolimus plus letrozole for 18 weeks or fluorouracil, epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide (FEC) for six cycles before surgery.
Primary outcome is the feasibility of the trial.
Secondary outcome measures include ultrasound response rate, pathological complete response rate, breast-conserving surgery rate, toxicities, and changes in the percentages of peripheral blood CD4(+) T cells, CD8(+) T cells, T helper cells, regulatory T cells, and NK cells.
DISCUSSION: This is the first study to determine the feasibility, efficacy and tolerability of head-to-head neoadjuvant everolimus plus letrozole versus neoadjuvant FEC in treating postmenopausal women with ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer.
The trial will provide evidence to assess the feasibility of a future multicenter, randomized controlled trial, and will provide valuable clinical data of the immunoregulatory effect of everolimus in breast cancer.
