<TEXT>Safety and efficacy of a mucoadhesive phytomedication containing curcuminoids and Bidens pilosa L. extract in the prevention and treatment of radiochemotherapy-induced oral mucositis: Triple-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trial.
BACKGROUND: Oral mucositis (OM) is the significant complication of radio/chemotherapy treatment.
This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of a mucoadhesive phytomedication containing curcuminoids and Bidens pilosa L. (FITOPROT) in the prevention/treatment of OM.
METHODS: Sixty-two patients were randomized into the group's intervention and placebo.
Adverse effect assessment, OM grading, pain, and saliva collection were carried at the 1st, 15th, 21st, and final of radiotherapy (RT).
Inflammatory salivary mediators were measured.
RESULTS: FITOPROT decreased the severity of OM from the 15th to the final RT, while the placebo showed an increase in the severity (p &lt; 0.05).
Intervention group had a lower number of patients with ulcerated OM at the final RT (p &lt; 0.05).
Phytomedication prevented increases of IL-8 levels and reduced the salivary nitrite during RT.
CONCLUSIONS: FITOPROT does not promote adverse effects, it appears to be effective at reducing the severity of OM, and it controls the concentration of pro-inflammatory mediators.</TEXT>
