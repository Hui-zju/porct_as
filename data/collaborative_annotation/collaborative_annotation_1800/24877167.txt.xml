<TEXT>Multi-institutional, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the efficacy of a mucoadhesive hydrogel (MuGard) in mitigating oral mucositis symptoms in patients being treated with chemoradiation therapy for cancers of the head and neck.
BACKGROUND: The objective of this trial was to determine how a mucoadhesive hydrogel (MuGard), a marketed medical device, would fare when tested with the strictness of a conventional multi-institutional, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study format.
METHODS: A total of 120 subjects planned to receive chemoradiation therapy (CRT) for treatment of head and neck cancers were randomized to receive either MuGard or sham control rinse (SC) during CRT.
Subjects completed the validated Oral Mucositis Daily Questionnaire.
Weight, opiate use, and World Health Organization (WHO) oral mucositis (OM) scores were recorded.
Subjects who dosed at least once daily during the first 2.5 weeks of CRT were included in the efficacy analysis.
RESULTS: Of 120 subjects enrolled, 78 (SC, N=41; MuGard, N=37) were eligible for efficacy analysis.
Both cohorts were similar in demographics, baseline characteristics, primary tumor type, and planned CRT regimen.
MuGard effectively mitigated OM symptoms as reflected by area under the curve of daily patient-reported oral soreness (P=.034) and WHO scores on the last day of radiation therapy (P=.038).
MuGard was also associated with nonsignificant trends related to therapeutic benefit including opioid use duration, and OM scores (WHO criteria) at CRT week 4.
Rinse compliance was identical between cohorts.
No significant adverse events were reported, and the adverse event incidence was similar between cohorts.
CONCLUSIONS: Testing MuGard, a rinse marketed as a device, in a standard clinical trial format demonstrated its superiority to SC in mitigating OM symptoms, delaying OM progression, and its safety and tolerability.</TEXT>
