BACKGROUND: This randomized phase II study investigated first-line chemotherapy plus cetuximab administered every second week in KRAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients received FOLFOX4 plus either standard weekly cetuximab (arm 1) or cetuximab (500 mg/m(2)) every second week (arm 2), until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
Primary end point was the objective response rate (ORR).
Progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), disease control rate (DCR) and safety were also investigated.
The study was not powered to establish non-inferiority, but aimed at the estimation of treatment differences.
RESULTS: Of 152 randomized eligible patients, 75 were treated in arm 1 and 77 in arm 2; ORRs [53% versus 62%, odds ratio 1.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74-2.66], PFS [median 9.5 versus 9.2 months, hazard ratio (HR) 0.92, 95% CI 0.63-1.34], OS (median 25.8 versus 23.0 months, HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.56-1.30) and DCR (87%) were comparable.
HRs adjusted for baseline factors were 1.01 and 0.99 for PFS and OS, respectively.
Frequencies of grade 3/4 adverse events in arms 1 versus 2 were similar: most common were neutropenia (28% versus 34%) and rash (15% versus 17%).
CONCLUSIONS: Activity and safety of FOLFOX4 plus either cetuximab administered weekly or every second week were similar.]]></TEXT>
