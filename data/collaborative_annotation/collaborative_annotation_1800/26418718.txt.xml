<TEXT>Phospho-kinase profile of colorectal tumors guides in the selection of multi-kinase inhibitors.
Protein kinases play a central role in the oncogenesis of colorectal tumors and are attractive druggable targets.
Detection of activated kinases within a tumor could open avenues for drug selection and optimization of new kinase inhibitors.
By using a phosphokinase arrays with human colorectal tumors we identified activated kinases, including the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), components of the PI3K/mTOR pathway (AKT and S6), and STAT, among others.
A pharmacological screening with kinase inhibitors against these proteins helped us to identify a new kinase inhibitor, termed EC-70124 that showed the highest anti-proliferative activity in cell lines.
EC-70124 also inhibited cell migration and biochemical experiments demonstrated its effect targeting the PI3K/mTOR pathway.
This drug also arrested cells at G2/M and induced apoptosis.
Experiments in combination with standard chemotherapy used in the clinical setting indicated a synergistic effect.
EC-70124 also reduced tumor growth in vivo and inhibited pS6 in the implanted tumors.
In conclusion, by studying the kinase profile of colorectal tumors, we identified relevant activated pathways, and a new multi-kinase compound with significant antitumor properties.</TEXT>
