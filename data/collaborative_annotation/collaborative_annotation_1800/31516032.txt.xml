<TEXT>Glasdegib plus intensive/nonintensive chemotherapy in untreated acute myeloid leukemia: BRIGHT AML 1019 Phase III trials.
Glasdegib, an oral Hedgehog pathway inhibitor, has been associated with significantly improved survival when combined with low-dose cytarabine in patients with untreated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who were unsuitable for intensive chemotherapy, when compared with low-dose cytarabine alone.
BRIGHT AML 1019 (NCT03416179) comprises two independently powered Phase III, randomized (1:1), double-blind global trials evaluating oral glasdegib 100 mg once daily or placebo plus one of two standard chemotherapy regimens in adults with untreated AML.
The intensive trial combines glasdegib/placebo with cytarabine and daunorubicin (7 + 3), while the nonintensive trial combines glasdegib/placebo with azacitidine.
The primary end point of both studies is overall survival.
Secondary end points include response, time to and duration of response, event-free survival, safety, patient-reported outcomes and pharmacokinetics.
Trial registration number: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03416179.</TEXT>
