PURPOSE: In PALOMA-2, palbociclib plus letrozole significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) as initial treatment of estrogen receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative advanced breast cancer.
We assessed the benefit of palbociclib plus letrozole in Asians.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Of 666 enrolled postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative advanced breast cancer (no prior treatment of advanced disease), 95 were Asian.
Patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive palbociclib plus letrozole or placebo plus letrozole.
The primary end point was investigator-assessed PFS.
Secondary end points were overall survival, objective response, patient-reported outcomes, pharmacokinetics, and safety.
RESULTS: Median PFS was significantly longer in Asian patients who received palbociclib plus letrozole versus placebo plus letrozole (25.7 months [95% CI, 19.2 months to not estimable] v 13.9 months [95% CI, 7.4 to 22.0 months]; hazard ratio, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.87; P = .007).
The most common toxicities with palbociclib were hematologic and more frequent among Asians versus non-Asians: neutropenia (any grade, 95.4% v 76.8%; grade 3/4, 89.2% v 62.5%), leukopenia (43.1% v 38.3%; 32.3% v 23.5%), and thrombocytopenia (27.7% v 13.5%; 4.6% v 1.1%).
No Asians had febrile neutropenia.
Discontinuation rates as a result of adverse events were similar among Asian and non-Asian patients who received palbociclib plus letrozole (10.8% and 9.5%).
In Asians, quality of life (QOL) was maintained with no significant differences observed between treatments from baseline in breast cancer-specific QOL and general health status scores.
Change from baseline in EuroQol five dimensions index scores was significantly higher with palbociclib plus letrozole (0.013 v -0.069; P = .0132).
Geometric mean palbociclib trough concentration values were higher in Asians versus non-Asians (93.8 v 61.7 ng/mL).
CONCLUSION: Consistent with the overall study population, the addition of palbociclib to letrozole significantly improved PFS in Asians.
Hematologic toxicities were more frequent in Asians versus non-Asians but manageable with early dose modifications while maintaining QOL.]]></TEXT>
