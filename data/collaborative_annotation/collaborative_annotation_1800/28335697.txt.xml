<TEXT>Investigation of a Lifestyle Intervention in Women at High Risk of Breast Cancer.
One fourth of breast cancer can be attributed to sedentary lifestyles and being overweight or obese.
This pilot study was conducted to explore whether a 6-month lifestyle intervention affected body composition and obesity-related biomarkers among women at high risk of breast cancer.
Overweight/obese women at high risk of breast cancer were randomized to the control group or to the intervention.
The intervention was an individually tailored, cognitive-behavioral therapy program that assists women in identifying strategies to improve their nutrition and physical activity habits with the goal of reduced adiposity.
We compared changes in body composition and plasma biomarkers from baseline to 6 months.
Body weight, adiposity, leptin, insulin resistance, and C-reactive protein were significantly reduced in the intervention group versus controls.
No significant differences were observed in adiponectin, insulin, glucose, or interleukin-6.
Our findings suggest that this intervention improves the metabolic and inflammatory profiles of overweight/obese women at risk of breast cancer.</TEXT>
