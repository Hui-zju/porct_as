<TEXT>Efficacy and safety of Yiqi Huoxue Jiedu decoction for the treatment of advanced epithelial ovarian cancer patients: a double-blind randomized controlled clinical trial.
OBJECTIVE: To further evaluate the complementary effect of Yiqi Huoxue Jiedu decoction (YHJD) on patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC).
METHODS: All 330 enrolled participants diagnosed with stage c EOC were randomly divided into two groups that received YHJD or a placebo.
The primary end point was health-related quality of life (HRQL) measured by the functional assessment of cancer therapy-ovary cancer (FACT-O) questionnaire.
The secondary end point was progression-free survival (PFS).
RESULTS: A total of 299 participants completed the trial with 153 and 146 in YHJD and control groups, respectively.
After 6 months of treatment, YHJD increased physical wellbeing (PWB), functional wellbeing (FWB), additional concerns (AC), and the trial outcome index (TOI) (P &lt; 0.05) by various degrees compared with the baseline.
YHJD also had notable advantages over the placebo at 3 and 6 months in terms of PWB, FWB, AC (P &lt; 0.05), and TOI (P &lt; 0.01).
In addition, YHJD had a significant advantage in terms of PFS compared with the placebo (21 vs 18 months, P &lt; 0.05).
No adverse events were reported.
CONCLUSION: YHJD is an effective and safe choice as a complementary therapy to improve HRQL and prolong PFS of stage c EOC patients.</TEXT>
