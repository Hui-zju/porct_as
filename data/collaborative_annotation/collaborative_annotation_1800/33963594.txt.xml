<TEXT>Neurotoxicity prevention with a multimodal program (ATENTO) prior to cancer treatment versus throughout cancer treatment in women newly diagnosed for breast cancer: Protocol for a randomized clinical trial.
A current challenge in breast cancer (BC) patients is how to reduce the side effects of cancer and cancer treatments and prevent a decrease in quality of life (QoL).
Neurotoxic side effects, especially from chemotherapy, are present in up to 75% of women with BC, which implies a large impact on QoL. There is a special interest in the preventive possibilities of therapeutic exercise (TE) for these neurological sequelae, and the benefits of TE could be improved when it is combined with vagal activation techniques (VATs).
This superiority randomized controlled trial aims to examine the feasibility and efficacy of an 8-week multimodal intervention (ATENTO) based on moderate-vigorous intensity and individualized TE (aerobic and strength exercises) and VAT (myofascial and breathing exercises), on neurotoxicity prevention in women with BC before starting adjuvant chemotherapy (ATENTO-B) versus throughout adjuvant chemotherapy (ATENTO-T).
A sample of 56 women newly diagnosed with BC, as calculated with a power of 85%, will be randomly allocated into these two groups.
This study could provide an impetus for the introduction of early multimodal intervention methods to prevent neurotoxicity and consequently avoid the QoL deterioration that BC patients presently suffer throughout their treatments.</TEXT>
