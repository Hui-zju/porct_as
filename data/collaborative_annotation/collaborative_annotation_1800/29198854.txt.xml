<TEXT>Efficacy and safety of transversus abdominis plane blocks versus thoracic epidural anesthesia in patients undergoing major abdominal oncologic resections: A prospective, randomized controlled trial.
BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to compare patient outcomes for thoracic epidural anesthesia (TEA) with transversus abdominis plane (TAP) blocks.
METHODS: A prospective, randomized trial was performed for patients undergoing abdominal oncologic surgeries.
RESULTS: There were 32 TAP and 35 TEA subjects.
The TEA group demonstrated increased episodes of hypotension in the first 24 h (3 v 0.6, p = 0.02).
There was no difference in 24-48 h fluid balance between the groups.
Overall parenteral morphine equivalents of opioids administered for the TEA group were higher for each postoperative day (p &lt; 0.05).
The post-operative survey did not demonstrate any difference in subjective pain between the TAP and TEA groups (6 v 6 p = 0.35).
There was no attributable morbidity associated with either technique.
CONCLUSIONS: TAP block use was associated with lower parenteral morphine equivalent usage and decreased incidence of hypotension in the early post-operative period compared to TEA.</TEXT>
