<TEXT>Bevacizumab in Combination With Either FOLFOX-4 or XELOX-2 in First-line Treatment of Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer: A Multicenter Randomized Phase II Trial of the Gruppo Oncologico dell'Italia Meridionale (GOIM 2802).
INTRODUCTION: Biweekly schedule of XELOX-2 (capecitabine plus oxaliplatin) showed interesting results in first-line therapy of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).
Bevacizumab plus FOLFOX-4 (oxaliplatin, folinic acid, and infusional 5-fluorouracil) is among standard first-line treatment options in this setting.
We performed a phase II randomized trial in order to evaluate the activity of bevacizumab plus either FOLFOX-4 or XELOX-2 in first-line therapy of patients with mCRC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with mCRC were randomized, in a 1:2 ratio, to first-line bevacizumab plus either FOLFOX-4 (Arm A), as calibration arm, or XELOX-2 (Arm B), up to 12 cycles.
Patients without progression were further randomized to maintenance bevacizumab alone or with the same induction fluoropyrimidine.
The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR); secondary endpoints included progression-free survival, overall survival, and toxicity.
The study design was formally non-comparative, but exploratory comparison was performed.
RESULTS: Forty-five patients were randomized in arm A and 87 in arm B with an ORR of 55.6% versus 48.3% (P = .43), respectively.
After a median follow-up of 47.2 months, progression-free survival was 10.0 versus 9.9 months (hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval, 0.65-1.41; P = .84) and overall survival was 29.8 versus 25.0 months (hazard ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 0.77-1.92; P = .41), respectively.
The main grade 3 to 4 toxicities (% A/B) were: neutropenia 15/3 and nausea 9/5.
CONCLUSION: This exploratory analysis showed that biweekly XELOX-2 plus bevacizumab has a comparable ORR with FOLFOX-4 plus bevacizumab in patients with mCRC.</TEXT>
