<TEXT>Epiluminescence microscopy (dermoscopy) versus visual inspection during Mohs microscopic surgery of infiltrative basal cell carcinoma.
BACKGROUND: The initial stage of Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) is usually outlined using visual inspection.
Newer noninvasive models are available to the Mohs surgeon to determine initial margins before MMS.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the final number of MMS stages performed using dermoscopy and visual inspection of infiltrative basal cell carcinoma (BCC).
METHODS: Forty patients were randomized to two groups (dermoscopy, visual inspection) before MMS for infiltrative BCC.
The final number of stages performed was recorded for each group.
RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in the final number of stages when using dermoscopy and visual inspection.
LIMITATIONS: Small sample sizes, comparison of different regions on the head and neck, and a single Mohs surgeon were the limiting factors in this study.
CONCLUSIONS: There was no difference in the final number of stages between dermoscopy and visual inspection to determine the margins of previously biopsied infiltrative BCC.</TEXT>
