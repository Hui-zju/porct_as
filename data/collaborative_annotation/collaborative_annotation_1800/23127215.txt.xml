<TEXT>Associations of soluble fiber, whole fruits/vegetables, and juice with plasma Beta-carotene concentrations in a free-living population of breast cancer survivors.
OBJECTIVE: Soluble fiber and the physical state of fruits/vegetables affect plasma ss-carotene concentrations; however, most of this research was conducted in laboratory-based settings.
These analyses investigated the relationship between soluble fiber and juiced versus whole fruits/vegetables to plasma ss-carotene concentrations in a free-living population.
METHOD: This cross-sectional analysis used 12-month follow-up data from the Women's Healthy Eating &amp; Living Study (1995-2006), a study to improve diet in breast cancer survivors in the Western United States.
The dietary nutrients considered in this analysis included intake of soluble fiber (g), ss-carotene from fruit/vegetable juice (mg), and ss-carotene from whole fruits/vegetables (mg).
A linear regression model was used to assess the relationship of the variables to plasma ss-carotene concentrations.
RESULTS: Out of 3,088 women enrolled in the Women's Healthy Eating &amp; Living Study, 2,397 women had complete data (mean age = 54).
The final model accounted for approximately 49% of the explained variance in plasma ss-carotene concentrations.
Fruit/vegetable juice had the largest positive relation to plasma ss-carotene concentrations (standardized parameter estimate = 0.23, p &lt; 0.01), followed by whole fruits/vegetables (standardized parameter estimate = 0.09, p &lt; 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Soluble fiber may inhibit ss-carotene absorption; therefore, consumption of juice may increase plasma ss-carotene concentrations more than whole fruits/vegetables in free-living populations.</TEXT>
