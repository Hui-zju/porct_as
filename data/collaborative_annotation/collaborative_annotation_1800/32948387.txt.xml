<TEXT>Double-Needle Lavage for Effective Treatment of Difficult-Aspiration Thyroid Cystic Nodules: A Single-Center Controlled Trial.
PURPOSE: To explore the safety and efficacy of double-needle lavage (DNL) in the treatment of difficult aspiration thyroid cystic nodules.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This single-center, prospective, randomized controlled trial was conducted using 100 thyroid cysts from 100 patients who were treated in our hospital from January 2018 to August 2019.
These patients were placed into 2 groups; group A including 40 patients treated with single-needle aspiration (SNA), and group B including 60 patients treated with DNL.
The safety and efficacy of these 2 aspiration methods were compared.
RESULTS: Ten patients in group A that did not benefit from SNA were transferred to group B. No complication occurred in either group.
Notably, DNL showed significantly higher efficacy than SNA.
This was evidenced by the higher extraction rate of materials in the capsule (A vs B, 91 +/- 6.51% vs 98.45 +/- 1.74%, P &lt; .001) and overall nodule volume reduction rate in group B (A vs B, 87.54 +/- 7.84% vs 95.62 +/- 3.66%, P &lt; .001).
In group B, patients who received DNL treatment with 2 needles pointed at the upper and lower extremes of the cystic nodules (B2) exhibited significantly better aspiration effects compared to patients in which the 2 needles were pointed at the same ultrasound plane (B1) (P &lt; .05), especially for patients with maximum diameter of nodules &gt;/=3 cm (P &lt; .01).
CONCLUSIONS: DNL treatment could efficiently and safely replace cystic material from thyroid gland.
Moreover, our results indicate that DNL treatment in which 2 needles are pointed at the 2 extremes of cystic nodules yields higher efficacy in patients with maximum diameter of nodules &gt;/=3 cm.</TEXT>
