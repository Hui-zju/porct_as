<TEXT>Therapeutic touch for nausea in breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy: Composing a treatment.
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Therapeutic touch (TT) is independent nursing intervention which is effective on nausea induced by chemotherapy but technique, steps and variables affected by this therapy are not yet well known.
The aim of this study was to elicit descriptions of how TT is used with cancer patients, providing a basis for the systematic use and evaluation of TT with patients.
MATERIALS AND METHOD: In this research, 108 patients were examined with intentional sampling and random allocation in 3 groups (control, placebo and intervention) in 2013 (each group 36).
Intervention received therapeutic touch (touching of first energy layer) and demographic form, visual analog scale (VAS) for intensity of nausea, check list for duration and times of nausea in the morning, noon, afternoon and night at acute phase were used.
Data were analyzed by Kruskal Wallis, chi(2) and analysis of variance (ANOVA).
RESULTS: Duration, frequency and intensity of nausea were significantly lower in the test group (P &lt; 0.001, P &lt; 0.001 and P &lt; 0.001).
The mean duration of intervention (whole process) was 21.38 min [SD 6.04].
In 69.4% of women there was a need for re-intervention after reassessment phase.
CONCLUSION: Results of this randomized control trial showed that TT is effective on duration, times and intensity of nausea; therefore, TT can be used as an alternative method for patients who are willing to use this technique.</TEXT>
