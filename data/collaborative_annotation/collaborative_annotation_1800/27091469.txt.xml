<TEXT>Voice Range Profile and Health-related Quality of Life Measurements Following Voice Rehabilitation After Radiotherapy; a Randomized Controlled Study.
PURPOSE: The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of voice rehabilitation in patients treated with radiotherapy for laryngeal cancer.
METHOD: A total of 42 patients with laryngeal cancer who are treated with radiotherapy with curative intent participated in a randomized controlled study.
The collected data were voice range profiles (VPRs) and patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments for measurement of self-perceived communication function (Swedish Self-Evaluation for Communication Experiences after Laryngeal cancer (S-SECEL)) and health related quality of life (HRQL) (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30/Head and Neck module).
Data were collected 1 month (pre voice rehabilitation), 6 months, and 12 months postradiotherapy.
Of the patients, 19 received voice rehabilitation, whereas 23 constituted a control group.
RESULTS: There were several statistically significant improvements in the study group concerning the HRQL and self-perceived communication function.
The largest improvements occurred between occasions 1 (prevoice rehabilitation) and 2 (6-month postradiotherapy) and then remained constant.
VRP area demonstrated a statistically significant difference when comparing changes over time, where the study group improved more than the control group.
CONCLUSION: HRQL and self-perceived communication function showed improvement in the study group and trends of impairment in the control group.
This result might suggest that it would be beneficial for the patients as well as in a health economic perspecitve, to receive voice rehabilitatiom to make a faster improvement of the HRQL and self-perceived communication function.</TEXT>
