<TEXT>Superficial hemangioma is better treated by topical 5-aminolevulinic followed by 595-nm pulsed dye laser therapy rather than 595-nm laser therapy alone.
The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and adverse effects of a 595-nm pulsed dye laser therapy alone (PDL alone) with a 5-aminolevulinic (5-ALA) local application followed by a 595-nm PDL (5-ALA PDL) in the treatment of superficial hemangioma (SH).
A prospectively randomized study in 181 patients with SH was carried out over a period of 24 months.
One hundred and ninety-three patients were seen.
One hundred and eighty-one patients with SH were enrolled, of which 165 completed final follow-up.
One hundred and nineteen patients received PDL alone and 46 received 5-ALA PDL.
The patients were assessed clinically and the patient's parents were given a satisfaction questionnaire.
Baseline patient data (gender, lesion size, lesion site, treatment times, cure rate, and adverse reactions) were recorded and the results of the treatment of the two groups were analyzed and compared.
Complete clearing of the lesion (recovery grade 4) was achieved in 44/119 (37.0%) of the PDL alone group and 31/46 (67.4%) of the 5-ALA PDL group (X (2) = 10.30, p &lt; 0.001).
Atrophic scars, hyper- and hypopigmentation occurred in both groups (X (2) = 3.32, p = 0.564).
The patients' parents' satisfaction was greater in the 5-ALA PDL group.
The clinical outcome of 5-ALA PDL was superior to that of PDL alone in the treatment of SH and only minor adverse events occurred in each group.</TEXT>
