<TEXT>[Clinical efficacy of immunotherapy of dendritic cell and cytokine-induced killer cell combined with chemotherapy for treatment of multiple myeloma].
OBJECTIVE: This research was aimed to evaluate the immune mechanism and clinical effect of immunotherapy of dendritic cells (DC) and cytokine-induced killer cell (CIK) combined with chemotherapy on multiple myeloma (MM).
METHODS: 60 patients with MM were randomly divided into two groups.
30 patients in chemotherapy group were treated by chemotherapy only, 30 patients in joint group were treated by adoptive immunotherapy (DC-CIK) combined with chemotherapy.
A variety of immunological indexes (Hsp70, Th1/Th2, TGF-beta) of all patients before and after chemotherapy were recorded; Also the clinical outcomes between two groups were compared.
RESULTS: After chemotherapy, the immunological indexes of all patients were better than those of before chemotherapy (P &lt; 0.05); After treatment, quality of life, clinical index and survival in joint group were better than in chemotherapy group (P &lt; 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Chemotherapy could break the immunosuppression of MM and improve the anti-tumor response of DC-CIK; Chemotherapy and DC-CIK may have synergistic effect for MM.</TEXT>
