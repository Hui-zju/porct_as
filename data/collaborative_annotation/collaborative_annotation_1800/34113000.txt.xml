<TEXT>Primary care providers' responses to unsolicited Lynch syndrome secondary findings of varying clinical significance.
PURPOSE: How primary care providers (PCPs) respond to genomic secondary findings (SFs) of varying clinical significance (pathogenic, uncertain significance [VUS], or benign) is unknown.
METHODS: We randomized 148 American Academy of Family Physicians members to review three reports with varying significance for Lynch syndrome.
Participants provided open-ended responses about the follow-up they would address and organized the SF reports and five other topics in the order they would prioritize responding to them (1 = highest priority, 6 = lowest priority).
RESULTS: PCPs suggested referrals more often for pathogenic variants or VUS than benign variants (72% vs. 16%, p &lt; 0.001).
PCPs were also more likely to address further workup, like a colonoscopy or esophagogastroduodenoscopy, in response to pathogenic variants or VUS than benign variants (43% vs. 4%, p &lt; 0.001).
The likelihoods of addressing referrals or further workup were similar when PCPs reviewed pathogenic variants and VUS (both p &gt; 0.46).
SF reports were prioritized highest for pathogenic variants (2.7 for pathogenic variants, 3.6 for VUS, 4.3 for benign variants, all p &lt;/= 0.014).
CONCLUSION: Results suggest that while PCPs appreciated the differences in clinical significance, disclosure of VUS as SFs would substantially increase downstream health-care utilization.</TEXT>
