<TEXT>Randomized Controlled Study of the Efficacy, Safety and Quality of Life with Low Dose bacillus Calmette-Guerin Instillation Therapy for Nonmuscle Invasive Bladder Cancer.
PURPOSE: The optimal dose of intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin for the treatment of nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer is controversial.
We investigated if induction therapy with low dose bacillus Calmette-Guerin could achieve a complete response rate similar to that of standard dose bacillus Calmette-Guerin, with less toxicity and higher quality of life.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: After transurethral resection, patients with unresectable multiple nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer and/or carcinoma in situ were randomized to receive standard (80 mg) or low dose (40 mg) bacillus Calmette-Guerin instillation induction therapy (weekly, 8 times).
The primary end point was noninferiority of low dose bacillus Calmette-Guerin with a null hypothesis of a 15% decrease in complete response rate.
Secondary end points were recurrence-free survival, progression-free survival, overall survival, patient compliance, adverse events and quality of life using the EORTC QLQ-C30.
RESULTS: In an intent to treat analysis of 166 patients the complete response rates for low dose and standard dose bacillus Calmette-Guerin were 79% (95% CI 0.70-0.88) and 85% (95% CI 0.77-0.92), respectively.
Dunnett-Gent analysis revealed that the null hypothesis of inferiority of low dose bacillus Calmette-Guerin in terms of complete response could not be rejected (p = 0.119).
However, there were no significant differences between the groups in terms of recurrence, progression and overall survival.
Low dose bacillus Calmette-Guerin was associated with significantly less fever (p = 0.001) and micturition pain (p = 0.047), and significantly higher quality of life scores for global quality of life, role functioning and functional impairment.
CONCLUSIONS: The noninferiority of low dose bacillus Calmette-Guerin was not proven.
However, low dose bacillus Calmette-Guerin was associated with lower toxicity and higher quality of life compared to standard dose bacillus Calmette-Guerin in patients with nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer.</TEXT>
