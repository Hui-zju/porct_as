<TEXT>Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy reduces chronic cancer-related fatigue: a treatment study.
INTRODUCTION: About one-third of cancer survivors suffer from severe chronic fatigue.
Aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of mindfulness-based cognitive group therapy in reducing severe chronic fatigue in cancer survivors with mixed diagnoses.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Participants (n = 100) were randomly selected from a cohort and allocated to an intervention and a waiting list condition.
Analyses were based on 59 participants in the intervention condition and 24 in the waiting-list condition.
Fatigue severity (Checklist Individual Strength), functional impairment (Sickness Impact Profile) and well being (Health and Disease-Inventory) were assessed before and after the 9-week intervention.
The intervention group had a follow-up 6 months following the intervention.
RESULTS: At post-treatment measurement the proportion of clinically improved participants was 30%, versus 4% in the waiting list condition (chi(2) (1) = 6.71; p = 0.007).
The mean fatigue score at post-measurement was significantly lower in the intervention group than in the waiting list group corrected for pre-treatment level of fatigue.
The mean well-being score at post-measurement was significantly higher in the intervention group than in the waiting list group corrected for pre-treatment level of well-being.
The treatment effect was maintained at 6-month follow-up.
No difference between the two conditions was found in functional impairment.
DISCUSSION: Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy is an effective treatment for chronic cancer-related fatigue.</TEXT>
