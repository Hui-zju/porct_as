<TEXT>A three-step method for modular lymphadenectomy in gastric cancer surgery: The ability to retrieve sufficient lymph nodes and improve survival.
BACKGROUND: Systematic lymphadenectomy for the resection of sufficient lymph nodes is the most important part of curative resection in gastric cancer surgery.
Here, we explore the outcomes of the three-step method for modular lymphadenectomy (TSMML) and determine its safety and efficacy, compared with the conventional method for lymphadenectomy (CML).
METHODS: From 2008 to 2011, 270 patients with gastric cancer were divided into 2 subgroups: the TSMML group and the CML group.
RESULTS: Patients in the TSMML group had a significantly higher median number of retrieved lymph nodes (rLNs), lower median metastatic lymph node ratios (MLRs), and superior 5-year relapse-free survival (RFS) than the CML group.
Moreover, the use of the TSMML procedure was an independent protective factor for RFS.
No significant intergroup differences were found in morbidity or mortality in these two groups.
CONCLUSION: The TSMML procedure is safe and effective and is easy to learn.</TEXT>
