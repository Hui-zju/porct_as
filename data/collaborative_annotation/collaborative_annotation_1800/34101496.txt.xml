<TEXT>Randomized Study on Dose Escalation in Definitive Chemoradiation for Patients With Locally Advanced Esophageal Cancer (ARTDECO Study).
PURPOSE: To analyze the effect of radiation dose escalation to the primary tumor on local tumor control in definitive chemoradiation (dCRT) for patients with esophageal cancer.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with medically inoperable and/or irresectable esophageal carcinoma, referred for dCRT, were randomly assigned between a standard dose (SD) of 50.4 Gy/1.8 Gy for 5.5 weeks to the tumor and regional lymph nodes and a high dose (HD) up to a total dose of 61.6 Gy to the primary tumor.
Chemotherapy consisted of courses of concurrent carboplatin (area under the curve 2) and paclitaxel (50 mg/m(2)) in both arms once a week for 6 weeks.
The primary end point was local progression-free survival.
RESULTS: Between September 2012 and June 2018, 260 patients were included.
Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) was present in 61% of patients, and 39% had adenocarcinoma (AC).
Radiation treatment was completed by 94%, and 85% had at least five courses of chemotherapy.
The median follow-up time for all patients was 50 months.
The 3-year local progression-free survival (LPFS) was 70% in the SD arm versus 73% in the HD arm (not significant).
The LPFS for SCC and AC was 75% versus 79% and 61% versus 61% for SD and HD, respectively (not significant).
The 3-year locoregional progression-free survival was 52% and 59% for the SD and HD arms, respectively (P = .08).
Overall, grade 4 and 5 common toxicity criteria were 12% and 5% in the SD arm versus 14% and 10% in the HD arm, respectively (P = .15).
CONCLUSION: In dCRT for esophageal cancer, radiation dose escalation up to 61.6 Gy to the primary tumor did not result in a significant increase in local control over 50.4 Gy.
The absence of a dose effect was observed in both AC and SCC.</TEXT>
