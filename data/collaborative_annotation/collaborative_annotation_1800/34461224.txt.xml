<TEXT>Simvastatin modulates estrogen signaling in uterine leiomyoma via regulating receptor palmitoylation, trafficking and degradation.
Uterine leiomyomas or fibroids are the most common tumors of the female reproductive tract.
Estrogen (E2), a steroid-derived hormone, and its receptors (ERs), particularly ER-alpha, are important drivers for the development and growth of leiomyomas.
We previously demonstrated that simvastatin, a drug used for hyperlipidemia, also possesses anti-leiomyoma properties.
The aim of this work is to investigate the impact of simvastatin on ER-alpha signaling in leiomyoma cells, including its expression, downstream signaling, transcriptional activity, post-translational modification, trafficking and degradation.
Primary and immortalized human uterine leiomyoma (HuLM) cells were used for in vitro experiments.
Immunodeficient mice xenografted with human leiomyoma tissue explants were used for in vivo studies.
Leiomyoma samples were obtained from patients enrolled in an ongoing double-blinded, phase II, randomized controlled trial.
Here, we found that simvastatin significantly reduced E2-induced proliferation and PCNA expression.
In addition, simvastatin reduced total ER-alpha expression in leiomyoma cells and altered its subcellular localization by inhibiting its trafficking to the plasma membrane and nucleus.
Simvastatin also inhibited E2 downstream signaling, including ERK and AKT pathways, E2/ER transcriptional activity and E2-responsive genes.
To explain simvastatin effects on ER-alpha level and trafficking, we examined its effects on ER-alpha post-translational processing.
We noticed that simvastatin reduced ER-alpha palmitoylation; a required modification for its stability, trafficking to plasma membrane, and signaling.
We also observed an increase in ubiquitin-mediated ER-alpha degradation.
Importantly, we found that the effects of simvastatin on ER-alpha expression were recapitulated in the xenograft leiomyoma mouse model and human tissues.
Thus, our data suggest that simvastatin modulates several E2/ER signaling targets with potential implications in leiomyoma therapy and beyond.</TEXT>
