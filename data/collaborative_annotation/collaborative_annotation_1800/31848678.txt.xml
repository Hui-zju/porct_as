<TEXT>Comparison of Common Surgical Procedures in Non-complicated Pilonidal Sinus Disease, a 7-Year Follow-Up Trial.
BACKGROUND: Pilonidal disease is a common problem in primary health care which may require immediate surgical referral.
Although various management options have been proposed, so far there is no gold standard treatment.
The aim of the present study was to determine which of the following techniques was superior as regards postoperative complications and recurrence, midline unshifted adipofascial turn-over flap, midline shifted adipofascial turn-over flap or Karydakis flap.
METHODS: A randomized clinical trial was conducted in the Department of General Surgery.
Patients with non-complicated pilonidal sinus were enrolled in the study from April 2009 to January 2012.
All patients were randomized the day of surgery at the coordinating center by means of a computer program.
Patients were randomized to receive midline unshifted adipofascial turn-over flap, midline shifted adipofascial turn-over flap or Karydakis flap.
All procedures were performed under local anesthesia and patients were discharged 6 h after surgery.
Demographic characteristics, skin color, body hair type, family history, preoperative complaints and duration of symptoms, cyst size, intraoperative iatrogenic cyst rupture, the presence of a tuft of hairs in the cyst, surgical techniques, duration of drainage, length of hospital stay, postoperative complications and recurrence were evaluated.
RESULTS: One hundred and ninety-two patients with non-complicated pilonidal sinus were enrolled.
Seventy-two patients were randomized to midline unshifted adipofascial turn-over flap, 67 patients to midline shifted adipofascial turn-over flap and 53 patients to Karydakis flap.
The mean age was 25.66 +/- 7.67 years.
At 76-month follow-up, the overall complications and recurrence rates were not significantly different between groups (p &gt; 0.05).
CONCLUSION: In cases of non-complicated pilonidal sinus, we recommend surgical management using local anesthesia, outpatient surgery and the surgical approach with which the surgeon is most familiar.</TEXT>
