BACKGROUND: Vismodegib specifically inhibits Sonic Hedgehog (SHH).
We report results of a phase I/II evaluating vismodegib + temozolomide (TMZ) in immunohistochemically defined SHH recurrent/refractory adult medulloblastoma.
METHODS: TMZ-naive patients were randomized 2:1 to receive vismodegib + TMZ (arm A) or TMZ (arm B).
Patients previously treated with TMZ were enrolled in an exploratory cohort of vismodegib (arm C).
If the safety run showed no excessive toxicity, a Simon's 2-stage phase II design was planned to explore the 6-month progression-free survival (PFS-6).
Stage II was to proceed if arm A PFS-6 was >/=3/9 at the end of stage I. RESULTS: A total of 24 patients were included: arm A (10), arm B (5), and arm C (9).
Safety analysis showed no excessive toxicity.
At the end of stage I, the PFS-6 of arm A was 20% (2/10 patients, 95% unilateral lower confidence limit: 3.7%) and the study was prematurely terminated.
The overall response rates (ORR) were 40% (95% CI, 12.2-73.8) and 20% (95% CI, 0.5-71.6) in arm A and B, respectively.
In arm C, PFS-6 was 37.5% (95% CI, 8.8-75.5) and ORR was 22.2% (95% CI, 2.8-60.0).
Among 11 patients with an expected sensitivity according to new generation sequencing (NGS), 3 had partial response (PR), 4 remained stable disease (SD) while out of 7 potentially resistant patients, 1 had PR and 1 SD.
CONCLUSION: The addition of vismodegib to TMZ did not add toxicity but failed to improve PFS-6 in SHH recurrent/refractory medulloblastoma.
Prediction of sensitivity to vismodegib needs further refinements.]]></TEXT>
