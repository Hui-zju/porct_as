<TEXT>Randomized Trial of Studer Pouch versus T-Pouch Orthotopic Ileal Neobladder in Patients with Bladder Cancer.
PURPOSE: The need to prevent reflux in the construction of an orthotopic ileal neobladder is controversial.
We designed the USC-STAR trial to determine whether the T-pouch neobladder that included an antireflux mechanism was superior to the Studer pouch in patients with bladder cancer undergoing radical cystectomy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This single center, randomized, controlled trial recruited patients with clinically nonmetastatic bladder cancer scheduled to undergo radical cystectomy with neobladder.
Eligible patients were randomly assigned to undergo T-pouch or Studer ileal orthotopic neobladder.
Treatment assignment was not masked.
The primary end point was change in renal function from baseline to 3 years.
The CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) equation was used to calculate the estimated glomerular filtration rate.
RESULTS: Between February 2002 and November 2009, 237 patients were randomly assigned to T-pouch ileal orthotopic neobladder and 247 to Studer ileal orthotopic neobladder.
Baseline characteristics did not differ between the groups.
Between baseline and 3 years the estimated glomerular filtration rate decreased by 6.4 ml/minute/1.73 m(2) in the Studer group and 6.6 ml/minute/1.73 m(2) in the T-pouch group (p=0.35).
Multivariable analysis showed that type of ileal orthotopic neobladder was not independently associated with 3-year renal function (p=0.63).
However, baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate, age and urinary tract obstruction were independently associated with 3-year decline in renal function.
Cumulative risk of urinary tract infection and overall late complications were not different between the groups, but the T-pouch was associated with an increased risk of secondary diversion related surgeries.
CONCLUSIONS: T-pouch ileal orthotopic neobladder with an antireflux mechanism did not prevent a moderate reduction in renal function observed at 3 years compared to the Studer pouch, but did result in an increase in diversion related secondary surgical procedures.</TEXT>
