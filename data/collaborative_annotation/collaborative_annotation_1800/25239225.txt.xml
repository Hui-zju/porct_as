<TEXT>Trabectedin as a single-agent treatment of advanced breast cancer after anthracycline and taxane treatment: a multicenter, randomized, phase II study comparing 2 administration regimens.
BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of trabectedin for advanced breast cancer.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In an open-label, phase II, multicenter study, women with advanced breast cancer previously treated with &lt;/= 2 lines of chemotherapy for advanced disease, including both anthracyclines and taxanes, were randomized (1:1) to 3-hour infusions of trabectedin 1.3 mg/m(2) once every 3 weeks (1/3 treatment arm) or 0.58 mg/m(2) every week for 3 of 4 weeks (3/4 treatment arm).
The primary end point was objective response.
Secondary end points included time to progression (TTP), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).
RESULTS: Fifty-two women (median age, 50 years; median chemotherapy agents, 4) were enrolled.
Relative trabectedin dose intensities were 81% and 76% in the 1/3 and 3/4 treatment arms, respectively.
Objective response rates were 12% (3 of 25) and 4% (1 of 27), respectively.
Stable disease was observed in 14 (56%) and 11 (41%) patients in the 1/3 and 3/4 treatment arms, respectively, with median durations of 3.5 and 3.7 months.
Median TTP and PFS were higher in the 1/3 treatment arm (3.1 months each) than in the 3/4 treatment arm (2.0 months each).
At a median follow-up of 7 months in both treatment arms, median OS was not reached in the 1/3 treatment arm and was 9.4 months in the 3/4 treatment arm.
The most frequent drug-related adverse events in the 1/3 and 3/4 treatment arms, respectively, were alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level increases (68% vs. 63%), nausea (56% vs. 59%), and asthenia (56% vs. 48%).
Neutropenia and increases in ALT levels were the most frequent grade 3/4 events.
Both types of events were usually transient and reversible.
CONCLUSION: In the population studied, trabectedin showed a manageable safety profile for both regimens analyzed.
There were higher objective response rates and a longer PFS in the 1/3 treatment arm compared with the 3/4 treatment arm.</TEXT>
