<TEXT>Nivolumab versus placebo in patients with relapsed malignant mesothelioma (CONFIRM): a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, phase 3 trial.
BACKGROUND: No phase 3 trial has yet shown improved survival for patients with pleural or peritoneal malignant mesothelioma who have progressed following platinum-based chemotherapy.
The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of nivolumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody, in these patients.
METHODS: This was a multicentre, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel group, randomised, phase 3 trial done in 24 hospitals in the UK.
Adult patients (aged &gt;/=18 years) with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, with histologically confirmed pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma, who had received previous first-line platinum-based chemotherapy and had radiological evidence of disease progression, were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive nivolumab at a flat dose of 240 mg every 2 weeks over 30 min intravenously or placebo until disease progression or a maximum of 12 months.
The randomisation sequence was generated within an interactive web response system (Alea); patients were stratified according to epithelioid versus non-epithelioid histology and were assigned in random block sizes of 3 and 6.
Participants and treating clinicians were masked to group allocation.
The co-primary endpoints were investigator-assessed progression-free survival and overall survival, analysed according to the treatment policy estimand (an equivalent of the intention-to-treat principle).
All patients who were randomly assigned were included in the safety population, reported according to group allocation.
This trial is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT03063450.
FINDINGS: Between May 10, 2017, and March 30, 2020, 332 patients were recruited, of whom 221 (67%) were randomly assigned to the nivolumab group and 111 (33%) were assigned to the placebo group).
Median follow-up was 11.6 months (IQR 7.2-16.8).
Median progression-free survival was 3.0 months (95% CI 2.8-4.1) in the nivolumab group versus 1.8 months (1.4-2.6) in the placebo group (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.67 [95% CI 0.53-0.85; p=0.0012).
Median overall survival was 10.2 months (95% CI 8.5-12.1) in the nivolumab group versus 6.9 months (5.0-8.0) in the placebo group (adjusted HR 0.69 [95% CI 0.52-0.91]; p=0.0090).
The most frequently reported grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events were diarrhoea (six [3%] of 221 in the nivolumab group vs two [2%] of 111 in the placebo group) and infusion-related reaction (six [3%] vs none).
Serious adverse events occurred in 90 (41%) patients in the nivolumab group and 49 (44%) patients in the placebo group.
There were no treatment-related deaths in either group.
INTERPRETATION: Nivolumab represents a treatment that might be beneficial to patients with malignant mesothelioma who have progressed on first-line therapy.
