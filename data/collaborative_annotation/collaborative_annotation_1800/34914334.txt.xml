<TEXT>[Modified Shenqi Dihuang Decoction for bone metastasis of hormone-sensitive prostate cancer after castration].
Objective: To observe the clinical effect of Modified Shenqi Dihuang Decoction (MSDD) on bone metastasis of hormone-sensitive PCa after castration.
METHODS: Seventy-six hormone-sensitive PCa patients with bone metastasis were randomly divided into a control and an MSDD group of an equal number, the former treated by maximal androgen blockade (MAB) and the latter with MSDD in addition to MAB, both for 6 months.
Comparisons were made between the two groups of patients in their TCM symptom scores, quality of life (QOL) scores and the incidence rates of castration resistance, bone metastasis and adverse events.
RESULTS: Totally, 64 of the patients were included in the statistical analysis.
Compared with the controls, the MSDD group showed significantly lower rates of castration resistance (71.87% vs 28.12%, P &lt; 0.05) and new bone and visceral metastases (40.63% vs 18.75%, P &lt; 0.05) and level of serum alkaline phosphatase after treatment (328.5 +/- 170.6 vs 318.5 +/- 165.8 U/L, P &lt; 0.05), as well as lower scores in the TCM symptoms of frequent micturition (2.05 +/- 0.51 vs 1.64 +/- 0.66, P &lt; 0.05), loss of appetite (1.95 +/- 0.48 vs 1.41 +/- 0.39, P &lt; 0.05), fatigue (2.59 +/- 0.68 vs 1.39 +/- 0.58, P &lt; 0.05), back pain (1.76 +/- 0.41 vs 1.26 +/- 0.38, P &lt; 0.05), weight loss (1.88 +/- 0.75 vs 1.26 +/- 0.80, P &lt; 0.05) and self-evaluation (1.89 +/- 0.58 vs 1.54 +/- 0.63, P &lt; 0.05), but a higher score in the physical status (Karnofsky Performance Scale) (70.45 +/- 12.16 vs 79.87 +/- 11.23, P &lt; 0.05).
There were no statistically significant differences in the Numeric Rating Scale for Pain score and the incidence of adverse events between the two groups of patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Modified Shenqi Dihuang Decoction can effectively improve the QOL and TCM symptom scores of the patients with hormone-sensitive PCa after androgen castration, enhance the efficacy of modern drugs in the treatment of hormone-sensitive PCa, decrease the incidence of metastasis, improve the patient's serum indicators, reduce the pain associated with bone metastasis, and improve the patient's quality of life.</TEXT>
