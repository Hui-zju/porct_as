<TEXT>Overall survival for sorafenib plus interleukin-2 compared with sorafenib alone in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC): final results of the ROSORC trial.
BACKGROUND: The ROSORC trial, a randomised, phase II trial comparing sorafenib plus interleukin (IL-2) versus sorafenib alone as first-line treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) failed to demonstrate differences in progression-free survival (PFS).
Updated overall survival (OS) results are reported.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this study, 128 patients were randomised to receive sorafenib 400 mg twice daily plus subcutaneous IL-2 4.5 million international units (MIU) five times per week for 6 weeks every 8 weeks (arm A) or sorafenib alone (arm B).
OS was estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with the two-sided log-rank test.
RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 58 months (interquartile range: 28-63 months), the median OS was 38 and 33 months in arms A and B, respectively (P = 0.667).
The 5-year OS was 26.3% [95% confidence interval (CI) 15.9-43.5) and 23.1% (95% CI 13.2-40.5) for the combination- and single-agent arm, respectively.
Most of the patients who were refractory to first-line treatment were subsequently treated with different targeted agents; they had a median survival greater than expected.
CONCLUSIONS: This outcome suggests a synergistic effect of the subsequent therapies following sorafenib failure.
