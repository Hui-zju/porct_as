<TEXT>Helicobacter pylori eradication on iatrogenic ulcer by endoscopic resection of gastric tumour: a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled multi-centre trial.
INTRODUCTION: The role of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication has not been clarified in the healing of iatrogenic ulcer after endoscopic resection of gastric neoplasm.
The aim of this study was to evaluate whether H. pylori eradication could facilitate the healing of iatrogenic ulcer after endoscopic resection of gastric neoplasm.
METHODS: A total of 232 patients with H. pylori-positive early gastric cancer or gastric adenoma underwent endoscopic resection and were randomly allocated to eradication or placebo group in a prospective, double-blinded, and placebo-controlled manner.
The primary outcome was measured by healing rate of ulcer, and the secondary outcomes by reduction rate of ulcer size, relief rate from ulcer-related symptoms, and adverse event rates.
RESULTS: The healing rate of ulcer was 53% in eradication group and 51.6% in placebo group, respectively (p value=0.95).
The reduction rate of ulcer size, relief rate from ulcer-related symptoms and adverse event rates were also not different between two groups.
In multivariate analysis, initial ulcer size more than 3 cm and histology of cancer were significant factors affecting iatrogenic ulcer healing.
CONCLUSIONS: H. pylori eradication did not facilitate iatrogenic ulcer healing at early and late phase after endoscopic resection of gastric neoplasm.</TEXT>
