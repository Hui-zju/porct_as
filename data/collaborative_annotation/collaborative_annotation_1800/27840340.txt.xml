<TEXT>The Impact of Aerobic Exercise on Quality of Life in Women with Breast Cancer: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
BACKGROUND: The women with breast cancer experience high rates of morbidity due to different treatments.
The objective of this study was to evaluate the role of aerobic exercise in the quality of life (QoL) among women suffering from breast cancer in Hamadan, western Iran.
METHODS: Participants who had consummated the eligibility criteria were randomly assigned in exercise group (n=30) and control group (n=30).
Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.
The mean age was 42.70 +/-9.6 and 43.50 +/-8.60 yr old in exercise and control groups, respectively.
The quality of life was assessed by two widely used standard questionnaires (EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-BR23).
The exercise group received supervised exercise 2 days per week for 10 weeks.
Through two stages (before and after intervention) these groups were evaluated.
Analyzing the data was performed by SPSS/20.0, using t-test, chi-squared and ANCOVA.
P&lt;0.05 was regarded as significant level.
RESULTS: The global health status QoL, based on EORTC QLQ-C30, developed significantly in the exercise group (48.76+/-24.96 vs. 81.79+/-16.34) in comparison with the controls (47.75 +/-15.73 vs. 52.88 +/-14.51) (P&lt;0.001).
The exercise intervention was associated with substantial development in total score of functions and symptoms of QoL using EORTC QLQ-BR23 (P&lt;0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The statistically and clinically crucial developments were indicated in functions and symptoms of QoL in response to exercise in breast cancer women.</TEXT>
