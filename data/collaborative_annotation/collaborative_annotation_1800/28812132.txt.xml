<TEXT>Bowel preparation in CT colonography: Is diet restriction necessary? A randomised trial (DIETSAN).
OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether diet restriction affects quality of colon cleansing and patient tolerance during reduced bowel preparation for CT colonography (CTC).
METHODS: Asymptomatic and symptomatic patients were enrolled in this pragmatic, single-centre, randomised trial.
All patients were randomly assigned (1:1 ratio, blocks of ten) to receive a reduced bowel preparation and faecal tagging with (Diet-Restriction-Group [DR]) or without (No-Diet-Restriction-Group [NDR]) dietary restriction.
Five readers performed a blinded subjective image analysis, by means of 4-point Likert-scales from 0 (highest score) to 3 (worst score).
Endpoints were the quality of large bowel cleansing and tolerance to the assigned bowel preparation regimen.
The trial is registered at ClinicalTrial.gov (URomLSDBAL1).
RESULTS: Ninety-five patients were randomly allocated to treatments (48 in NDR-group, 47 in DR-group).
Both groups resulted in optimal colon cleansing.
The mean residual stool (0.22, 95%CI 0.00-0.44) and fluid burden (0.39, 95%CI 0.25-0.53) scores for patients in DR-group were similar to those in patients in NDR-group (0.25, 95%CI 0.03-0.47 [p = 0.82] and 0.49, 95%CI 0.30-0.67 [p = 0.38], respectively).
Tolerance was significantly better in NDR-group.
CONCLUSION: A reduced bowel preparation in association with faecal tagging and without any dietary restriction demonstrated optimal colon cleansing effectiveness for CTC, providing better patient compliance compared with dietary restriction.
KEY POINTS: * Dietary restriction in reduced bowel preparation regimen can be avoided. *
The quality of colon cleansing is not affected by dietary restriction.
* The quality of faecal tagging is not affected by dietary restriction.
* Avoidance of dietary restriction improves patients' tolerance for CTC.</TEXT>
