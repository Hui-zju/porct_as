<TEXT>Effects of a nursing care program based on the theory of human caring on women diagnosed with gynecologic cancer: a pilot study from Turkey.
PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: This pilot study aimed to determine the effects of a nursing care program based on the Theory of Human Caring (THC) on chemotherapy symptoms, hope, and meaning in life in women diagnosed with gynecologic cancer.
DESIGN/METHODS: This pilot study was conducted in a single-blinded, randomized controlled trial on 52 women diagnosed with gynecologic cancer in Turkey.
In the present study, the experimental group was given a nursing care program based on the THC alongside routine nursing care for five sessions, while the control group received solely routine nursing care.
Data were collected using the Chemotherapy Symptom Assessment Scale, the Herth Hope Scale, and the Life Attitude Profile.
FINDINGS: There was a statistically significant decrease in the frequency, severity, and degree of discomfort of some chemotherapy symptoms in the experimental group.
In addition, the mean scores of hope and meaning in life were significantly higher in the study group compared to the control group.
CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS: This study revealed that a nursing care program based on the Theory of Human Caring might be of benefit for decreasing the frequency, intensity, and discomfort level of some chemotherapy symptoms, and also for improving the level of hope and meaning in life in women diagnosed with gynecologic cancer.</TEXT>
