<TEXT>Refractory or relapsed aggressive B-cell lymphoma failing (R)-CHOP: an analysis of patients treated on the RICOVER-60 trial.
BACKGROUND: The prognosis of elderly patients with aggressive B-non-Hodgkin's lymphoma after first lymphoma-related treatment failure (TF-L) is not well described.
METHODS: We analysed patient characteristics including the presence of MYC rearrangements and MYC-expression immunohistochemistry (IHC) at diagnosis and modalities of salvage therapy and their impact on the prognosis of patients between 61 and 80 years who had been treated on the RICOVER-60 trial.
RESULTS: TF-L occurred in 301 of the 1222 (24.6%) patients; 297 patients could be analysed.
Prognosis was extremely poor in patients with primary progressive disease or early relapse (&lt;/=12 months) with median survivals of 3.3 and 6.4 months.
Survival after TF-L was significantly lower in patients pretreated with R-CHOP compared with CHOP (23.0% versus 36.4% at 2 years, P = 0.016).
In patients with MYC translocation at diagnosis Rituximab reduced the risk of TF-L from 58.8% to 26.3%.
Survival after TF-L was significant longer for patients after CHOP without MYC translocations (31.8% versus 0% at 2 years, P &lt; 0.001) or negative MYC-IHC (41.0% versus 16.8% at 2 years, P = 0.017) but not after R-CHOP.
224 patients (75.4%) received salvage therapy.
Rituximab was part of salvage therapy in 57.4% and improved 2-year survival rate from 20.7% to 46.8% (P &lt; 0.001).
The benefit of R was significant after first-line CHOP [2-year overall survival (OS) 49.6% versus 19.1%, P &lt; 0.001] as well as after R-CHOP (2-year OS 33.1% and 22.5%, P = 0.034).
For patients pretreated with R-CHOP long-term survival was below 15% regardless of the treatment chosen.
CONCLUSION: MYC rearrangement and IHC are adverse prognostic factors after TF-L for CHOP treated patients, rituximab as part of first-line therapy reduced the effects of MYC-break.
Rituximab improves results of any type of salvage therapy; however, survival after progression/relapse of aggressive B-cell lymphoma in elderly patients pretreated with (R)-CHOP is poor regardless of treatment chosen.</TEXT>
