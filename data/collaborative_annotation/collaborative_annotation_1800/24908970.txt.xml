<TEXT>[Effect of high dose tamoxifen therapy in conservative treatment of patients with III-IV stages of non-small cell lung cancer].
Lung cancer is currently the leading cause of cancer-related death.
The effectiveness of treatment of locally advanced and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains low.
One the promising new directions in NSCLC treatment is the inclusion of antiestrogens (tamoxifen) to standard chemotherapy regimens.
Expression of estrogen (Eralpha) and progesterone (PR) receptors in the tumor tissue, objective effect and NSCLC patients' survival at chemohormonal treatment with tamoxifen use were analysed.
ERalpha and PR-receptor status study in patients with NSCLC revealed presence of expression only in 1 (2%) patient.
One-year and median survival (55% and 13.1 months respectively) at high-dose tamoxifen therapy use in combination with chemotherapy were established to be significantly higher (P = 0,00055) than in patients, which received only chemotherapy (32% and 9.5 months respectively).</TEXT>
