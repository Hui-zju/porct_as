<TEXT>A turning point: Head and neck cancer patients' exercise preferences and barriers before and after participation in an exercise intervention.
This study examined the exercise barriers and preferences of head and neck cancer (HNC) survivors in relation to exercise experience.
Participants (n = 22; 46.8% response rate) completed retrospective self-report questionnaires on demographic and medical information, exercise barriers and preferences.
A subset of participants then completed semi-structured interviews (n = 18).
Participants had previously engaged in the ENHANCE trial during, or immediately following, radiation treatment, an average of 22.1 +/- 5.8 months before.
Retrospective questionnaires revealed that before ENHANCE participation, lack of interest and time were the primary exercise barriers.
After participation, there was a significant decrease in typical barriers including lack of interest (p = .008), exercise not a priority (p = .039) and exercise not in routine (p = .004).
Number of barriers experienced after ENHANCE participation was negatively correlated with age, quality of life and minutes of resistance exercise training per week.
After ENHANCE participation, significant increases were found in preference for exercising at a cancer centre (p = .031) and with other cancer survivors (p = .016).
Four higher order themes emerged inductively from interview data analysis pertaining to preferences (i.e., class format) and three higher order themes regarding barriers (physical, psychological and external).
By investigating participants' perspectives after ENHANCE participation, key factors for effective HNC exercise programme design were identified.</TEXT>
