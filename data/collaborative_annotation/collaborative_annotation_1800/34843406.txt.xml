<TEXT><![CDATA[Romidepsin Plus CHOP Versus CHOP in Patients With Previously Untreated Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma: Results of the Ro-CHOP Phase III Study (Conducted by LYSA).
PURPOSE: Romidepsin, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, has demonstrated activity in relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) as a single agent.
Cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) therapy is widely used as first-line treatment of PTCL; however, it has limited efficacy.
Results from a phase Ib and II study showed the feasibility of combining romidepsin with CHOP (Ro-CHOP).
METHODS: This study is a randomized phase III study of Ro-CHOP versus CHOP in adult patients with previously untreated PTCL.
All patients received CHOP in 3-week cycles for six cycles.
Romidepsin, 12 mg/m(2), was administered intravenously over a 4-hour period on days 1 and 8 of each 3-week cycle for six cycles.
The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) according to International Working Group 1999 criteria.
RESULTS: Between January 2013 and December 2017, 421 patients were enrolled (Ro-CHOP, n = 211; CHOP, n = 210).
The median PFS for Ro-CHOP versus CHOP was 12.0 months (95% CI, 9.0 to 25.8) versus 10.2 months (95% CI, 7.4 to 13.2) with a hazard ratio of 0.81 (P = .096).
In the Ro-CHOP versus CHOP arms, the median overall survival was 51.8 versus 42.9 months and the objective response rate was 63% versus 60% with complete response plus unconfirmed complete response rates of 41% versus 37% (P > .1 in all comparisons), respectively.
Grade 3 or 4 treatment-emergent adverse events occurring in >/= 30% of patients in the Ro-CHOP arm included thrombocytopenia (50% v 10% in the Ro-CHOP v CHOP arms, respectively), neutropenia (49% v 33%), anemia (47% v 17%), and leukopenia (32% v 20%).
CONCLUSION: The addition of romidepsin to CHOP did not improve PFS, response rates, nor overall survival and increased the frequency for grade >/= 3 treatment-emergent adverse events.
Ro-CHOP does not represent a significant advance in the standard of care for patients with previously untreated PTCL.]]></TEXT>
