<TEXT>Early matched sibling hematopoietic cell transplantation for adult AML in first remission using an age-adapted strategy: long-term results of a prospective GOELAMS study.
The LAM2001 phase 3 trial, involving 832 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML; median: 46 years) proposed HLA-identical sibling allograft HSCT for all patients with an identified donor.
The trial compared reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) for patients older than 50 years of age (N = 47) and myeloablative conditioning for younger patients (N = 117).
BM HSCT was performed in the younger patients, while the older ones received a consolidation course, followed by peripheral blood allo-HSCT using RIC.
The incidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD, was 51.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 42.1-61.8) and 11.3% (1.6-21.2) after myeloablative or RIC, respectively (P &lt; .0001) and that of chronic GVHD 45.8% (95% CI: 34.8-56.7) and 41.7% (24.7-58.6; NS).
Cumulative incidence of nonrelapse mortality at 108 months was 15.8% (95% CI: 9.8-23.2) for myeloablative, and 6.5% (0.2-16.2) for RIC (NS).
CI of relapse at 108 months was 21.7% (95% CI: 13.9-28.6) and 28.6% (16.5-43.4; NS).
Overall survival at 108 months was 63.4% (95% CI: 54.6-72.2) and 65.8% (52.2-72.2), respectively, after myeloablative or RIC (NS).
RIC peripheral blood stem cell allo-HSCT is prospectively feasible for patients between the ages of 51 and 60 years without excess of relapse or nonrelapse mortality, and compares favorably with myeloablative marrow allo-HSCT proposed to younger patients.</TEXT>
