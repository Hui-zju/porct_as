<TEXT>Effect of the treatment with beta-glucan in women with cervical cytologic report of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (L-SIL).
AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of beta-glucan in women with ASCUS or L-SIL, as detected by cervical cytologic screening.
METHODS: A total of 356 women with ASCUS or L-SIL were enrolled and divided into two groups: 1) 176 patients, treated with topical beta-glucan; and 2) 180 patients who were only followed-up.
The treatment consisted of two cycles of topical beta-glucan applied once a day for 20 consecutive days and treatment separated by ten days.
The effect of beta-glucan was evaluated comparing Pap cytology results and colposcopic findings between treated patients and controls after 6 and 12 months of follow-up.
RESULTS: After 6 months from enrollment, 63.1% (111/176) of patients treated with beta-glucan had a negative Pap smear versus 45% (81/180) of controls (P&lt;0.001), and 43.4% (36/83) of treated patients versus 18.2% (14/77) of controls experienced the disappearance of colposcopic lesions (P=0.001).
At the end of the 12-month follow up, 83.5% (147/176) of treated patients versus 60% (108/180) of controls had a negative Pap smear (P&lt;0.001), and 55.4% (46/83) of treated patients versus 24.7% (19/77) of controls experienced the disappearance of colposcopic lesions (P&lt;0.001).
No side effects were observed in treated patients.
CONCLUSION: beta-glucan increases the spontaneous regression rate of low-grade cytologic abnormalities as well as cervical findings.</TEXT>
