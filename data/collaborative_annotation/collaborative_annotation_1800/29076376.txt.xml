<TEXT>Clomiphene citrate combined with metformin versus letrozole for induction of ovulation in clomiphene-resistant polycystic ovary syndrome: a randomized clinical trial.
A total of 202 patients with clomiphene citrate (CC) -resistant polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) were randomly allocated into two arms of induction of ovulation; the first group (n = 102) received CC 100 mg and metformin 500 mg while the second group (n = 100) received letrozole 2.5 mg with ovulation rate, clinical pregnancy rate, adverse effects, and acceptability were assessed.
Patients in the letrozole arm experienced higher rate of ovulation (82% versus 43.1%, p &lt; .001), more dominant follicles (p &lt; .05), better endometrial thickness (p &lt; .001), higher clinical pregnancy rate (36% versus 9.8%, p &lt; .001), higher multiple pregnancy rate (p &lt; .05), lesser adverse effects (p &lt; .05) and higher acceptability (p &lt; .001) compared to patients in the CC and metformin arm.
In conclusion; letrozole is better and more acceptable than combined CC and metformin for inducing ovulation in patients with CC-resistant PCOS with higher clinical pregnancy rate and unexpectedly higher multiple pregnancy rate.</TEXT>
