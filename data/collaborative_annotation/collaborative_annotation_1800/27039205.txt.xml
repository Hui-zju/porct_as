<TEXT>"Enjoy glass of wine before eating:" a randomized trial to test the orexigenic effects of this advice in advanced cancer patients.
BACKGROUND: Because the extant literature suggests wine increases appetite, this study sought to determine whether this effect could be observed in advanced cancer patients with appetite loss.
METHODS: Advanced cancer patients with self-reported loss of appetite were randomly assigned to white wine with &lt;/=15 % alcohol content twice a day for 3-4 weeks versus a nutritional supplement, such as Boost(R) or Ensure(R).
Patients assigned to wine were encouraged to also take a nutritional supplement, whereas patients assigned to the nutritional supplement arm were told to abstain completely from alcohol.
Patient-reported outcomes were captured with a validated questionnaire to assess the primary endpoint of appetite improvement.
RESULTS: A total of 141 patients (118 evaluable) were enrolled.
Twenty-eight patients (48 %) in the wine arm reported an improvement in appetite at some point during the treatment period, whereas 22 patients (37 %) assigned to the nutritional supplement arm also reported improvement (p = 0.35).
Other appetite-related questions and questionnaire items showed no statistically significant differences between treatment arms.
In both arms, approximately 9 % of patients achieved weight stability (p = 0.98); median survival was not statistically different.
Both interventions were well tolerated.
CONCLUSION: As prescribed in this trial, wine does not improve appetite or weight in advanced cancer patients.</TEXT>
