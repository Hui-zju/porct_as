Purpose ARCHER 1050, a randomized, open-label, phase III study of dacomitinib versus gefitinib in treatment-naive patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and activating mutations in EGFR, reported significant improvement in progression-free survival with dacomitinib.
The mature overall survival (OS) analysis for the intention-to-treat population is presented here.
Patients and Methods In this multinational, multicenter study, patients age 18 years or older (>/= 20 years in Japan and Korea) who had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 and newly diagnosed NSCLC with activating mutations in EGFR (exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R) were enrolled and randomly assigned in a 1:1 manner to dacomitinib (n = 227) or gefitinib (n = 225).
Random assignment was stratified by race (Japanese, Chinese, other East Asian, or non-Asian) and EGFR mutation type.
The final OS analysis was conducted with a data cutoff date of February 17, 2017; at that time 220 deaths (48.7%) were observed.
Results During a median follow-up time of 31.3 months, 103 (45.4%) and 117 (52.0%) deaths occurred in the dacomitinib and gefitinib arms, respectively.
The estimated hazard ratio for OS was 0.760 (95% CI, 0.582 to 0.993; two-sided P = .044).
The median OS was 34.1 months with dacomitinib versus 26.8 months with gefitinib.
The OS probabilities at 30 months were 56.2% and 46.3% with dacomitinib and gefitinib, respectively.
Preliminary subgroup analyses for OS that are based on baseline characteristics were consistent with the primary OS analysis.
Conclusion In patients with advanced NSCLC and EGFR activating mutations, dacomitinib is the first second-generation epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) to show significant improvement in OS in a phase III randomized study compared with a standard-of-care TKI.
Dacomitinib should be considered one of the standard treatment options for these patients.]]></TEXT>
