<TEXT>High-Flow Nasal Cannula Therapy for Exertional Dyspnea in Patients with Cancer: A Pilot Randomized Clinical Trial.
BACKGROUND: Exertional dyspnea is common in patients with cancer and limits their function.
The impact of high-flow nasal cannula on exertional dyspnea in nonhypoxemic patients is unclear.
In this double-blind, parallel-group, randomized trial, we assessed the effect of flow rate (high vs. low) and gas (oxygen vs. air) on exertional dyspnea in nonhypoxemic patients with cancer.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with cancer with oxygen saturation &gt;90% at rest and exertion completed incremental and constant work (80% maximal) cycle ergometry while breathing low-flow air at 2 L/minute.
They were then randomized to receive high-flow oxygen, high-flow air, low-flow oxygen, or low-flow air while performing symptom-limited endurance cycle ergometry at 80% maximal.
The primary outcome was modified 0-10 Borg dyspnea intensity scale at isotime.
Secondary outcomes included dyspnea unpleasantness, exercise time, and adverse events.
RESULTS: Seventy-four patients were enrolled, and 44 completed the study (mean age 63; 41% female).
Compared with low-flow air at baseline, dyspnea intensity was significantly lower at isotime with high-flow oxygen (mean change, -1.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], -2.1, -0.12) and low-flow oxygen (-1.83; 95% CI, -2.7, -0.9), but not high-flow air (-0.2; 95% CI, -0.97, 0.6) or low-flow air (-0.5; 95% CI, -1.3, 0.4).
Compared with low-flow air, high-flow oxygen also resulted in significantly longer exercise time (difference + 2.5 minutes, p = .009), but not low-flow oxygen (+0.39 minutes, p = .65) or high-flow air (+0.63 minutes, p = .48).
The interventions were well tolerated without significant adverse effects.
CONCLUSION: Our preliminary findings support that high-flow oxygen improved both exertional dyspnea and exercise duration in nonhypoxemic patients with cancer.
(ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02357134).
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: In this four-arm, double-blind, randomized clinical trial examining the role of high-flow nasal cannula on exertional dyspnea in patients with cancer without hypoxemia, high-flow oxygen, but not high-flow air, resulted in significantly lower dyspnea scores and longer exercise time.
High-flow oxygen delivered by high-flow nasal cannula devices may improve clinically relevant outcomes even in patients without hypoxemia.</TEXT>
