<TEXT>Robotic-assisted Versus Laparoscopic Surgery: Outcomes from the First Multicentre, Randomised, Patient-blinded Controlled Trial in Radical Prostatectomy (LAP-01).
BACKGROUND: The LAP-01 trial was designed to address the lack of high-quality literature comparing robotic-assisted (RARP) and laparoscopic (LRP) radical prostatectomy.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the functional and oncological outcomes between RARP and LRP at 3 mo of follow-up.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this multicentre, randomised, patient-blinded controlled trial, patients referred for radical prostatectomy to four hospitals in Germany were randomly assigned (3:1) to undergo either RARP or LRP.
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The primary outcome was time to continence recovery at 3 mo based on the patient's pad diary.
Secondary outcomes included continence and potency as well as quality of life in addition to oncological outcomes for up to 3 yr of follow-up.
Time to continence was analysed by log-rank test and depicted by the Kaplan-Meier method.
Continuous measurements were analysed by means of linear mixed models.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: A total of 782 patients were randomised.
The primary endpoint was evaluable in 718 patients (547 RARPs; full analysis set).
At 3 mo, the difference in continence rates was 8.7% in favour of RARP (54% vs 46%, p = 0.027).
RARP remained superior to LRP even after adjustment for the randomisation stratum nerve sparing and age &gt;65 yr (hazard ratio = 1.40 [1.09-1.81], p = 0.008).
A significant benefit in early potency recovery was also identified, while similar oncological and morbidity outcomes were documented.
It is a limitation that the influence of different anastomotic techniques was not investigated in this study.
CONCLUSIONS: RARP resulted in significantly better continence recovery at 3 mo.
PATIENT SUMMARY: In this randomised trial, we looked at the outcomes following radical prostate surgery in a large German population.
We conclude that patients undergoing robotic prostatectomy had better continence than those undergoing laparoscopic surgery when assessed at 3 mo following surgery.
Age and the nerve-sparing technique further affected continence restoration.</TEXT>
