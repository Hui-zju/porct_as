<TEXT>The association between deaths from infection and mutations of the BRAF, FBXW7, NRAS and XPO1 genes: a report from the LRF CLL4 trial.
Causes of death, in particular deaths due to infection, have not been widely studied in randomised trials in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.
With long-term follow-up (median 13 years) we examined the cause of death in 600/777 patients in the LRF CLL4 trial.
Blood samples, taken at randomisation from 499 patients, were available for identifying gene mutations.
Infection was a cause of death in 258 patients (43%).
Patients dying of infection were more likely than those who died of other causes to have received &gt;/=2 lines of treatment (194/258 [75%] versus 231/342 [68%], P = 0.04) and to have died in the winter months (149/258 [58%] versus 166/342 [49%], P = 0.03), respectively.
In patients with mutation data, the factors significantly associated with death from infection versus all other deaths were 11q deletion (47/162 [29%] versus 40/209 [19%], P = 0.03) and mutations of the BRAF, FBXW7, NRAS and XPO1 genes.
Death was caused by an infection in 46/67 assessable patients (69%) who had a mutation of one or more of these four genes versus only 129/333 patients (39%) without any of these mutations (odds ratio: 3.46 [95% CI 1.98-6.07] P &lt; 0.0001).
Careful management of infection risk, including prophylaxis against infection, may be important in patients who carry these mutations.</TEXT>
