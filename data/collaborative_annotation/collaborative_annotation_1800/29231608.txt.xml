<TEXT>[Influence of electroacupuncture pretreatment on intestinal function in the patients of colorectal cancer surgery].
OBJECTIVE: To observe the effects of electroacupuncture (EA) pretreatment on the intestinal function, inflammatory reaction and blood lactic acid in the patients of colorectal cancer surgery.
METHODS: Sixty patients of colorectal cancer laparotomy at selective period, aged from 18 to 59 years old were selected.
According to- grade of American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA), the patients were randomized into group A (total intravenous anesthesia), group B[total intravenous anesthesia combined with EA pretreatment at Zusanli (ST 36), Shangjuxu (ST 37) and Xiajuxu (ST 39) on the right side] and group C[total intravenous anesthesia combined with EA pretreatment at Zhongwan (CV 12), Tianshu (ST 25), Zusanli (ST 36), Shangjuxu (ST 37) and Xiajuxu (ST 39) on the right side], 20 cases in each one.
The total intravenous anesthesia was applied to all of the three groups.
EA pretreatment was used one day before surgery and 30 min before surgery at corresponding acupoints in the group B and group C separately, 30 min each time.
After surgery, the recovery time of bowel sound, the recovery time of flatus, the recovery time of defecation, the duration of diet fasting, the time of peritoneal drainage tube withdrawal and the total peritoneal drainage volume were observed in the three groups.
The venous blood was collected to determine white blood cell count (WBC) and neutrophil count (NEUT) before surgery (T0), 24 h after surgery (T1) and on the 5th day after surgery (T2) separately.
The arterial blood was collected to determine the level of lactic acid before surgery (T), after peritoneal douching (T) and 24 h after surgery (T)separately.
RESULTS: The recovery time of bowel sound, the recovery time of flatus, the duration of diet fasting and the time of peritoneal drainage tube withdrawal in the group C were apparently earlier than those in the group A (all P&lt;0.05).
WBC and NEUT at T1 in the group C were apparently less than those in the group A (both P&lt;0.05).
The differences in lactic acid at T, T and T were not significant statistically in comparison of the three groups (all P&gt;0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The total intravenous anesthesia combined with EA pretreatment at Zusanli (ST 36), Shangjuxu (ST 37), Xiajuxu (ST 39), Tianshu (ST 25) and Zhongwan (CV 12) reduce the recovery time of bowel sound, the recovery time of flatus, the duration of diet fasting and the time of peritoneal drainage tube withdrawal so as to improve the recovery of intestinal function, reduce WBC in 24 h after surgery and alleviate inflammatory reaction.
This therapy has no influence on blood lactic acid.</TEXT>
