<TEXT>Eribulin versus dacarbazine in patients with leiomyosarcoma: subgroup analysis from a phase 3, open-label, randomised study.
BACKGROUND: This subgroup analysis of a phase 3 study compares outcomes for eribulin versus dacarbazine in patients with leiomyosarcoma.
METHODS: Patients &gt;/=18 years old with advanced liposarcoma or leiomyosarcoma, ECOG PS &lt;/=2, and &gt;/=2 prior treatment regimens were randomly assigned (1:1) to eribulin mesylate (1.4 mg/m(2) intravenously on day 1 and day 8) or dacarbazine (either 850, 1000, or 1200 mg/m(2) intravenously) every 21 days until disease progression.
The primary end point was OS; additional end points were progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR).
RESULTS: 309 Patients with leiomyosarcoma were included (eribulin, n = 157; dacarbazine, n = 152).
Median age was 57 years; 42% of patients had uterine disease and 57% had nonuterine disease.
Median OS was 12.7 versus 13.0 months for eribulin versus dacarbazine, respectively (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.93 [95% CI 0.71-1.20]; P = 0.57).
Median PFS (2.2 vs 2.6 months, HR = 1.07 [95% CI 0.84-1.38]; P = 0.58) and ORR (5% vs 7%) were similar between eribulin- and dacarbazine-treated patients.
Grade &gt;/=3 TEAEs occurred in 69% of patients receiving eribulin and 59% of patients receiving dacarbazine.
CONCLUSIONS: Efficacy of eribulin in patients with leiomyosarcoma was comparable to that of dacarbazine.
Both agents had manageable safety profiles.</TEXT>
