<TEXT>The effect of everolimus on renal angiomyolipoma in pediatric patients with tuberous sclerosis being treated for subependymal giant cell astrocytoma.
BACKGROUND: Patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) often have multiple TSC-associated hamartomas, particularly in the brain and kidney.
METHODS: This was a post hoc analysis of pediatric patients being treated for subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs) during the phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled EXIST-1 trial.
Patients were initially randomly assigned to receive everolimus 4.5 mg/m(2)/day (target blood trough 5-15 mg/dl) or placebo and could continue in an open-label extension phase.
Angiomyolipoma response rates were analyzed in patients aged &lt;18 years with &gt;/=1 target angiomyolipoma lesion at baseline.
Response was defined as the proportion of patients with a &gt;/=50% reduction in the sum volume of target renal angiomyolipomata from baseline, in the absence of new target angiomyolipomata, a &gt;20% increase in kidney volume from nadir, and angiomyolipoma-related bleeding &gt;/= grade 2.
Tolerability was also assessed.
RESULTS: Overall, this analysis included 33 patients.
Renal angiomyolipoma response was achieved by 75.8% of patients (95% confidence interval, 57.7-88.9%), with sustained mean reductions in renal angiomyolipoma volume over nearly 4 years of treatment.
In addition, most (&gt;/=80%) achieved clinically relevant reductions in angiomyolipoma volume (&gt;/=50%), beginning at week 24 and continuing for the remainder of the study.
Everolimus was generally well tolerated in this subgroup, with most adverse events being grade 1 or 2 in severity.
CONCLUSIONS: Although everolimus is currently not indicated for this use, this analysis from EXIST-1 demonstrates its long-term efficacy and safety for the treatment of renal angiomyolipoma in pediatric patients undergoing treatment for TSC-associated SEGA.</TEXT>
