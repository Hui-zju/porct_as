BACKGROUND: To evaluate the efficacy of the surgical fat-filling procedure (SFFP) in the treatment of refractory cough and quality of life (QOL) after systematic mediastinal lymphadenectomy in patients with right lung cancer.
METHODS: This is a blinded, randomized, controlled clinical trial to evaluate refractory cough and QOL in patients after mediastinal lymphadenectomy for lung cancer.
One hundred eligible lung cancer patients were randomly divided into two groups: the fat-filling group and non-filling group.
In the fat-filling group, post-lymphadenectomy residual cavities (PLRCs) were filled with fatty tissue autografts after lymph node dissection.
In the non-filling group, the PLRCs remained unfilled.
Clinical endpoints were postoperative cough score and QOL.
RESULTS: The SFFP did not increase intraoperative bleeding, extend operation time, or hospital stay.
Further, night cough was significantly improved after 4 wk in the fat-filling group after the removal of a chest drainage tube.
QOL issues, such as emotional condition, functional status, and additional concerns, demonstrated a remarkable improvement in the fat-filling group at postoperative 1 mo compared with the non-filling (control) group.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that filling PLRCs with fatty tissue autografts is a safe and partially effective treatment for refractory cough after major pulmonary resection and mediastinal lymphadenectomy.
This novel procedure significantly improved patient QOL and may prove useful as a relatively safe preventive surgical adjunct operation for refractory cough.]]></TEXT>
