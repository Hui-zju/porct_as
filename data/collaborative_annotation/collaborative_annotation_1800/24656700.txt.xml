OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of 4-month treatment of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) and Diane-35 on the clinical and biochemical features of hyperandrogenism and quality of life of adolescent girls with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).
DESIGN: A prospective, randomized, cross-over study.
SETTING: An accredited pediatric and adolescent gynecology clinic of a university-affiliated tertiary hospital.
PARTICIPANTS: 76 adolescents girls aged 14 to 19 years old with PCOS were recruited from July 2007 to July 2010.
INTERVENTIONS: Girls were randomized into 2 groups.
Group 1 received oral MPA for 4 months, followed by a washout period of 4 months, and then Diane-35 for another 4 months.
Group 2 received the same combination but in the reverse order.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical and biochemical features of hyperandrogenism and quality of life were assessed.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the 2 groups at baseline.
No significant difference was found in the clinical and biochemical parameters of hyperandrogenism before and after treatment with MPA.
Significant reduction of the acne score, LH/FSH ratio, and testosterone level was seen after taking Diane-35.
Hirsutism was also improved but it did not reach statistical significant.
When comparing post-MPA and post-Diane-35, the post-Diane-35 group had significantly improved acne score and LH/FSH ratio.
No significant difference was found on quality of life between both groups after treatment.
CONCLUSION: Diane-35 may be a more suitable treatment option in adolescent girls diagnosed with PCOS when compared to MPA.]]></TEXT>
