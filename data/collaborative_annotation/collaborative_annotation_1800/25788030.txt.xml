<TEXT>Methods of reconstruction after esophagectomy on long-term health-related quality of life: a prospective, randomized study of 5-year follow-up.
The health-related quality of life (HRQL) is generally accepted as an important parameter for patients undergoing oncologic surgery.
We conducted this prospective, randomized study to compare the effect of narrow gastric tube (NGT) reconstruction and whole-stomach (WS) reconstruction on the long-term HRQL in patients after esophagectomy.
One hundred and four patients undergoing esophagectomy were enrolled in our study from 2007 to 2008, with 52 in NGT group and 52 in WS group.
A questionnaire with reference to the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 and QLQ-OES18 was used to assess the HRQL at 3 weeks, 6 months, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years after esophagectomy.
Data collection and follow-up were performed regularly.
No significant difference was found between NGT group and WS group in the patients' baseline characteristics.
Patients in NGT group had decreased risk of postoperative reflux esophagitis by comparison with those in WS group.
The 5-year cumulative survival rate was 42 % (NGT) and 27 % (WS), respectively.
Compared with WS group, a significant increased survival rate (P = 0.027) was found in NGT group.
Additionally, patients had lower dysphagia scores (better) in NGT group than those in WS group at 5 years after esophagectomy (P &lt; 0.05).
However, the scores of the other scales did not show statistical difference at 5-year follow-up.
NGT is a better option for the reconstruction after esophagectomy because of decreased risk of postoperative complication, increased survival rate, and better HRQL, and NGT should be preferred to be recommended for patients undergoing esophagectomy.</TEXT>
