<TEXT>The influence of Kinesiology Taping on the volume of lymphoedema and manual dexterity of the upper limb in women after breast cancer treatment.
The aim of our study was to evaluate the effect of Kinesiology Taping (KT) on the size of lymphoedema and manual dexterity of the upper limb in women after breast cancer treatment.
We also examined whether the application of KT can replace the traditional and standard multilayered bandaging in the treatment of upper extremity lymphoedema.
Group A comprised of 22 patients who underwent KT as well as pneumatic and manual lymphatic drainage.
Then, group B comprised of 23 patients who were treated with quasi-KT as well as pneumatic and manual lymphatic drainage.
In contrast, group C had 25 patients subjected only to the standard procedure - pneumatic and manual lymphatic drainage and multilayered bandaging.
Patient evaluation items included limb size, grip strength and range of motion.
After 4-week therapy, we observed that KT is not an effective method of reducing lymphoedema II and III(0) in women after breast cancer treatment.
At this moment, the taping cannot replace the traditional and standard multilayered bandaging in the treatment of upper extremity lymphoedema.</TEXT>
