<TEXT>Long-term results of the Dutch randomized prostate cancer trial: impact of dose-escalation on local, biochemical, clinical failure, and survival.
PURPOSE: Nowadays, advanced irradiation techniques make it possible to escalate safely the dose in prostate cancer.
We studied the effect of a higher dose on tumor control in a randomized trial with a median follow-up of 110 months.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with T1b-T4N0 prostate cancer (n=664) were randomized between 78 Gy and 68 Gy.
Primary endpoint was biochemical and/or clinical failure (BCF) according to the American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology (ASTRO) guidelines (3 consecutive rises), and to Phoenix (nadir plus 2 mug/L).
Secondary endpoints were clinical failure (CF), local failure (LF), prostate cancer death (PCD), and overall survival (OS).
Explorative subgroup analyses were performed.
RESULTS: BCF rate (HR=0.8; 20% less events) and LF rate (HR=0.5; 50% less events) were significantly lower in the 78 Gy arm (p&lt;0.05).
CF, PCD and OS were similar in both arms.
A significant heterogeneity of treatment effect was found for PSA cutoffs between 7 and 10 mug/L. CONCLUSION: We observed significantly less BCF and LF in the high-dose arm.
This suggests improvement of the therapeutic ratio.
However, we observed similar rates of CF and PCD at the current update.
More follow-up is needed to investigate which patients benefit in terms of prolonged OS.</TEXT>
