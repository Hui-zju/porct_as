<TEXT>Mean medical costs associated with vaginal and vulvar cancers for commercially insured patients in the United States and Texas.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the average medical costs for vaginal and vulvar cancers in a commercially insured population in the U.S. and Texas.
METHODS: 2011-2014U.S. MarketScan databases were used to estimate the average medical costs associated with vaginal and vulvar cancers.
Women with newly diagnosed vaginal or vulvar cancer were matched to a comparison group without cancer using propensity score.
Year 1 and year 2 costs after index diagnosis date were estimated.
A generalized linear model was used to estimate the cost for censored months.
The differential costs between groups were defined as the net costs associated with cancer diagnosis and treatment.
RESULTS: The analysis included 355 women with vaginal cancer and 997 with vulvar cancer in the U.S. The year 1 and year 2 costs for vaginal cancer were $86,995 and $51,107, respectively.
The year 1 and year 2 costs for vulvar cancer were $37,657 and $19,139, respectively.
The major factors associated with higher monthly vaginal and vulvar cancer costs were higher Charlson Comorbidity Index score and higher medical costs prior to cancer diagnosis.
Monthly costs for vaginal and vulvar cancers decreased rapidly from month 1 to month 6 after diagnosis and then remained stable.
CONCLUSIONS: Seventy to 75% of all vaginal and vulvar cancers are due to HPV infections and mean medical costs associated with these cancers are substantial.
These data will serve as key cost parameters in the economic evaluation of HPV vaccination dissemination and estimation of the long-term net economic benefit of promoting HPV vaccination.</TEXT>
