<TEXT>A randomized clinical trial of the effects of supplemental calcium and vitamin D3 on the APC/beta-catenin pathway in the normal mucosa of colorectal adenoma patients.
APC/beta-catenin pathway perturbation is a common early event in colorectal carcinogenesis and is affected by calcium and vitamin D in basic science studies.
To assess the effects of calcium and vitamin D on adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), beta-catenin, and E-cadherin expression in the normal appearing colorectal mucosa of sporadic colorectal adenoma patients, we conducted a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled 2 x 2 factorial clinical trial.
Pathology-confirmed colorectal adenoma cases were treated with 2 g/day elemental calcium and/or 800 IU/day vitamin D(3) versus placebo over 6 months (N = 92; 23/group).
Overall APC, beta-catenin, and E-cadherin expression and distributions in colon crypts in normal-appearing rectal mucosa biopsies were detected by standardized automated immunohistochemistry and quantified by image analysis.
In the vitamin D(3)-supplemented group relative to placebo, the proportion of APC in the upper 40% of crypts (Phih APC) increased 21% (P = 0.01), beta-catenin decreased 12% (P = 0.18), E-cadherin increased 72% (P = 0.03), and the Phih APC/beta-catenin ratio (APC/beta-catenin score) increased 31% (P = 0.02).
In the calcium-supplemented group Phih APC increased 10% (P = 0.12), beta-catenin decreased 15% (P = 0.08), and the APC/beta-catenin score increased 41% (P = 0.01).
In the calcium/vitamin D(3)-supplemented group, beta-catenin decreased 11% (P = 0.20), E-cadherin increased 51% (P = 0.08), and the APC/beta-catenin score increased 16% (P = 0.26).
These results support (i) that calcium and vitamin D modify APC, beta-catenin, and E-cadherin expression in humans in directions hypothesized to reduce risk for colorectal neoplasms, (ii) calcium and vitamin D as potential chemopreventive agents against colorectal neoplasms, and (iii) the potential of APC, beta-catenin, and E-cadherin expression as modifiable, preneoplastic risk biomarkers for colorectal neoplasms.</TEXT>
