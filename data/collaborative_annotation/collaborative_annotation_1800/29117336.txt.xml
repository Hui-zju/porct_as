<TEXT>Clinical and genetic predictors of paclitaxel neurotoxicity based on patient- versus clinician-reported incidence and severity of neurotoxicity in the ICON7 trial.
Background: Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a dose-limiting toxicity of paclitaxel, with no reliable method to identify at-risk patients.
We investigated the incidence and risk factors including genetic polymorphisms associated with the development of CIPN based on clinician and patient reporting of neuropathic symptoms.
Patients and methods: Risk factors for the development of CIPN were examined in 454 patients treated with paclitaxel/carboplatin from the International Collaboration on Ovarian Neoplasms 7 (ICON7) trial.
Neuropathy was graded by clinicians by standard adverse event reporting and by patients utilising OV28 questionnaire.
Genetic risk factors were examined by selecting six single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes associated with microtubule function.
Risk factors were assessed via dose-to-event cox regression models.
Results: Grade &gt;2 neuropathy was reported by clinicians in 28% of patients, while 67% of patients reported 'quite a bit' or 'very much' tingling or numbness.
Agreement between clinicians and patients was poor (kappa = 0.236, 95% confidence interval, 0.177-0.296, P &lt; 0.001).
Older age, bevacizumab treatment and bowel resection were associated with clinician reported CIPN, while older age and volume of residual disease were associated with patient-reported neuropathy.
There were no significant associations between clinician-reported neuropathy or patient-reported neuropathy and TUBB2, CEP72 or individual MAPT or GSK3B SNPs, however MAPT additive polymorphisms were associated with patient-reported neuropathy and GSK3B additive polymorphisms were associated with clinician reported CIPN.
Conclusions: There was significant discordance between patient- and clinician-reported neurotoxicity.
The lack of consensus regarding optimal outcome measures and whose opinion with regard to CIPN takes precedence is a limitation in the investigation of risk factors for CIPN.
Care must be taken to select and include patient-reported outcome measures in CIPN assessment to enable accurate identification of genetic and other risk factors for neuropathy.</TEXT>
