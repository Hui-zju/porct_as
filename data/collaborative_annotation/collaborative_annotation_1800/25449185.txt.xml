<TEXT>Effects of yoga on cancer-related fatigue and global side-effect burden in older cancer survivors.
BACKGROUND: Sixty percent of cancer survivors are 65years of age or older.
Cancer and its treatments lead to cancer-related fatigue and many other side effects, in turn, creating substantial global side-effect burden (total burden from all side effects) which, ultimately, compromises functional independence and quality of life.
Various modes of exercise, such as yoga, reduce cancer-related fatigue and global side-effect burden in younger cancer survivors, but no studies have specifically examined the effects of yoga on older cancer survivors.
OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of a 4-week yoga intervention (Yoga for Cancer Survivors: YOCAS(c)(R)) on overall cancer-related fatigue, and due to its multidimensional nature, the subdomains of cancer-related fatigue (general, physical, emotional, and mental) and global side-effect burden in older cancer survivors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis on data from a multicenter phase III randomized controlled clinical trial with 2 arms (standard care and standard care plus a 4-week YOCAS(c)(R) intervention).
The sample for this secondary analysis was 97 older cancer survivors (&gt;/=60years of age), between 2months and 2years post-treatment, who participated in the original trial.
RESULTS: Participants in the YOCAS(c)(R) intervention arm reported significantly lower cancer-related fatigue, physical fatigue, mental fatigue, and global side-effect burden than participants in the standard care arm following the 4-week intervention period (p&lt;0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: YOCAS(c)(R) is an effective standardized yoga intervention for reducing cancer-related fatigue, physical fatigue, mental fatigue, and global side-effect burden among older cancer survivors.</TEXT>
