PURPOSE: This randomized, multicenter, open-label, phase Ib/II study assessed durvalumab and tremelimumab in combination or as monotherapy for chemotherapy-refractory gastric cancer or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Second-line patients were randomized 2:2:1 to receive durvalumab plus tremelimumab (arm A), or durvalumab (arm B) or tremelimumab monotherapy (arm C), and third-line patients received durvalumab plus tremelimumab (arm D).
A tumor-based IFNgamma gene signature was prospectively evaluated as a potential predictive biomarker in second- and third-line patients receiving the combination (arm E).
The coprimary endpoints were objective response rate and progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 6 months.
RESULTS: A total of 113 patients were treated: 6 in phase Ib and 107 (arm A, 27; arm B, 24; arm C, 12; arm D, 25; arm E, 19) in phase II.
Overall response rates were 7.4%, 0%, 8.3%, 4.0%, and 15.8% in the five arms, respectively.
PFS rates at 6 months were 6.1%, 0%, 20%, 15%, and 0%, and 12-month overall survival rates were 37.0%, 4.6%, 22.9%, 38.8%, and NA, respectively.
Treatment-related grade 3/4 adverse events were reported in 17%, 4%, 42%, 16%, and 11% of patients, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Response rates were low regardless of monotherapy or combination strategies.
No new safety signals were identified.
Including use of a tumor-based IFNgamma signature and change in baseline and on-treatment circulating tumor DNA are clinically feasible and may be novel strategies to improve treatment response in this difficult-to-treat population.]]></TEXT>
