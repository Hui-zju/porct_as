<TEXT><![CDATA[A web-based intervention (RESTORE) to support self-management of cancer-related fatigue following primary cancer treatment: a multi-centre proof of concept randomised controlled trial.
PURPOSE: Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is a frequent and distressing symptom experienced after cancer treatment.
RESTORE is the first web-based resource designed to enhance self-efficacy to manage CRF following curative-intent treatment.
The aim of this study is to test the proof of concept and inform the design of an effectiveness trial.
METHODS: A multi-centre parallel-group two-armed (1:1) exploratory randomised controlled trial (RCT) with qualitative process evaluation was employed in the study.
Participants (>/=18 years; </=5 years post treatment with moderate to severe fatigue) were recruited and randomly assigned to RESTORE or a leaflet.
Feasibility and acceptability were measured by recruitment, attrition, intervention adherence, completion of outcome measures and process evaluation.
Change in self-efficacy to manage CRF was also explored.
Outcome measures were completed at baseline (T0), 6 weeks (T1) and 12 weeks (T2).
Data were analysed using mixed-effects linear regression and directed content analysis.
RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-three people participated in the trial and 19 in the process evaluation.
The intervention was feasible (39 % of eligible patients consented) and acceptable (attrition rate 36 %).
There was evidence of higher fatigue self-efficacy at T1 in the intervention group vs comparator (mean difference 0.51 [-0.08 to 1.11]), though the difference in groups decreased by 12 weeks.
Time since diagnosis influenced perceived usefulness of the intervention.
Modifications were suggested.
CONCLUSION: Proof of concept was achieved.
The RESTORE intervention should be subject to a definitive trial with some adjustments.
Provision of an effective supportive resource would empower cancer survivors to manage CRF after treatment completion.
