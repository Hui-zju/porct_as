<TEXT>Randomized study comparing mannitol with furosemide for the prevention of cisplatin-induced renal toxicity in non-small cell lung cancer: The OLCSG1406 trial.
AIM: Evidence is lacking on the best standard method for forced diuresis to prevent cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity.
We compared the cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity prevention effect of furosemide or mannitol in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.
METHODS: Patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer suitable to receive cisplatin-containing regimen were randomly assigned to receive furosemide or mannitol with appropriate hydration.
The primary endpoint was the proportion of &gt;/= grade 1 serum creatinine elevation in the first cycle.
RESULTS: The trial was terminated early with 44 (22 per arm) of the planned 66 patients because of slow accrual.
Patients' characteristics were well balanced with median baseline creatinine clearance of 98.0 and 95.1 mL/min in the furosemide and mannitol arms, respectively.
In the first cycle, two (9%) and four (18%) patients developed grade 1 creatinine elevation (P = .66), respectively, despite no &gt;/= grade 2 toxicity.
The median times to develop the worst creatinine score were 10 and 8 days, respectively.
For all cycles, median times to recover to grade 0 were 56 and 20 days, respectively.
The furosemide arm was characterized by relatively high urine output after cisplatin administration (900 vs 550 mL/h), low frequency of unplanned additional hydration (14% vs 32%), and high incidence of hyponatremia (18% and 5%) compared with the mannitol arm.
Both arms showed similar progression-free survival and overall survival.
CONCLUSION: The preventive effect of the two forced diuretics on cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity was not significantly different.
However, the two diuretics have some distinct types of clinical presentations.</TEXT>
