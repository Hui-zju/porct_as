<TEXT>Comparison of two different radiation fractionation schedules with concurrent chemotherapy in head and neck malignancy.
INTRODUCTION: The worldwide incidence of head and neck malignancy exceeds half a million cases annually.
In radiotherapy (RT), conventional fractionation comprises giving five fractions per week from Monday to Friday.
Accelerated RT includes administration of six fractions per week is being advocated.
It gives better locoregional control and the median overall treatment time is 39 days as compared to 46 days in conventional group.
Our study involved comparison of conventional versus accelerated RT with concurrent chemotherapy, in evaluation of local control and toxicity in the two arms.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty patients of locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma head and neck region were studied.
All the patients received cisplatin (30 mg/m2) weekly during the therapy.
The patients received RT dose of 70 Gray (Gy) in 35 fractions (#).
The patients were randomly assorted into two groups: Group 1 - Study group (n = 30) - Six fractions RT per week (Monday-Saturday).
Group 2 - Control group (n = 30) - Five fractions RT per week (Monday-Friday).
During and after the treatment, locoregional control, acute and late radiation toxicity were assessed.
Results and Observation: There was no significant difference between the two schedules regarding locoregional control rate.
The Grade 3 or higher acute toxicities were significantly higher in the accelerated arm although there was no significant difference in late toxicities between the two arms.
CONCLUSION: Accelerated fractionation regimen was not more efficacious than conventional fractionation in the treatment of previously untreated head and neck carcinoma.</TEXT>
