<TEXT>[Clinical study of different bowel preparations on changes of gut flora in patients undergoing colorectal resection].
OBJECTIVE: To compare the impact of traditional and fast bowel preparation on the changes of gut flora in the patients following colorectal resection.
METHODS: Sixty patients undergoing colorectal resection from March 2010 to March 2011 in the Nanfang Hospital were randomly divided into the control group(n=27, 3 days of bowel preparation) and the experimental group(n=33, 1 day of bowel preparation).
Fresh feces were collected before bowel preparation and on the first defecation after surgery.
The postoperative changes in gut flora and septic complications were observed.
RESULTS: Gut flora disturbance was found in both groups.
The postoperative population of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus decreased significantly(P&lt;0.05), and the decrease was more significant in the experimental group compared to the control group(P&lt;0.05), while E.coli and Staphylococcus were much higher than the preoperative level(P&lt;0.05), which was more significant in the control group.
The incidence of postoperative infection was 9.1%(3/33) in the experimental group, which was significantly lower than 29.6%(8/27) in the control group(P&lt;0.05).
CONCLUSION: Fast bowel preparation is effective in reducing gut flora disturbance and the incidence of postoperative infection.</TEXT>
