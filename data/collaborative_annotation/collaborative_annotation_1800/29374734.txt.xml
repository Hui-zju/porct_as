<TEXT>Comparison of Two Radiotherapy Regimens for Metastatic Spinal Cord Compression: Subgroup Analyses from a Randomized Trial.
BACKGROUND/AIM: According to our randomized trial, 5x4Gy was comparable to 10x3Gy for metastatic spinal cord compression.
Since it remained unclear whether findings applied to poor and intermediate prognoses patients, subgroup analyses were performed.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In patients with poor prognoses, 58 received 5x4Gy, 53 received 10x3Gy.
In intermediate-prognoses patients, numbers were 43 and 49.
RESULTS: In patients with poor prognoses, 1-month overall response (OR) was 85% after 5x4Gy and 10x3Gy (p=0.99), improvement 38% vs. 42%, ambulatory status 60% vs. 64% (p=0.83), 6-month local progression-free survival (LPFS) 75% vs. 69% (p=0.74) and 6-month overall survival (OS) 26% vs. 19% (p=0.43).
In patients with intermediate prognoses, 1-month OR was 89% after 5x4Gy and 93% after 10x3Gy (p=0.85), improvement 39% vs. 45%, ambulatory status 84% vs. 82% (p=0.90), 6-month LPFS 79% vs. 92% (p=0.17) and 6-months OS 65% vs. 58% (p=0.65).
CONCLUSION: 5x4Gy was not significantly inferior to 10x3Gy in both subgroups.</TEXT>
