<TEXT>Serratus plane block for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery major lung resection: a randomized controlled trial.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of 2 different analgesic approaches on pain, postoperative rehabilitation exercises and rescue analgesics of 2 groups of patients undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) major lung resection for cancer.
METHODS: A total of 94 patients undergoing a VATS major lung resection were randomly allocated to 2 groups: the control group received intravenous and oral (i.e. systemic) analgesics while the intervention group received systemic analgesics plus pre-emptive serratus plane block.
Pain perception was recorded until drainage removal or until 2 p.m. of postoperative day (POD) 3.
In particular, the primary end point was defined as the peak pain perception on POD 1 (in the time frame between 6 a.m. and 2 p.m.).
Secondary end points were the number of forced inspiration manoeuvers during rehabilitative incentive spirometry on POD 1 and 2 and the overall number of rescue analgesics requested by patients.
RESULTS: Serratus plane block provided a better pain control between 6 a.m. and 2 p.m. of POD 1 (Numeric Rating Scale 1.7 vs 3.5; P &lt; 0.001).
Patients in the intervention group performed more forced inspiration manoeuvers at a mean higher volume during incentive spirometry (8.9 vs 7, P &lt; 0.001, and 1010 vs 865 ml, P = 0.02).
They required fewer rescue doses of analgesics (0.57 vs 1.1; P = 0.008).
CONCLUSIONS: Serratus plane block provided a better pain control, entailing a better performance during postoperative rehabilitation exercises in terms of duration and quality of incentive spirometry.
It diminished the patient's need for rescue analgesics during the early postoperative period.
