PURPOSE: To explore the efficacy and safety of 125I radioactive seed implantation combined with epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) in the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
METHODS: 108 patients with EGFR mutation-positive unresectable advanced NSCLC (stage IIIB-IV) were randomly divided into 125I group (treated with 125I radioactive seed implantation combined with EGFR-TKIs, n=54) and EGFR-TKIs group (treated with EGFR-TKIs alone, n=54).
The short-term efficacy and adverse reactions were analyzed and evaluated, the changes in the levels of peripheral blood T lymphocyte subsets, natural killer (NK) cells and related immune-inflammatory factors were analyzed, and the long-term survival and progression of disease were recorded.
RESULTS: The objective response rate was 61.1% (33/54) and 51.9% (28/54), and the disease control rate was 88.9% (48/54) and 68.5% (37/54), respectively, in 125I group and EGFR-TKIs group.
At 6 months after treatment, the levels of peripheral blood cluster of differentiation 3+ (CD3+), CD4+, CD4+/CD8+ and NK cells significantly rose in both groups compared with those before treatment (p<0.05), while the levels of CD8+, serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-10 significantly declined compared with those before treatment.
The 2-year overall survival (OS) rate was 53.7% (29/54) and 40.7% (22/54), and the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 14.5 months and 9.8 months, respectively, in 125I group and EGFR-TKIs group.
CONCLUSIONS: 125I radioactive seed implantation combined with EGFR-TKIs is safe and effective in the treatment of advanced NSCLC, and its short-term efficacy and long-term survival rate of patients are significantly superior to those of EGFR-TKIs alone.
At the same time, it can regulate the expressions of T lymphocyte subsets, NK cells and immune-inflammatory factors in patients, and improve their immune function.]]></TEXT>
