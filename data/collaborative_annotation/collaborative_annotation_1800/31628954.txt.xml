<TEXT>Underwater versus conventional endoscopic resection of nondiminutive nonpedunculated colorectal lesions: a prospective randomized controlled trial (with video).
BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Incomplete resection of colorectal neoplasia decreases the efficacy of colonoscopy.
Conventional resection (CR) of polyps, performed in a gas-distended colon, is the current standard, but incomplete resection rates of approximately 2% to 30% for nondiminutive (&gt;5 mm), nonpedunculated lesions are reported.
Underwater resection (UR) is a novel technique.
The aim of this study was to determine the incomplete resection rates of colorectal lesions removed by UR versus CR.
METHODS: In a randomized controlled trial, patients with small (6-9 mm) and large (&gt;/=10 mm) nonpedunculated lesions were assigned to CR (gas-distended lumen) or UR (water-filled, gas-excluded lumen).
Small lesions in both arms were removed with a dedicated cold snare.
For CR, large lesions were removed with a hot snare after submucosal injection.
For UR, large lesions were removed with a hot snare without submucosal injection.
Four-quadrant biopsy samples around the resection sites were used to evaluate for incomplete resection.
RESULTS: Four hundred sixty-two eligible polyps (248 UR vs 214 CR) from 255 patients were removed.
Incomplete resection rates for UR and CR were low and did not differ (2% vs 1.9%, P = .91).
UR was performed significantly faster for lesions &gt;/=10
mm in size (10-19 mm, 2.9 minutes vs 5.6 minutes, P &lt; .0001); &gt;/=20 mm, 7.3 minutes vs 9.5 minutes, P = .015).
CONCLUSIONS: Low incomplete resection rates are achievable with UR and CR.
UR is effective and safe with the advantage of faster resection and potential cost savings for removal of larger (&gt;/=10 mm) lesions by avoiding submucosal injection.
As an added approach, UR has potential to improve the cost-effectiveness of colonoscopy by increasing efficiency and reducing cost while maintaining quality.
