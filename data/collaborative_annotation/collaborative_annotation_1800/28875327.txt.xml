<TEXT>The Effects of Selenium Supplementation on Gene Expression Related to Insulin and Lipid in Infertile Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Women Candidate for In Vitro Fertilization: a Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial.
This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of selenium supplementation on gene expression related to insulin and lipid in infertile women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) candidate for in vitro fertilization (IVF).
This randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted among 40 infertile women with PCOS candidate for IVF.
Subjects were randomly allocated into two groups to intake either 200-mug selenium (n = 20) or placebo (n = 20) per day for 8 weeks.
Gene expression levels related to insulin and lipid were quantified in lymphocytes of women with PCOS candidate for IVF with RT-PCR method.
Results of RT-PCR demonstrated that after the 8-week intervention, compared with the placebo, selenium supplementation upregulated gene expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma) (1.06 +/- 0.15-fold increase vs. 0.94 +/- 0.18-fold reduction, P = 0.02) and glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1) (1.07 +/- 0.20-fold increase vs. 0.87 +/- 0.18-fold reduction, P = 0.003) in lymphocytes of women with PCOS candidate for IVF.
In addition, compared with the placebo, selenium supplementation downregulated gene expression of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) (0.88 +/- 0.17-fold reduction vs. 1.05 +/- 0.22-fold increase, P = 0.01) in lymphocytes of women with PCOS candidate for IVF.
We did not observe any significant effect of selenium supplementation on gene expression levels of lipoprotein(a) [LP(a)] in lymphocytes of women with PCOS candidate for IVF.
Overall, selenium supplementation for 8 weeks in lymphocytes of women with infertile PCOS candidate for IVF significantly increased gene expression levels of PPAR-gamma and GLUT-1 and significantly decreased gene expression levels of LDLR, but did not affect LP(a).
