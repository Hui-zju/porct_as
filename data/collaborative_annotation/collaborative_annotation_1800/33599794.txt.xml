<TEXT>Subcutaneous daratumumab in Asian patients with heavily pretreated multiple myeloma: subgroup analyses of the noninferiority, phase 3 COLUMBA study.
The phase 3 COLUMBA study demonstrated noninferiority of subcutaneous daratumumab (DARA SC) to intravenous daratumumab (DARA IV) in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.
We present a subgroup analysis of Asian patients from COLUMBA.
Eligible patients had &gt;/= 3 prior lines of therapy, including a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulatory drug, or were double refractory.
Co-primary endpoints were overall response rate (ORR) and maximum trough concentration (Ctrough).
Secondary endpoints included rates of infusion-related reactions, progression-free survival, and patient-reported satisfaction with therapy.
Sixty-seven Asian patients (DARA SC, n = 30; DARA IV, n = 37) were randomized, including 42 Japanese patients (DARA SC, n = 18; DARA IV, n = 24).
Comparable ORRs for DARA SC versus DARA IV were seen in the Asian cohort (66.7% vs 43.2%) and Japanese-only cohort (61.1% vs 54.2%), including patients weighing &lt;/= 65 kg.
Similarity of Ctrough was seen in both Asian and Japanese-only cohorts; the ratio of the geometric mean of the Ctrough concentrations for DARA SC/DARA IV was 143.96% (90% confidence interval (CI), 112.03-185.00%) and 148.02% (90% CI, 113.32-193.34%), respectively.
The Asian cohort (both treatment groups) and Japanese-only cohort (DARA SC group) experienced higher rates of grade 3/4 cytopenias compared with the global COLUMBA population, occurring predominantly in patients of low bodyweight; no patients discontinued treatment due to cytopenias.
The Cancer Therapy Satisfaction Questionnaire results generally favored DARA SC.
In the Asian and Japanese-only cohorts, DARA SC was comparable to DARA IV.
The efficacy, pharmacokinetic, safety, and satisfaction results were generally consistent with the global COLUMBA population regardless of patient bodyweight.
