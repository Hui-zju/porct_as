<TEXT>Feasibility and suitability of a graded exercise test in patients with aggressive hemato-oncological disease.
PURPOSE: Physical activity promises to reduce disease-related symptoms and therapy-related side effects in patients suffering from aggressive lymphoma (L) or acute leukemia (AL).
For an efficient training program, determination of patients' physical capacity with a purposive exercise test is crucial.
Here, we evaluated the feasibility and suitability of a graded exercise test (GXT) frequently applied in patients suffering from solid tumors by assessing whether patients achieved criteria for maximal exercise testing according to the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM).
METHODS: The GXT was performed by 51 patients with an aggressive L or AL prior to the start or in the earliest possible phase of high-dose chemotherapy, following a recommended protocol for cancer patients, starting at 20 Watts (W), with an increase of 10 W/min until volitional exhaustion.
Subsequently, we investigated whether the following ACSM criteria were fulfilled: (1) failure of heart rate to increase despite increasing workload, (2) post-exercise capillary lactate concentration &gt;
/= 8.0 mmol L(-1), (3) rating of perceived exertion at exercise cessation &gt; 17 on the 6-20 Borg Scale.
RESULTS: Out of 51 patients, two, six, and 35 participants met the first, second, and third criterion, respectively.
No relevant relationships between the completion of the criteria and patients' characteristics (e.g., gender, age) were found.
CONCLUSION: Although results of this study suggest a general feasibility of the applied GXT, the ACSM criteria were not met by the majority of the participants.
Therefore, this study raises doubts about the suitability of the GXT protocol and the ACSM criteria for this group of patients.</TEXT>
