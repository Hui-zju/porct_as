<TEXT>Saline-pocket endoscopic submucosal dissection for superficial colorectal neoplasms: a randomized controlled trial (with video).
BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Colorectal endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is a time-consuming procedure because of the technical difficulty.
The newly developed saline-pocket ESD (SP-ESD) provides a clearer view and better traction of the submucosal layer compared with the standard ESD with gas insufflation (S-ESD).
This study aimed to prospectively compare the efficacy and safety between S-ESD and SP-ESD in patients with superficial colorectal neoplasms (SCNs).
METHODS: From April 2017 to November 2018, 95 patients with SCNs &gt;/=20 mm in diameter were prospectively and randomly enrolled.
Four patients were excluded because of an incomplete ESD procedure.
Patients were finally allocated to 2 groups, S-ESD with 45 patients and SP-ESD with 46 patients.
The primary outcome was dissection speed.
Secondary outcomes were ESD procedure time, en bloc and complete resection rates, perforation rate, and adverse effects.
RESULTS: Median dissection speed was significantly faster in the SP-ESD than the S-ESD group (20.1 mm(2)/min [range, 17.3-28.1] vs 16.3 mm(2)/min [range, 11.4-19.8]; P &lt; .001).
Median procedure time was significantly shorter in the SP-ESD than the S-ESD group (29.5 minutes [range, 22.3-44] vs 41 minutes [range, 31-55]; P &lt; .001).
The en bloc and complete resection rates were 100% in both groups.
No perforations occurred among patients.
The volume of saline solution used in the SP-ESD group was significantly greater than that in the S-ESD group (200 mL [range, 120-250] vs 150 mL [range, 100-200]; P = .016).
CONCLUSIONS: SP-ESD improved dissection speed and procedure time compared with S-ESD.
SP-ESD may be an alternative method for resection of SCNs.
