In this study, we evaluate the efficacy of autologous cytokine-induced killer cells (CIK) transfusion used in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin (GC) chemotherapy to treat nasopharyngeal carcinoma in patients with distant metastasis after radiotherapy.
From September 2007 to August 2008, 60 patients with distant metastasis after radiotherapy were followed up and were randomly divided into 2 groups.
The 30 patients in the GC+CIK group were treated with adoptive autologous CIK cell transfusion in combination with GC chemotherapy; the 30 patients in the GC group were treated with chemotherapy alone.
Short-term efficacy evaluation revealed that in the GC+CIK group, there were 3 cases of complete remission, 18 cases of partial remission, 2 cases of stabilization of disease, and 7 cases of progression of disease and the total effective rate was 70% (21/30).
In the GC group, there were 0 cases of complete remission, 14 cases of partial remission, 3 case of stable disease, and 13 cases of progressive disease and the total effective rate was 46.7% (14/21).
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that the overall survival of the GC+CIK group was higher than that of the GC group, but the difference was not significant (P=0.1374, log-rank test).
However, the progression-free survival of the GC+CIK group was significantly higher than that of the GC group (P=0.0234, log-rank test).
Thus, our study indicated that CIK cell transfusion therapy used in combination with GC chemotherapy may be a more effective treatment for postradiotherapy distant metastasis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients.]]></TEXT>
