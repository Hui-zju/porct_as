BACKGROUND: Multiple studies have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of daratumumab for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM) and primary treatment for transplant-eligible and -ineligible patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted an integrated safety analysis to characterize the frequency, severity, natural history, and outcomes of adverse events (AEs) with daratumumab versus comparators.
Data were pooled from 5 completed phase III randomized controlled studies that had included 1798 daratumumab-treated and 1797 comparator-treated patients with MM as a first line in both transplant-eligible and transplant-ineligible patients and for relapsed/refractory disease.
Safety analyses included reporting of AEs using crude and exposure-adjusted incidence rates.
RESULTS: The median follow-up duration was 16.84 months (range, 7.4-28 months) for both daratumumab-treated and comparator-treated patients.
Discontinuation for any reason occurred less often with daratumumab (22% vs. 33.9%), although discontinuation because of AEs occurred at similar rates (25% vs. 26%) as did deaths owing to AEs (2.25% vs. 1.84%).
When adjusted for exposure, neutropenia, lymphopenia, diarrhea, fatigue, dyspnea, pneumonia, and hypertension were the only common grade 3/4 AEs reported more often with daratumumab than with the comparators.
The prevalence of common grade 3/4 AEs with daratumumab were < 7% apart from neutropenia, lymphopenia, and pneumonia (45.9% vs. 32.3%, 13% vs. 7.5%, and 10.6% vs. 7.2%, respectively).
Grade 3/4 daratumumab infusion-related reactions happened in 3.8% of patients.
The majority of infusion-related reactions occurred after the first infusion.
CONCLUSIONS: These results from an integrated analysis support a favorable benefit/risk profile of daratumumab in patients with MM.]]></TEXT>
