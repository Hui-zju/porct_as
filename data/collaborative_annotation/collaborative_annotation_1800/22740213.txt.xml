<TEXT>Mini-nutrition assessment, malnutrition, and postoperative complications in elderly Chinese patients with lung cancer.
PURPOSE: To assist healthcare professionals in using the mini nutrition assessment (MNA) and its short-form (MNASF) for early identification of malnourished elderly lung cancer patients, conducting preoperative nutritional support, and improving patients' postoperative prognosis, quality of life, and survival.
METHODS: The MNA with revised cut-off points to better suit the Chinese population was conducted on 103 elderly lung cancer Chinese patients aged 60 or above in the Tianjin Cancer Hospital prior to their scheduled surgery.
Patient demographic data, anthropometric parameters, biochemical markers, and postoperative complications were collected and analysed.
RESULTS: Of the 103 patients studied 12.6% (13/103) were malnourished, 31.1% (32/103) were at risk of malnutrition, and 56.3% (58/103) had adequate nutrition; the average MNA score was 23.6+/-3.7.
Significant positive correlations were found between total MNA score and body mass index (BMI), mid-arm circumference (MAC), calf circumference (CC), and hemoglobin (Hb) (p&lt;0.05), as well as between total MNA-SF score and BMI, MAC, CC, and total MNA score.
Significant negative correlations occurred between total MNA-SF score and age (p&lt;0.05).
Among postoperative complications, cardiovascular diseases had the highest morbidity rate (23%), followed by respiratory diseases (22%), and cardiovascular and respiratory diseases combined (19%).
No significant relationship between nutritional status with types of morbidity (p=0.235) and postoperative complications (p=0.362) was found.
CONCLUSION: The MNA scale is an effective tool to preoperatively evaluate the nutritional status of elderly Chinese patients with lung cancer.
These patients have poor nutritional status.
Further investigations are needed to re-examine the correlation between the MNA results and postoperative complications.</TEXT>
