Background: Gastrointestinal cancer is the third most common types of cancer in the world which leads to a lot of stress among sufferers.
Pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches are used to treat stress induced by serious diseases.
Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) technique is considered as one of non-pharmacological method for decreasing patient's stress.
Objective: This study was conducted to determine the effect of home care using EMDR technique on the stress of patients with gastrointestinal cancer.
Materials and Methods: The current semi-experimental study was performed on patients with gastrointestinal cancer residing in Ilam, Iran.
The patients were randomly divided into two groups of intervention (n=30) and control (n=30).
Home care was provided for intervention group in patients' homes which included 2 sessions (a total of 60 sessions for all patients).
Each session lasted for 45 to 60 minutes according to EMDR protocol.
The data were analyzed using SPSS (version 16).
Results: The findings of this study showed that most of patients were male (36, 60%), had diploma degrees (44, 73.3%), had a monthly income less than 500 thousand (38, 63.3%), were married (39, 65 %).
The mean age of the patients was 69.18 +/- 11.58 years.
No statistically significant difference was observed between two groups before the intervention in terms of patients' perceived stress (P&gt;0.05).
However, efficacy and perceived distress of the intervention group significantly was decreased following the intervention (P&lt;0.05).
Conclusions: According to the findings regarding the impact of home care using EMDR technique on reducing stress in patients with gastrointestinal cancer, the implementation of this intervention and provision of education for patients are recommended to expand the nursing duty to community health wards as well as to improve the health status of patients.</TEXT>
