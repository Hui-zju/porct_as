<TEXT>Comparison of Diagnostic Performance of Three-Dimensional Positron Emission Mammography versus Whole Body Positron Emission Tomography in Breast Cancer.
Objective: To compare the diagnostic performance of three-dimensional (3D) positron emission mammography (PEM) versus whole body positron emission tomography (WBPET) for breast cancer.
Methods: A total of 410 women with normal breast or benign or highly suspicious malignant tumors were randomized at 1 : 1 ratio to undergo 3D-PEM followed by WBPET or WBPET followed by 3D-PEM.
Lumpectomy or mastectomy was performed on eligible participants after the scanning.
Results: The sensitivity and specificity of 3D-PEM were 92.8% and 54.5%, respectively.
WBPET showed a sensitivity of 95.7% and specificity of 56.8%.
After exclusion of the patients with lesions beyond the detecting range of the 3D-PEM instrument, 3D-PEM showed higher sensitivity than WBPET (97.0% versus 95.5%, P = 0.913), particularly for small lesions (&lt;1 cm) (72.0% versus 60.0%, P = 0.685).
Conclusions: The 3D-PEM appears more sensitive to small lesions than WBPET but may fail to detect lesions that are beyond the detecting range.
This study was approved by the Ethics Committee (E2012052) at the Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital (Tianjin, China).
The instrument positron emission mammography (PEMi) was approved by China State Food and Drug Administration under the registration number 20153331166.</TEXT>
