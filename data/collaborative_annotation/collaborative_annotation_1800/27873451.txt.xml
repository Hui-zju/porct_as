<TEXT>A prospective randomized trial comparing piperacillin/tazobactam with meropenem as empirical antibiotic treatment of febrile neutropenic children and adolescents with hematologic and malignant disorders.
BACKGROUND: This randomized prospective study was designed to assess whether piperacillin/tazobactam (PIPC/TAZ) is as effective as meropenem (MEPM) as a first-line antibiotic treatment for febrile neutropenia (FN).
PROCEDURE: FN episodes were randomly assigned to receive either PIPC/TAZ (337.5 mg/kg per day in three doses, 1-hr DIV, maximum 13.5 g per day) or MEPM (120 mg/kg per day in three doses, 1-hr DIV, maximum 3 g per day).
Clinical responses were evaluated 120 hr after the DIV.
RESULTS: A total of 434 febrile episodes in 105 patients (42 females and 63 males) with a median age of 8 years (range 0-25) were included in this trial.
Blood cultures were positive in 47 out of the 434 episodes (10.8%).
Regarding responses to the treatment, success rates between the PIPC/TAZ and MEPM groups were similar (62.4 vs. 65.9%, P = 0.484), even if patients were restricted to those with bacteremia (26.1 vs 37.5%, P = 0.534).
Mortality rates did not significantly differ between the two groups (0.8 vs. 0%, P = 0.500).
CONCLUSION: Both PIPC/TAZ and MEPM appeared to be equally efficacious and safe.
Carbapenems are now broadly used to treat FN; however, this may increase the prevalence of drug-resistant bacteria.
In this regard, the treatment using PIPC/TAZ for FN is more beneficial.</TEXT>
