<TEXT>Randomised phase II trial (SWOG S1310) of single agent MEK inhibitor trametinib Versus 5-fluorouracil or capecitabine in refractory advanced biliary cancer.
BACKGROUND: The rationale for the evaluation of trametinib in advanced biliary cancer (BC) is based on the presence of mitogen-activated protein kinase alterations and on earlier promising results with MEK inhibitors in BC.
METHODS: Patients with histologically proven BC who progressed on gemcitabine/platinum were randomised to trametinib daily (arm 1) versus fluoropyrimidine therapy (infusional 5-fluorouracil or oral capecitabine, arm 2).
The primary end-point was overall survival (OS).
Secondary end-points included progression free survival (PFS) and response rate.
A planned interim futility analysis of objective response was performed on the first 14 patients registered to the trametinib arm.
RESULTS: The study was stopped early based on the lack of measurable response in the trametinib arm.
A total of 44 eligible patients were randomised (24 patients in arm 1 and 20 patients in arm 2).
Median age was 62 years and the primary sites of tumour were cholangiocarcinoma (68%) and gallbladder (32%).
The overall response rate was 8% (95% CI 0%-19%) in arm 1 versus 10% (95% CI 0%-23%) in arm 2 (p &gt; .99) Median OS was 4.3 months for arm 1 and 6.6 months for arm 2.
The median PFS was 1.4 months for arm 1 and 3.3 months for arm 2.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first prospective randomised study of a targeted agent versus chemotherapy for the second-line treatment of BC.
In this unselected population, the interim analysis result of unlikely benefit with trametinib resulted in early closure.</TEXT>
