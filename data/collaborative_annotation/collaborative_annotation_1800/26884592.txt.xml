<TEXT><![CDATA[Long-course oxaliplatin-based preoperative chemoradiation versus 5 x 5 Gy and consolidation chemotherapy for cT4 or fixed cT3 rectal cancer: results of a randomized phase III study.
BACKGROUND: Improvements in local control are required when using preoperative chemoradiation for cT4 or advanced cT3 rectal cancer.
There is therefore a need to explore more effective schedules.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with fixed cT3 or cT4 cancer were randomized either to 5 x 5 Gy and three cycles of FOLFOX4 (group A) or to 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions combined with two 5-day cycles of bolus 5-Fu 325 mg/m(2)/day and leucovorin 20 mg/m(2)/day during the first and fifth week of irradiation along with five infusions of oxaliplatin 50 mg/m(2) once weekly (group B).
The protocol was amended in 2012 to allow oxaliplatin to be then foregone in both groups.
RESULTS: Of 541 entered patients, 515 were eligible for analysis; 261 in group A and 254 in group B. Preoperative treatment acute toxicity was lower in group A than group B, P = 0.006; any toxicity being, respectively, 75% versus 83%, grade III-IV 23% versus 21% and toxic deaths 1% versus 3%.
R0 resection rates (primary end point) and pathological complete response rates in groups A and B were, respectively, 77% versus 71%, P = 0.07, and 16% versus 12%, P = 0.17.
The median follow-up was 35 months.
At 3 years, the rates of overall survival and disease-free survival in groups A and B were, respectively, 73% versus 65%, P = 0.046, and 53% versus 52%, P = 0.85, together with the cumulative incidence of local failure and distant metastases being, respectively, 22% versus 21%, P = 0.82, and 30% versus 27%, P = 0.26.
Postoperative and late complications rates in group A and group B were, respectively, 29% versus 25%, P = 0.18, and 20% versus 22%, P = 0.54.
CONCLUSIONS: No differences were observed in local efficacy between 5 x 5 Gy with consolidation chemotherapy and long-course chemoradiation.
Nevertheless, an improved overall survival and lower acute toxicity favours the 5 x 5 Gy schedule with consolidation chemotherapy.
CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: The trial is registered as ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT00833131.]]></TEXT>
