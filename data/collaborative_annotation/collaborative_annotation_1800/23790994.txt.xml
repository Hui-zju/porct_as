<TEXT>Online narratives and peer support for colorectal cancer screening: a pilot randomized trial.
BACKGROUND: Delivering personal narratives and peer support for CRC screening in an online weight-loss community could be an efficient approach to engaging individuals at increased risk, because obesity is associated with excess colorectal cancer (CRC) mortality and lower screening rates.
PURPOSE: Evaluate user engagement and impact of narratives and peer support for promoting CRC screening in an online weight-loss community.
DESIGN: Pilot randomized trial.
SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Members of an online weight-loss community who were not up-to-date with CRC screening were enrolled in the study in 2011.
INTERVENTION: Basic and Enhanced groups (n=153 each) both received education.
The Enhanced group also received narratives and peer support for CRC screening in online forums.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main measures were user engagement, psychosocial outcomes, and self-report CRC screening at 6 months.
Analyses were conducted with (1) the full sample of participants and (2) a minimum dose sample of those who participated in their assigned intervention to a minimum degree.
Analyses were completed in 2012.
RESULTS: Participants were mostly female (92%) with a mean age of 56 years.
More than 90% in both groups viewed the educational information.
Only 57% in the Enhanced group joined the online team.
The Enhanced group had greater improvement in motivation for screening than the Basic group at 1 month (p=0.03).
In the full sample, there was no difference in CRC screening at 6 months (Enhanced 19% vs Basic 16%, adjusted OR=1.33, 95% CI=0.73, 2.42).
In the minimum dose sample, fecal occult blood testing was higher in the Enhanced (14%) vs Basic (7%) group (adjusted OR=2.49, 95% CI=1.01, 6.17).
CONCLUSIONS: Although no between-group differences in CRC screening were seen at 6 months, this study did demonstrate that it is feasible to deploy a narrative and peer support intervention for CRC screening in a randomized trial among members of an online community.
However, modifications are needed to improve user engagement.
