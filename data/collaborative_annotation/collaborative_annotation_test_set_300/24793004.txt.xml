<TEXT><![CDATA[A feasibility study of a psychoeducational intervention program for gynecological cancer patients.
PURPOSE OF THE RESEARCH: This study aimed to test the feasibility of implementing a psychoeducational intervention program for gynecological cancer patients.
METHODS AND SAMPLE: A single-blinded randomized controlled trial and mixed-method design were used.
Study subjects were newly diagnosed gynecological cancer patients with surgery as the first-line treatment.
They were randomly assigned to the intervention group, in which a psychoeducational intervention program based on a thematic counseling model was offered, or to the attention control group.
Quantitative data on sexual functioning, quality of life, uncertainty, anxiety, depression and social support were collected at recruitment, post-operative and during the in-hospital period, and eight weeks after the operation.
Participants in the intervention group and three nurses working in the clinical setting were invited to have semi-structured interviews.
KEY RESULTS: Of the 30 eligible subjects, 26 were successfully recruited into the study.
Following the psychoeducational intervention program, there was significant improvement in the level of inconsistent information about the illness within the category of uncertainty among participants in the intervention group.
In addition, trends towards improvement were demonstrated in quality of life, uncertainty, depression and perceived social support with the provision of the interventions.
Qualitative data indicated the interventions were desired and appreciated by the participants, as well as being feasible and practical to implement in Hong Kong clinical settings.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that it is feasible to deliver the psychoeducational intervention program and it may have beneficial effects in gynecological cancer patients.
A full-scale study is warranted to confirm the results.]]></TEXT>
