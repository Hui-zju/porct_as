PURPOSE: This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of the combination drug tegafur, gimeracil, and oteracil potassium (S-1) concurrent with 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy for newly diagnosed squamous cell carcinoma of the lung in elderly patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with pathologically or cytologically newly diagnosed lung squamous cell carcinoma (n=106) were randomly assigned to receive the combination of tegafur, gimeracil, and oteracil potassium (40mg/m(2), BID, d1-28, repeated every 6 weeks for 4 cycles) and concurrent 3D-conformal radiotherapy (60Gy; experimental group), or gemcitabine (800-1000mg/m(2), d1 and d8) repeated every 21 days for 4 cycles as well as 3D-conformal radiotherapy (control group).
RESULTS: The overall response rate (complete and partial responses) of the experimental group was 68.6%, which was significantly higher than that of the control group (38.5%; P=0.002).
The median progression-free survival rates of the experimental and control groups were 11.8 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.0-22.4) and 7.8 months (95% CI, 6.9-9.2), respectively (P=0.017).
Adverse reactions included grade I/II radiation esophagitis and pneumonitis, with good tolerance.
Grade III/IV adverse reactions of the experimental and control groups were leucopenia (20% cf.
56.6%, respectively; P=0.027), thrombocytopenia (3.9% cf. 25%; P=0.037), and gastrointestinal reaction (1.9% cf. 3.5%; P=0.35).
CONCLUSION: The efficacy of concurrent combination chemotherapy with tegafur, gimeracil, and oteracil potassium (S-1) and 3D-conformal radiotherapy for newly diagnosed squamous cell carcinoma of the lung in elderly patients was excellent, and all toxicities were well tolerated.
This treatment might be considered a main regimen in the management of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung in elderly patients.]]></TEXT>
