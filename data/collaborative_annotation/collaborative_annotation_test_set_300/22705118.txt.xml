INTRODUCTION: The strategy of chemotherapy in the elderly is controversial.
We wanted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of biweekly gemcitabine and low-dose carboplatin combination therapy in elderly patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
METHODS: In this phase-II trial, chemotherapy-naive elderly patients (aged >/=76 years) with NSCLC were randomly treated with biweekly combination therapy with gemcitabine and carboplatin (1000 mg/m(2) gemcitabine and carboplatin at an area under the curve (AUC) of 3 on days 1 and 15, every 4 weeks) or gemcitabine monotherapy (1000 mg/m(2) on days 1, 8 and 15, every 4 weeks).
The primary endpoint was overall response rate and analysis was based on intention-to-treat.
RESULTS: Thirty-one patients were randomly assigned combination therapy and 30 were assigned monotherapy.
The median age was 79.0 years.
Response rate was 22.6% (95% confidence interval (CI): 11.4-39.8%) for biweekly combination therapy and 10.0% (95% CI: 3.5-25.6%) for monotherapy.
Median progression-free survival in combination chemotherapy was 3.9 months (95% CI: 0.5-8.5 months), which was significantly longer that that in monotherapy (2.4 months, 95% CI: 0.5-6.7 months).
The prevalence of hematological and non-hematological adverse events reaching grade 3/4 was not significantly different between combination therapy and monotherapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Biweekly gemcitabine and low-dose carboplatin combination chemotherapy showed acceptable efficacy, toxicity, and tolerability in those aged >/=76 years with NSCLC.
Further investigations with a large population are required to confirm our results.]]></TEXT>
