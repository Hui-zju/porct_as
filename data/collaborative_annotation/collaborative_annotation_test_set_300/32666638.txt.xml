AIM: We aimed to evaluate the effect of a psychological nursing intervention on quality of life (QoL) and cognitive function in patients with gastric carcinoma (GC) and proposed that the intervention might improve the QoL and cognitive function of GC patients.
METHODS: Gastric carcinoma patients were randomly assigned into two groups: (a) intervention group: receiving proper psychological nursing intervention; (b) control group: receiving conventional care.
RESULTS: The QoL and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores at each dimensionality between the intervention group and the control group at baseline showed no significant differences (p > .05).
However, after the 6-month psychological nursing intervention, 5 of 10 dimensionalities in QoL and 5 of 6 dimensionalities in MoCA showed statistically differences between the intervention group and the control group (p < .05).
In comparison with the scores at baseline, the QoL scores measured after the 6-month psychological nursing intervention showed remarkable improvement in multiple dimensionalities in the intervention group, but only appetite loss improved in the control group.
MoCA scores in multiple dimensionalities in the intervention group also exhibited obvious improvement compared with those in control group.
CONCLUSION: A psychological nursing intervention benefits the QoL and cognitive function in GC patients, indicating the importance of a psychological nursing intervention.]]></TEXT>
