OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of an 8-week water physical therapy program on cervical and shoulder pain, pressure sensitivity, and the presence of trigger points (TrPs) in breast cancer survivors.
DESIGN: Randomized, controlled trial.
SETTING: To date, no study has investigated effects of water therapy in breast cancer.
PATIENTS: Sixty-six breast cancer survivors were randomly assigned into two groups: WATER group, who received a water exercise program or CONTROL group who received the usual care treatment for breast cancer.
INTERVENTIONS: The WATER therapy program consisted of 24 sessions (3 times/week over 8 weeks) of low-intensity exercises in a warm pool (32 degrees C).
Each session included 10-minute warm-up period; 35 minutes of aerobic, low-intensity endurance, and core stability training; and a 15-minute cool-down period (stretching and relaxation).
OUTCOMES: Neck and shoulder pain (visual analog scale, 0-100 mm), pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) over C5-C6 zygapophyseal joints, deltoid muscles, second metacarpal, and tibialis anterior muscles, and the presence of TrPs in cervical-shoulder muscles were assessed at baseline and after the 8-week program by an assessor blinded to treatment allocation.
RESULTS: The WATER group demonstrated a between-group improvement for neck pain of -31 mm (95% confidence interval [CI]-49 to -22, P < 0.001; effect size 1.1, 0.81-1.75) and for shoulder-axillary of -19 mm (-40 to -04, P = 0.046; effect size 0.70, 0.14-1.40).
Improvements were also noted for PPT levels over C5-C6 joints (between-group differences, affected side: 27.7 kPa, 95% CI 3.9-50.4; unaffected: 18.1 kPa, 95% CI 6.1-52.2).
No between-group differences for PPT over the remaining points were observed (P > 0.05).
Finally, patients in the WATER program showed a greater reduction of active TrPs as compared with the CONTROL group (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: An 8-week water therapy program was effective for improving neck and shoulder/axillary pain, and reducing the presence of TrPs in breast cancer survivors as compared with usual care; however, no significant changes in widespread pressure pain hyperalgesia were found.]]></TEXT>
