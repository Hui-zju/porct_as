BACKGROUND: The phase III randomised FALCON trial (NCT01602380) demonstrated improved progression-free survival with fulvestrant 500 mg versus anastrozole 1 mg in endocrine therapy-naive postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive (HR+) locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (LA/MBC).
Furthermore, overall health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was maintained and comparable for fulvestrant and anastrozole.
Here, we present additional analyses of patient-reported HRQoL outcomes from FALCON.
METHODS: Women with endocrine therapy-naive HR+ LA/MBC were randomised 1:1 to fulvestrant (days 0, 14, 28, then every 28 d) or anastrozole (daily) until disease progression or discontinuation.
HRQoL was assessed by FACT-B questionnaire (TOI and FACT-B total score) at randomisation and every 12 weeks during treatment.
HRQoL data post-treatment (with or without progression) were also collected.
RESULTS: In total, 462 patients were randomised (fulvestrant, n = 230; anastrozole, n = 232).
Compliance to FACT-B overall ranged from 60.0 to 97.4%.
Mean change from baseline in TOI and FACT-B total score remained broadly stable (approximately +/- 3 points to week 132) and was similar between arms during treatment.
HRQoL was also maintained in FACT-B subscales.
Approximately one-third of patients had improved TOI (>/=+6 points) and FACT-B (>/=+8 points) total scores from baseline up to week 120 and 132, respectively, of treatment with fulvestrant (ranges 26.4-45.0% and 22.4-35.8%, respectively) and anastrozole (ranges 18.6-32.9%, and 22.7-37.9%, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Mean change from baseline in TOI and FACT-B total score was maintained for fulvestrant and anastrozole; similar proportions of patients in both arms had improved TOI and FACT-B total scores.
