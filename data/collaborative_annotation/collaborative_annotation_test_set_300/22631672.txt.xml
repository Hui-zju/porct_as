The aim of this study was to investigate the early outcome of Endostar combined with chemoradiotherapy for advanced cervical cancer.
Fifty-two cases (FIGO IIb to IVa) were divided randomly into two groups, receiving chemoradiotherapy alone (CRT group) and Endostar combined with chemoradiotherapy (CRT+E group).
For the patients in the CRT+E group, Endostar was administered daily with the dosage of 7.5 mg/m2, and cisplatin was administered weekly with the dosage of 20 mg/m2 during the radiation.
The regimens lasted for 4 weeks with no difference in chemoradiotherapy between the two groups.
The early outcome complete remission rate was 73.1%, partial remission rate was 23.1% and the total response rate was 96.2% in CRT+E group, a significnat improvement on the 34.6%, 42.3% and 76.9%, respectively, in the CRT group.
One year survive rates were 100% and 84.6% in the CRT+E group and CRT groups, the difference being significant.
Endostar combined with chemoradiotherapy can improve the early outcome of the advanced cervical cancer, and adverse effects were not encountered.]]></TEXT>
