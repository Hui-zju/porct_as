<TEXT><![CDATA[Phase III Randomized Study of Induction Chemotherapy Followed by Definitive Radiotherapy + Cetuximab Versus Chemoradiotherapy in Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck: The INTERCEPTOR-GONO Study (NCT00999700).
OBJECTIVES: Induction chemotherapy followed by cetuximab and RT (IBRT) (Arm A) was compared to cisplatin/RT (CRT) (Arm B) in a randomized phase III study.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Naive patients with stage III-IVa, histologically proven locally advanced head and neck cancer (LASCCHN) were eligible.
Arm A (IBRT): 3 TPF induction followed by cetuximab-RT (equivalent daily dose 2 Gy up to 70 Gy); Arm B: 3 cisplatin concurrent with the same RT scheduling.
Due to slow accrual and incomplete data collection a futility analysis was performed.
RESULTS: 236/282 patients were evaluable.
Therefore, no formal analyses can be made between the two arms.
OS was 45.2/53.6 months in Arm A/B. Complete responses were achieved in 64% of patients in both arms.
Neutropenia and skin toxicity were significantly worse in Arm A and body weight loss was significantly worse in Arm B. Compliance with the planned drug administration was higher in Arm B (p = 0.0008).
CONCLUSION: The study suggests that IBRT and CRT have similar efficacy, activity and toxicity.]]></TEXT>
