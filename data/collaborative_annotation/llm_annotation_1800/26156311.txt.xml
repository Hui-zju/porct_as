<TEXT>Transbronchial Catheter Aspiration and Transbronchial Needle Aspiration in the Diagnostic Workup of Peripheral Lung Lesions.
PURPOSE: Increasingly frequent, it is clinically indicated to obtain tissue from a peripheral lung lesion (PLL) to yield a pathological diagnosis.
The aim of the present study was to evaluate the diagnostic sensitivity of transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) and transbronchial catheter aspiration (TBCA) in addition to transbronchial forceps biopsy (TBB) at conventional bronchoscopy.
METHODS: Eligible patients showing a PLL on computed tomography scans were included in the study.
In all patients, following TBB, TBNA and TBCA were employed in randomised order under fluoroscopy.
RESULTS: Fourty-eight patients were enrolled, of whom 46 patients with 46 PLLs were included in the analysis.
The mean +/- SD diameter of the PLL was 27.0 +/- 13.3 mm.
The overall sensitivity for all modalities was 69.6%; PLL &lt;/=20 or &gt;20 and &lt;/=30 mm in diameter showed a sensitivity of 60.0 and 72.2%, respectively.
For malignant PLL (n = 33), the combined sensitivity of TBNA + TBCA versus TBB was significantly higher (63.6 vs. 33.3%, p &lt;/= 0.05), and could not further be improved by TBB.
For benign PLL, TBB was superior to TBNA + TBCA (76.9 vs. 38.5%).
CONCLUSIONS: TBB, TBNA and TBCA are complementary to one another.
Combining the three techniques, even allows transbronchial specimen collection of PLL &lt;3 cm in diameter at conventional bronchoscopy.</TEXT>
