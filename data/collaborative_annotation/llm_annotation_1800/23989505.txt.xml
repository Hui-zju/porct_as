<TEXT>A randomized clinical trial to evaluate the impact of a dental care program in the quality of life of head and neck cancer patients.
OBJECTIVES: A randomized clinical trial (RCT) to evaluate the impact of dental care program on the quality of life (QOL) of head and neck cancer patients under oncological treatment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study design was a parallel RCT where 46 subjects with a diagnosis of head and neck primary neoplasy were randomly allocated to the control (CG) or test group (TG).
Both groups received basic dental care but the TG received a complimentary care before and during, oncological therapy.
Data related to general (WHOQOL-BREF) and specific (EORTC QLQ H&amp;N 35) QOL were assessed before and 15 days after the conclusion of the oncological therapy.
RESULTS: The TG showed an improvement in the general and specific QOL, while the CG showed a worsening in these indexes but without significant difference.
The variation between the initial and final measures in the TG shows a tendency of significant improvement along the time.
A reduction in candidiasis (p &lt; 0.05) and muccositis was observed in the TG.
CONCLUSION: In a short follow-up period, dental care was able to reduce damage from the oncological therapy especially related to muccositis and candidiasis, although the QOL was not significantly improved.
However, a longer follow-up to measure the late side effects over the QOL of these patients is necessary.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Provision of continuous dental care for head and neck cancer patients can reduce deleterious side effects of the oncological treatment.</TEXT>
