<TEXT>Cocreated internet-based stepped care for individuals with cancer and concurrent symptoms of anxiety and depression: Results from the U-CARE AdultCan randomized controlled trial.
OBJECTIVE: The aim was to evaluate the effects of cocreated internet-based stepped care (iCAN-DO) on anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in individuals with cancer and self-reported anxiety and/or depression symptoms, compared with standard care.
METHODS: Clinically recruited individuals with breast, colorectal, or prostate cancer underwent online screening with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).
Those with anxiety and/or depression symptoms (&gt;7 on any of the HADS subscales) were randomized to iCAN-DO or standard care.
iCAN-DO comprised psychoeducation and self-care strategies (step 1) and internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT, step 2).
Data were collected before randomization and at 1, 4, 7, and 10 months and analyzed with intention-to-treat regression analysis and randomization tests.
RESULTS: Online screening identified 245 (27%) of 909 individuals who reported anxiety and/or depression symptoms.
They were randomized to iCAN-DO (n = 124) or standard care (n = 121).
Of them 49% completed the 10-month assessment, and in the iCAN-DO group 85% accessed step 1 and 13% underwent iCBT.
iCAN-DO decreased the levels of symptoms of depression (-0.54, 95% confidence interval: -1.08 to -0.01, P &lt; .05) and the proportion of individuals with symptoms of depression (P &lt; .01) at 10 months, compared with standard care, according to HADS.
There were no significant effects on anxiety, posttraumatic stress, or HRQoL. CONCLUSION: Internet-based stepped care improves symptoms of depression in individuals with cancer.
Further studies are needed to gain knowledge on how to optimize and implement internet-based support in oncology care.</TEXT>
