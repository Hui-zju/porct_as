<TEXT>Randomized trial in malignant biliary obstruction: plastic vs partially covered metal stents.
AIM: To compare efficacy and complications of partially covered self-expandable metal stent (pcSEMS) to plastic stent (PS) in patients treated for malignant, infrahilar biliary obstruction.
METHODS: Multicenter prospective randomized clinical trial with treatment allocation to a pcWallstent((R)) (SEMS) or a 10 French PS.
Palliative patients aged &gt;/= 18, for infrahilar malignant biliary obstruction and a Karnofsky performance scale index &gt; 60% from 6 participating North American university centers.
Primary endpoint was time to stent failure, with secondary outcomes of death, adverse events, Karnofsky performance score and short-form-36 scale administered on a three-monthly basis for up to 2 years.
Survival analyses were performed for stent failure and death, with Cox proportional hazards regression models to determine significant predictive characteristics.
RESULTS: Eighty-five patients were accrued over 37 mo, 42 were randomized to the SEMS group and 83 patients were available for analyses.
Time to stent failure was 385.3 +/-
52.5 d in the SEMS and 153.3 +/- 19.8 d in the PS group, P = 0.006.
Time to death did not differ between groups (192.3 +/- 23.4 d for SEMS vs 211.5 +/- 28.0 d for PS, P = 0.70).
The only significant predictor was treatment allocation, relating to the time to stent failure (P = 0.01).
Amongst other measured outcomes, only cholangitis differed, being more common in the PS group (4.9% vs 24.5%, P = 0.029).
The small number of patients in follow-up limits longitudinal assessments of performance and quality of life.
From an initially planned 120 patients, only 85 patients were recruited.
CONCLUSION: Partially covered SEMS result in a longer duration till stent failure without increased complication rates, yet without accompanying measurable benefits in survival, performance, or quality of life.</TEXT>
