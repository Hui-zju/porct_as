<TEXT>Clear colonoscopy as a surveillance tool in the prediction and reduction of advanced neoplasms: a randomized controlled trial.
BACKGROUND: Missed and incompletely resected lesions remain the main cause of the recurrence of advanced neoplasms (ANs) in post-polypectomy patients.
This study aims to determine whether the recurrence of ANs can be predicted and reduced by the newly developed clear colonoscopy procedure.
METHODS: Between 2006 and 2010, a total of 1350 participants with colorectal neoplasm were equally randomized to clear colonoscopy surveillance (CCS) and routine colonoscopy surveillance (RCS) in our center.
Clear colonoscopy was achieved through repeat colonoscopy.
On surveillance colonoscopy at 3 (for high-risk patients) and 5 (for low-risk patients) years, the recurrence of ANs and the relationship between the frequency of repeat examinations required for a clear colonoscopy and the recurrence of ANs were analyzed.
RESULTS: Surveillance colonoscopy at 3 and 5 years showed that the incidence of ANs in patients belonging to the CCS group was 1.7%, which was lower than 4.7% in patients belonging to the RCS group (P = 0.012) for both high- and low-risk patients.
Out of the 1126 patients who achieved clear colonoscopy on first repeat examination, only 5 ( 0.4%) were found to have ANs on surveillance examination, whereas 12 out of the 217 (5.4%) patients on second repeat examination and 5 out of the 29 (17.2%) patients on third repeat examination were found to have ANs (P &lt; 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Surveillance based on clear colonoscopy decreased the incidence of ANs in post-polypectomy patients.
The number of repeat examinations required for a clear colonoscopy is an important factor in the prediction of the recurrence of ANs.</TEXT>
