<TEXT>Volumetric computed tomography screening for lung cancer: three rounds of the NELSON trial.
Several medical associations recommended lung cancer screening by low-dose computed tomography scanning for high-risk groups.
Counselling of the candidates on the potential harms and benefits and their lung cancer risk is a prerequisite for screening.
In the NELSON trial, screenings are considered positive for (part) solid lung nodules with a volume &gt;500 mm3 and for (part) solid or nonsolid nodules with a volume-doubling time &lt;400 days.
For this study, the performance of the NELSON strategy in three screening rounds was evaluated and risk calculations were made for a follow-up period of 5.5 years.
458 (6%) of the 7582 participants screened had a positive screen result and 200 (2.6%) were diagnosed with lung cancer.
The positive screenings had a predictive value of 40.6% and only 1.2% of all scan results were false-positive.
In a period of 5.5 years, the risk of screen-detected lung cancer strongly depends on the result of the first scan: 1.0% after a negative baseline result, 5.7% after an indeterminate baseline and 48.3% after a positive baseline.
The screening strategy yielded few positive and false-positive scans with a reasonable positive predictive value.
The 5.5-year lung cancer risk calculations aid clinicians in counselling candidates for lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography.</TEXT>
