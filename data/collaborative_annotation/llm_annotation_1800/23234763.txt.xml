<TEXT>Adjuvant lapatinib for women with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer: a randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial.
BACKGROUND: Worldwide, many patients with HER2-positive early stage breast cancer do not receive trastuzumab-the standard adjuvant treatment.
We investigated the efficacy and safety of adjuvant lapatinib for patients with trastuzumab-naive HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer, started at any time after diagnosis.
METHODS: This study was a placebo-controlled, multicentre, randomised phase 3 trial.
Women outpatients from 405 [corrected] centres in 33 countries [corrected] with HER2-positive early-breast cancer who had previously received adjuvant chemotherapy but not trastuzumab were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive daily lapatinib (1500 mg) or daily placebo for 12 months.
Randomisation was done with a computer-generated sequence, stratified by time since diagnosis, lymph node involvement at diagnosis, and tumour hormone-receptor status.
Investigators, site staff, and patients were masked to treatment assignment.
The primary endpoint was disease-free survival in the intention-to-treat population.
This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00374322.
FINDINGS: Between August, 2006, and May, 2008, 3161 women were enrolled and 3147 were assigned to lapatinib (n=1571) or placebo (n=1576).
After a median follow-up of 47.4 months (range 0.4-60.0) in the lapatinib group and 48.3 (0.7-61.3) in the placebo group, 210 (13%) disease-free survival events had occurred in the lapatinib group versus 264 (17%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.83, 95% CI 0.70-1.00; p=0.053).
Central review of HER2 status showed that only 2490 (79%) of the randomised women were HER2-positive.
157 (13%) of 1230 confirmed HER2-positive patients in the lapatinib group and in 208 (17%) of 1260 in the placebo group had a disease-free survival event (HR 0.82, 95% 0.67-1.00; p=0.04).
Serious adverse events occurred in 99 (6%) of 1573 patients taking lapatinib and 77 (5%) of 1574 patients taking placebo, with higher incidences of grade 3-4 diarrhoea (97 [6%] vs nine [&lt;1%]), rash (72 [5%] vs three [&lt;1%]), and hepatobiliary disorders (36 [2%] vs one [&lt;1%]).
INTERPRETATION: Our data show that there was no significant difference in disease-free survival between groups when analysed in the intention-to-treat population.
However, exploratory analyses restricted to patients who had HER2-positive disease confirmed by central fluorescence in-situ hybridisation review suggested marginal benefit with lapatinib in terms of disease-free survival.
Thus lapatinib might be an option for women with HER2-positive breast cancer who do not or cannot receive adjuvant trastuzumab.
