<TEXT>Dietary patterns as risk factors of differentiated thyroid carcinoma.
UNLABELLED: Nutritional factors are known to be important in the development of different metabolic diseases.
The history of nodular or diffuse goiter is closely related to risk of thyroid carcinoma.
On account of the function of the thyroid gland, many studies focus on iodine intake.
The aim of the study was to assess whether dietary patterns could be risk factors of differentiated thyroid carcinoma.
MATERIAL/METHODS: The case-control study was based on a questionnaire, which included information about dietary patterns and was carried out on 284 patients comprising 30 males (mean age 58.4+/-13.7 years), and 254 females (mean age 52.1+/-13.8 years), as well as 345 randomly selected controls: 58 males (mean age 60.2+/-12 years) and 287 females (mean age 53.4+/-14.3 years) randomly selected from the Population Register and adjusted by age and gender to the group of TC.
The main groups of nutritional products, i.e. starchy foods, meat, dairy products, vegetables, fruits, and beverages, were analyzed.
RESULTS: Consumption of vegetables, fruits, saltwater fish and cottage cheese was significantly lower in patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma than in controls, quite the contrary to starchy foods, especially white bread.
CONCLUSIONS: Dietary patterns appear to modify the risk of thyroid carcinoma.
A diet rich in vegetables and fruit, as well as saltwater fish (a source of iodine) and low-fat meat, could be an important protective factor.</TEXT>
