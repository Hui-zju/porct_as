<TEXT>Pilot randomized sham-controlled trial of self-acupressure to manage the symptom cluster of insomnia, depression, and anxiety in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.
PURPOSE: Current evidence for using self-acupressure to manage the cancer-related symptom cluster of insomnia, depression, and anxiety, while promising, is unknown.
This study evaluated the feasibility of self-acupressure to manage this symptom cluster and to explore its potential effectiveness.
METHODS: Participants were assigned randomly to three study groups, namely the true acupressure (TAP), the sham acupressure (SAP), and the enhanced standard care group (ESC).
Participants in the TAP and SAP groups received a training session on acupressure and were required to practice self-acupressure at home once per day for 28 days.
The duration of participant involvement was 8 weeks.
Patients completed a Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) for each symptom, the Insomnia Severity Index, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General at baseline (T1), post-intervention (T2, week 4), and post follow-up (T3, week 8).
RESULTS: The results indicated that the intervention had clinical significance in improving the targeted symptoms and quality of life.
In the TAP group, the symptom cluster severity was significantly lower than in the other groups at T2 (p &lt; 0.05).
The insomnia severity and anxiety scores in the TAP and SAP groups were significantly lower than those in ESC at T2 and T3 (p &lt; 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The trial was feasible.
The promising results of the study suggest that further testing of self-acupressure is warranted to inform its effectiveness on the targeted symptom cluster in patients with cancer.
A placebo effect was evident alongside therapeutic effects.
