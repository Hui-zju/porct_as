<TEXT>Long-term Peripheral Neuropathy in Breast Cancer Patients Treated With Adjuvant Chemotherapy: NRG Oncology/NSABP B-30.
Background: The long-term effects of chemotherapy are sparsely reported.
Peripheral neuropathy (PN) is one of the most frequent toxicities associated with taxane use for the treatment of early-stage breast cancer.
We investigated the impact of the three different docetaxel-based regimens and patient characteristics on long-term, patient-reported outcomes of PN and the impact of PN on long-term quality of life (QOL).
Methods: The National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project Protocol B-30 was a randomized trial comparing sequential doxorubicin (A) and cyclophosphamide (C) followed by docetaxel (T) (AC--&gt;T), concurrent ACT, or AT in women with node-positive, early-stage breast cancer.
The AC--&gt;T group had a higher cumulative dose of T. PN was one of the symptoms assessed in a QOL substudy.
Statistical methods included simple and mixed ordinal logistic regression and general linear models.
All statistical tests were two-sided.
Results: Of 1512 patients, 41.9% reported PN two years after treatment initiation.
Treatment with AT and ACT was associated with less severe long-term PN compared with AC--&gt;T (odds ratio [OR] = 0.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.35 to 0.58; OR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.46 to 0.75).
Preexisting PN, older age, obesity, mastectomy, and greater number of positive nodes were also associated with higher risk of long-term PN.
Patients who reported worse PN symptoms at 24 months had statistically significantly worse QOL (Ptrend &lt; .001).
Conclusions: The administration of docetaxel is associated with long-term PN.
The lower rate of long-term PN in AT and ACT patients might be an important consideration in supporting choosing these therapies for individuals with preexisting neuropathic symptoms or other risk factors for neuropathy.</TEXT>
