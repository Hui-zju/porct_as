<TEXT>Linked Color Imaging Can Improve Detection Rate of Early Gastric Cancer in a High-Risk Population: A Multi-Center Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial.
BACKGROUND: Early diagnosis of gastric cancer is difficult in China due to the lack of a valid method for endoscopic screening.
Early gastric cancer, especially flat gastric cancer, lacks specific endoscopic features.
Many cases appear to be similar to ordinary gastritis cases under normal white light endoscopy, which can lead to misdiagnosis.
AIMS: In order to find a new method to improve detection rate of early gastric cancer in China, we designed a trial to validate linked color imaging (LCI) for screening of early gastric cancer in a high-risk population, as compared to white light imaging (WLI).
METHOD: Subjects were randomly allocated to either the LCI + WLI or WLI group and then subjected to gastroscopy and all endoscopies were made after special preparation.
All endoscopists had knowledge of this experiment.
The main indicator was the rate of detection of gastric neoplastic lesions.
The difference in the detection rate between the two groups is reported.
RESULTS: The detection rate was 4.31% in the WLI group and 8.01% in the LCI + WLI group.
This is a difference of 3.70% with a P value &lt; 0.001 and an OR (95% CI) of 1.934 (1.362, 2.746).
The lower limit of the 95% CI was greater than 0, and the superiority margin was 1%.
CONCLUSION: The detection rate of gastric neoplastic lesions was higher in the LCI + WLI group than in the WLI group, LCI might be an effective method for screening early gastric cancer.</TEXT>
