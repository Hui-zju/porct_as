<TEXT>Frequency of elevated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) biomarkers in patients with advanced hepatitis C.
OBJECTIVES: Prospective studies of serum hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) biomarkers in patients with advanced hepatitis C are lacking.
The aim of this study was to determine the frequencies and performance of elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), AFP-L3, and des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin (DCP) levels as HCC biomarkers in advanced hepatitis C. METHODS: Patients in the HALT-C Trial were tested every 3 months for 42 months.
Screening ultrasound was performed every 12 months.
Levels of biomarkers were compared in patients in whom HCC did or did not develop.
RESULTS: In all, 855 patients were evaluated; HCC developed in 46.
Among patients without HCC, 73.2% had AFP consistently &lt;20, 24.5% had at least one AFP between 20 and 199, and 2.3% had at least one AFP value &gt;/=200 ng/ml; 73.7% had DCP consistently &lt;90, 11.6% had at least one DCP between 90 and 149, and 14.7% had at least one DCP value &gt;/=150 mAU/ml.
AFP-L3 &gt;/=10% was present at least once in 9.0% and in 17.1% of those with AFP &gt;/=20 ng/ml.
Among all patients with elevated biomarkers, a diagnosis of HCC was made in 0-31.6% (depending on the biomarker and cutoff) during the subsequent 24 months.
AFP &gt;/=200 ng/ml had the highest specificity (99%), but sensitivity was &lt;/=20%.
DCP &gt;/=40
mAU/ml had the highest sensitivity (76%), but specificity was &lt;/=58%.
Independent predictors of elevated AFP were gender (female), race (Black), more advanced disease, and HCC.
Elevated DCP was associated with more advanced disease and HCC.
CONCLUSIONS: Mild-moderate elevations in total AFP and DCP but not in AFP-L3 occur frequently in patients with chronic hepatitis C and advanced fibrosis, are related to factors other than HCC, and are poor predictors of HCC.</TEXT>
