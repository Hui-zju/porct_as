<TEXT>The neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and the presence of large nodal mass are independent predictors of early response: A subanalysis of the prospective phase II PET-2-adapted HD0607 trial.
BACKGROUND: The neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and the lymphocyte to monocyte ratio (LMR) can reflect both the myeloid dysfunction and T-cell immune suppression and have prognostic significance.
METHODS: In 771 newly diagnosed advanced-stage Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) patients we evaluated the baseline values of NLR and LMR as predictors of clinical outcome.
According to the multicenter prospective phase II GITIL-HD0607 trial, all patients received two ABVD courses and if PET-2 negative received four additional ABVD cycles while if PET-2-positive patients were randomized to either BEACOPP escalated (Be) plus BEACOPP baseline (Bb) (4 + 4 courses) or Be + Bb (4 + 4) and Rituximab.
PET scans were centrally reviewed by an expert panel by Blinded Independent Central Review.
RESULTS: Higher NLR and lower LMR were associated with a PET-2 positivity and failure to achieve long-term disease control, respectively.
By univariate and multivariate analysis, large nodal mass (&gt;7 cm), IPS &gt;/= 3, NLR &gt; 6 were strong independent predictors of early PET-2 response after ABVD.
Only NLR &gt; 6 and IPS &gt;/= 3 were strong independent predictors of outcome at diagnosis; however, when PET-2 status was added, only PET-2-positive status and IPS &gt;/= 3 were independent predictors of PFS.
Focusing on PET-2-negative patients, those with NLR &gt; 6 had an inferior 3-year PFS compared to patients with NLR &lt;/= 6 (84% vs 89% months, P = .03).
CONCLUSION: In advanced-stage HL patients treated with a PET-2-driven strategy, IPS &gt;/= 3 and NLR &gt; 6 are independent predictors of outcome at diagnosis while the presence of large nodal mass, IPS &gt;/= 3, and NLR &gt; 6 at diagnosis are independent predictors of early ABVD response.</TEXT>
