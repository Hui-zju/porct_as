<TEXT>Primary HPV testing with cytology versus cytology alone in cervical screening-A prospective randomized controlled trial with two rounds of screening in a Chinese population.
We conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial with two screening rounds to evaluate the effectiveness of combining HPV testing with liquid-based cytology (LBC) as a co-test, compared to LBC only in cervical cancer screening of a Chinese population.
First, 15,955 women aged 30-60 were randomized at a 1:1 ratio into an intervention group (Digene Hybrid Capture 2 HPV test with LBC) and a control group (LBC alone).
Women in the intervention group would be referred for colposcopy and biopsy immediately if they were found to have high-risk HPV regardless of cytology results.
The detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or above (CIN2+) lesions was significantly higher in the intervention group compared to the control (0.95% vs. 0.38%, OR 2.50, 95% CI 1.65-3.88).
At the subsequent round of screening approximately 36 months later, CIN2+ detection was significantly lower in the intervention group (0.08% vs. 0.35%, OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.08-0.57).
Over the two rounds of screening, the total detection of CIN2+ was higher in the intervention group (1.01% vs. 0.66%, OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.09-2.19).
There was a fourfold increase (10.6% vs. 2.4%, p &lt; 0.001) in the number of colposcopies performed in the intervention arm.
Adding a high-risk HPV test to cytology for primary cervical screening led to earlier detection of clinically significant preinvasive lesions, resulting in a reduced detection of CIN2+ lesions in subsequent rounds and an increased rate of colposcopy.</TEXT>
