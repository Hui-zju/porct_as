<TEXT>Cutaneous head and neck melanoma in OPTiM, a randomized phase 3 trial of talimogene laherparepvec versus granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor for the treatment of unresected stage IIIB/IIIC/IV melanoma.
BACKGROUND: Cutaneous head and neck melanoma has poor outcomes and limited treatment options.
In OPTiM, a phase 3 study in patients with unresectable stage IIIB/IIIC/IV melanoma, intralesional administration of the oncolytic virus talimogene laherparepvec improved durable response rate (DRR; continuous response &gt;/=6 months) compared with subcutaneous granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF).
METHODS: Retrospective review of OPTiM identified patients with cutaneous head and neck melanoma given talimogene laherparepvec (n = 61) or GM-CSF (n = 26).
Outcomes were compared between talimogene laherparepvec and GM-CSF treated patients with cutaneous head and neck melanoma.
RESULTS: DRR was higher for talimogene laherparepvec-treated patients than for GM-CSF treated patients (36.1% vs 3.8%; p = .001).
A total of 29.5% of patients had a complete response with talimogene laherparepvec versus 0% with GM-CSF.
Among talimogene laherparepvec-treated patients with a response, the probability of still being in response after 12 months was 73%.
Median overall survival (OS) was 25.2 months for GM-CSF and had not been reached with talimogene laherparepvec.
CONCLUSION: Treatment with talimogene laherparepvec was associated with improved response and survival compared with GM-CSF in patients with cutaneous head and neck melanoma.
