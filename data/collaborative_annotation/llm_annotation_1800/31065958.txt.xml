<TEXT>The Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Using Indocyanine Green Fluorescence Plus Radioisotope Method Compared With the Radioisotope-Only Method for Breast Cancer Patients After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy: A Prospective, Randomized, Open-Label, Single-Center Phase 2 Trial.
BACKGROUND: This study aimed to compare the sentinel lymph node (SLN) identification rates for breast cancer patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) between the dual method (DM) of indocyanine green fluorescence (ICG-F) plus a radioisotope (RI) and RI alone.
METHODS: This randomized study enrolled 130 patients who received NAC for breast cancer and 122 patients who received SLN biopsy (SLNB) using either DM (n = 58) or RI only (n = 64).
The study compared the identification rate, number of SLNs, and detection time of SLNB.
RESULTS: Among the 122 patients, 113 (92.6%) were clinically node-positive before NAC.
The SLN identification rate was 98.3% in the DM group and 93.8% in the RI group (p = 0.14).
The DM group and the RI group were similar in the average number of SLNs (2.2 +/- 1.13 vs. 1.9 +/- 1.33; p = 0.26) and the time to detection of the first SLN (8.7 +/- 4.98 vs. 8.3 +/- 4.31 min; p = 0.30).
In the DM group, transcutaneous lymphatic drainage was visualized by fluorescence imaging for 65.5% (38 of 58) of the patients.
The SLN identification rate was 94.7% using ICG-F and 93% using RI (p = 0.79).
During and after the operation, no complications, including allergic reactions or skin necrosis, occurred.
CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first randomized trial to use ICG-F for SLNB in breast cancer patients after NAC.
The DM including ICG-F could be a feasible and safe method for SLNB in initially node-positive breast cancer patients with NAC.</TEXT>
