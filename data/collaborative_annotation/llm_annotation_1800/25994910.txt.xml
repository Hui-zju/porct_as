<TEXT>[The prospects for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia of being cured has increased in the Czech Republic in the 21st century to 90% - outcome of the ALL-IC BFM 2002 trial].
BACKGROUND: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most frequent childhood malignancy.
Treatment has been unified in the middle of 1980 in the Czech Republic.
In 2002-2007 children and adolescents with acute lymphoblastic leukemia were treated in an international randomized trial ALL-IC BFM 2002 in the Czech Republic.
291 patients aged 1-18 years were enrolled; infants below 1 year entered a separate trial.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients were stratified into three risk groups according to their age, initial leukocyte count, prednisone response, presence of fusion genes BCR/ABL or MLL/AF4, bone marrow D+15 and remission status D+33.
The whole therapy took 24 months.
Randomized late intensification compared standard BFM therapy with extended, usually more intensive experimental treatment.
The median follow-up was 8.7 years.
Complete remission was achieved in 97.9% patients, 1% died in remission.
11% of children relapsed, 1.7% with CNS involvement.
Six children (2.1%) developed secondary malignancy.
Event free survival (EFS) 8 years from diagnosis was 83.5%, overall survival (OS) 91.4%.
EFS and OS of the risk groups were: standard risk: 89.4%; 98.1%; intermediate risk: 82.6%; 89.6%; high risk: 68.8%; 78.1%.
Male sex and age above 10 years were adverse prognostic factors.
CONCLUSIONS: In comparison with the previous trial ALL-BFM 95, significant improvement was achieved.</TEXT>
