<TEXT>Tumor consistency of pituitary macroadenomas: predictive analysis on the basis of imaging features with contrast-enhanced 3D FIESTA at 3T.
BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Preoperative evaluation of pituitary macroadenoma tumor consistency is important for neurosurgery.
Thus, we aimed to retrospectively assess the role of contrast-enhanced FIESTA in predicting the tumor consistency of pituitary macroadenomas.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-nine patients with pituitary macroadenomas underwent conventional MR imaging sequences and contrast-enhanced FIESTA before surgery.
Two neuroradiologists assessed the contrast-enhanced FIESTA, contrast-enhanced T1WI, and T2WI.
On the basis of surgical findings, the macroadenomas were classified by the neurosurgeons as either soft or hard.
Finally, Fisher exact probability tests and unpaired t tests were used to compare predictions on the basis of the MR imaging findings with the tumor consistency, collagen content, and postoperative tumor size.
RESULTS: The 29 pituitary macroadenomas were classified as either solid or mosaic types.
Solid type was characterized by a homogeneous pattern of tumor signal intensity without intratumoral hyperintense dots, whereas the mosaic type was characterized by many intratumoral hyperintense dots on each MR image.
Statistical analyses revealed a significant correlation between tumor consistency and contrast-enhanced FIESTA findings.
Sensitivity and specificity were higher for contrast-enhanced FIESTA (1.00 and 0.88-0.92, respectively) than for contrast-enhanced T1WI (0.80 and 0.25-0.33, respectively) and T2WI (0.60 and 0.38-0.54, respectively).
Compared with mosaic-type adenomas, solid-type adenomas tended to have a hard tumor consistency as well as a significantly higher collagen content and lower postoperative tumor size.
CONCLUSIONS: Contrast-enhanced FIESTA may provide preoperative information regarding the consistency of macroadenomas that appears to be related to the tumor collagen content.</TEXT>
