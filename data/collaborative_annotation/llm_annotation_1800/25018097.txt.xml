<TEXT>Efficacy of the HPV-16/18 vaccine: final according to protocol results from the blinded phase of the randomized Costa Rica HPV-16/18 vaccine trial.
BACKGROUND: A community-based randomized trial was conducted in Costa Rica to evaluate the HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine (NCT00128661).
The primary objective was to evaluate efficacy of the vaccine to prevent cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 or more severe disease (CIN2+) associated with incident HPV-16/18 cervical infections.
Secondary objectives were to evaluate efficacy against CIN2+ associated with incident cervical infection by any oncogenic HPVs and to evaluate duration of protection against incident cervical infection with HPV-16/18.
Vaccine safety and immunogenicity over the 4-year follow-up were also evaluated.
METHODS: We randomized (3727 HPV arm; 3739 control arm), vaccinated (HPV-16/18 or Hepatitis A) and followed (median 53.8 months) 7466 healthy women aged 18-25 years.
5312 women (2635 HPV arm; 2677 control arm) were included in the according to protocol analysis for efficacy.
The full cohort was evaluated for safety.
Immunogenicity was considered on a subset of 354 (HPV-16) and 379 (HPV-18) women.
HPV type was assessed by PCR on cervical specimens.
Immunogenicity was assessed using ELISA and inhibition enzyme immunoassays.
Disease outcomes were histologically confirmed.
Vaccine efficacy and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were computed.
RESULTS: Vaccine efficacy was 89.8% (95% CI: 39.5-99.5; N=11 events total) against HPV-16/18 associated CIN2+, 59.9% (95% CI: 20.7-80.8; N=39 events total) against CIN2+ associated with non-HPV-16/18 oncogenic HPVs and 61.4% (95% CI: 29.5-79.8; N=51 events total) against CIN2+ irrespective of HPV type.
The vaccine had an acceptable safety profile and induced robust and long-lasting antibody responses.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm the high efficacy and immunogenicity of the HPV-16/18 vaccine against incident HPV infections and cervical disease associated with HPV-16/18 and other oncogenic HPV types.
These results will serve as a benchmark to which we can compare future findings from the ongoing extended follow-up of participants in the Costa Rica trial.
