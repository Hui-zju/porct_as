<TEXT>Effects of an antiadhesive agent on functional recovery of the greater auricular nerve after parotidectomy: a double-blind randomized controlled trial.
PURPOSE: Periauricular sensory deficit occurs frequently after parotidectomy even in cases with preservation of the greater auricular nerve (GAN).
This study was performed to evaluate the effects of antiadhesive agent in functional recovery of the GAN after parotidectomy.
METHODS: Ninety-eight patients undergoing partial parotidectomy for benign parotid tumors were prospectively enrolled in this multicenter, double-blind randomized controlled study and randomly assigned to either the study or control group.
Antiadhesive agent was applied in the study group.
The results of sensory tests (tactile, heat, and cold sensitivity) and a questionnaire on quality of life (QoL) were acquired at postoperative 1, 8, and 24 weeks after surgery.
Clinical parameters, and the results of the sensory tests and the questionnaire, were compared between the two groups.
RESULTS: A total of 80 patients were finally enrolled.
On sensory evaluation, tactile sensation and warm sensation in the ear lobule, and warm sensation in the mastoid area, showed significant improvement at 24 weeks postoperatively in the study group.
There were no significant differences between the two groups on any questions in the QoL questionnaire, at any follow-up time point.
CONCLUSIONS: Antiadhesive agents have some positive effects on functional recovery of the GAN after parotidectomy.
Therefore, applying antiadhesive agents after parotidectomy can reduce discomfort in patients.</TEXT>
