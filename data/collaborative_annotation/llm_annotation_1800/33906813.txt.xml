<TEXT>Decision aid for women with newly diagnosed breast cancer seeking breast reconstruction surgery: A prospective, randomized, controlled, single-blinded, pilot study.
BACKGROUND: Women undergoing immediate breast reconstruction for breast cancer often experience anxiety when faced with reconstruction and the type of reconstruction to choose.
The purpose of this study is to analyze the impact of a decision aid on decisional conflict in women with newly diagnosed breast cancer seeking breast reconstruction.
METHODS: Newly diagnosed breast cancer patients seeking breast reconstruction at a single center were prospectively randomized into two groups.
Comparisons were made between two groups using the decisional conflict scale (DCS): women who reviewed the standard educational materials prior to initial consultation (control) and women who reviewed standard materials prior to initial consultation and then reviewed a decision aid brochure at initial consultation and two-week post-consultation (intervention).
Pre-to-post-consultation DCS scores were compared within and between the control groups and intervention groups to assess which group had lower DCS scores.
RESULTS: A total of 20 patients, mean age 53+/-9 years were included.
Median differences between pre-to-post-consultation DCS total scores in the control and intervention groups lowered from 32 to 22 and 28 to 16, respectively.
Significant differences in subscores were control group: uncertainty: 54-21 (p=0.030), and intervention group: uncertainty: 46-29 (p=0.036) and values clarity: 29-25(p=0.042).
Pre-to-post-consultation differences between DCS scores and subscores did not demonstrate any statistical significance.
CONCLUSION: Decision aids did not significantly reduce pre-operative DCS total scores compared to current educational materials.
More educational materials may not always be helpful for patients.</TEXT>
