<TEXT>Therapeutic effects of anterolateral thigh flap transfer in repairing oral and maxillofacial defects after ablative surgery of neoplasms.
BACKGROUND: To investigate the therapeutic effects of anterolateral thigh flap transfer in repairing oral and maxillofacial defects after ablative surgery of neoplasms and to discuss perioperative psychological care.
METHODS: A total of 80 patients who received oral and maxillofacial surgery for tumor resection in Nanfang Hospital from October 2014 to August 2016 were selected.
Patients were randomly divided into control group and observation group, 40 patients in each group.
Patients in control group received forearm flap transfer, while patients in observation group were treated with anterolateral thigh flap transfer.
RESULTS: The survival rate of flap, food intake ability, quality of life and incidence of complication were compared between groups.
There was no significant difference in survival rate of the flaps between two groups (P&gt;0.05).
No significant difference in food intake was found between groups at 3 months after operation (P&gt;0.05).
The UW-QOL scores of the two groups at 1 year after operation were significantly higher than those before operation (P&lt;0.05), and no significant differences in UW-QOL scores were found between two groups at 1 year after operation (P&gt;0.05).
Incidence of temporary dysfunction, hyperplastic scar, permanent dysfunction, pigmentation and pruritus was significantly lower in observation group than in control group (P&lt;0.05).
There was no significant difference in the incidence of necrosis between two groups (P&gt;0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that anterolateral thigh flap transfer has similar therapeutic effects to those of forearm flap transfer in repairing oral and maxillofacial defects after ablative surgery of neoplasms and improving food intake and quality of life.
But Anterolateral thigh flap transfer can reduce the incidence of postoperative complications, so this treatment should be popularized.</TEXT>
