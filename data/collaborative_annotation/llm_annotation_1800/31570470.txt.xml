<TEXT>The Role of Metoprolol and Enalapril in the Prevention of Doxorubicin-induced Cardiotoxicity in Lymphoma Patients.
BACKGROUND/AIM: Anthracyclines, such as doxorubicin, though widely used in anticancer therapy, they are associated with cardiotoxic side-effects.
The aim of this trial was to investigate long-term follow-up cardiotoxicity findings in patients treated with doxorubicin and concomitant metoprolol or enalapril 10 years earlier.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Overall, 147 patients were randomized into the treatment arms.
A total of 125 patients treated with doxorubicin without evidence of heart disease at the start of chemotherapy were analyzed.
They were followed-up for up to 10 years after treatment start.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: A total of 47 patients completed the follow-up and 21 patients died, none due to cardiotoxicity events.
Clinical signs of heart failure were not seen in any patients and no statistically significant differences between baseline and 10-year findings were seen for echocardiographic variables.
No evidence of long-term cardiotoxicity was seen and nor metoprolol or enalapril offered an additional benefit.</TEXT>
