<TEXT>Association between prediagnostic biomarkers of inflammation and endothelial function and cancer risk: a nested case-control study.
Experimental and prevalent case-control studies suggest an association between biomarkers of inflammation, endothelial function, and adiposity and cancer risk, but results from prospective studies have been limited.
The authors' objective was to prospectively examine the relations between these biomarkers and cancer risk.
A nested case-control study was designed within the Supplementation en Vitamines et Mineraux Antioxydants (SU.VI.MAX) Study, a nationwide French cohort study, to include all first primary incident cancers diagnosed between 1994 and 2007 (n = 512).
Cases were matched with randomly selected controls (n = 1,024) on sex, age (in 2-year strata), body mass index (weight (kg)/height (m)(2); &lt;25 vs. &gt;/=25), and SU.VI.MAX intervention group.
Conditional logistic regression was used to study the associations between prediagnostic levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), adiponectin, leptin, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (sICAM-1), soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, soluble E-selectin, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 and cancer risk.
All statistical tests were 2-sided.
Plasma sICAM-1 level was positively associated with breast cancer risk (for quartile 4 vs. quartile 1, multivariate odds ratio (OR) = 1.86, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.06, 3.26; P(trend) = 0.048).
Plasma hs-CRP level was positively associated with prostate cancer risk (for quartile 4 vs. quartile 1, multivariate OR = 3.04, 95% CI: 1.28, 7.23; P(trend) = 0.03).
These results suggest that prediagnostic hs-CRP and sICAM-1 levels are associated with increased prostate and breast cancer risk, respectively.</TEXT>
