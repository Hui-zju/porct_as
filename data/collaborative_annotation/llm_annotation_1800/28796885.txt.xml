<TEXT>Photodynamic therapy is more effective than imiquimod for actinic keratosis in organ transplant recipients: a randomized intraindividual controlled trial.
BACKGROUND: Actinic keratoses (AKs) in solid organ transplant recipients (OTRs) are difficult-to-treat premalignancies and comparison of topical therapies is therefore warranted.
OBJECTIVES: In an intraindividual study to compare the efficacy and safety of field treatment with methyl aminolaevulinate photodynamic therapy (MAL-PDT) and imiquimod (IMIQ) for AKs in OTRs.
METHODS: OTRs (n = 35) with 572 AKs (grade I-III) in two similar areas on the face, scalp, dorsal hands or forearms were included.
All patients received one MAL-PDT and one IMIQ session (three applications per week for 4 weeks) in each study area according to randomization.
Treatments were repeated after 2 months (IMIQ) and 3 months (PDT) in skin with incomplete AK response.
Outcome measures were complete lesion response (CR), skin reactions, laboratory results and treatment preference.
RESULTS: The majority of study areas received two treatment sessions (PDT n = 25 patients; IMIQ n = 29 patients).
At 3 months after two treatments, skin treated with PDT achieved a higher rate of CR (AK I-III median 78%; range 50-100) compared with IMIQ-treated skin areas (median 61%, range 33-100; P &lt; 0.001).
Fewer emergent AKs were seen in PDT-treated skin vs. IMIQ-treated skin (0.7 vs. 1.5 AKs, P = 0.04).
Patients developed more intense inflammatory skin reactions following PDT, which resolved more rapidly compared with IMIQ (median 10 days vs. 18 days, P &lt; 0.01).
Patient preference (P = 0.47) and cosmesis (P &gt; 0.30) were similar for PDT and IMIQ.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with IMIQ, PDT treatment obtained a higher rate of AK clearance at 3-month follow-up and achieved shorter-lasting, but more intense, short-term skin reactions.</TEXT>
