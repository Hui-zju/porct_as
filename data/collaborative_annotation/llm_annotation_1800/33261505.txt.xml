<TEXT>Clinical study of a 125I particle-integrated esophageal covered stent and hyperbaric oxygen in the treatment of advanced esophageal cancer.
OBJECTIVE: this study aimed to investigate the clinical efficacy and feasibility of the treatment of advanced esophageal cancer with a combination of a 125I particle-integrated esophageal covered stent and hyperbaric oxygen.
METHODS: forty-five patients with advanced esophageal cancer were enrolled and were randomly divided into two groups: a treatment group and a control group.
Patients in the treatment group were treated with a 125I particle-integrated esophageal covered stent and hyperbaric oxygen, while patients in the control group were treated with a 125I particle-integrated esophageal covered stent.
The clinical effects and long-term survival time of the two groups were observed.
RESULTS: in the treatment group, the complete remission (CR) rate and partial remission (PR) rate of local lesions were 19.2 % and 61.5 %, respectively, and the total effective rate was 80.7 %.
In the control group, the CR rate and PR rate of local lesions were 10.5 % and 52.6 %, respectively, and the total effective rate was 63.1 %.
The total effective rate was higher in the treatment group than in the control group, which was statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05).
CONCLUSION: the combination of a 125I particle-integrated esophageal covered stent and hyperbaric oxygen shows a good short- and long-term efficacy in the treatment of advanced esophageal cancer.</TEXT>
