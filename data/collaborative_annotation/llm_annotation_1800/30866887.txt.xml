<TEXT>Improving cancer symptom awareness and help-seeking among adults living in socioeconomically deprived communities in the UK using a facilitated health check: A protocol for the Awareness and Beliefs About Cancer (ABACus) Randomised Control Trial.
BACKGROUND: Cancer survival is lower in socioeconomically deprived communities, partly due to low awareness of symptoms, negative beliefs and delayed help-seeking.
We developed an interactive health check questionnaire facilitated by trained lay advisors.
It entails 29 questions about background, lifestyle and health with tailored behaviour change advice.
Personalised results are printed using a traffic light (red/amber/green) system, highlighting areas where action should be taken.
This is an individually randomised control trial to test effectiveness of the health check on symptom recognition.
METHODS: A total 246 participants aged 40+ years will be recruited from community and healthcare settings in socioeconomically deprived areas of Yorkshire and South Wales.
Participants will be randomised to receive the health check or standard care (1:1 ratio).
Outcome measures include: adapted Awareness and Beliefs about Cancer (primary outcome), brief State Trait Anxiety Inventory, intentions and motivation to adopt recommended health behaviours (early symptom presentation, cancer screening and lifestyle behaviours), adapted Client Service Receipt Inventory, brief medical history/screening and demographic questionnaire at: baseline; 2-weeks; and 6-months post-randomisation.
A purposive sample of intervention sessions will be audio-recorded (n = 24) and half will additionally be observed (n = 12).
Semi-structured interviews will take place at 2-weeks (n = 30) and 6-months (n = 15-20) post-randomisation.
The primary analysis will compare cancer symptom recognition scores between arms at 2-weeks.
Secondary analysis will assess cancer beliefs, barriers/time to presentation, screening and lifestyle behaviours, anxiety and costs.
A process evaluation will assess intervention fidelity, dose and contamination.
The London-Surrey NHS Research Ethics Committee (Ref: 17/LO/1507) approved this trial.
DISCUSSION: This is a trial of a theoretically underpinned complex intervention which has undergone phase 1 and 2 development work.
The findings will evaluate evidence about the effect of the health check on symptom awareness.
Although there are few exclusion criteria there are limitations regarding the population we are able to reach, who may have even higher risks of late diagnosis and poor cancer prognosis.
However, the health check has the potential to improve cancer symptom awareness and encourage early help-seeking behaviour in deprived populations, thereby reducing inequalities in longer term cancer outcomes.
