<TEXT>Clinical observation and therapeutic evaluation of Rh-endostatin combined with DP regimen in treating patients with advanced esophageal cancer.
OBJECTIVE: To observe the curative effects of rh-endostatin combined with DP regimen in treating patients with advanced esophageal cancer and analyze the correlation of CT perfusion (CTP) parameters and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).
METHODS: Twenty patients with esophageal cancer confirmed pathologically were randomly divided into combined treatment (rh-endostatin+DP regimen) group and single chemotherapy group, 10 patients in each group, respectively.
All patients were given conventional CT examination and CTP imaging for primary tumor.
The level of VEGF, the size of tumor and CTP parameters (BF, BV, PS and MTT) before treatment and after 2 cycles of treatment were determined for the comparison and the correlation between CTP parameters and VEGF expression was analyzed.
RESULTS: the therapeutic effect of rh-endostatin+DP regimen group was superior to single chemotherapy group.
VEGF level after treatment in rh- endostatin +DP regimen group was obviously lower than single chemotherapy group (P&lt;0.01).
The expression of VEGF had positive correlation with BF and BV but negative correlation with MTT.
Compared with treatment before for rh-endostatin +DP regimen group, BF, BV and PS decreased while MTT increased after treatment (P&lt;0.05).
However, there were no significant differences between treatment before and after treatment in single chemotherapy (P&gt;0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Rh-endostatin can down-regulate the expression of VEGF in esophageal cancer, change the state of hypertransfusion and high permeability of tumor vessels and had the better curative effect and slighter adverse reactions when combined with chemotherapy.</TEXT>
