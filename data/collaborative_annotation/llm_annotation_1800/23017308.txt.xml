<TEXT>Fish oil supplementation is beneficial on caloric intake, appetite and mid upper arm muscle circumference in children with leukaemia.
A randomised trial was carried out to determine the effect of supplementation of fish oil among 51 children with leukaemia aged 4 to 12 years on appetite level, caloric intake, body weight and lean body mass.
They were randomly allocated into the trial group (TG) and the control group (CG).
At baseline, 30.8% of TG subjects and 44.0% of CG subjects were malnourished and 7.7% of subject from TG and 28.0% from CG were classified as stunted.
The majority of subjects from TG and CG were in the mild malnutrition category for mid upper arm muscle circumference (MUAMC)-for-age.
The TG group showed significant increment in MUAMC (0.13 cm vs -0.09 cm) compared with CG at 8 weeks (p&lt;0.001).
There was a significant higher increase for appetite level (0.12+/-0.33) (p&lt;0.05) and an increasing trend on energy and protein intake in the TG group (213+/-554 kcal; 3.64 +/-26.8 g) than in the CG group.
In conclusion, supplementation of fish oil has a positive effect on appetite level, caloric intake and MUAMC among children with leukaemia.</TEXT>
