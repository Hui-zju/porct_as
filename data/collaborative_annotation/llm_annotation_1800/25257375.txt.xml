<TEXT>High plasma ghrelin protects from coronary heart disease and Leu72Leu polymorphism of ghrelin gene from cancer in healthy adults during the 19 years follow-up study.
The aim of our investigation was to find out if ghrelin concentrations or polymorphisms predict the future risk for cardiovascular diseases and cancer in a population-based cohort initiated in 1991 (491 hypertensive and 513 control subjects).
Total mortality and hospital events were followed up for 19 years.
Fasting total ghrelin concentrations were determined and Arg51Gln, Leu72Met and -501 A &gt; C polymorphisms identified.
Cox regression analysis was performed.
The mean value in the control cohort was 674 pg/ml whereas in the hypertensive cohort it was 661 pg/ml.
The associations found suggest that in the controls the highest ghrelin quartile protected from CHD (coronary heart disease).
The results were significant without or with adjustments for age, sex, smoking, systolic blood pressure and LDL cholesterol, BMI, type 2 diabetes or QUICK index.
C/C variant of the promoter associated with the prevention of IHD (ischemic heart disease) in the hypertensive group (p&lt;0.05).
The controls with the Leu72Leu genotype had less cancer (p&lt;0.05).
In conclusion, high plasma ghrelin concentration was related to protection from CHD and Leu72Leu genotype to prevention of cancer in healthy adults during the 19 years follow-up.
C/C promoter protects from IHD in the hypertensive subjects.</TEXT>
