<TEXT>Oral supplementation of branched-chain amino acids reduces early recurrence after hepatic resection in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma: a prospective study.
PURPOSES: The long-term outcomes of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) administration after hepatic resection in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unclear.
This study assessed the effect of oral supplementation with BCAA on the development of liver tumorigenesis after hepatic resection in HCC patients.
METHODS: Fifty-six patients were randomly assigned to receive either BCAA supplementation (Livact group, n = 26) or a conventional diet (Control group, n = 30).
Twenty-six patients in the BCAA group were treated orally for 2 weeks before and 6 months after hepatic resection.
Postoperative tumor recurrence was continuously evaluated in all patients by measuring various clinical parameters.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the overall survival rate between the two patient groups; however, the recurrence rate at 30 months after surgery was significantly better in the Livact group in comparison to the Control group.
Interestingly, the tumor markers, such as AFP and PIVKA-II, significantly decreased at 36 months after liver resection in the Livact group in comparison to the Control group.
CONCLUSIONS: Oral supplementation of BCAA reduces early recurrence after hepatic resection in patients with HCC.
This treatment regimen offers potential benefits for clinical use in such patients, even in cases with a well-preserved preoperative liver function.</TEXT>
