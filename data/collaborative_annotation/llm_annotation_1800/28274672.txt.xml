<TEXT>The role of screening expectations in modifying short-term psychological responses to low-dose computed tomography lung cancer screening among high-risk individuals.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the relationship between pre-screening expectations and psychological responses to low-dose computerised tomography (LDCT) screening among high-risk individuals in the United Kingdom Lung Cancer Screening (UKLS) pilot trial.
METHODS: Prior to screening, high-risk individuals randomised into the intervention arm of the UKLS were asked about their expected screening test result.
Their actual LDCT scan result was compared with their baseline screening expectation to determine the level of congruence.
Levels of concern about and perceived accuracy of the result were assessed in a questionnaire two weeks following receipt of their test result.
RESULTS: The sample included 1589 participants.
Regardless of their expected results, patients who required follow-up investigations after their initial LDCT scan were the most concerned about their result (p&lt;0.001).
Participants who expected to require follow-up, but did not need it, perceived the test to be least accurate (p=0.006).
CONCLUSIONS: Lung cancer screening participants who require follow-up or who have unexpected negative results can be identified for supportive interventions.
PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: These findings can be used to ensure that any future LDCT lung cancer screening programme is tailored to identify and support those high-risk individuals who may benefit from additional help.</TEXT>
