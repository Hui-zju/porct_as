<TEXT>[Efficacy and safety of anlotinib in 16 patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer].
Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of anlotinib in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
Methods: Patients with stage B/ NSCLC who progressed after two lines or more regimens were randomized into anlotinib group (12 mg daily from day 1 to 14 of a 21-day cycle) or placebo group with ratio of 2ratio1.
Study drugs or placebo were given until disease progression or intolerable toxicity.
The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), and the second endpoints were progression free survival (PFS), objective response rate, and disease control rate.
Results: Between April 2015 and December 2015, twenty-four patients were assigned at Peking Union Medical College Hospital.
The baseline characteristics of the anlotinib group (n=16) and placebo group (n=8) were fairly comparable.
The median OS was 12.7 months in anlotinib group and 11.1 months in placebo group (P=0.460).The median PFS was 4.0 months in anlotinib group and 1.4 months in placebo group (P=0.065).The common adverse events were manageable such as hypertension, hand-foot syndrome, thyroiddy sfunction.
No drug-related mortality occurred.
Conclusions: Anlotinib had a trend of improvement in OS and PFS as third-line treatment or beyond in advanced NSCLC compared with placebo with manageable toxicity.
