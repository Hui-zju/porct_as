<TEXT>Treatment of mid-late stage NSCLC using sodium cantharidinate/vitamin B6/GP regimen in clinic.
OBJECTIVE: The present study observed the clinical outcomes of the sodium cantharidinate/vitamin B6/GP regimen in the treatment of middle-late stage Non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-six cases of NSCLC were selected and randomized into two groups.
Forty-five cases in the treatment group were subject to 30 ml cantharidinate/vitamin B6+ GP regimen, for four 21-day cycles.
Forty-one cases in the control group were subject to regular GP regimen, for four 21-day cycles.
RESULTS: The effectiveness rate was 57.8% in the treatment group and 36.6% in the control group, suggesting statistical difference (P &lt; 0.05); life quality in the treatment group was significantly better than that in the control group (P &lt; 0.05); the occurrence rate of the toxic/adverse effects were significantly lower in the treatment group compared with that in the control group (P &lt; 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Sodium cantharidinate/vitamin B6/GP regimen had fair effectiveness and synergistically improved the clinical outcomes.
It lowered the toxic/adverse effects and its application is worth further investigation and promotion.</TEXT>
