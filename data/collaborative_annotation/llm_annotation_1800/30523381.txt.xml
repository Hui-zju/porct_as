<TEXT>Randomized phase II trial of the prophylactic use of celecoxib for the prevention of oxaliplatin-related peripheral vascular pain in Capeox (YCOG1205).
PURPOSE: Capeox is widely used as an adjuvant chemotherapy regimen of colorectal cancer that does not require central vein catheter insertion.
However, oxaliplatin-related vascular pain with peripheral administration is a major adverse event.
We assessed the preventive effect of Celecoxib on oxaliplatin-related vascular pain.
METHODS: A multicenter study of the Yokohama Clinical Oncology Group (YCOG) in Japan.
This study was an open label, randomized non-comparative phase II study between Capeox without Celecoxib (C+ Group) and with it (C- group).
The primary endpoint was the appearance frequency of grade &gt;/= 2 vascular pain according to the Verbal Rating Scale (VRS).
RESULTS: Between October 2012 and February 2014, 81 patients were recruited to this study and randomly divided into 2 groups: 38 patients in the C- group and 39 patients in the C+ group.
Four cases were excluded at the analysis stage because they had not received the allocated intervention.
The rate of grade &gt;/= 2 vascular pain was 55.3% in the C- group and 53.8% in the C+ group (p = 1.000).
CONCLUSIONS: Celecoxib was unable to prevent oxaliplatin-related vascular pain in this study.
However, it may be able to decrease the vascular pain that patients already have.</TEXT>
