<TEXT>How Exercise Can Influence Oxidative Stress and Glucose Levels after Pancreatic Resection: A Randomised Controlled Trial.
BACKGROUND: One of the most challenging operations is the resection of the pancreas, which is associated with high morbidity.
Metabolic control during the perioperative period remains an issue that is sometimes difficult to manage.
OBJECTIVES: Exercise has a positive effect on glycaemic control.
The objective of this trial was determining whether exercise has any benefit for oxidative stress and glucose levels.
METHOD: The study was an open-label, randomised clinical trial.
It has been registered in the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial registry.
The patients were selected according to the Consolidated Standard of Reporting Trials criteria.
RESULTS: In total, 56 patients were assessed for eligibility.
There was no statistical difference between the 2 groups (the exercise and the control one) regarding the disease characteristics, morbidity or influence of exercise on oxidative stress; however, the control of glucose was superior in the exercise group.
CONCLUSIONS: Exercise has a positive effect on glycaemic control in patients after pancreatic resection.</TEXT>
