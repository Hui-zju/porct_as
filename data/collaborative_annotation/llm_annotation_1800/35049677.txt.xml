<TEXT>Prospective Randomized Phase II Study of Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) vs. Conventional Fractionated Radiotherapy (CFRT) for Chinese Patients with Early-Stage Localized Prostate Cancer.
BACKGROUND: Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) has potential radiobiologic and economic advantages over conventional fractionated radiotherapy (CFRT) in localized prostate cancer (PC).
This study aimed to compare the effects of these two distinct fractionations on patient-reported quality of life (PRQOL) and tolerability.
METHODS: In this prospective phase II study, patients with low- and intermediate-risk localized PC were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the SBRT (36.25 Gy/5 fractions/2 weeks) or CFRT (76 Gy/38 fractions/7.5 weeks) treatment groups.
The primary endpoint of variation in PRQOL at 1 year was assessed by changes in the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) questionnaire scores and analysed by z-tests and t-tests.
RESULTS: Sixty-four eligible Chinese men were treated (SBRT, n = 31; CFRT, n = 33) with a median follow-up of 2.3 years.
At 1 year, 40.0%/46.9% of SBRT/CFRT patients had a &gt;5-point decrease in bowel score (p = 0.08/0.28), respectively, and 53.3%/46.9% had a &gt;2-point decrease in urinary score (p = 0.21/0.07).
There were no significant differences in EPIC score changes between the arms at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months, but SBRT was associated with significantly fewer grade &gt;/= 1 acute and 1-year late gastrointestinal toxicities (acute: 35% vs. 87%, p &lt; 0.0001; 1-year late: 64% vs. 84%, p = 0.03), and grade &gt;/= 2 acute genitourinary toxicities (3% vs. 24%, p = 0.04) compared with CFRT.
CONCLUSION: SBRT offered similar PRQOL and less toxicity compared with CFRT in Chinese men with localized PC.</TEXT>
