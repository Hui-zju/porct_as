<TEXT>Disseminated lymphoblastic lymphoma in children and adolescents: results of the COG A5971 trial: a report from the Children's Oncology Group.
The Children's Oncology Group's A5971 trial examined central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis and early intensification in paediatric patients diagnosed with CNS-negative Stage III and IV lymphoblastic lymphoma.
Using a 2 x 2 factorial design, the study randomized patients to Children's Cancer Group (CCG) modified Berlin-Frankfurt-Muenster (BFM) acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) regimen with intensified intrathecal (IT) methotrexate (MTX) (Arm A1) or an adapted non-Hodgkin lymphoma/BFM-95 therapy with high dose MTX in interim maintenance but no IT-MTX in maintenance (Arm B1).
Each cohort was randomized +/-
intensification (cyclophosphamide/anthracycline) (Arms A2/B2).
For the 254 randomized patients, there was no difference in 5-year event-free survival (EFS) for the four arms: Arm A1, 80% [95% confidence interval (CI) 67-89%] and Arm A2, 81% (95% CI 69-89%); Arm B1, 80% (95% CI 68-88%) and Arm B2, 84% (95% CI 72-91%).
The cumulative incidence of CNS relapse was 1.2%.
Age &lt;10 years and institutional imaging response at 2 weeks was associated with improved outcomes (P &lt; 0.001 and P = 0.014 for overall survival).
CNS positive patients (n = 12) did poorly [5-year EFS of 63% (95% CI 29-85%)].
For CNS-negative patients, there was no difference in outcome based on CNS prophylaxis (IT-MTX versus HD-MTX) or with intensification.</TEXT>
