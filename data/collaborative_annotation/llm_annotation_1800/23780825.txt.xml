<TEXT>Urinary incontinence and prostate cancer: a progressive rehabilitation program design.
PURPOSE: To design and implement a rehabilitation program based on pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) to improve the urinary incontinence (UI).
METHODS: This study is based on a randomized clinical trial.
The sample was formed by 66 participants with prostate cancer.
The intervention groups were randomized into an experimental group (EG) and a control group (CG).
The variables studied are: waist perimeter, variables related to the evolution of UI, muscular strength, and quality of life (QoL).
Measurements were taken in order to evaluate changes in both groups.
A statistical analysis was conducted using the Student-Fisher t-test, the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test, and the chi-square test.
FINDINGS/CONCLUSIONS: After 24 weeks an improvement was identified in the EG compared with the CG, in waist perimeter (p&lt;/=.001), variables related to the UI symptom, intensity, frequency, difficulty and limitation of activity (p&lt;/=.0001).
A correlation between UI and QoL was observed (p=.039).
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The improvement in QoL is mediated indirectly by the improvement in the UI symptom.</TEXT>
