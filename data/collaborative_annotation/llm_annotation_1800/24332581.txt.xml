<TEXT>Comparison of mammographic findings after intraoperative radiotherapy or external beam whole breast radiotherapy.
BACKGROUND: The TARGIT (TARGeted Intraoperative Radiotherapy) trial was designed to compare local recurrence and complication rates in breast cancer patients, prospectively randomised to either EBRT (external beam whole breast radiotherapy) or a single dose of IORT (intraoperative radiotherapy).
The aim of our study was to compare follow-up mammographic findings, ultrasound and biopsy rates in each group.
METHODS: Follow-up imaging and breast biopsies of women from one centre participating in the TARGIT-A trial were independently reviewed by two radiologists blinded to the radiotherapy treatment received.
RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 141 patients (EBRT n = 80/IORT n = 61).
There was no significant difference in the patient or disease characteristics of the two groups.
The number of follow-up mammograms and length of follow-up was similar (EBRT/IORT n = 2.0/2.4; 4.3yr/5.1yr; p = 0.386 chi(2) test).
There were no significant differences in mammographic scar or calcification appearances of the post-operative site.
Generalised increase in breast density and skin thickening were more common in the EBRT compared to the IORT group (p = 0.002; p = 0.030, chi(2) test respectively).
A trend towards additional ultrasound at follow-up was observed in the IORT group (15 of 61 [24.6%] versus 11 of 80 [13.8%]), however this was not statistically significant (p = 0.100 chi(2) test).
No disease recurrence was demonstrated on any of the breast biopsies taken.
Only one biopsy was reported as fat necrosis in the IORT group.
CONCLUSIONS: Mammographic changes were more common following EBRT, although more additional follow-up ultrasounds were performed in the IORT group.
IORT is not detrimental to subsequent radiological follow up.</TEXT>
