<TEXT>A hospital-based work support intervention to enhance the return to work of cancer patients: a process evaluation.
PURPOSE: To perform a process evaluation of a hospital-based work support intervention for cancer patients aimed at enhancing return to work and quality of life.
The intervention involves the delivery of patient education and support at the hospital and involves the improvement of the communication between the treating physician and the occupational physician.
In addition, the research team asked patient's occupational physician to organise a meeting with the patient and the supervisor to make a concrete gradual return-to-work plan.
METHODS: Eligible were cancer patients treated with curative intent and who have paid work.
Data were collected from patients assigned to the intervention group (N = 65) and from nurses who delivered the patient education and support at the hospital (N = 4) by means of questionnaires, nurses' reports, and checklists.
Data were quantitatively and qualitatively analysed.
RESULTS: A total of 47 % of all eligible patients participated.
Nurses delivered the patient education and support in 85 % of the cases according to the protocol.
In 100 % of the cases at least one letter was sent to the occupational physician.
In 10 % of the cases the meeting with the patient, the occupational physician and the supervisor took place.
Patients found the intervention in general very useful and nurses found the intervention feasible to deliver.
CONCLUSIONS: We found that a hospital- based work support intervention was easily accepted in usual psycho-oncological care but that it proved difficult to involve the occupational physician.
Patients were highly satisfied and nurses found the intervention feasible.</TEXT>
