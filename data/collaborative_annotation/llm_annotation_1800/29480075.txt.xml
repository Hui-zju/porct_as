<TEXT>Dietary Factors Associated with Pancreatic Cancer Risk in Minia, Egypt: Principal Component Analysis
Background: Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a serious and rapidly progressing malignancy.
Identifying risk factors including dietary elements is important to develop preventive strategies.
This study focused on possible links between diet and PC.
Methods: We conducted a case-control study including all PC patients diagnosed at Minia Cancer Center and controls from general population from June 2014 to December 2015.
Dietary data were collected directly through personal interviews.
Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to identify dietary groups.
The data were analyzed using crude odds ratios (ORs) and multivariable logistic regression with adjusted ORs and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
Results: A total of 75 cases and 149 controls were included in the study.
PCA identified six dietary groups, labeled as cereals and grains, vegetables, proteins, dairy products, fruits, and sugars.
Bivariate analysis showed that consumption of vegetables, fruits, sugars, and total energy intake were associated with change in PC risk.
In multivariable-adjusted models comparing highest versus lowest levels of intake, we observed significant lower odds of PC in association with vegetable intake (OR 0.24; 95% CI, 0.07-0.85, P=0.012) and a higher likelihood with the total energy intake (OR 9.88; 95% CI, 2.56-38.09, P&lt;0.0001).
There was also a suggested link between high fruit consumption and reduced odds of PC.
Conclusions: The study supports the association between dietary factors and the odds of PC development in Egypt.
It was found that higher energy intake is associated with an increase in likelihood of PC, while increased vegetable consumption is associated with a lower odds ratio.</TEXT>
