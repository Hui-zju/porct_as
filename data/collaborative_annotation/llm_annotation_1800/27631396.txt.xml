<TEXT>Exercise Intervention in Pediatric Patients with Solid Tumors: The Physical Activity in Pediatric Cancer Trial.
INTRODUCTION: The randomized controlled trial "Physical Activity in Pediatric Cancer" determined the effects of an inhospital exercise intervention combining aerobic and muscle strength training on pediatric cancer patients with solid tumors undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
METHODS: Participants were allocated to an exercise (n = 24, 17 boys; mean +/- SEM age, 10 +/- 1 yr) or control group (n = 25, 18 boys; 11 +/- 1 yr).
Training included three sessions per week for 19 +/- 2 wk.
Participants were assessed at treatment initiation, termination, and 2 months after end treatment.
The primary endpoint was muscle strength (as assessed by upper and lower-body five-repetition-maximum tests).
Secondary endpoints included cardiorespiratory fitness, functional capacity during daily life activities, physical activity, body mass and body mass index, and quality of life.
RESULTS: Most sessions were performed in the hospital's gymnasium.
Adherence to the program averaged 68% +/- 4% and no major adverse events or health issues were noted.
A significant interaction (group-time) effect was found for all five-repetition maximum tests (leg/bench press and lateral row; all P &lt; 0.001).
Performance significantly increased after training (leg press: 40% [95% confidence interval [CI], 15-41 kg); bench press: 24% [95% CI, 6-14 kg]; lateral row 25% [95% CI, 6-15 kg]), whereas an opposite trend was found in controls.
Two-month post values tended to be higher than baseline for leg (P = 0.017) and bench press (P = 0.014).
In contrast, no significant interaction effect was found for any of the secondary endpoints.
CONCLUSION: An inhospital exercise program for pediatric cancer patients with solid tumors undergoing neoadjuvant treatment increases muscle strength despite the aggressiveness of such therapy.</TEXT>
