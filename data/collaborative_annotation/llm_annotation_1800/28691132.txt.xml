<TEXT>Randomized phase II placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy of topical pure emu oil for joint pain related to adjuvant aromatase inhibitor use in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer: JUST (Joints Under Study).
PURPOSE: Aromatase inhibitors are standard of care in women with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer.
Published evidence demonstrates that adverse effects may have an impact on drug compliance, with arthralgias being one of the most commonly reported adverse effects.
METHODS: Eligible patients were postmenopausal women who had experienced arthralgia following initiation of an aromatase inhibitor.
Patients who experienced arthralgias following a minimum of a 3-month treatment on the aromatase inhibitor were randomized to emu oil or placebo oil.
The primary endpoint was to assess for a reduction in pain as measured by a visual analogue score after 8 weeks of treatment.
RESULTS: Seventy-three patients comprised the intent-to-treat population, and there was no statistically significant benefit with use of EO.
However, there was a statistically significant improvement in pain (visual analogue score was -1.28; p &lt; 0.001) and Brief Pain Inventory severity score -0.88 (p &lt; 0.001), as well as functional interference (Brief Pain Inventory interference -1.10 (p &lt; 0.001) for the entire population following an 8-week administration of EO or placebo oil.
CONCLUSIONS: Arthralgias, as a result of aromatase inhibitor use, may be ameliorated by the use of topical oil massaged onto the joint.
Further research into interventions for this common side effect is needed.</TEXT>
