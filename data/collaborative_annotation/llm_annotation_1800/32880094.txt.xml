<TEXT>Effectiveness of a Tailored Work-Related Support Intervention for Patients Diagnosed with Gastrointestinal Cancer: A Multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial.
Purpose The aim of this research was to study the effectiveness on return to work (RTW) of an early tailored work-related support intervention in patients diagnosed with curative gastrointestinal cancer.
Methods A multicenter randomized controlled trial was undertaken, in which patients were assigned randomly to the intervention or the control group (usual care).
The intervention encompassed three psychosocial work-related support meetings, starting before treatment.
Five self-reported questionnaires were sent over twelve months of follow-up.
Primary outcome was days until RTW (fulltime or partial) and secondary outcomes included work status, quality of life, work ability, and work limitations.
Descriptive analysis, Kaplan-Meier analysis, relative risk ratio and linear mixed models were applied.
Results Participants (N = 88) had a mean age of 55 years; 67% were male and the most common cancer type was colon cancer (66%).
Of the participants, 42 were randomized to the intervention group.
The median time from sick leave until RTW was 233 days (range 187-279 days) for the control group, versus 190 days (range 139-240 days) for the intervention group (log-rank p = 0.37).
The RTW rate at twelve months after baseline was 83.3% for the intervention group and 73.5% for the control group.
Work limitations did statistically differ between the groups over time (p = 0.01), but quality of life and work ability did not.
Conclusion Patients in the intervention group seem to take fewer days to RTW, albeit not to a statistically significant extent.
