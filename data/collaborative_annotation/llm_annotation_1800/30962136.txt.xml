<TEXT>Laparoscopic versus open liver resection in the posterosuperior segments: a sub-group analysis from the OSLO-COMET randomized controlled trial.
BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic liver resection in the posterosuperior segments is technically challenging.
This study aimed to compare the perioperative outcomes for laparoscopic and open resection of colorectal liver metastases located in the posterosuperior segments.
METHODS: This was a subgroup analysis of the OSLO-COMET randomized controlled trial, where 280 patients were randomly assigned to open or laparoscopic parenchyma-sparing liver resections of colorectal metastases.
Patients with tumors in the posterosuperior segments were identified, and perioperative outcomes and health related quality of life (HRQoL) were compared.
RESULTS: We identified a total of 136 patients, 62 in the laparoscopic and 74 in the open group.
The postoperative complication rate was 26% in the laparoscopic and 31% in the open group.
The blood loss was less in the open group (500 vs. 250 ml, P = 0.006), but the perioperative transfusion rate was similar.
The operative time was similar, while postoperative hospital stay was shorter in the laparoscopic group (2 vs. 4 days, P &lt; 0.001).
HRQoL was significantly better after laparoscopy at 1 month.
CONCLUSION: In patients undergoing laparoscopic or open liver resection of colorectal liver metastases in the posterosuperior segments, laparoscopic surgery was associated with shorter hospital stay and comparable perioperative outcomes.</TEXT>
