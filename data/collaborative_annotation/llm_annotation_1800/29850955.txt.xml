<TEXT>1 Versus 2-cm Excision Margins for pT2-pT4 Primary Cutaneous Melanoma (MelMarT): A Feasibility Study.
BACKGROUND: There is a lack of consensus regarding optimal surgical excision margins for primary cutaneous melanoma &gt; 1 mm in Breslow thickness (BT).
A narrower surgical margin is expected to be associated with lower morbidity, improved quality of life (QoL), and reduced cost.
We report the results of a pilot international study (MelMarT) comparing a 1 versus 2-cm surgical margin for patients with primary melanoma &gt; 1 mm in BT.
METHODS: This phase III, multicentre trial [NCT02385214] administered by the Australia &amp; New Zealand Medical Trials Group (ANZMTG 03.12) randomised patients with a primary cutaneous melanoma &gt; 1 mm in BT to a 1 versus 2-cm wide excision margin to be performed with sentinel lymph node biopsy.
Surgical closure technique was at the discretion of the treating surgeon.
Patients' QoL was measured (FACT-M questionnaire) at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months after randomisation.
RESULTS: Between January 2015 and June 2016, 400 patients were randomised from 17 centres in 5 countries.
A total of 377 patients were available for analysis.
Primary melanomas were located on the trunk (56.9%), extremities (35.6%), and head and neck (7.4%).
More patients in the 2-cm margin group required reconstruction (34.9 vs. 13.6%; p &lt; 0.0001).
There was an increased wound necrosis rate in the 2-cm arm (0.5 vs. 3.6%; p = 0.036).
After 12 months' follow-up, no differences were noted in QoL between groups.
DISCUSSION: This pilot study demonstrates the feasibility of a large international RCT to provide a definitive answer to the optimal excision margin for patients with intermediate- to high-risk primary cutaneous melanoma.</TEXT>
