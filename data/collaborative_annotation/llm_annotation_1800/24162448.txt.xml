<TEXT>A randomized controlled trial of diet and physical activity in BRCA mutation carriers.
High serum levels of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) are associated with an increased risk of sporadic breast cancer (BC).
Furthermore, insulin and markers of insulin resistance, such as abdominal obesity, high blood glucose, high serum testosterone and metabolic syndrome, may affect both BC incidence and prognosis.
We hypothesized that all these factors might be relevant also for hereditary BC, due to a deleterious mutation of BRCA genes.
Epidemiological observation suggested that weight, energy intake (usually associated with higher bio-availability of growth factors) and physical activity may be relevant in BRCA mutation carriers.
Mechanistic studies hypothesized a functional interaction between BRCA genes and the IGF-I system.
We have provided some evidence that high serum levels of IGF-I are associated with a significantly increased penetrance.
We are recruiting a larger cohort of BRCA mutation carriers in order to test potential modulators of penetrance and prognosis.
Within this cohort, we have planned a randomized controlled trial to test whether moderate calorie and protein restriction, together with physical activity, decrease IGF-I. Eligible study subjects are women with or without BC, aged 18-70, with a proven deleterious BRCA mutation, and without metastases.
All the women will receive recommendations for the dietary prevention of cancer.
The women will be then randomized into an active life-style intervention group and into a control group that will receive only the baseline recommendations.
We expect to significantly reduce IGF-I in the intervention group.
This trial and the subsequent cohort follow-up might open up primary prevention options for genetic BC.</TEXT>
