<TEXT>Elotuzumab, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone in RRMM: final overall survival results from the phase 3 randomized ELOQUENT-2 study.
Prolonging overall survival (OS) remains an unmet need in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM).
In ELOQUENT-2 (NCT01239797), elotuzumab plus lenalidomide/dexamethasone (ERd) significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) versus lenalidomide/dexamethasone (Rd) in patients with RRMM and 1-3 prior lines of therapy (LoTs).
We report results from the pre-planned final OS analysis after a minimum follow-up of 70.6 months, the longest reported for an antibody-based triplet in RRMM.
Overall, 646 patients with RRMM and 1-3 prior LoTs were randomized 1:1 to ERd or Rd.
PFS and overall response rate were co-primary endpoints.
OS was a key secondary endpoint, with the final analysis planned after 427 deaths.
ERd demonstrated a statistically significant 8.7-month improvement in OS versus Rd (median, 48.3 vs 39.6 months; hazard ratio, 0.82 [95.4% Cl, 0.68-1.00]; P = 0.0408 [less than allotted alpha of 0.046]), which was consistently observed across key predefined subgroups.
No additional safety signals with ERd at extended follow-up were reported.
ERd is the first antibody-based triplet regimen shown to significantly prolong OS in patients with RRMM and 1-3 prior LoTs.
The magnitude of OS benefit was greatest among patients with adverse prognostic factors, including older age, ISS stage III, IMWG high-risk disease, and 2-3 prior LoTs.</TEXT>
