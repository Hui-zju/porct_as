<TEXT>MTHFR c.677C&gt;T Inhibits Cell Proliferation and Decreases Prostate Cancer Susceptibility in the Han Chinese Population in Shanghai.
Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) c.677C&gt;T and c.1298A&gt;C variants were known to be associated with prostate cancer (PCa) risk with conflicting results, because of MTHFR and nutrient status interaction in the prostate development.
In this large-scale, hospital-based, case-control study of 1817 PCa cases and 2026 cancer-free controls, we aimed to clarify the association between these two MTHFR variants and PCa risk in Shanghai and to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms.
We found that both the heterozygous CT (adjusted OR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.67-0.92) and the homozygous TT genotypes (adjusted OR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.55-0.83) of c.677C&gt;T were associated with a significantly decreased risk of PCa compared with homozygous wild-type CC genotype, respectively, using multivariate logistic regression.
Furthermore, we confirmed that MTHFR c.677T allele was related to an increased serum homocysteine level in the Han Chinese population in Shanghai.
In the cultured PCa cell lines, we observed that MTHFR c.677T could elevate the cellular homocysteine level and cause DNA damage, thus increasing cell apoptosis and finally inhibiting cell proliferation.
In conclusion, MTHFR c.677T was a protective factor of PCa risk in ethnic Han Chinese males by inducing DNA damage and cell apoptosis.</TEXT>
