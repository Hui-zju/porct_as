<TEXT>Feasibility and safety of early chest tube removal after complete video-assisted thoracic lobectomy.
OBJECTIVE: The aim was to evaluate the feasibility and safety of early chest tube removal after complete video-assisted thoracic lobectomy (CVATL).
METHODS: Retrospective analysis was performed on effects of chest tube removal on patients with lung cancer after pulmonary lobectomy between November 2013 and October 2014.
154 eligible patients included 97 cases for CVATL and 57 cases for open thoracic lobectomy.
Patients with CVATL were divided randomly into experimental group (EG) and control group (CG), in which 51 patients in EG had chest tube removal on the 2 nd day after operation; 46 patients in CG had the tube removal when the drainage volume &lt;100 ml/day.
Patients in open thoracic lobectomy group (OG) had the tubes removal as CG.
The drainage volumes of the 1 st and 2 nd 24 h after operation, duration of chest tubes, cases of pain alleviation, and recurrent pleural effusions requiring reintervention were measured.
RESULTS: The average drainage volume of the 1 st 24 h after operation of CVATL group from EG and CG was significantly reduced than that in OG (260.41 ml vs. 353.16 ml, P &lt; 0.001).
The average drainage volume of the 2 nd 24 h after operation of CG was significantly reduced than that in OG (163.91 ml vs. 222.98 ml, P &lt; 0.001).
The average duration of chest tube of CG for 2.98 days showed significant different compared with OG for 3.81 days (P &lt; 0.001).
Chest tube removal in CVATL group increased more chest pain alleviation than OG (80.4% vs. 56.1%, P = 0.001).
The frequencies of recurrent pleural effusions requiring reintervention were 5.88% (3/51), 4.35% (2/46) and 5.26% (3/57), respectively, which had no significant differences between three groups (P = 1.000).
CONCLUSIONS: Complete video-assisted thoracic lobectomy brings less drainage volume after operation.
Early removal of chest tube in CVATL shows feasible and safe and demonstrates that it may reduce postoperative pain and help fast recovery.</TEXT>
