<TEXT>Aromatherapy Plus Music Therapy Improve Pain Intensity and Anxiety Scores in Patients With Breast Cancer During Perioperative Periods: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
INTRODUCTION: To investigate the effect of perioperative aromatherapy (AT) or/plus music therapy (MT) on pain and anxiety level, and the potential mechanism in women experiencing breast cancer surgery.
METHODS: A total of 160 patients with breast cancer were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive usual care (UC), AT, MT, or combination therapy (CT) during perioperative periods.
Pain intensity and anxiety scores were measured by visual analog scale.
Interleukin (IL)-6 and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB-1) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
RESULTS: There was a significant group effect on pain, anxiety, and IL-6 and HMGB-1 levels, with the greatest improvement occurring in the CT group (P &lt; .001).
Compared with the UC group, the AT and MT groups had lower mean changes of pain intensity and IL-6 and HMGB-1 levels, and greater anxiety reduction (P &lt; .001).
However, the differences between the AT and MT groups did not reach significance (P &gt; .05).
CONCLUSION: In patients with breast cancer, perioperative CT achieves greater pain improvement and anxiety reduction and less marked increase in IL-6 and HMGB-1 levels.
These results suggest that CT is an acceptable complementary and alternative medicine for breast cancer patients.</TEXT>
