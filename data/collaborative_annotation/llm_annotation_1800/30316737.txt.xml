<TEXT>Comparison of the Effect of Intermittent and Continuous Aerobic Physical Training on Sexual Function of Women With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome: Randomized Controlled Trial.
BACKGROUND: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common condition characterized by hyperandrogenism, anthropometric changes (increased weight and waist-to-hip ratio [WHR]), behavioral changes (sexual dysfunction, anxiety, and depression), and reduced quality of life.
Physical exercise may reduce many of the adverse effects of PCOS.
However, no studies have yet evaluated the effects of aerobic exercise on the sexual function of women with PCOS.
AIM: To compare the effects of continuous and intermittent aerobic physical training on the sexual function and mood of women with PCOS.
METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of a controlled clinical trial in which women with PCOS (18-39 years of age) were randomly allocated to 1 of 3 groups for 16 weeks: continuous aerobic training (CAT, n = 23), intermittent aerobic training (IAT, n = 22), or no training (control group, n = 24).
The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) was used to assess sexual function, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to assess anxiety and depression.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The main outcome measure used was the FSFI.
OUTCOMES: The primary outcomes were changes from baseline in total FSFI score and HAD scores at week 16 to prove the superiority of intermittent aerobic exercise compared with continuous aerobic exercise.
RESULTS: After 16 weeks, the CAT group had a significant increase in the total FSFI score, improvements in the FSFI domains of satisfaction and pain, and a reduction in the WHR.
The CAT and IAT groups also had significantly lower levels of testosterone after 16 weeks.
The IAT group had a significant increase in the total FSFI score and improvements in the desire, excitation, lubrication, orgasm, and satisfaction FSFI domains.
The CAT and IAT groups both had significant reductions in anxiety and depression scores after 16 weeks.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Aerobic physical training protocols could be indicated to promote mental and sexual health in women with PCOS.
STRENGTH &amp; LIMITATIONS: This is one of the first studies to examine the effects of different physical training protocols on the sexual function of women with PCOS.
The limitations of this study are that we did not consider diet or the frequency of sexual relations of participants with their partners.
These factors could have interfered with the outcomes.
CONCLUSION: The CAT and IAT protocols improved the sexual function and reduced the anxiety and depression of women with PCOS.
Both protocols were similar to improve FSFI domain scores.
