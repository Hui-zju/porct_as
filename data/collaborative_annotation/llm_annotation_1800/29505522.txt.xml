<TEXT>The effects of one-lung ventilation mode on lung function in elderly patients undergoing esophageal cancer surgery.
The objective of the present study was to explore the effects of different one-lung ventilation (OLV) modes on lung function in elderly patients undergoing esophageal cancer surgery.
A total of 180 consecutive elderly patients (ASA Grades I-II, with OLV indications) undergoing elective surgery were recruited in the study.
Patients were randomly divided into 4 groups (n = 45).
In Group A, patients received low tidal volume (VT &lt; 8 mL/kg) + pressure controlled ventilation (PCV), low tidal volume (VT &lt; 8 mL/kg) + volume-controlled ventilation (VCV) in Group B, high tidal volume (VT &gt;/= 8 mL/kg) + PCV in Group C and high tidal volume (VT &gt;/= 8 mL/kg) + VCV in Group D. Two-lung ventilation involved routine tidal volume (8-10 mL/kg) at a frequency of 12 to 18 times/min, and VCV mode.
Clinical efficacy among 4 groups was compared.
The partial pressure of end-tidal carbon dioxide (PetCO2) did not significantly differ among 4 groups (all P &gt; .05), and the oxygenation index and SO2 in Group A were significantly higher than in the other groups (P &lt; .05).
The PetCO2, peak airway pressure (Ppeak), platform airway pressure (Pplat), and mean airway pressure (Pmean) in Group A were significantly lower than those in the other groups (all P &lt; .05).
However, airway resistance (Raw) among 4 groups did not significantly differ (all P &gt; .05).
The incidence of pulmonary infection, anastomotic fistula, ventilator-induced lung injury, lung dysfunction, difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation, and multiple organ dysfunction in Groups A and B were lower than that in Groups C and D (all P &lt; .05).
The expression levels of IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and C-reactive protein in lavage fluid in Group A were significantly lower than those in the other groups (all P &lt; .05).
OLV with low tidal volume (VT &lt; 8 mL/kg) + PCV (5 cmH2O PEEP) improved lung function and mitigated inflammatory responses in elderly patients undergoing esophageal cancer surgery.</TEXT>
