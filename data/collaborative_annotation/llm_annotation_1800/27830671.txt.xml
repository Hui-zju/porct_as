<TEXT>Prolidase activity and oxidative stress in patients with breast carcinoma A prospective randomized case-controlled study.
INTRODUCTION: Oxidative stress plays an important role in the pathogenesis of malign diseases.
Prolidase is a member of the matrix metalloproteinase family, plays a major role in collagen metabolism, cell growth, and matrix remodeling.
Elevated serum prolidase activity have beendemonstrated in several types of carcinoma.
The aim of this study is to investigate the serum prolidase activity, total oxidant status (TOS), total antioxidant status (TAS) and to evaluate their relationship with tumor stage, lymph node metastasis, and tumor size in patients with breast carcinoma.
METHODS: Thirty-five patients with breast carcinoma and forty healthy controls were enrolled to this study.
Serum TAS, TOS levels, and prolidase activities were measured and oxidative stress indices (OSI) were calculated.
RESULTS: TOS, OSI levels and prolidase activities were significantly higher in the patients with breast carcinoma compared to the control group (P &lt; 0.001, P &lt; 0.001, P = 0.002, respectively).TAS levels were significantly lower in the in the patients with breast carcinoma compared to the control group (P = 0.016).Positive correlations were found between prolidase activity, TOS, OSI levels and tumor stage, lymph node metastasis, and tumor size.
A negative correlation was found between TAS levels and tumor size,hovewer there were no correlationsbetween tas levels and stage of the tumor,as well as lymph node infiltration.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that elevatedserum prolidase activity and oxidative stress may be associated with breast carcinoma.
Increased serum prolidase activity may be related to stage and prognosis of breast carcinoma.
