<TEXT>The Effect of Using an Electric Fan on Dyspnea in Chinese Patients With Terminal Cancer.
BACKGROUND: Fan therapy is often suggested for relieving the symptom of dyspnea in patients with advanced cancer, but relevant literature among Asians is limited.
OBJECTIVE: Phase 2 clinical trial to assess the clinical feasibility and outcome of using an electric fan to alleviate the symptom of dyspnea in Chinese patients with advanced cancer.
METHODS: Thirty patients with advanced cancer having unresolved breathlessness were recruited from Hospice and Palliative Care Centre of Kiang Wu Hospital in Macau.
Participants were randomly and equally allocated to the experimental group and the control group, respectively.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Verbal numerical rating scale (NRS) of breathlessness, respiratory rate (RR), and saturation of peripheral oxygen (SpO2) was collected before and after the intervention.
RESULTS: T test was used to analyze the data collected.
There was a significant difference in the NRS scores of the experimental group ( P &lt; .01), indicating a significant reduction in the patients' sensation of breathlessness after fan therapy, whereas no significant difference was found in the objective statistic results of RR and SpO2.
No significant difference ( P &gt; .05) was found in the control group for all the 3 variables before and after routine treatment.
CONCLUSION: The results of the study suggested that fan therapy could be effective in alleviating dyspnea in Chinese patients with advanced cancer.
It should be considered as one of the nonpharmacological treatment option.
Future large-scale phase 3 clinical trials are warranted.</TEXT>
