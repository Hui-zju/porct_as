<TEXT>Acute effects of aerobic exercise and relaxation training on fatigue in breast cancer survivors: A feasibility trial.
OBJECTIVE: This three-armed randomized controlled feasibility trial tested the acceptability and acute effects of aerobic exercise and technology-guided mindfulness training (relative to standalone interventions) on cancer-related fatigue among breast cancer survivors (BCS).
METHODS: BCS recruited from Central Illinois completed pre- and post-testing using established measures and were randomized to one of three groups (combined aerobic exercise with guided-mindfulness relaxation, aerobic exercise only, and relaxation only), conducted in three 90 min sessions over the course of 7 days in a fitness room and research office on a university campus.
RESULTS: We enrolled 40 BCS (Mage = 57.33 +/- 8.75), MBMI = 27.38 +/- 5.27, Mfatigue = 4.56 +/- 1.81 as measured by the Piper Fatigue Scale.
More favorable post-intervention evaluations were reported by the combined group, compared to aerobic exercise or relaxation only (p &lt; 0.05).
Reductions in fatigue favoring the combined group (p = 0.05) showed a modest effect size (Cohen's d = 0.91) compared to aerobic exercise only.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide preliminary evidence for the feasibility of combining evidence-based techniques to address fatigue among BCS.
The combined approach, incorporating mobile health technology, presents an efficacious and well-received design.
If replicated in longer trials, the approach could provide a promising opportunity to deliver broad-reaching interventions for improved outcomes in BCS.
