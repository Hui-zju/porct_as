<TEXT>Predictors of Colorectal Cancer Screening Among African American Men Living with HIV.
African American men living with HIV are at high risk of colorectal cancer (CRC).
Screening to detect CRC is associated with a reduced risk of CRC mortality.
However, little is known about CRC screening predictors in this population.
This study examined the relation of self-efficacy, a potential mediator of screening that interventions could target, to CRC screening.
It also investigated several variables that might identify subpopulations of African American men non-adherent to CRC screening recommendations.
We report a secondary analysis on baseline data from a randomized controlled trial of a health promotion intervention for African American men living with HIV.
Before their intervention, they completed measures of CRC screening, self-efficacy, marital status, age, education, and adherence to physical activity guidelines and were assessed for obesity.
A total of 270 African American men aged 45 to 88 (Mean = 55.07; SD = 6.46) living with HIV participated.
About 30% reported CRC screening in the past six months.
Multiple logistic regression revealed greater CRC screening self-efficacy and meeting physical activity guidelines were associated with receiving CRC screening.
Obese men and men reporting higher education were less likely to report screening.
Age and marital status were unrelated to screening.
The results of this study suggest CRC screening rates may be low among African American men living with HIV, and interventions targeting self-efficacy may improve their screening uptake.
Moreover, public-health efforts to increase screening should prioritize interventions with subpopulations of African American men living with HIV who are physically inactive and obese.</TEXT>
