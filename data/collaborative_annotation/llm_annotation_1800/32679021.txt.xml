<TEXT>The JPJDF has Synergistic Effect with Fluoropyrimidine in the Maintenance Therapy for Metastatic Colorectal Cancer.
BACKGROUND: Maintenance chemotherapeutic regimen with low toxicity is needed for metastatic colorectal cancer.
A recent patent has been issued on the spleen-strengthening and detoxification prescription (JPJDF), a traditional Chinese herbal medicinal formula with anti-angiogenesis effect.
The clinical effect of JPJDF on the maintenance treatment of advanced colorectal cancer has not been evaluated.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of JPJDF in combination with fluoropyrimidine compared to fluoropyrimidine alone as maintenance therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer.
METHODS: We applied a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, single center clinical study design.
A total of 137 patients with advanced colorectal cancer were recruited.
Patients received either Fluoropyrimidine (Flu-treated group, n = 68), or Fluoropyrimidine plus JPJDF (Flu-F-treated group, n = 69) as maintenance treatment after 6-cycle of FOLFOX4 or FOLFORI induction treatment.
The primary endpoints were Progression-Free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS).
The secondary endpoints were safety, Performance Status (PS) score and other symptoms.
RESULTS: The endpoint of disease progression was observed in 91.7% of patients.
The PFS was 5.0 months and 3.0 months in the Flu-F-treated and Flu-treated groups, respectively.
The OS was 15.0 months and 9.0 months in the Flu-F-treated and Flu-treated groups, respectively.
Some common symptoms, such as hypodynamia, anepithymia, dizziness and tinnitus and shortness of breath, were improved in the Flu-F-treated group.
There was no significant difference in the common adverse reactions between the two groups.
CONCLUSION: JPJDF and fluoropyrimidine have synergistic effect in the maintenance treatment of mCRC.</TEXT>
