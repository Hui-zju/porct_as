<TEXT>Comparison of 18FDG-PET/CT and conventional follow-up methods in colorectal cancer: A randomised prospective study.
BACKGROUND: A surveillance program was performed in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients after surgery, to diagnose asymptomatic recurrence.
AIMS: To assess whether 18-FDG positron emission tomography/CT (PET/CT) improved the detection of recurrence during a 3-year follow-up.
METHODS: A multicentre, two-arm randomised prospective trial comparing different 36-month follow-up strategies.
Complete colonoscopy was performed at baseline and after 3 years and clinical exams with imaging every 3 months.
The conventional arm (A) received carcinoembryonic antigen, liver echography, and alternated between lung radiography and computed tomography (CT) scans.
The experimental arm (B) received PET/CT.
RESULTS: A total of 365 patients with colon (79.4%) or rectal cancer (20.6%), stages II (48.2%) or III (50.8%), were enroled in this study.
At 36 months, intention-to-treat analysis revealed recurrence in 31 (17.2%) patients in arm A and 47 (25.4%) in arm B (p=0.063).
At 3 years, 7 of 31 relapses (22.5%) in arm A were surgically treated with curative intent, compared to 17 of 47 (36.2%) in arm B (p=0.25).
The rates of recurrence and new cancers were higher in arm B than arm A (p=0.038).
CONCLUSIONS: PET/CT follow-up every 6 months did not increase the rate of recurrence at 3 years or the rate of surgically treated recurrence compared with conventional follow-up.</TEXT>
