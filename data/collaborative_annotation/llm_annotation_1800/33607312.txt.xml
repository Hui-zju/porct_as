<TEXT>Efficacy and Safety of Rovalpituzumab Tesirine Compared With Topotecan as Second-Line Therapy in DLL3-High SCLC: Results From the Phase 3 TAHOE Study.
INTRODUCTION: DLL3, an atypical Notch ligand, is expressed in SCLC tumors but is not detectable in normal adult tissues.
Rovalpituzumab tesirine (Rova-T) is an antibody-drug conjugate containing a DLL3-targeting antibody tethered to a cytotoxic agent pyrrolobenzodiazepine by means of a protease-cleavable linker.
The efficacy and safety of Rova-T compared with topotecan as second-line therapy in patients with SCLC expressing high levels of DLL3 (DLL3-high) was evaluated.
METHODS: The TAHOE study was an open-label, two-to-one randomized, phase 3 study comparing Rova-T with topotecan as second-line therapy in DLL3-high advanced or metastatic SCLC.
Rova-T (0.3 mg/kg) was administered intravenously on day 1 of a 42-day cycle for two cycles, with two additional cycles available to patients who met protocol-defined criteria for continued dosing.
Topotecan (1.5 mg/m(2)) was administered intravenously on days 1 to 5 of a 21-day cycle.
The primary end point was overall survival (OS).
RESULTS: Patients randomized to Rova-T (n = 296) and topotecan (n = 148) were included in the efficacy analyses.
The median age was 64 years, and 77% had the extensive disease at initial diagnosis.
The median OS (95% confidence interval) was 6.3 months (5.6-7.3) in the Rova-T arm and 8.6 months (7.7-10.1) in the topotecan arm (hazard ratio, 1.46 [95% confidence interval: 1.17-1.82]).
An independent data monitoring committee recommended that enrollment be discontinued because of the shorter OS observed with Rova-T compared with topotecan.
Safety profiles for both drugs were consistent with previous reports.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with topotecan, which is the current standard second-line chemotherapy, Rova-T exhibited an inferior OS and higher rates of serosal effusions, photosensitivity reaction, and peripheral edema in patients with SCLC.
A considerable unmet therapeutic need remains in this population.</TEXT>
