<TEXT>Experiences of Internet-Based Stepped Care in Individuals With Cancer and Concurrent Symptoms of Anxiety and Depression: Qualitative Exploration Conducted Alongside the U-CARE AdultCan Randomized Controlled Trial.
BACKGROUND: Individuals with newly diagnosed cancer may experience impaired health in several aspects and often have a large need for information and support.
About 30% will experience symptoms of anxiety and depression, with varying needs of knowledge and support.
Despite this, many of these patients lack appropriate support.
Internet-based support programs may offer a supplement to standard care services, but must be carefully explored from a user perspective.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to explore the participants' perceptions of the relevance and benefits of an internet-based stepped care program (iCAN-DO) targeting individuals with cancer and concurrent symptoms of anxiety and depression.
METHODS: We performed a qualitative study with an inductive approach, in which we used semistructured questions to interview 15 individuals using iCAN-DO.
We analyzed the interviews using content analysis.
RESULTS: The analysis found 17 subcategories regarding the stepped care intervention, resulting in 4 categories.
Participants described the need for information as large and looked upon finding information almost as a survival strategy when receiving the cancer diagnosis.
iCAN-DO was seen as a useful, reliable source of information and support.
It was used as a complement to standard care and as a means to inform next of kin.
Increased knowledge was a foundation for continued processing of participants' own feelings.
The optimal time to gain access to iCAN-DO would have been when being informed of the diagnosis.
The most common denominator was feeling acknowledged and supported, but with a desire for further adaptation of the system to each individual's own situation and needs.
CONCLUSIONS: Users saw the internet-based stepped care program as safe and reliable and used it as a complement to standard care.
Similar interventions may gain from more personalized contents, being integrated into standard care, or using symptom tracking to adjust the contents.
Offering this type of program close to diagnosis may provide benefits to users.
