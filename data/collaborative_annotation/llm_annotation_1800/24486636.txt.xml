<TEXT>Protocol and recruitment results from a randomized controlled trial comparing group phone-based versus newsletter interventions for weight loss maintenance among rural breast cancer survivors.
Obesity is a risk factor for breast cancer recurrence and death.
Women who reside in rural areas have higher obesity prevalence and suffer from breast cancer treatment-related disparities compared to urban women.
The objective of this 5-year randomized controlled trial is to compare methods for delivering extended care for weight loss maintenance among rural breast cancer survivors.
Group phone-based counseling via conference calls addresses access barriers, is more cost-effective than individual phone counseling, and provides group support which may be ideal for rural breast cancer survivors who are more likely to have unmet support needs.
Women (n=210) diagnosed with Stage 0 to III breast cancer in the past 10 years who are &gt;/= 3 months out from initial cancer treatments, have a BMI 27-45 kg/m(2), and have physician clearance were enrolled from multiple cancer centers.
During Phase I (months 0 to 6), all women receive a behavioral weight loss intervention delivered through group phone sessions.
Women who successfully lose 5% of weight enter Phase II (months 6 to 18) and are randomized to one of two extended care arms: continued group phone-based treatment or a mail-based newsletter.
During Phase III, no contact is made (months 18 to 24).
The primary outcome is weight loss maintenance from 6 to 18 months.
Secondary outcomes include quality of life, serum biomarkers, and cost-effectiveness.
This study will provide essential information on how to reach rural survivors in future efforts to establish weight loss support for breast cancer survivors as a standard of care.</TEXT>
