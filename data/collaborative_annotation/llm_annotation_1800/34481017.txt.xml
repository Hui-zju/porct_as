<TEXT>Adding Short-Term Androgen Deprivation Therapy to Radiation Therapy in Men With Localized Prostate Cancer: Long-Term Update of the NRG/RTOG 9408 Randomized Clinical Trial.
PURPOSE: For men with localized prostate cancer, NRG Oncology/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 9408 demonstrated that adding short-term androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) to radiation therapy (RT) improved the primary endpoint of overall survival (OS) and improved disease-specific mortality (DSM), biochemical failure (BF), local progression, and freedom from distant metastases (DM).
This study was performed to determine whether the short-term ADT continued to improve OS, DSM, BF, and freedom from DM with longer follow-up.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: From 1994 to 2001, NRG/RTOG 9408 randomized 2028 men from 212 North American institutions with T1b-T2b, N0 prostate adenocarcinoma and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) &lt;/=20ng/mL to RT alone or RT plus short-term ADT.
Patients were stratified by PSA, tumor grade, and surgical versus clinical nodal staging.
ADT was flutamide with either goserelin or leuprolide for 4 months.
Prostate RT (66.6 Gy) was started after 2 months.
OS was calculated at the date of death from any cause or at last follow-up.
Secondary endpoints were DSM, BF, local progression, and DM.
Acute and late toxic effects were assessed using RTOG toxicity scales.
RESULTS: Median follow-up in surviving patients was 14.8 years (range, 0.16-21.98).
The 10-year and 18-year OS was 56% and 23%, respectively, with RT alone versus 63% and 23% with combined therapy (HR 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85-1.05; P = .94).
The hazards were not proportional (P = .003).
Estimated restricted mean survival time at 18 years was 11.8 years (95% CI, 11.4-12.1) with combined therapy versus 11.3 years with RT alone (95% CI, 10.9-11.6; P = .05).
The 10-year and 18-year DSM was 7% and 14%, respectively, with RT alone versus 3% and 8% with combined therapy (HR 0.56; 95% CI, 0.41-0.75; P &lt; .01).
DM and BF favored combined therapy at 18 years.
Rates of late grade &gt;/=3 hepatic, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary toxicity were &lt;/=1%, 3%, and 8%, respectively, with combined therapy versus &lt;/=1%, 2%, and 5% with RT alone.
CONCLUSIONS: Further follow-up demonstrates that OS converges at approximately 15 years, by which point the administration of 4 months of ADT had conferred an estimated additional 6 months of life.</TEXT>
