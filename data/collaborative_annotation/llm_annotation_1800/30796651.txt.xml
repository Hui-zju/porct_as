<TEXT>Strong impact of MammaPrint and BluePrint on treatment decisions in luminal early breast cancer: results of the WSG-PRIMe study.
PURPOSE: The WSG-PRIMe Study prospectively evaluated the impact of the 70-gene signature MammaPrint(R) (MP) and the 80-gene molecular subtyping assay BluePrint(R) on clinical therapy decisions in luminal early breast cancer.
METHODS: 452 hormone receptor (HR)-positive and HER2-negative patients were recruited (N0, N1).
Physicians provided initial therapy recommendations based on clinicopathological factors.
After prospective risk classification by MammaPrint/BluePrint was revealed, post-test treatment recommendations and actual treatment were recorded.
Decisional Conflict and anxiety were measured by questionnaires.
RESULTS: Post-test switch (in chemotherapy (CT) recommendation) occurred in 29.1% of cases.
Overall, physician adherence to MP risk assessment was 92.3% for low-risk and 94.3% for high-risk MP scores.
Adherence was remarkably high in "discordant" groups: 74.7% of physicians initially recommending CT switched to CT omission following low-risk MP scores; conversely, 88.9% of physicians initially recommending CT omission switched to CT recommendations following high-risk MP scores.
Most patients (99.2%) recommended to forgo CT post-test and 21.3% of patients with post-test CT recommendations did not undergo CT; among MP low-risk patients with pre-test and post-test CT recommendations, 40% did not actually undergo CT.
Luminal subtype assessment by BluePrint was discordant with IHC assessment in 34% of patients.
Patients' State Anxiety scores improved significantly overall, particularly in MP low-risk patients.
Trait Anxiety scores increased slightly in MP high risk and decreased slightly in MP low-risk patients.
CONCLUSIONS: MammaPrint and BluePrint test results strongly impacted physicians' therapy decisions in luminal EBC with up to three involved lymph nodes.
The high adherence to genetically determined risk assessment represents a key prerequisite for achieving a personalized cost-effective approach to disease management of early breast cancer.</TEXT>
