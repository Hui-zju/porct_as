<TEXT>Effects of a personal trainer-led exercise intervention on physical activity, physical function, and quality of life of breast cancer survivors.
PURPOSE: Exercise is important to address physical and emotional effects of breast cancer treatment.
This study examines effects of a personal trainer led exercise intervention on physical activity levels, physical function and quality of life (QoL) in breast cancer survivors.
METHODS: Women post active breast cancer treatment were recruited from 2015 to 2017, randomized to immediate exercise or wait-list control, and received three personal training sessions for up to 30 weeks.
Physical activity and function were assessed by pedometer, and tests of endurance, strength, and flexibility.
Self-reported physical activity, physical activity self-efficacy, and QoL were also assessed.
RESULTS: 60 women were randomized to immediate intervention (n = 31) or wait-list control (n = 29).
Subjects were aged (mean +/- SD) 56 +/- 10 years.
On the endurance test, the exercise group significantly improved (increase of 18 +/- 20 steps vs control 9 +/- 12 steps) (p = 0.036).
On the strength test, the exercise group significantly improved (increase of 4 +/- 3 curls vs control 1 +/- 3 curls) (p = 0.002).
After intervention, change (mean +/- SD) in the FACT-ES physical well-being subscale score was 1 +/- 2 in the exercise group and - 1 +/-
2 in the control group (p = 0.023).
Improvement in Self-efficacy and Physical Activity (SEPA) score was significant with a change (mean +/- SD) of 2 +/- 5 for exercise vs 0 +/- 5 for control (p = 0.047).
The number of steps/day, back scratch test, weight, and self-reported physical activity did not significantly improve with intervention.
CONCLUSIONS: The intervention yielded significant improvements in endurance and strength but not physical activity or quality of life.
IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Future efforts to explore feasible ways to support patient's physical activity efforts need to be undertaken.</TEXT>
