<TEXT>The effectiveness of solution-focused brief therapy for psychological distress among Chinese parents of children with a cancer diagnosis: a pilot randomized controlled trial.
PURPOSE: Given the critical role of parental care for pediatric cancer patients, this pilot study evaluated the feasibility and effectiveness of a hospital-based solution-focused brief therapy (SFBT) intervention for reducing psychological distress among parents of pediatric cancer patients in China.
Differences between treatment and active control (AC) groups were assessed on dimensions of psychological distress.
Parents' level of hope was also assessed.
METHODS: Participants (N = 44) were randomly assigned to SFBT or AC.
Parents received four sessions of SFBT twice a week delivered by graduate-level hospital social workers.
Pre- and post-intervention assessments measured change in distress (depression, anxiety, and somatization symptoms) of parents as well as their level of hope.
RESULTS: Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) indicated the SFBT group had better outcomes than the AC group on overall distress of somatic, anxiety, depression symptoms and level of hope.
Within- and between-group treatment effects reported significantly greater effect of the SFBT group than of the AC group.
CONCLUSIONS: Considering the inherent limits of a pilot feasibility study, results suggest that SFBT is a feasible, culturally compatible, and promising intervention for alleviating distress among Chinese parents of children with cancer.
Additional comprehensive trials are needed to draw more definitive conclusions.
RELEVANCE: SFBT may be beneficial for improving the critical support systems of parents of pediatric cancer patients.
Thus, SFBT may have the potential to enhance children's well-being during cancer treatment and recovery.</TEXT>
