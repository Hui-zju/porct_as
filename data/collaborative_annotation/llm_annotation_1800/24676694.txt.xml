<TEXT>Comparison of two oral contraceptive forms containing cyproterone acetate and drospirenone in the treatment of patients with polycystic ovary syndrome: a randomized clinical trial.
PURPOSE: To compare the effects of combined oral contraceptives (OCs) containing cyproterone acetate and drospirenone in the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).
METHODS: Fifty-two patients with PCOS were randomized in two groups: group A (n = 26) received 0.035 mg ethinyl estradiol + 2 mg cyproterone acetate and group B (n = 26) received 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol + 3 mg drospirenone-containing OCs for 12 months.
Baseline clinical features including body mass index, waist to hip ratio (WHR), and modified Ferriman-Gallwey (mFG) score were noted.
Baseline biochemical parameters included androgen profile, carbohydrate metabolism, lipid profile, and oxidative stress.
The percentages of changes for all parameters were compared.
RESULTS: The groups were comparable regarding the baseline characteristics.
WHR decreased significantly from baseline (-4 % [-31 to 35]) in group B when compared to group A (0 % [-11 to 14]) (P = 0.033).
The total mFG score decreased significantly from baseline (-35 % [-71 to 10]) in group A when compared to group B (-18 % [-72 to 30]) (P = 0.035).
Changes in androgen hormone profile were comparable except DHEA-SO4 (-32 % [-53 to 15] in group B vs. -10 % [-49 to 63] in group A; P = 0.046).
The effects of the drugs were similar regarding carbohydrate metabolism, lipid profile, and oxidative stress parameters.
CONCLUSIONS: Cyproterone acetate containing OCs seem to be more effective to treat clinical hirsutism in patients with PCOS after 12 months of treatment.</TEXT>
