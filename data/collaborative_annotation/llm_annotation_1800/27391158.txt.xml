<TEXT>Concurrent paclitaxel/cisplatin chemoradiotherapy with or without consolidation chemotherapy in high-risk early-stage cervical cancer patients following radical hysterectomy: preliminary results of a phase III randomized study.
A phase III randomized study on the efficacy and safety of consolidation chemotherapy with paclitaxel plus cisplatin following radical hysterectomy and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in the treatment of high risk early-stage cervical cancer were reported.
146 eligible patients were randomized to arm A receiving concurrent CRT or arm B receiving CRT plus consolidation chemotherapy, respectively.
An interim analysis showed a trend of improvement on disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in arm B with hazard ratios (HR) of 1.25 (95% CI = 0.60-2.60, p = 0.55) and 1.43 (95% CI = 0.64-3.20, p = 0.38) for DFS and OS, respectively.
The 3-year DFS and OS were 82.0% vs.74.3%, and 86.6% vs. 78.3% for patients receiving CRT plus consolidation chemotherapy and CRT alone, respectively.
There was significant difference between the two arms in distant alone recurrence (p = 0.048).
Multivariate analysis indicated that pathologic type was a significant prognostic factor for OS (p = 0.045), positive pelvic nodes were significantly associated with both OS ( p=0.02) and DFS (P=0.03).
Grade 2 to 4 gastrointestinal disorder (p = 0.95), radiation enteritis (P=0.48), radiation cystitis (p = 0.27) and radioepidermitis (p = 0.46) were similar in the two arms.
Overall rates of grade 0-2/3-4 myelosuppression were 87.7%/12.3% for arm A and 74.6%/25.4% for arm B, respectively, but this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.05).
In conclusion, concurrent CRT plus consolidation chemotherapy may play a potential role in further improving survival outcomes for high-risk early stage cervical cancer patients compared CRT alone.</TEXT>
