<TEXT>Short-term surgical outcomes of laparoscopy-assisted versus open D2 distal gastrectomy for locally advanced gastric cancer in North China: a multicenter randomized controlled trial.
BACKGROUND: Although laparoscopic surgery has been recommended as an optional therapy for patients with early gastric cancer, whether patients with locally advanced gastric cancer (AGC) could benefit from laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy (LADG) with D2 lymphadenectomy remains elusive due to a lack of comprehensive clinical data.
To evaluate the efficacy of LADG, we conducted a multi-institutional randomized controlled trial to compare laparoscopy-assisted versus open distal gastrectomy (ODG) for AGC in North China.
METHODS: In this RCT, after patients were enrolled according to the eligibility criteria, they were preoperatively assigned to LADG or ODG arm randomly with a 1:1 allocation ratio.
The primary endpoint was the morbidity and mortality within 30 postoperative days to evaluate the surgical safety of LADG.
The secondary endpoint was 3-year disease-free survival.
This trial was registered at ClinicalTrial.gov as NCT02464215.
RESULTS: Between March 2014 and August 2017, a total of 446 patients with cT2-4aN0-3M0 (AJCC 7th staging system) were enrolled.
Of these, 222 patients underwent LADG and 220 patients underwent ODG were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis.
The compliance rate of D2 lymph node dissection was identical between the LADG and ODG arms (99.5%, P = 1.000).
No significant difference was observed regarding the overall postoperative complication rate in two groups (LADG 13.1%, ODG 17.7%, P = 0.174).
No operation-related death occurred in both arms.
CONCLUSIONS: This trial confirmed that LADG performed by credentialed surgeons was safe and feasible for patients with AGC compared with conventional ODG.</TEXT>
