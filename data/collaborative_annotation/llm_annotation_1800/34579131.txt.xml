<TEXT>Effects of Sodium Selenite Injection on Serum Metabolic Profiles in Women Diagnosed with Breast Cancer-Related Lymphedema-Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Placebo-Controlled Trial Using Global Metabolomics.
In our previous study, intravenous (IV) injection of selenium alleviated breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL).
This secondary analysis aimed to explore the metabolic effects of selenium on patients with BCRL.
Serum samples of the selenium-treated (SE, n = 15) or the placebo-controlled (CTRL, n = 14) groups were analyzed by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography with Q-Exactive Orbitrap tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-Exactive Orbitrap/MS).
The SE group showed a lower ratio of extracellular water to segmental water (ECW/SW) in the affected arm to ECW/SW in the unaffected arm (arm ECW/SW ratio) than the CTRL group.
Metabolomics analysis showed a valid classification at 2-weeks and 107 differential metabolites were identified.
Among them, the levels of corticosterone, LTB4-DMA, and PGE3-which are known anti-inflammatory compounds-were elevated in the SE group.
Pathway analysis demonstrated that lipid metabolism (glycerophospholipid metabolism, steroid hormone biosynthesis, or arachidonic acid metabolism), nucleotide metabolism (pyrimidine or purine metabolism), and vitamin metabolism (pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis, vitamin B6 metabolism, ascorbate and aldarate metabolism) were altered in the SE group compared to the CTRL group.
In addition, xanthurenic acid levels were negatively associated with whole blood selenium level (WBSe) and positively associated with the arm ECW/SW.
In conclusion, selenium IV injection improved the arm ECW/SW ratio and altered the serum metabolic profiles in patients with BCRL, and improved the anti-inflammatory process in lipid, nucleotide and vitamin pathways, which might alleviate the symptoms of BCRL.</TEXT>
