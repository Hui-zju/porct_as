<TEXT>The Research of No-Touch Isolation Technique on the Prevention of Postoperative Recurrence and Metastasis of Hepatocellular Carcinoma after Hepatectomy.
BACKGROUND/AIMS: To evaluate the efficacy of a surgical no-touch isolation technique in primary hepatocellular carcinoma patients compared with traditional hepatectomy.
METHODOLOGY: Eighty hepatocellular carcinoma patients were randomly divided into traditional hepatectomy (n = 40) and no-touch isolation technique groups (n = 40).
We compared peripheral blood variations in alpha-fetoprotein mRNA, miRNA-221, miRNA-224, and miRNA-122 expression levels in both groups pre- and postoperatively using real-time fluorescent quantitative polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: The patients in the no-touch isolation technique group had better clinical curative effect.
In the traditional hepatectomy group, variations in alpha-fetoprotein mRNA copy number pre- and postoperatively indirectly indicated a significant increase in the number of exfoliated carcinoma cells induced by manipulating the liver, increasing the risk of postoperative recurrence and metastasis (P &lt; 0.05).
Traditional hepatectomy patients showed higher increases in miRNA-221 and miRNA-224 expression than those in the no-touch isolation technique group (P &lt; 0.05).
Tumor resection resulted in preoperative expression and high postoperative expression of miRNA-122.
No-touch isolation technique patients showed a slight and significant increase (P &lt; 0.01) in miRNA-122, which was positively correlated with postoperative liver function index.
Conclusion: The no-touch isolation technique is more effective than traditional hepa- tectomy in tumor resection for primary hepatocellular carcinoma.</TEXT>
