<TEXT>Site-specific risk factors for local recurrence after rectal cancer surgery.
BACKGROUND: Quite few studies examined risk factors for local recurrence after rectal cancer surgery with respect to local recurrence sites.
METHODS: Local recurrence sites were categorized into axial, anterior, posterior, and lateral (pelvic sidewall), and axial, anterior, and posterior type were combined as the "other" type of local recurrence.
Among 76 patients enrolled into our prospective randomized controlled trial to determine the indication for pelvic autonomic nerve preservation (PANP) in patients with advanced lower rectal cancer (UMIN000021353), multivariate analyses were conducted to elucidate risk factors for either lateral or the "other" type of local recurrence.
RESULTS: Univariate analyses showed that tumor distance from the anal verge was significantly (p = 0.017), and type of operation (sphincter preserving operation (SPO) vs. abdominoperineal resection (APR)) was marginally (p = 0.065) associated with pelvic sidewall recurrence.
Multivariate analysis using these two parameters showed that tumor distance from the anal verge was significantly and independently correlated with pelvic sidewall recurrence (p = 0.017).
As for the "other" type of local recurrence, univariate analyses showed that depth of tumor invasion (p = 0.011), radial margin status (p &lt; 0.001), and adjuvant chemotherapy (p = 0.037) were significantly associated, and multivariate analysis using these three parameters revealed that depth of tumor invasion (p = 0.004) and radial margin status (p &lt; 0.001) were significantly and independently correlated with the "other" type of local recurrence.
CONCLUSION: Risk factors for local recurrence after rectal cancer surgery were totally different with respect to the intra-pelvic recurrent sites.
Site-specific probability of local recurrence can be inferred using these risk factors.
