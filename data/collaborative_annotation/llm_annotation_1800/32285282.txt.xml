<TEXT>Opioid Consumption Following Breast Surgery Decreases with a Brief Educational Intervention: A Randomized, Controlled Trial.
BACKGROUND: Current rates of opioid prescribing and consumption in the United States have resulted in deleterious consequences for both patients and society.
There has been a focus on opioid consumption and overprescribing, but the utility of patient education in reducing opioid consumption has only recently been explored.
This randomized trial aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a brief patient educational intervention in reducing pain and opioid consumption in patients undergoing mastectomy and breast reconstruction.
METHODS: A parallel, randomized, single-center trial of women undergoing mastectomy with immediate, implant-based breast reconstruction was completed to evaluate the utility of a patient educational instrument with information on multi-modal pain control.
A questionnaire was administered postoperatively to collect data on pain control and opioid consumption.
RESULTS: Fifty participants were randomized to each group preoperatively; 46 control (92%) and 39 intervention (78%) participants completed the postoperative questionnaire.
Active tobacco use was more common in the control group (p = 0.04).
There was a trend towards lower pain scores in the intervention group (3.0/10, SD 1.8 vs 3.6/10, SD 1.6, p = 0.06).
Both groups were prescribed a median of 32.0 5-mg oxycodone tablets postoperatively.
Participants in the intervention group consumed 33% fewer opioids than the control group (16.2 tablets, SD 16.4 vs 24.3 tablets, SD 21.8, p = 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The use of a brief educational intervention provided at a preoperative appointment can reduce opioid consumption.
We recommend the use of an educational intervention to decrease opioid consumption among breast surgery patients.</TEXT>
