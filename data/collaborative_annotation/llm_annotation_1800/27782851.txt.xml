<TEXT>Surefire infusion system versus standard microcatheter use during holmium-166 radioembolization: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
BACKGROUND: An anti-reflux catheter (ARC) may increase the tumor absorbed dose during radioembolization (RE) by elimination of particle reflux and its effects on hemodynamics.
Since the catheter is fixed in a centro-luminal position, it may also increase the predictive accuracy of a scout dose administration before treatment.
The purpose of the SIM trial is to compare the effects of ARC use during RE with holmium-166 ((166)Ho) microspheres in patients with colorectal liver metastases (CRLM), with the use of a standard end-hole microcatheter.
METHODS/DESIGN: A within-patient randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted in 25 patients with unresectable chemorefractory liver-dominant CRLM.
Study participants will undergo a (166)Ho scout dose procedure in the morning and a therapeutic procedure in the afternoon.
The ARC will be randomly allocated to the left/right hepatic artery, and a standard microcatheter will be used in the contralateral artery.
SPECT/CT imaging will be performed for quantitative analyses of the microsphere distribution directly after the scout and treatment procedure.
Baseline and follow-up investigations include (18)F-FDG-PET + liver CT, clinical and laboratory examinations.
The primary endpoint is the comparison of tumor to non-tumor (T/N) activity ratio in both groups.
Secondary endpoints include comparisons of mean absorbed dose in tumors and healthy liver tissue, infusion efficiency, the predictive value of (166)Ho scout dose for tumor response.
In the entire cohort, a dose-response relationship, clinical toxicity, and overall survival will be assessed.
The sample was determined for the expectation that the ARC will increase the T/N ratio by 25 % (mean T/N ratio 2.0 vs. 1.6).
DISCUSSION: The SIM trial is a within-patient RCT that will assess whether (166)Ho RE treatment can be optimized by using an ARC.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The SIM trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT02208804 ).
