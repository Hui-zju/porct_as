<TEXT>Intracorporeal Versus Extracorporeal Anastomosis in Patients Undergoing Laparoscopic Right Hemicolectomy: A Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial (The IVEA-study).
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate short-term outcomes of performing intracorporeal versus extracorporeal anastomosis in laparoscopic right hemicolectomy for right colon neoplasm.
BACKGROUND: Despite advances in the laparoscopic approach in colorectal surgery and the clear benefit of this approach over open surgery, because of the technical difficulty in performing intracorporeal anastomosis (IA), some continue to perform it extracorporeally in right colon surgery.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was a prospective multicenter randomized trial with 2 parallel groups on which either IA or extracorporeal anastomosis was performed in laparoscopic right hemicolectomy for right colon neoplasm, carried out between January 2016 and December 2018.
RESULTS: A total of 168 patients were randomized during the study period.
At baseline, the 2 groups were comparable for age, sex, body mass index, surgical risk, and comorbidity.
The median length of postoperative hospital stay was 7 days with no differences between the groups.
About 70% of patients had an uneventful postoperative period without complications.
The most common complications were paralytic ileus (20.63%; 33), surgical site infection (SSI) (10%; 16), and anastomotic leakage (6.25%; 10).
The results show a lower level of SSI in the IA group (3.65% vs. 16.67%, P=0.008).
Other complications do not show statistically significant differences between groups.
Likewise, the incision for the extraction of the specimen was smaller in the IA group (P=0.000) and creation of the anastomosis intracorporeally decreased postoperative pain (P=0.000).
CONCLUSIONS: In comparison to the extracorporeal technique, IA decreased postoperative pain, incision size, and SSI.
Further studies will be needed to verify our findings.</TEXT>
