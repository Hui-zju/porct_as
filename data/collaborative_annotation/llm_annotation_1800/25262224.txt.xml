<TEXT>A randomized, prospective trial of operative treatments for hyperparathyroidism in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1.
BACKGROUND: Hyperparathyroidism (HPT) in multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 1 is associated with multiglandular parathyroid disease.
Previous retrospective studies comparing subtotal parathyroidectomy (SP) and total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation (TP/AT) have not established clearly better outcomes with either procedure.
METHODS: Patients were assigned randomly to either SP or TP/AT and data were collected prospectively.
The rates of persistent HPT, recurrent HPT, and postoperative hypoparathyroidism were compared.
RESULTS: The study cohort included 32 patients randomized to receive either SP or TP/AT (mean follow-up, 7.5 +/- 5.7 years).
The overall rate of recurrent HPT was 19% (6/32).
Recurrent HPT occurred in 4 of 17 patients (24%) treated with SP and 2 of 15 patients (13%) treated with TP/AT (P = .66).
Permanent hypoparathyroidism occurred in 3 of 32 patients (9%) overall.
The rate of permanent hypoparathyroidism was 12% in the SP group (2/17) and 7% in the TP/AT group (1/15).
A second operation was performed in 4 of 17 patients initially treated with SP (24%), compared with 1 of 15 patients undergoing TP/AT (7%; P = .34).
CONCLUSION: This randomized trial of SP and TP/AT in patients with MEN 1 failed to show any difference in outcomes when comparing results of SP versus TP/AT.
Both procedures are associated with acceptable results, but SP may have advantages in that is involves only 1 surgical incision and avoids an obligate period of transient postoperative hypoparathyroidism.</TEXT>
