<TEXT>Three different techniques for administering analgesia during transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy: a comparative study.
PURPOSE: The efficacy of three different analgesic techniques during transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guided prostate biopsy, including (i) periprostatic blockage (PPB), (ii) intrarectal gel instillation, and (iii) sedoanalgesia were compared.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: During a period of five months, 100 consecutive men were enrolled in this study.
A 10-point linear visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to assess the pain scores during (VAS 1), immediately after (VAS 2) and one hour after (VAS 3) the needle biopsy procedure.
The relationship between the level of pain, prostate volume, age and PSA was determined.
RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between the four groups in terms of mean age and PSA values.
The pain scores were significantly lower in sedoanalgesia and PPB groups (p = 0.0001).
There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in terms of complications.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, it was shown that patient comfort is better and it is possible to get decreased pain scores with PPB or sedoanalgesia.
However, PPB is a preferable method in TRUS-guided prostate biopsy since it is much more practical in outpatient clinics.</TEXT>
