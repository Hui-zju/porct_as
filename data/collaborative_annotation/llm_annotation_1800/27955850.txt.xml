<TEXT>[A randomized controlled trial of preoperative oral immunonutrition in patients undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer: hospital stay and health care costs].
BACKGROUND: The use of enteral formulas with immunonutrients in patients with gastrointestinal malignancies susceptible to surgery can reduce postoperative morbidity, at the expense of reduced infectious complications, with the consequent reduction in hospital stay and health care costs.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Prospective randomized study.
84 patients operated on a scheduled basis for resectable colorectal cancer were recruited.
In the group YES IN Impact (c) Oral was administered for 8 days (3 sachets a day), compared with the NOT IN group who did not receive it.
RESULTS: 40.5% (17) patients without immunonutrition suffered infectious complications vs. 33.3% (14) of YES IN.
In patients with rectal cancer NOT IN, 50% (8) suffered minor infectious complications (p=.028).
In each group (YES IN, NOT IN, colon and rectal cancer) when infectious complications were observed, the variables total hospital stay and costs doubled, with significant differences.
These variables showed higher values in the group NOT IN compared with those who received immunonutrition, although these differences were not statistically significant.
CONCLUSIONS: NOT IN patients suffered infectious complications more frequently than YES IN, with significant results in the subgroup of patients with rectal cancer.
The total hospital stay and costs were slightly higher in the group not supplemented, doubling in each category significantly (YES IN, NOT IN, colon and rectal cancer), when infectious complications were observed.</TEXT>
