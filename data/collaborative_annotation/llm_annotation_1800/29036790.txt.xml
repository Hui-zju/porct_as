<TEXT>Predictors for the efficacy of Endostar combined with neoadjuvant chemotherapy for stage IIIA (N2) NSCLC.
BACKGROUND: Endostar (rh-endostatin) is a new recombinant human endostatin, which could inhibit cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and tumor growth.
OBJECTIVE: To explore anti-angiogenesis short-term efficacy combined with neoadjuvant chemotherapy for stage IIIA (N2) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and identify the potential predictive factors.
METHODS: We pathologically examined 26 patients diagnosed with stage IIIA (N2) NSCLC who received NP chemotherapy alone or combined with Endostar, respectively.
RESULTS: Our results indicated that total clinical benefit rate (CBR) 87.5% and 64% (p= 0.76), respectively.
The clinical benefit (CB) patients in the treatment group showed significant changes in endothelial progenitor cells (EPC), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), blood flow (BF), permeability surface (PMS), and microvascular density (MVD) before and after treatment.
Compared with CB patients in the control group, changes in EPC and MVD (only) before and after treatment were significant.
The variation of EPC, PMS, and MVD before and after treatment in the treatment group showed positive correlation with tumor regression rate (TRR) and the variation of MVD, whereas those of EPC and PMS demonstrated positive correlations with variation of MVD before and after treatment.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggested that PMS and EPC may be used as a predictive factor for the short-term efficacy of the combined therapy in NSCLC.</TEXT>
