<TEXT>Prospective associations between vitamin D status, vitamin D-related gene polymorphisms, and risk of tobacco-related cancers.
BACKGROUND: Experimental evidence has suggested that vitamin D may be protective against tobacco-related cancers through the inhibition of the formation of tumors induced by tobacco carcinogens.
To our knowledge, only one previous epidemiologic study investigated the association between vitamin D status and tobacco-related cancer risk, and no study has focused on vitamin D-related gene polymorphisms.
OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to prospectively study the association between plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations, vitamin D-related gene polymorphisms, and risk of tobacco-related cancers.
DESIGN: A total of 209 tobacco-related cancers were diagnosed within the SU.VI.MAX (Supplementation en vitamines et mineraux antioxydants) cohort (1994-2007) and were matched with 418 controls as part of a nested case-control study.
Tobacco-related cancers (i.e., cancers for which tobacco is one of the risk factors) included several sites in the respiratory, digestive, reproductive, and urinary systems.
Total plasma 25(OH)D was assessed with the use of an electrochemoluminescent assay.
Polymorphisms were determined with the use of a TaqMan assay.
Conditional logistic regression models were computed.
RESULTS: A 25(OH)D concentration &gt;/=30 ng/mL was associated with reduced risk of tobacco-related cancers (OR for &gt;/=30 compared with &lt;30 ng/mL: 0.59; 95% CI 0.35, 0.99; P = 0.046).
This association was observed in former and current smokers (OR for &gt;/=30 compared with &lt;30 ng/mL: 0.43; 95% CI: 0.23, 0.84; P = 0.01) but not in never smokers (P = 0.8).
The vitamin D receptor (VDR) FokI AA genotype and retinoid X receptor (RXR) rs7861779 TT genotype were associated with increased risk of tobacco-related cancers [OR for homozygous mutant type (MT) compared with wild type (WT): 1.87; 95% CI: 1.08, 3.23; P-trend = 0.02; OR for heterozygous type (HT) plus MT compared with WT: 1.60; 95% CI: 1.07, 2.38; P = 0.02].
CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective study, high vitamin D status [25(OH)D concentration &gt;/=30 ng/mL] was associated with decreased risk of tobacco-related cancers, especially in smokers.
These results, which are supported by mechanistic plausibility, suggest that vitamin D may contribute to the prevention of tobacco-induced cancers in smokers and deserve additional investigation.
The SU.VI.MAX trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00272428.</TEXT>
