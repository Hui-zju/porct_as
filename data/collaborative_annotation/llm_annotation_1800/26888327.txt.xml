<TEXT>Framing preventive care messaging and cervical cancer screening in a health-insured population in South Africa: Implications for population-based communication?
The impact of health message framing on cervical cancer screening uptake is poorly understood.
In a prospective randomized control study with 748 females, aged 21-65 years with no Pap smear in the previous 3 years, they randomly received a loss-framed, gain-framed, or neutral health message (control) regarding cervical cancer screening by email.
Screening rate in the control group was 9.58 percent (CI: 9.29%-9.87%), 5.71 percent (CI: 5.48%-6.98%) in the gain-framed group, and 8.53 percent (CI: 8.24%-8.81%) in the loss-framed group.
Statistically there was no difference between the three screening rates.
Framing of health messages may not be a significant consideration when communicating through emails.</TEXT>
