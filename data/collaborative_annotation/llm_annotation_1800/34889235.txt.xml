<TEXT>The efficacy and safety of modified Gegenqinlian Fomular for advanced colorectal cancer (damp heat accumulation type): A multicenter randomized controlled trial.
INTRODUCTION: CRC, the incidence of the fourth highest among males and the third among females, is one of the malignant tumors that seriously threaten human health.
The principle of treatment for advanced stage CRC is a multidisciplinary and comprehensive treatment based on chemotherapy, which always bring significant toxic side effects.
CHM has advantages in the treatment of tumors with the effect on improving clinical symptoms and reducing side effects.
GGQL formula is mainly used for treating abnormal defecates caused by damp-heat, so we will evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of modified GGQL formula for patients with advanced CRC with the type of damp-heat in this study.
METHODS: Multicenter RCT with two parallel groups in three hospitals planning to recruit 120 CRC patients with the type of damp-heat will be conducted.
The control group will be treated by basic antitumor therapy and the treatment group will use modified GGQL formula plus basic antitumor therapy.
The primary outcomes will be quality of life, TCM symptom score, PFS and OS, and the secondary outcomes will be performance status, size of tumor, tumor marker in the serum, tumor microenvironment and immune status.
All analyses will be based on an intention-to-treat principle.
This study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of Shanxi Province Hospital of Traditional Chinese medicine (2021Y-06017).
The results will be published in relevant journal.
DISCUSSION: The results of this RCT will contribute to Chinese herbal medicine for treating CRC patients with the type of damp heat accumulation.
