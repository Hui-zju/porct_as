<TEXT>The Effects of Dinner-to-Bed Time and Post-Dinner Walk on Gastric Cancer Across Different Age Groups: A Multicenter Case-Control Study in Southeast China.
Gastric cancer (GC) remains a major killer throughout the world.
Despite the dramatic decrease in GC over the last century, its etiology has not yet been well characterized.
This study investigated the possible independent and combined effects of the dinner-to-bed time and post-dinner walk on the risk for GC across different age groups.
A population-based, case-control study was conducted in southeast China, including 452 patients with GC and 465 age-, race-, and gender-matched controls.
A self-designed questionnaire was used to collect information on demographic characteristics, dinner-to-bed time, post-dinner walk, and other behavioral factors.
Conditional logistic regression models were used to estimate the effects of the dinner-to-bed time and post-dinner walk as well as their joint effect on the risk for GC across different age groups.
Individuals with dinner-to-bed time &lt;3 hours were more prone to have GC (P &lt; 0.001), and the shorter the dinner-to-bed time was, the higher was the risk for GC (Ptrend &lt; 0.001).
Post-dinner nonwalk was associated with a 2.9-fold increased risk for GC compared with post-dinner walk (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.942, 95% confidence intervals [95% CIs] = 2.072-4.179).
The interaction effect of dinner-to-bed time and post-dinner walk on GC risk was detected (AOR = 1.862, 95% CIs = 1.584-3.885, synergy index [SI] = 2.654, 95% CIs = 2.27-3.912).
Participants with dinner-to-bed time &lt;3 hours who did not walk after dinner were 7.4 times likely to suffer from GC (AOR = 7.401, 95% CIs = 4.523-13.16) than those with dinner-to-bed time &gt;/=4 hours who took such walk.
The risk of GC due to dinner-to-bed time &lt;3 hours, post-dinner nonwalk and their interaction was positively correlated with age.
The strongest risk was observed among people &gt;/=70 years old, but the effects were not significant for people &lt;/=55 years old.
Dinner-to-bed time &lt;3 hours and post-dinner nonwalk are independent risk factors for GC; the synergistic interaction between the 2 factors was positively related to age, which might significantly increase the risk for GC among people &gt;55 years old.</TEXT>
