<TEXT>Equal efficacy of endoscopic and surgical cystogastrostomy for pancreatic pseudocyst drainage in a randomized trial.
BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Although surgery is the standard technique for drainage of pancreatic pseudocysts, use of endoscopic methods is increasing.
We performed a single-center, open-label, randomized trial to compare endoscopic and surgical cystogastrostomy for pancreatic pseudocyst drainage.
METHODS: Patients with pancreatic pseudocysts underwent endoscopic (n = 20) or surgical cystogastrostomy (n = 20).
The primary end point was pseudocyst recurrence after a 24-month follow-up period.
Secondary end points were treatment success or failure, complications, re-interventions, length of hospital stay, physical and mental health scores, and total costs.
RESULTS: At the end of the follow-up period, none of the patients who received endoscopic therapy had a pseudocyst recurrence, compared with 1 patient treated surgically.
There were no differences in treatment successes, complications, or re-interventions between the groups.
However, the length of hospital stay was shorter for patients who underwent endoscopic cystogastrostomy (median, 2 days, vs 6 days in the surgery group; P &lt; .001).
Although there were no differences in physical component scores and mental health component scores (MCS) between groups at baseline on the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form General Survey questionnaire, longitudinal analysis showed significantly better physical component scores (P = .019) and mental health component scores (P = .025) for the endoscopy treatment group.
The total mean cost was lower for patients managed by endoscopy than surgery ($7011 vs $15,052; P = .003).
CONCLUSIONS: In a randomized trial comparing endoscopic and surgical cystogastrostomy for pancreatic pseudocyst drainage, none of the patients in the endoscopy group had pseudocyst recurrence during the follow-up period, therefore there is no evidence that surgical cystogastrostomy is superior.
However, endoscopic treatment was associated with shorter hospital stays, better physical and mental health of patients, and lower cost.
