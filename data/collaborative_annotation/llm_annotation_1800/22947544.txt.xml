<TEXT>Effect of exercise on bone structural traits, physical performance and body composition in breast cancer patients--a 12-month RCT.
In this 12-month RCT, we examined whether aerobic impact exercise training (3x/week) could facilitate breast cancer survivors' recovery by enhancing their bone structural strength, physical performance and body composition.
After the adjuvant chemo- and/ or radiotherapy, 86 patients were randomly assigned into the training or control group.
Structural bone traits were assessed with pQCT at the tibia and with DXA at the femoral neck.
Agility (figure-8 running), jump force and power (force platform), grip strength and cardiovascular fitness (2-km walk test) were also assessed.
Training effects on outcome variables were estimated by two-way factorial ANCOVA using the study group and menopausal status as fixed factors.
Bone structural strength was better maintained among the trainees.
At the femoral neck, there was a small but significant 2% training effect in the bone mass distribution (p=0.05).
At the tibial diaphysis, slight 1% to 2% training effects (p=0.03) in total cross-sectional area and bone structural strength were observed (p=0.03) among the postmenopausal trainees.
Also, 3% to 4% training effects were observed in the figure-8 running time (p=0.03) and grip strength (p=0.01).
In conclusion, vigorous aerobic impact exercise training has potential to maintain bone structural strength and improve physical performance among breast cancer survivors.</TEXT>
