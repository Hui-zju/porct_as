<TEXT>Extraskeletal Ewing sarcoma in children, adolescents, and young adults. An analysis of three prospective studies of the Cooperative Weichteilsarkomstudiengruppe (CWS).
BACKGROUND: We have analyzed the outcome of patients with localized extraskeletal Ewing sarcoma (EES) treated in three consecutive Cooperative Weichteilsarkomstudiengruppe (CWS) soft tissue sarcoma (STS) studies: CWS-91, CWS-96, and CWS-2002P.
METHODS: Patients were treated in CWS-91 with four- (vincristine, dactinomycin, doxorubicin, and ifosfamide [VAIA] or cyclophosphamide [VACA II]) or five-drug (+etoposide [EVAIA]) cycles, in CWS-96 they were randomly assigned to receive VAIA or CEVAIE (+carboplatin and etoposide), and in CWS-2002P with VAIA III plus optional maintenance therapy (MT) with cyclophosphamide and vinblastine.
Local therapy consisted of resection and/or radiotherapy (RT).
RESULTS: Two hundred forty-three patients fulfilled the eligibility criteria.
The 5-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were 63% (95% confidence interval [CI] 57-69) and 73% (95% CI 67-79), respectively.
The 5-year EFS by study was 64% (95% CI 54-74) in CWS-91, 57% (95% CI 48-66) in CWS-96, and 79% (95% CI 67-91) in CWS-2002P (n.s.).
The 5-year OS was 72% (95% CI 62-82) in CWS-91, 70% (95% CI 61-79) in CWS-96, and 86% (95% CI 76-96) in CWS-2002P (n.s.).
In CWS-96, 5-year EFS and OS in the VAIA arm versus the CEVAIE were 65% (95% CI 52-81) versus 55% (95% CI 39-76) log-rank p = .13, and 85% (95% CI 75-96) versus 61% (95% CI 45-82), log-rank p = .09.
CONCLUSION: Our analysis provides interesting information on the treatment and specificities of EES, which can be useful for a better understanding of this rare entity and should be considered in the development of future clinical trials for Ewing sarcoma defined as FET-ETS fusion positive tumors.</TEXT>
