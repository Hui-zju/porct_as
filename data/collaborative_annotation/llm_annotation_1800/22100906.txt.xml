<TEXT>Gemcitabine versus gemcitabine plus dalteparin thromboprophylaxis in pancreatic cancer.
BACKGROUND: Annualised figures show an up to 7-fold higher incidence of vascular thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer (APC) compared to other common malignancies.
Concurrent VTE has been shown to confer a worse overall prognosis in APC.
METHODS: One hundred and twenty three APC patients were randomised to receive either gemcitabine 1000 mg/m(2) or the same with weight-adjusted dalteparin (WAD) for 12 weeks.
Primary end-point was the reduction of all-type VTE during the study period.
NCT00462852, ISRCTN: 76464767.
FINDINGS: The incidence of all-type VTE during the WAD treatment period (&lt;100 days from randomisation) was reduced from 23% to 3.4% (p = 0.002), with a risk ratio (RR)of 0.145, 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.035-0.612) and an 85% risk reduction.
All-type VTE throughout the whole follow-up period was reduced from 28% to 12% (p = 0.039), RR = 0.419, 95% CI (0.187-0.935) and a 58% risk reduction.
Lethal VTE &lt;100 days was seen only in the control arm, 8.3% compared to 0% (p = 0.057), RR = 0.092, 95% CI (0.005-1.635).
INTERPRETATION: Weight adjusted dalteparin used as primary prophylaxis for 12 weeks is safe and produces a highly significant reduction of all-type VTE during the prophylaxis period.
The benefit is maintained after dalteparin withdrawal although decreases with time.</TEXT>
