<TEXT>Virtual Reality Intervention Targeting Pain and Anxiety Among Pediatric Cancer Patients Undergoing Peripheral Intravenous Cannulation: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
BACKGROUND: Peripheral intravenous cannulation (PIC) is commonly performed in cancer treatment and causes pain and anxiety to children with cancer.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine whether virtual reality distraction intervention can alleviate pain and anxiety and reduce length of procedure among pediatric cancer patients undergoing PIC.
METHODS: One hundred eight pediatric cancer patients aged 6 to 17 years were recruited from a regional public hospital in Hong Kong to participate in this randomized controlled trial.
The intervention group received virtual reality distraction intervention, and the control group received standard care.
The primary outcome was child-reported pain.
Secondary outcomes included child-reported anxiety, pulse rate, and length of procedure.
Outcome measurements were conducted at 5 minutes before, during, and immediately after the procedure.
RESULTS: Pediatric cancer patients in the intervention group demonstrated a significantly greater reduction in pain (estimated mean difference = -1.69, P = .007) and anxiety levels (estimated mean difference = -3.50, P &lt; .001) compared with the control group.
The mean duration (in minutes) for the PIC procedure was significantly shorter among participants receiving virtual reality intervention compared with the control counterparts (estimated mean difference = -0.75, P = .017).
However, no significant difference was observed in pulse rate during and after the procedure between groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate that virtual reality is safe and effective to alleviate pain and anxiety among pediatric cancer patients undergoing PIC procedure.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Virtual reality can be considered as an adjunctive treatment to manage pain and anxiety in pediatric cancer patients before and during PIC procedure.</TEXT>
