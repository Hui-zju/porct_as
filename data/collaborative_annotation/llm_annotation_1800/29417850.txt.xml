<TEXT>Efficacy of Ginger in Ameliorating Acute and Delayed Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting Among Patients With Lung Cancer Receiving Cisplatin-Based Regimens: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
Nausea and vomiting are among the most common and distressing side effects of chemotherapy.
Additional antiemetic drugs are urgently needed to effectively manage and ameliorate chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV).
The efficacy of ginger as an antiemetic modality for ameliorating CINV has not been established in previous studies.
The aim of this study was to examine the efficacy of ginger, as an adjuvant drug to standard antiemetic therapy, in ameliorating acute and delayed CINV in patients with lung cancer receiving cisplatin-based regimens.
In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, 140 patients with lung cancer receiving cisplatin-based regimens were enrolled and allocated to receive either ginger root powder or a placebo.
Ginger root powder was administered orally (0.5 g, 2 capsules per day, 0.25 g per capsule, every 12 hours) for 5 days beginning on the first day of chemotherapy.
The incidence and severity of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting were assessed using the MASCC (Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer) Antiemesis Tool (MAT).
Adverse effects and patient adherence were also assessed in this study.
No significant difference was observed between the ginger and control groups in the reduction of the incidence and severity of nausea and vomiting ( P &gt; .05).
No significant difference in adverse events was observed between the 2 groups ( P &gt; .05).
No study-treatment-related adverse events were observed in this study.
As an adjuvant drug to standard antiemetic therapy, ginger had no additional efficacy in ameliorating CINV in patients with lung cancer receiving cisplatin-based regimens.</TEXT>
