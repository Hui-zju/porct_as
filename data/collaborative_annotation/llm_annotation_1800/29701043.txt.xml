<TEXT>[Therapeutic effects on ovulation and reproduction promotion with acupuncture and clomiphene in polycystic ovary syndrome].
OBJECTIVE: To compare the difference in the therapeutic effects on ovulation disorder in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) between the combined therapy of electroacupuncture and clomiphene and the single medication of clomiphene and to explore the effect mechanism.
METHODS: A total of 80 patients of PCOS were randomized into an acupuncture plus medication group (40 cases) and a medication group (40 cases).
In the medication group, since the 5th day of menstruation or medicine-withdrawal bleeding, clomiphene was prescribed for oral administration, continuously for 5 days.
In the acupuncture plus medication group, the medication was the same as the medication group.
Additionally, 30 min electroacupuncture (continuous wave, 2 Hz) was applied to Qihai (CV 6), Guanyuan (CV 4), Zigong (EX-CA 1), Dahe (KI 12), Sanyinjiao (SP 6), Zhongji (CV 3), Diji (SP 8), Shenshu (BL 23), Sanjiaoshu (BL 22) and Ciliao (BL 32), etc.
The treatment started on the 5th day of menstruation or medicine-withdrawal bleeding, once every two days, 3 times a week.
One cycle of menstruation or 1 month was taken as one course.
The treatment cycles were 3 months in the two groups.
The level of estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P) in the serum, the endometrial thickness and morphology, ovulation rate and clinical pregnancy rate, as well as the clinical therapeutic effects were compared after treatment in the two groups.
RESULTS: Two cases were dropped out because the herbal medicine was taken simultaneously in the acupuncture plus medication group.
In the medication group, the medication was discontinued in 3 cases due to gastrointestinal adverse reactions.
The total effective rate was 86.8% (33/38) in the acupuncture plus medication group, better than 64.9% (24/37) in the medication group (P&lt;0.05).
The ovulation rate in the acupuncture plus medication group was higher than that in the medication group [(86.8%, 33/38) vs (64.9% 24/37), P&lt;0.05].
The pregnancy rate in the acupuncture plus medication group was higher than the medication group in tendency, without significant difference [21.1% (8/38) vs 16.2% (6/37), P&gt;0.05].
After treatment, the results of endometrial thickness and morphology (A-type rate) in the acupuncture plus medication group were better than those in the medication group (P&lt;0.01, P&lt;0.05).
After treatment, regarding the levels of E2 and P in the serum in the window period of implantation, the results in the acupuncture plus medication group were higher remarkably than those in the medication group (both P&lt;0.01).
CONCLUSION: The combined intervention of electroacupuncture and clomiphene achieves the definite effects of ovulation and pregnancy promotion in PCOS.
It remarkably increases the levels of E2 and P in the serum, the endometrial thickness and A-type rate.
The therapeutic effects of the combined intervention are remarkably better than those of the simple application of clomiphene.
This combined intervention is safe and tolerable for the adverse reactions.
The effect mechanisms may be related to the improvements of estrogen, progestin and endometrial receptivity.</TEXT>
