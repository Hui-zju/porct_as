<TEXT>Small bowel obstruction, incisional hernia and survival after laparoscopic and open colonic resection (LAFA study).
BACKGROUND: Short-term advantages to laparoscopic surgery are well described.
This study compared medium- to long-term outcomes of a randomized clinical trial comparing laparoscopic and open colonic resection for cancer.
METHODS: The case notes of patients included in the LAFA study (perioperative strategy in colonic surgery; LAparoscopy and/or FAst track multimodal management versus standard care) were reviewed 2-5 years after randomization for incisional hernia, adhesional small bowel obstruction (SBO), overall survival, cancer recurrence and quality of life (QoL).
The laparoscopic and open groups were compared irrespective of fast-track or standard perioperative care.
RESULTS: Data on incisional hernias, SBO, survival and recurrence were available for 399 of 400 patients: 208 laparoscopic and 191 open resections.
These outcomes were corrected for duration of follow-up.
Median follow-up was 3.4 (i.q.r. 2.6-4.4) years.
Multivariable regression analysis showed that open resection was a risk factor for incisional hernia (odds ratio (OR) 2.44, 95 per cent confidence interval (c.i.) 1.12 to 5.26; P = 0.022) and SBO (OR 3.70, 1.07 to 12.50; P = 0.039).
There were no differences in overall survival (hazard ratio 1.10, 95 per cent c.i.
0.67 to 1.80; P = 0.730) or in cumulative incidence of recurrence (P = 0.514) between the laparoscopic and open groups.
There were no measured differences in QoL in 281 respondents (P &gt; 0.350 for all scales).
CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic colonic surgery led to fewer incisional hernia and adhesional SBO events.
