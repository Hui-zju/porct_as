<TEXT>Cognitive-behavioral therapy improves weight loss and quality of life in women with polycystic ovary syndrome: a pilot randomized clinical trial.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and lifestyle modification (LS) versus LS alone on weight, depressive and anxiety symptoms, and stress response in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), overweight/obesity, and depressive symptoms.
DESIGN: A 16-week pilot randomized clinical trial.
SETTING: Tertiary-care PCOS center.
PATIENT(S): Overweight/obese women with PCOS and depressive symptoms.
INTERVENTION(S): Weekly CBT (n = 7) or contact only/no therapy (n = 8) for 8 weeks.
Both groups received weekly LS for 16 weeks.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Changes in weight, depression (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale [CES-D]), anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory [STAI]), quality of life (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Health-Related Quality of Life Questionnaire [PCOSQ]), laboratory tests, and response to a Trier Social Stress Test (TSST).
RESULT(S): The CBT+LS group lost more weekly weight (-0.35 kg/wk vs. -0.16 kg/wk) compared with the LS group.
Overall, the CBT+LS group lost 3.2 kg versus 1.8 kg for the LS group.
The CBT+LS group had greater improvement in PCOSQ at 8 weeks (+3.7 vs. +1.2 points).
In the overall cohort, STAI and CES-D decreased by -0.27 points per week and -0.31 points/wk, respectfully, and total and free T decreased at week 8.
Heart rate response to TSST was lower at 15 minutes after stressor in the CBT+LS group.
CONCLUSION(S): Weekly CBT+LS for 8 weeks compared with LS alone resulted in significant weight loss and improved quality of life in overweight/obese women with PCOS and depressive symptoms.
These interventions were associated with a decreased autonomic response to a laboratory stressor, suggesting a potential link between CBT, weight loss, and modulation of the stress response.
