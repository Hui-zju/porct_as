<TEXT>Comparison of resection margins and cosmetic outcome following intraoperative ultrasound-guided excision versus conventional palpation-guided breast conservation surgery in breast cancer: A randomized controlled trial.
INTRODUCTION: Use of intraoperative ultrasound (IOUS) has been shown to help achieve satisfactory cosmesis and negative margins in breast conserving surgery (BCS).
This study has been done to compare the oncological and cosmetic outcomes following BCS using conventional palpatory method and IOUS.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a prospective randomized controlled trial conducted at a tertiary care teaching and research institute in India.
Patients with early operable breast cancer willing for BCS were included.
Tumors were excised with 1 cm margin.
In palpatory group, tumor was palpated and 1 cm margin was taken with a measuring scale while in the second group, IOUS was used to mark the margins.
Histopathological evaluation was done to assess margins and cosmesis was assessed by patient, resident doctor, and nurse independently.
RESULTS: Sixty patients were included, 32 in the ultrasonography-guided and 28 in palpation-guided wide local excision.
The mean age of patients was 48.78 years.
In both groups, mean tumor size was 3.18 cm.
Margin thickness and positivity was higher in palpatory group (though P &gt; 0.05).
Most patients were satisfied with cosmesis.
There was no significant difference in complications and specimen volume in both groups.
Presence of ductal carcinoma in situ component and expression of Her2neu by tumor cells had a significant impact on margin positivity.
CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative use of ultrasound offers a real-time assessment of margin status and may reduce the margin positivity rate compared to conventional palpation-guided method.</TEXT>
