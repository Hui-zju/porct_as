<TEXT>[Effect of Tanshinone IIA in Preventing and Treating Oxaliplatin Induced Peripheral Neuropathy].
OBJECTIVE: To observe preventive and therapeutic effects of Tanshinone IIA (T II A) on oxaliplatin induced peripheral neuropathy (OlPN) and to explore its effects on the expression of calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) and never growth factor (NGF).
METHODS: Totally 36 phase II - III patients with malignant tumor of digestive tract undergoing chemotherapy program with oxaliplatin, were equally assigned to the T II A group (using THA at 80 mg/day 1 day before oxaliplatin chemotherapy for 3 successive days) and the control group (using chemotherapy program with oxaliplatin alone) by segmented randomization.
After 4 cycles of chemotherapy, the incidence degree and incidence of OlPN were evaluated.
Sensory nerve conduction velocity (SNCV) and motor nerve conduction velocity ( MNCV) were tested by EMG
evoked potential device.
Serum levels of CGRP and NGF were also detected in the two groups before and after chemotherapy.
The correlation of serum levels of CGRP and NGF to OIPN was assessed using linear correlation analysis.
RESULTS: After chemotherapy the OlPN incidence was 27.8% (5/18 cases) in the T II A group, obviously lower than that in the control group (55.6%, 10/18 cases; P &lt; 0.05).
Compared with before treatment in the same group, SNCV and MNCV of common peroneal nerve were slowed down, serum NGF levels decreased, and serum CGRP levels obviously increased in the two groups (all P &lt; 0.05).
Compared with the control group after treatment, SNCV and MNCV of common peroneal nerve were obviously accelerated, serum NGF levels increased, and serum CGRP levels obviously decreased in the THA group (all P &lt; 0.05).
Results of linear correlation analysis indicated serum NGF level was negatively correlated with peripheral neuropathy (PN), serum CGRP expression was positively correlated with neurotoxicity (P &lt; 0.05).
CONCLUSION: T II A could reduce the incidence of OlPN, which might be associated with inhibiting the expression of CGRP and up-regulating NGF activities.</TEXT>
