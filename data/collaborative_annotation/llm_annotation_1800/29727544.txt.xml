<TEXT>[Clinical efficacy of integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine for castration-resistant prostate cancer].
Objective: To investigate the clinical effects of integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine in the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).
METHODS: A total of 54 CRPC patients were randomly divided into a control and a trial group, all treated by endocrine therapy (oral Bicalutamide at 50 mg per d plus subcutaneous injection of Goserelin at 3.6 mg once every 4 wk) and chemotherapy (intravenous injection of Docetaxel at 75 mg/m2 once every 3 wk plus oral Prednisone at 5 mg bid), while the latter group by Fuyang Huayu Prescription (a Traditional Chinese Medicine TCM prescription for tonifying yang and dispersing blood stasis) in addition, for a course of 24 weeks.
Comparisons were made between the two groups of patients in the level of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA), Karnofsky physical condition scores, function assessment of cancer therapy-prostate (FACT-P) scores, and TCM symptoms scores before and after 12 or 24 weeks of treatment.
RESULTS: Compared with the baseline, the serum PSA level was significantly decreased after 12 weeks of treatment both in the control (25.9 +/- 39.3 vs 20.0 +/- 21.1 mug/L, P &lt;0.05) and in the trial group (22.1 +/- 33.9 vs 17.9 +/- 19.1 mug/L, P &lt;0.05), with no statistically significant differences between the two groups (P &gt;0.05).
At 24 weeks, however, the PSA levels in the control and trial groups were slightly increased to (23.1 +/- 28.4) and (19.6 +/- 23.5) mug/L, respectively, with no statistically significant differences in between (P &gt;0.05).
Karnofsky, FACT-P and TCM symptoms scores were all markedly improved in the trial group after 12 weeks of treatment (P &lt;0.05) and remained stable at 24 weeks, but not in the control group either at 12 or at 24 weeks (P &gt;0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: TCM Fuyang Huayu Prescription combined with endocrine therapy and chemotherapy is effective for CRPC.</TEXT>
