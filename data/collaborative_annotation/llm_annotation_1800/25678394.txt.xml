<TEXT>Double-blinded, randomized phase II study using embolization with or without granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor in uveal melanoma with hepatic metastases.
PURPOSE: To investigate the effects of immunoembolization with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in patients with uveal melanoma (UM) with liver-only metastasis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this double-blind phase II clinical trial, patients were randomized to undergo immunoembolization or bland embolization (BE).
Lobar treatment was performed with GM-CSF or normal saline solution mixed with ethiodized oil followed by embolization with gelatin sponge emulsified with iodinated contrast medium.
Fifty-two patients (immunoembolization, n = 25; BE, n = 27) were enrolled.
Response was assessed after every two treatments.
The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR) of liver metastases.
Progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and immunologic responses were secondary endpoints.
RESULTS: There were five partial responses in the immunoembolization group (ORR, 21.2%; 90% confidence interval [CI], 10.3%-30.5%) and three in the BE group (ORR, 16.7%; 90% CI, 6.3%-26.9%).
Stable disease was seen in 12 patients in the immunoembolization group and 19 in the BE group.
OS times were 21.5 months (95% CI, 18.5-24.8 mo) with immunoembolization and 17.2 months (95% CI, 11.9-22.4 mo) with BE.
The degree of proinflammatory cytokine production was more robust after immunoembolization and correlated with time to "systemic" extrahepatic progression.
In the immunoembolization group, interleukin (IL)-6 levels at 1 hour (P = .001) and IL-8 levels at 18 hours after the procedure (P &lt; .001) were significant predictors of longer systemic PFS.
Moreover, a dose-response pattern was evident between posttreatment serum cytokine concentrations and systemic PFS.
CONCLUSIONS: Immunoembolization induced more robust inflammatory responses, which correlated with the delayed progression of extrahepatic systemic metastases.</TEXT>
