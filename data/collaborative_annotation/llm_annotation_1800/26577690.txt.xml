<TEXT>RESTORE: an exploratory trial of a web-based intervention to enhance self-management of cancer-related fatigue: findings from a qualitative process evaluation.
BACKGROUND: Cancer-related fatigue is a distressing symptom experienced by many after cancer treatment.
An exploratory randomised controlled trial was conducted to test proof of concept of RESTORE: a web-based tool to enhance self-efficacy to manage cancer-related fatigue.
This paper reports findings from a qualitative process evaluation to determine feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and trial processes.
METHOD: Qualitative process evaluation carried out at the end of the trial to explore participants' experiences using semi-structured telephone interviews with a purposive sample of participants from both trial arms.
Normalisation Process Theory informed data collection and analysis.
Analysis involved directed content analysis within a Framework Approach.
RESULTS: Nineteen participants took part.
They understood the purpose and requirements of the trial and identified beneficial outcomes from taking part.
For the majority, the work of the trial was easily accommodated into daily routines and did not require new skills.
There were mixed views about the value of the information provided by RESTORE, depending on time since diagnosis and treatment.
Personal factors, constraints of the intervention, and environmental context inhibited the integration and embedding of RESTORE into everyday life.
Access to the intervention at an early stage in the treatment trajectory was important to effective utilisation, as were individual preferences for delivery of information.
CONCLUSION: The theoretical foundations of the intervention were sound.
Participants derived benefits from the intervention but barriers to implementation and integration suggest that RESTORE and the trial processes require some modification before testing in a full trial.
