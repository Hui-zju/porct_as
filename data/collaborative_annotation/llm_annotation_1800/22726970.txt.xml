<TEXT>The efficacy of apparent diffusion coefficient value calculation in differentiation between malignant and benign thyroid nodules.
PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) calculation in differentiation between malignant and benign thyroid nodules.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: A prospective study was conducted in 52 patients.
Diffusion-weighted echoplanar imaging was performed and b factors were taken as 0 and 400 s/mm(2).
RESULTS: The mean ADC value for malignant thyroid nodules was 0.829+/-0.179x10(-3) mm(2)/s and that for benign thyroid nodules was 1.984+/-0.482x10(-3) mm(2)/s.
The mean ADC value for malignant nodules was significantly lower than that for benign nodules (P=.0001).
CONCLUSION: ADC value calculation is an effective method in differentiation of malignant thyroid nodules from benign ones.</TEXT>
