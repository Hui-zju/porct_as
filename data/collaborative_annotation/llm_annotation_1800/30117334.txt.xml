<TEXT>Aflibercept plus FOLFIRI in Asian patients with pretreated metastatic colorectal cancer: a randomized Phase III study.
AIM: To investigate whether the benefit of combining aflibercept with 5-fluorouracil, folinic acid and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) chemotherapy could be confirmed in patients from the Asia-Pacific region (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01661270).
Patients &amp; methods: Asian patients with oxaliplatin-pretreated metastatic colorectal cancer were randomized to receive aflibercept or placebo, followed by FOLFIRI.
The primary end point was progression-free survival.
RESULTS: The intention-to-treat population comprised 332 patients.
A clinical supply misallocation resulted in 198/332 (60%) patients receiving at least one cycle of misallocated treatment.
Nevertheless, the addition of aflibercept to FOLFIRI was shown to improve progression-free survival (hazard ratio: 0.629; 95% CI: 0.488-0.812).
Adverse events were in line with expectations.
CONCLUSION: The beneficial treatment effect associated with the addition of aflibercept to FOLFIRI was confirmed in Asian patients with pretreated metastatic colorectal cancer.</TEXT>
