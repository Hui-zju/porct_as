<TEXT>Subgroup analysis of nelipepimut-S plus GM-CSF combined with trastuzumab versus trastuzumab alone to prevent recurrences in patients with high-risk, HER2 low-expressing breast cancer.
HER2-targeted therapy has not benefited patients with low levels of HER2 expression; however, combination therapy may be effective.
Primary analysis of a phase IIb trial investigating the HER2-derived vaccine nelipepimut-S (NPS) did not benefit the intention-to-treat population, but subset analysis showed a benefit in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients.
The subset analysis of this multicenter, randomized, single-blind, phase IIb trial identified significant improvement in 36-month disease-free survival (DFS) between NPS (n = 55) and placebo (n = 44) in TNBC (HR 0.25, p = 0.01) and those who express HLA-A24 (HR 0.41, p = 0.05).
The TNBC cohort demonstrated improved 36-month DFS in those with HER2 1+ expression (HR 0.17, p = 0.01), HLA-A24 positivity (HR 0.08, p &lt; 0.01), or in those who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (HR 0.21, p &lt; 0.01).
NPS vaccination with trastuzumab was associated with improved 36-month DFS among patients with TNBC.
The observed benefit to this high-risk subgroup warrants confirmation in a phase III trial.</TEXT>
