<TEXT>A randomized, open-label, phase I/II trial to investigate the maximum tolerated dose of the Polo-like kinase inhibitor BI 2536 in elderly patients with refractory/relapsed acute myeloid leukaemia.
Polo-like kinases (Plks) play an important role in cell cycle checkpoint controls and are over-expressed in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML).
BI 2536, a novel Plk inhibitor, induces mitotic arrest and apoptosis.
In this phase I/II trial of BI 2536 in 68 elderly patients with relapsed/refractory AML, three schedules were investigated (day 1, days 1-3, and days 1 + 8).
Maximum tolerated dose was 350 and 200 mg in the day 1 and days 1 + 8 schedules, respectively.
The day 1-3 schedule appeared equivalent to the day 1 schedule and was discontinued early.
BI 2536 exhibited multi-compartmental pharmacokinetic behaviour.
The majority of patients showed an increase of bone marrow cells in G2/M with a characteristic pattern of mitotic catastrophe.
The overall response rate in the day 1 and day 1 + 8 schedules was 9% (5/54) with 2 complete and 3 partial responses.
The majority of drug-related adverse events grade &gt;/=3 were haematological.
Taken together, Plk inhibition induced cell cycle arrest in AML blasts in vivo and BI 2536 monotherapy showed modest clinical activity in this poor prognosis patient group.</TEXT>
