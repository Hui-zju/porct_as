<TEXT>Randomized controlled trial on timing and number of sampling for bile aspiration cytology.
BACKGROUND: The issue on timing and number of bile sampling for exfoliative bile cytology is still unsettled.
METHODS: A total of 100 patients with cholangiocarcinoma undergoing resection after external biliary drainage were randomized into two groups: a 2-day group where bile was sampled five times per day for 2 days; and a 10-day group where bile was sampled once per day for 10 days (registered University Hospital Medical Information Network/ID 000005983).
The outcome of 87 patients who underwent laparotomy was analyzed, 44 in the 2-day group and 43 in the 10-day group.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in patient characteristics between the two groups.
Positivity after one sampling session was significantly lower in the 2-day group than in the 10-day group (17.0 +/- 3.7% vs. 20.7 +/- 3.5%, P = 0.034).
However, cumulative positivity curves were similar and overlapped each other between both groups.
The final cumulative positivity by the 10th sampling session was 52.3% in the 2-day group and 51.2% in the 10-day group.
We observed a small increase in cumulative positivity after the 5th or 6th session in both groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Bile cytology positivity is unlikely to be affected by sample time.</TEXT>
