<TEXT>Randomized phase 3 trial comparing 2 cisplatin dose schedules in 326 patients with locally advanced squamous cell cervical carcinoma: long-term follow-up.
OBJECTIVE: The evaluation of 5-year results obtained through 2 radiochemotherapy (RCT) regimens: cisplatin (CDDP), 20 mg/m x 5 days every 21 days; and CDDP, 40 mg/m per week in locally advanced cervical carcinoma.
METHODS/MATERIALS: In this single-institution prospective randomized phase 3 study, 326 patients with stage IIB to IIIB squamous cell cervical carcinoma treated from March 2003 to March 2005 were included.
One hundred sixty patients (49%) had stage IIB cervical carcinoma, 103 patients (31.5%) had stage IIIA cervical carcinoma, and 63 patients (19.5%) had stage IIIB cervical carcinoma.
The patients were randomly assigned to 2 therapeutic arms: 164 patients in arm A (5 days) concurrent RCT with CDDP, 20 mg/m per day, days 1 to 5 every 21 days; and 162 patients in arm B (weekly), concurrent RCT with CDDP, 40 mg/m per day weekly.
All patients were treated with external beam radiotherapy on the abdominopelvic region using 15-MV x-rays and a cervical boost using the x-rays arch technique or medium-dose-rate intracavitary brachytherapy.
RESULTS: The 5-year survival rate obtained through the 2 RCT regimens are not statistically different, even if a tendency of superiority can be observed in the 5-day arm as far as overall survival (78% in arm A vs 72% in arm B; p = 0.14) and disease-free survival (73% in arm A and 69% in arm B; p = 0.09) are concerned.
Five-year local relapse-free survival was significantly superior in the 5-day CDDP arm (87%) in comparison with the weekly CDDP arm (77%); p &lt; 0.01.
In the 5-day arm, local relapse rate was twice lower, 21/164 (13%), compared with the weekly arm, 40/162 (25%); p &lt; 0.01).
Distance failures were identical in the 2 therapeutic groups: 22/164 (13%) and 21/162 (13%), respectively, which shows the superiority of arm A regarding local control.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study demonstrate that RCT with cisplatin, 20 mg/m x 5 days every 21 days, is superior regarding local efficacy and is less toxic compared with the weekly chemotherapy regimen.</TEXT>
