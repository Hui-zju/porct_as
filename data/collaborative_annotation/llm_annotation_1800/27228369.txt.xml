<TEXT>Baseline AMH Level Associated With Ovulation Following Ovulation Induction in Women With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome.
CONTEXT: Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) reduces aromatase activity and sensitivity of follicles to FSH stimulation.
Therefore, elevated serum AMH may indicate a higher threshold for response to ovulation induction in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).
OBJECTIVE: This study sought to determine the association between AMH levels and ovulatory response to treatment among the women enrolled into the Pregnancy in PCOS II (PPCOS II) trial.
DESIGN AND SETTING: This was a secondary analysis of data from a randomized clinical trial in academic health centers throughout the United States Participants: A total of 748 women age 18-40 years, with PCOS and measured AMH levels at baseline, were included in this study.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Couples were followed for up to five treatment cycles to determine ovulation (midluteal serum progesterone &gt; 5 ng/mL) and the dose required to achieve ovulation.
RESULTS: A lower mean AMH and AMH per follicle was observed among women who ovulated compared with women who never achieved ovulation during the study (geometric mean AMH, 5.54 vs 7.35 ng/mL; P = .0001; geometric mean AMH per follicle, 0.14 vs 0.18; P = .01) after adjustment for age, body mass index, T, and insulin level.
As AMH levels increased, the dose of ovulation induction medication needed to achieve ovulation also increased.
No associations were observed between antral follicle count and ovulation.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that high serum AMH is associated with a reduced response to ovulation induction among women with PCOS.
Women with higher AMH levels may require higher doses of medication to achieve ovulation.</TEXT>
