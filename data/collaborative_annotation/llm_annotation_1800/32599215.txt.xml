<TEXT><![CDATA[Who Enrolls in an Online Cancer Survivorship Program? Reach of the INSPIRE Randomized Controlled Trial for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Survivors.
The internet can be a valuable tool in delivering survivorship care to hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) cancer survivors.
We describe the reach of INSPIRE, an Internet and social media-based randomized controlled trial, to address healthcare and psychosocial needs of HCT survivors.
All survivors 2-10 years after HCT for hematologic malignancy or myelodysplasia from 6 transplantation centers in the US were approached by mail and follow-up calls.
Eligible participants had access to the Internet, an email address, and did not have active disease in the past 2 years.
We used logistic regression to determine characteristics of eligible survivors who were more or less likely to enroll.
Of 2578 eligible HCT survivors, 1065 (41%) enrolled in the study.
The mean age of enrollees was 56.3 +/- 12.6 years (range, 19 to 89 years), 52% were male, and 94% were white.
Survivors less likely to enroll included those who were male, age <40 years, and who received an autologous transplant (all P < .001).
Compared with white survivors, African Americans were less likely to enroll (P < .001), whereas Native Americans/Alaska Natives were more likely to join the study (P = .03).
The reach of the INSPIRE program was broad, including to survivors who traditionally have less access to resources, such as Native Americans/Alaskan Natives and rural residents.
Strategies are still needed to improve the enrollment of online studies of survivorship resources for males, young adults, African American, and autologous HCT survivors because their use may improve outcomes.]]></TEXT>
