OBJECTIVES: Compare the effect of financial incentives on response to a cancer survivors' postal questionnaire.
STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Prostate cancer survivors in Ireland, 1.5-18 years after diagnosis, were randomized to the (1) "lottery" arm [a euro 1 lottery scratch card sent with the questionnaire (n = 2,413)] or (2) "prize" arm [entry into a draw on return of a completed questionnaire (n = 2,407)].
Impact of interventions on response overall and by survival period ("short term": < 5 years after diagnosis; "long term": >/= 5 years after diagnosis) was compared as was cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS: Adjusted response rate was 54.4%.
Response was higher among younger men (P < 0.001) and those with earlier stage disease (P = 0.002).
A modest 2.6% higher response rate was observed in the lottery compared with the prize arm [multivariate relative risk (RR) = 1.06; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.00, 1.11].
When stratified by survival period, higher response in the lottery arm was only observed among long-term survivors (multivariate RR = 1.10; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.19; short-term survivors: RR = 1.01; 95% CI: 0.94, 1.09).
Costs per completed questionnaire were euro 4.54 and euro 3.57 for the lottery and prize arms, respectively.
Compared with the prize arm, cost per additional questionnaire returned in the lottery arm was euro 25.65.
CONCLUSION: Although more expensive, to optimize response to postal questionnaires among cancer survivors, researchers might consider inclusion of a lottery scratch card.]]></TEXT>
