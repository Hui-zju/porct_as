<TEXT>A theory-driven psycho-educational intervention programme for gynaecological cancer patients during treatment trajectory: A randomised controlled trial.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the effects of a theory-driven psycho-educational intervention programme on uncertainty in illness, anxiety, and sexual functioning in a cohort of Chinese patients with gynaecological cancer.
METHODS: Women with newly diagnosed gynaecological cancer (n = 202) received either a four-session, 12-week-long, culturally appropriate psycho-educational intervention programme (n = 102) or attention from intervener (n = 100) in a two-group randomised controlled trial.
Patient-reported measures included Chinese version of Mishel's Uncertainty in Illness Scale (C-MUIS), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)-Anxiety subscale, and Sexual Function-Vaginal Changes Questionnaire (SVQ).
Data regarding uncertainty in illness and anxiety were collected at baseline and postintervention, while data on sexual functioning were collected postintervention.
RESULTS: Patients receiving psycho-educational intervention reported significantly greater reductions in ambiguity, inconsistency, and overall uncertainty in illness, as measured by C-MUIS (P &lt; .01).
They were also more likely to be sexually active (P = .037), report their partners having greater sexual interest (P = .008), and perceive a significantly greater level of intimacy (P = .001) in the SVQ.
CONCLUSIONS: Given the growing population of gynaecological cancer survivors and the universal side effects of the disease and its related treatments, the established design and content of the psycho-educational intervention programme should be incorporated into routine clinical practice.</TEXT>
