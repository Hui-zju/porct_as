<TEXT>Radiation-free weekend rescued! Continuous accelerated irradiation of 7-days per week is equal to accelerated fractionation with concomitant boost of 7 fractions in 5-days per week: report on phase 3 clinical trial in head-and-neck cancer patients.
PURPOSE: To report long-term results of randomized trial comparing 2 accelerated fractionations of definitive radiation therapy assessing the need to irradiate during weekend in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 345 patients with SCC of the oral cavity, larynx, and oro- or hypo-pharynx, stage T2-4N0-1M0, were randomized to receive continuous accelerated irradiation (CAIR: once per day, 7 days per week) or concomitant accelerated boost (CB: once per day, 3 days per week, and twice per day, 2 days per week).
Total dose ranged from 66.6-72 Gy, dose per fraction was 1.8 Gy, number of fractions ranged from 37-40 fractions, and overall treatment time ranged from 37-40 days.
RESULTS: No differences for all trial end-points were noted.
At 5 and 10 years, the actuarial rates of local-regional control were 63% and 60% for CAIR vs 65% and 60% for CB, and the corresponding overall survival were 40% and 25% vs 44% and 25%, respectively.
Confluent mucositis was the main acute toxicity, with an incidence of 89% in CAIR and 86% in CB patients.
The 5-year rate of grade 3-4 late radiation morbidity was 6% for both regimens.
CONCLUSIONS: Results of this trial indicate that the effects of accelerated fractionation can be achieve by delivering twice-per-day irradiation on weekday(s).
This trial has also confirmed that an accelerated, 6-weeks schedule is a reasonable option for patients with intermediate-stage head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma because of the associated high cure rate and minimal severe late toxicity.</TEXT>
