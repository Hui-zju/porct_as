<TEXT>Preoperative tranexamic acid does not reduce transfusion rates in major oncologic surgery: Results of a randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled trial.
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Allogeneic blood transfusions are associated with worse postoperative outcomes in oncologic surgery.
The aim of this study was to introduce a preoperative intervention to reduce transfusion rates in this population.
METHODS: Adult patients undergoing major oncologic surgery in five categories with similar transfusion rates were recruited.
Enrollees received a single preoperative intravenous dose of placebo or tranexamic acid (1000 mg).
The primary outcome measure was perioperative transfusion rate.
Secondary outcome measures included: estimated blood loss, thromboembolic events, morbidity, hospital length of stay, and readmission rate.
RESULTS: Seventy-six patients were enrolled, 39 in the tranexamic acid group and 37 in the placebo group, respectively.
Demographics and surgery type were equivalent between groups.
The transfusion rates were 8 out of 39 (20.5%) in the tranexamic acid group and 5 out of 37 (13.5%) in the placebo group, respectively (P = .418).
Median estimated blood loss was 400 mL (interquartile range [IQR] = 150-600) in the tranexamic acid group compared with 300 mL (IQR = 150-800) in the placebo group (P = .983).
There was one pulmonary embolism in each arm and no deep venous thrombosis (P &gt; .999).
CONCLUSION: Preoperative administration of tranexamic acid at a 1000 mg intravenous dose does not decrease transfusion rates or estimated blood loss in patients undergoing major oncologic surgery.</TEXT>
