<TEXT>Delay discounting and adjuvant endocrine therapy adherence in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.
OBJECTIVES: Oral endocrine therapy improves survival among hormone responsive breast cancer (HRBC) survivors; however, 30-70% of patients are nonadherent.
One patient-centered factor that may impact adherence is delay discounting (DD), or the degree to which patients value future outcomes.
In prior research, DD is robustly associated with maladaptive health behavior; but no work to our knowledge has examined delay discounting and medication nonadherence in breast cancer patients.
Study 1 examined cross-sectional associations between DD and endocrine therapy nonadherence.
Study 2 examined whether DD in the HRBC population is amenable to a brief intervention-episodic future thinking (EFT), in which participants preexperience future events.
METHOD: In Study 1, HRBC survivors completed assessments of DD and endocrine therapy adherence (pill count and self-report).
In Study 2, participants were randomized to engage in a brief behavioral intervention (EFT) or a control condition, and again completed assessments of DD.
RESULTS: Eighty nine female HRBC survivors completed Studies 1 and 2.
Controlling for other known risk factors, greater DD was significantly associated with poorer pill-count but not self-report adherence.
In Study 2, the EFT intervention significantly reduced DD when compared to control episodic thinking.
CONCLUSIONS: DD is associated with direct-observation (pill count) measures of endocrine therapy adherence in HRBC survivors, suggesting it is a potential therapeutic target for improving adherence.
This target is also amenable to intervention with EFT.
