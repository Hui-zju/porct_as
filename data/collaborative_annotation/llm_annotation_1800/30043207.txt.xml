<TEXT>Randomized controlled clinical trial of polyethylene glycol recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor in the treatment of neutropenia after chemotherapy for breast cancer.
PURPOSE: To explore the efficacy and safety of daily administration of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF), and a single subcutaneous injection of polyethylene glycol recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (PEG-rhG-CSF, a sustained-duration rhG-CSF) in neutropenia induced after chemotherapy.
METHODS: Each patient received two cycles of chemotherapy.
In the trial cycle, the patients received a single subcutaneous injection of PEG-rhG-CSF 100 microg/kg 72 h after completion of chemotherapy; and in the control cycle, rhG-CSF 5 microg/kg/day was subcutaneous injected once a day which began 72 h after completion of chemotherapy for continued 14 days or until the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) was &gt;/= 10.0 x 10(9)/l twice.
Therapeutic effect on primary endpoint was the incidence and duration of grade IV ANC neutropenia: comparing the incidence and the mean time of duration of PEG-rhG-CSF with those of rhG-CSF under the circumstance of ANC &lt; 0.5 x 109/l.
The immune populations evaluated included, CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and NK cells.
RESULTS: After chemotherapy, comparing to PEG-rhG-CSF, the CD4/CD8 ratio (0.84 +/- 0.19 vs.1.06 +/- 0.25) and the number of NK cells of rhG-CSF group (12.18 +/- 2.13 vs. 15.78 +/- 2.57) decreased significantly.
The number of NK cells (12.18 +/- 2.13 vs. 13.78 +/- 2.57) of rhG-CSF group after chemotherapy is significantly less than that before chemotherapy, and the number of CD3+ (54.31 +/- 7.51 vs. 57.96 +/- 5.55), CD4+ (26.28 +/- 6.25 vs. 29.48 +/- 6.44), CD8+ (29.97 +/- 6.47 vs. 31.68 +/- 5.96) is lower than that before chemotherapy in rhG-CSF group, but the difference is not significant.
CONCLUSION: The efficacy and side effects of a single subcutaneous injection of PEG-rhG-CSF were similar to that of rhG-CSF multiple administrations.
PEG-rhG-CSF may have the effect of promoting immune function repairing.</TEXT>
