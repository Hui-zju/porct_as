<TEXT>Transrectal Natural Orifice Specimen Extraction (NOSE) With Oncological Safety: A Prospective and Randomized Trial.
BACKGROUND: In the present paper, we introduce our experience with the novel method during laparoscopic anterior resection of upper rectal or sigmoid colon cancer by transrectal natural orifice specimen extraction (NOSE).
METHODS: A prospective randomized controlled trial was performed from June 2016 to May 2019.
Patients with upper rectal or sigmoid colon cancer were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the NOSE group and the non-NOSE group.
Preoperative and postoperative clinical variables were analyzed and compared between groups.
Postoperative pain was analyzed utilizing a visual analog scale.
Postoperative overall survival was analyzed using a Kaplan-Meier curve.
RESULTS: A total of 276 patients were enrolled, of whom 254 were randomly divided into the NOSE group (n = 122) and the conventional laparoscopic group (n = 119).
NOSE failed in 22 cases, which were converted to transabdominal specimen extraction.
Intention-to-treat analysis was performed, and these 22 cases were included in the NOSE group.
The incidence of postoperative complications was significantly lower in the NOSE group (11/122, 9%) than in the non-NOSE group (25/119, 21%).
The NOSE group had a longer operation time, less blood loss, and a lower postoperative visual analog scale score than the non-NOSE group.
The time for intestinal function recovery (ventilation) and the length of hospital stay were significantly longer in the non-NOSE group.
The Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed no statistically significant difference in the disease-free survival rate between the NOSE group and the non-NOSE group.
CONCLUSIONS: The novel NOSE method is safe and feasible to use in patients having colorectal cancer.
Compared with traditional laparoscopic surgery, the postoperative complication rates of NOSE surgery were lower with an improved short-term clinical recovery.</TEXT>
