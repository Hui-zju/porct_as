<TEXT><![CDATA[Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy for Locally Advanced Squamous Carcinoma of Oral Cavity: a Pilot Study.
To evaluate the effect of adding neoadjuvant chemotherapy to surgery and radiation therapy for locally advanced resectable oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma, 24 patients with T3 or T4a oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma were randomly assigned to surgery alone or Docetaxel, Cisplatin, and 5-FU (TPF) induction chemotherapy followed by surgery.
All patients were planned to receive chemoradiotherapy after surgery.
The primary end-points were organ preservation and progression-free-survival.
SPSS version 17 was used for data analysis.
Median follow-up was 16 months.
The median age of the patients was 62 years old (23-75 years).
Man/woman ratio was 1.13.
The primary site of the tumor was the tongue in most patients (48%).
No significant difference was observed between pathologic characteristics of the two groups.
Chemotherapy group showed 16% complete pathologic response to TPF.
No significant difference in organ preservation surgery or overall survival was detected.
However, the patients in the chemotherapy group had longer progression-free-survival (P=0.014).
Surgery followed by chemoradiotherapy with or without TPF induction results in similar survival time.
However, progression-free-survival improves with the TPF induction chemotherapy.
Studies with more patents and new strategies are recommended to evaluate organ preservation improvement and long-term outcomes.]]></TEXT>
