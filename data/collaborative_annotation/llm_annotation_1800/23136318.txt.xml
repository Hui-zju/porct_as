<TEXT>Association of speculum lubrication with pain and Papanicolaou test accuracy.
PURPOSE: To determine the effects of lubrication of the vaginal speculum before insertion during a Papanicolaou test on perceived pain and quality of the cytology specimen.
METHODS: Four hundred eligible women participating in cervical cancer screening and an early detection program were randomized with respect to lubricant gel use before speculum insertion.
Perceived pain during speculum insertion and cytology results were assessed in study groups.
RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 45.7 years (range, 23-77 years).
Pain score of the NO GEL group was significantly higher than that of the GEL group (2.3 and 1.6, respectively; P &lt; .05).
For premenopausal women, lubricant gel use significantly reduced the pain scores of the participants (P &lt; .05).
Cytological interpretations of the Papanicolaou test specimens were comparable among all groups.
CONCLUSIONS: During the collection of Papanicolaou test specimens, lubrication of the vaginal speculum with a small amount of K-Y Jelly (a water-soluble lubricant gel) decreases the pain associated with insertion of the vaginal speculum among postmenopausal women without obscuring the cytological interpretation of conventional or liquid-based cytology.
In women of reproductive age, lubrication of the speculum with K-Y Jelly does not cause a meaningful effect with respect to perceived pain.</TEXT>
