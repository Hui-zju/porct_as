<TEXT>Open sphincter-preserving surgery of extraperitoneal rectal cancer without primary stoma and Fast Track Protocol.
AIM: Fast track protocol (FTP) showed to improve perioperative care.
The study aims to evaluate the impact of the FTP in the open extraperitoneal rectal cancer (ERC) surgical treatment without a primary derivative stoma (DS) and the QoL in patients with or without a secondary DS.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: 50 patients affected by ERC were enrolled and operated on with open low anterior resection without a primary DS.
They were randomized in two groups: one was treated perioperativelly in the traditional way (group T), the other using a modif ed FTP (group FT).
A QoL questionnaire was administered prior to discharge and at 1-month follow-up.
RESULTS: Five courses (10%) were complicated by anastomotic leakage: 3 (12%) in the FT group (2 minor and 1 maior) and 2 (8%) in the T group (1 minor and 1 maior) (p=n.s.).
All the maiors and one minor were treated with a DS.
Patients of the group FTP were considered dischargeable earlier that those of group T (p&lt;0.05).
Patients with DS had a significantly lower QoL score (p&lt;0.0001).
CONCLUSION: FTP with minor modifications is feasible and safe in the ERC open surgery without using a DS.
Better results were obtained without increasing complication rate.
A secondary DS impacts detrimentally on QoL.</TEXT>
