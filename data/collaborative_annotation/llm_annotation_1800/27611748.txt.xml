<TEXT>Effectiveness of Positioning Stents in Radiation-Induced Xerostomia in Patients with Tongue Carcinoma: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to perform an objective and subjective evaluation of the efficacy of positioning stents in radiation-induced xerostomia in patients with tongue carcinoma.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 30 patients with tongue carcinoma and undergoing conventional radiotherapy were randomly assigned to control (n = 15) and study (n = 15) groups, without and with a positioning stent, respectively.
Assessment of salivary output reduction was done before and after radiotherapy, at 3- and 6-month intervals, by measurement of unstimulated and stimulated salivary flow rates (objective evaluation).
Xerostomia (subjective evaluation) was noted using six items from the Quality of Life Head and Neck Module (QLQ-H&amp;N35) as proposed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer.
The significance level was set at .05.
RESULTS: Mean unstimulated and stimulated salivary flow rates at 3- and 6-month intervals revealed significantly (P &lt; .05) higher scores for the study group as compared with the control group.
The mean quality of life scores in the study group were significantly (P &lt; .05) lower compared with the control group.
CONCLUSION: The use of a positioning stent minimized radiation-induced xerostomia and its symptoms.</TEXT>
