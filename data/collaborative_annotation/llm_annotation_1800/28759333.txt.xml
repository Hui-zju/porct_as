<TEXT>Do Pattern-Focused Visuals Improve Skin Self-Examination Performance? Explicating the Visual Skill Acquisition Model.
Skin self-examination (SSE) consists of routinely checking the body for atypical moles that might be cancerous.
Identifying atypical moles is a visual task; thus, SSE training materials utilize pattern-focused visuals to cultivate this skill.
Despite widespread use, researchers have yet to explicate how pattern-focused visuals cultivate visual skill.
Using eye tracking to capture the visual scanpaths of a sample of laypersons (N = 92), the current study employed a 2 (pattern: ABCDE vs. ugly duckling sign [UDS]) x 2 (presentation: photorealistic images vs. illustrations) factorial design to assess whether and how pattern-focused visuals can increase layperson accuracy in identifying atypical moles.
Overall, illustrations resulted in greater sensitivity, while photos resulted in greater specificity.
The UDS x photorealistic condition showed greatest specificity.
For those in the photo condition with high self-efficacy, UDS increased specificity directly.
For those in the photo condition with self-efficacy levels at the mean or lower, there was a conditional indirect effect such that these individuals spent a larger amount of their viewing time observing the atypical moles, and time on target was positively related to specificity.
Illustrations provided significant gains in specificity for those with low-to-moderate self-efficacy by increasing total fixation time on the atypical moles.
Findings suggest that maximizing visual processing efficiency could enhance existing SSE training techniques.</TEXT>
