<TEXT>A randomized, controlled, phase II clinical trial of beta-D-mannuronic acid (M2000) in pre-surgical breast cancer patients at early stage (T1-T2).
Following the potent efficacy of beta-D-Mannuronic acid in a breast cancer murine model, we evaluated the efficacy of this novel non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug in breast cancer patients in the present clinical trial.
The study was an 8-week randomized, controlled, phase II clinical trial (IRCT: 2017012213739N7 (in 48 pre-surgical breast cancer patients.
Patients who had breast cancer at early stage, with invasive ductal carcinoma, were placed on a waiting-list for surgery and were allocated to the study.
beta-D-Mannuronic was administrated at a dose of two capsules (1000 mg/d) orally during a period of 8 weeks.
The end point of this study was when the patients were admitted for surgery.
Moreover, the patients' well-being status was followed up on for safety.
There were no statistically significant differences between treatment and non-treatment groups at baseline.
beta-D-Mannuronic acid therapy, from 20 patients, showed that in one patient (5%) tumour size was decreased; in five patients (25%) tumour growth was stopped; and in 14 patients (70%) the growth rate in the treatment group did not show significant change, compared to the non-treatment group.
Evaluation of two tumour markers (carcinoembryonic antigen and cancer antigen 15-3) showed that there was no significant difference between before and after treatment.
Although the use of some non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in a long time period has shown a prophylactic effect in breast cancer, their therapeutic efficacy in a short time period is unknown, whereas treatment with beta-D-Mannuronic acid during 8 weeks could show 30% therapeutic effects in pre-surgical breast cancer patients.</TEXT>
