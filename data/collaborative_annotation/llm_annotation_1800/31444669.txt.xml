<TEXT>Low-Frequency Sonophoresis of Chinese Medicine Formula Improves Efficacy of Malignant Pleural Effusion Treatment.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether low-frequency ultrasound-facilitated transdermal delivery of a Chinese medicine (CM) formula could improve the efficacy of intrapleural administration of interleukin-2 (IL-2) in treatment of malignant pleural effusion (MPE).
METHODS: A total of 110 eligible participants were randomized into the low-frequency sonophoresis (LFS) of CM (LSF/CM) group (55 cases) and the control group (55 cases) by simple randomization using a random number table.
The control group was treated with an intrapleural administration of IL-2; and the LFS/CM group was treated with LFS of a CM gel formulation, combined with the same IL-2 injection as in the control group.
The CM formula consisted of Semen Lepidii, Semen Sinapis, Ramulus Cinnamomi, Poriacocos, Herba Lycopi, and Radix Paeoniae Rubra.
After 2-week treatment, the therapeutic outcome was determined by the change of the amount of MPE, which was evaluated by B-scan ultrasound and/or chest X-ray, and the change of quality of life (QOL) scores, which were evaluated by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status.
RESULTS: A significantly higher objective remission rate (ORR) was obtained with intrapleural IL-2 plus LFS/CM than IL-2 treatment alone (P=0.049).
In addition, more patients in the LFS/CM group than in the control group had an improved QOL score (P=0.048), and no patients in the LFS/CM group had a reduced QOL.
CONCLUSION: LFS of CM formulation could effectively alleviate MPE and improve the QOL of cancer patients.</TEXT>
