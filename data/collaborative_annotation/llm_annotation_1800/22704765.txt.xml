<TEXT>Transumbilical versus transvaginal retrieval of surgical specimens at laparoscopy: a randomized trial.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to compare transumbilical (TU) and transvaginal (TV) route for retrieval of surgical specimens at laparoscopy.
STUDY DESIGN: Women scheduled for a laparoscopic resection of an adnexal mass were randomized to have their surgical specimen removed either through a posterior colpotomy (n = 34) or the umbilical port site (n = 32).
Group allocation was concealed from patients and bedside clinicians.
The primary outcome was postoperative incisional pain assessed by a 10-cm visual analog scale at 1, 3, and 24 hours after surgery.
RESULTS: TV retrieval caused less postoperative pain than TU specimen extraction at each time point (visual analog scale score at 1 hour: 2.6 +/- 2.9 vs 1.2 +/- 2.0, P = .03; at 3 hours: 2.4 +/- 2.0 vs 1.4 +/- 2.0, P = .02; and at 24 hours: 1.1 +/- 1.5 vs 0.5 +/- 1.4, P = .02).
A higher proportion of women in the TU group than in the TV group indicated the umbilicus as the most painful area at 1 and 3 hours postoperatively.
Two months after surgery, the participants scored similarly as to their overall satisfaction, cosmetic outcome, and dyspareunia upon resumption of intercourse.
CONCLUSION: A TV approach for specimen removal after laparoscopic resection of adnexal masses offers the advantage of less postoperative pain than TU retrieval.</TEXT>
