<TEXT>Serum C-Telopeptide Collagen Crosslinks and Plasma Soluble VEGFR2 as Pharmacodynamic Biomarkers in a Trial of Sequentially Administered Sunitinib and Cilengitide.
PURPOSE: Fit-for-purpose pharmacodynamic biomarkers could expedite development of combination antiangiogenic regimens.
Plasma sVEGFR2 concentrations ([sVEGFR2]) mark sunitinib effects on the systemic vasculature.
We hypothesized that cilengitide would impair microvasculature recovery during sunitinib withdrawal and could be detected through changes in [sVEGFR2].
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Advanced solid tumor patients received 50 mg sunitinib daily for 14 days.
For the next 14 days, patients were randomized to arm A (cilengitide 2,000 mg administered intravenously twice weekly) or arm B (no treatment).
The primary endpoint was change in [sVEGFR2] between days 14 and 28.
A candidate pharmacodynamic biomarker of cilengitide inhibition of integrin alphavbeta3, serum c-telopeptide collagen crosslinks (CTx), was also measured.
RESULTS: Of 21 patients, 14 (7 per arm) received all treatments without interruption and had all blood samples available for analysis.
The mean change and SD of [sVEGFR2] for all sunitinib-treated patients was consistent with previous data.
There was no significant difference in the mean change in [sVEGFR2] from days 14 to 28 between the arms [arm A: 2.8 ng/mL; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.1-3.6 vs. arm B: 2.0 ng/mL; 95% CI, 0.72-3.4; P = 0.22, 2-sample t test].
Additional analyses suggested (i) prior bevacizumab therapy to be associated with unusually low baseline [sVEGFR2] and (ii) sunitinib causes measurable changes in CTx.
CONCLUSIONS: Cilengitide had no measurable effects on any circulating biomarkers.
Sunitinib caused measurable declines in serum CTx.
The properties of [sVEGFR2] and CTx observed in this study inform the design of future combination antiangiogenic therapy trials.</TEXT>
