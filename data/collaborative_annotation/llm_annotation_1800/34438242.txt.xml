<TEXT>Potential role of CMPK1, SLC29A1, and TLE4 polymorphisms in gemcitabine-based chemotherapy in HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer patients: pharmacogenetic study results from the prospective randomized phase II study of eribulin plus gemcitabine versus paclitaxel plus gemcitabine (KCSG-BR-13-11).
BACKGROUND: In this study, we evaluated the association between genetic polymorphisms of 23 genes associated with gemcitabine metabolism and the clinical efficacy of gemcitabine in breast cancer patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective, pharmacogenetic study was conducted in cooperation with a phase II clinical trial.
A total of 103 genetic polymorphisms of the 23 genes involved in gemcitabine transport and metabolism were selected for genotyping.
The associations of genetic polymorphisms with overall survival, progression-free survival (PFS), and 6-month PFS were analyzed.
RESULTS: A total of 91 breast cancer patients were enrolled in this study.
In terms of 6-month PFS, rs1044457 in CMPK1 was the most significant genetic polymorphism [55.9% for CT and TT and 78.9% for CC, P &lt; 0.001, hazard ratio (HR): 4.444, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.905-10.363].
For the rs693955 in SLC29A1, the median duration of PFS was 5.4 months for AA and 10.5 months for CA and CC (P = 0.002, HR: 3.704, 95% CI: 1.615-8.497).
For the rs2807312 in TLE4, the median duration of PFS was 5.7 months for TT and 10.4 months for CT and CC (P = 0.005, HR: 4.948, 95% CI: 1.612-15.190).
In survival analysis with a multi-gene model, the TT genotype of rs2807312 had the worst PFS regardless of other genetic polymorphisms, whereas the CA genotype of rs693955 or the CT genotype of rs2807312 without the AA genotype of rs693955 had the best PFS compared with those of other genetic groups (P &lt; 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Genetic polymorphisms of rs1044457 in CMPK1, rs693955 in SLC29A1, and rs2807312 in TLE4 were significantly associated with the 6-month PFS rate and/or the duration of PFS.
Further studies with a larger sample size and expression study would be helpful to validate the association of genetic polymorphisms and clinical efficacy of gemcitabine.</TEXT>
