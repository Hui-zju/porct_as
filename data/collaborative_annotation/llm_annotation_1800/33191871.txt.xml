<TEXT>Resilient youth with neurofibromatosis: Less perceived stress and greater life satisfaction after an 8-week virtual mind-body intervention.
OBJECTIVES: The neurofibromatoses (NF) are rare, incurable genetic disorders.
Adolescents with NF report greater stress and lower life satisfaction compared to same-age peers.
We report on changes in life satisfaction and perceived stress following an 8-week single-blind, virtual randomized controlled trial of a mind-body intervention versus an educational control.
METHODS: Adolescents (N = 51) completed measures at baseline, post-treatment (N = 45), and 6 months later (N = 39).
RESULTS: Adolescents were geographically diverse, 41% female, and 76% White.
Adolescents randomized to the intervention had greater improvements from baseline to post-test in stress compared to those in control; these were maintained through 6 months.
Those randomized to intervention also reported greater improvement in life satisfaction from baseline to 6 months.
CONCLUSIONS: The NF tailored mind-body program resulted in sustained reduction in stress and improved life satisfaction.
A virtual model of mind-body care may help adolescents who face other chronic medical illness.</TEXT>
