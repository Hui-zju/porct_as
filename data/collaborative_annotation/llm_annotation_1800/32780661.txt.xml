<TEXT>Hypofractionated Versus Conventional Fractionated Radiotherapy After Breast-Conserving Surgery in the Modern Treatment Era: A Multicenter, Randomized Controlled Trial From China.
PURPOSE: No randomized trials have compared hypofractionated radiotherapy (HFRT) with conventional fractionated radiotherapy (CFRT) after breast-conserving surgery in the Asian population.
This study aimed to determine whether a 3.5-week schedule of HFRT is noninferior to a standard 6-week schedule of CFRT in China.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients from 4 Chinese institutions who had undergone breast-conserving surgery and had T1-2N0-3 invasive breast cancers participated this study.
Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) using a computer-generated central randomization schedule, without stratification, to receive whole-breast irradiation with or without nodal irradiation, followed by tumor-bed boost, either at a dose of 50 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks with a boost of 10 Gy in five fractions over 1 week (CFRT) or 43.5 Gy in 15 fractions over 3 weeks with a boost of 8.7 Gy in three daily fractions (HFRT).
The primary endpoint was 5-year local recurrence (LR), and a 5% margin of 5-year LR was used to establish noninferiority.
RESULTS: Between August 2010 and November 2015, 734 patients were assigned to the HFRT (n = 368) or CFRT (n = 366) group.
At a median follow-up of 73.5 months (interquartile range, 60.5-91.4 months), the 5-year cumulative incidence of LR was 1.2% in the HFRT group and 2.0% in the CFRT group (hazard ratio, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.20 to 1.88; P = .017 for noninferiority).
There were no significant differences in acute and late toxicities, except that the HFRT group had less grade 2-3 acute skin toxicity than the CFRT group (P = .019).
CONCLUSION: CFRT and HFRT with a tumor-bed boost may have similar low LR and toxicity.</TEXT>
