<TEXT>Sacrocolpopexy with polypropylene tape as valuable surgical modification during cystectomy with orthotopic ileal bladder: functional results.
Introduction.
Urinary diversion is very often associated with urinary retention and urinary incontinence.
In this study, a surgical modification during cystectomy with orthotopic ileal neobladder is presented.
Material and Methods.
Female patients enrolled in the study (n-24) were subjected to sacrocolpopexy during the operation.
Apart from oncological control, the follow-up consisted of 1-hour inlay test and questionnaires (UDI-6 and IIQ-7) in the 3rd, 6th, and 12th month after the operation.
In the 12th month after the surgery, the urodynamic pressure-flow test was performed.
Outcomes were compared with the control group (n-18) in which sacrocolpopexy was not implemented.
Results.
The study group was characterised by reduced urinary retention and improved continence.
Conclusion.
Sacrocolpopexy during cystectomy with orthotopic ileal bladder is a valuable surgical method which provides patients with a better quality of life.</TEXT>
