<TEXT>Conventional vs machine learning-based treatment planning in prostate brachytherapy: Results of a Phase I randomized controlled trial.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the noninferiority of Day 30 dosimetry between a machine learning-based treatment planning system for prostate low-dose-rate (LDR) brachytherapy and the conventional, manual planning technique.
As a secondary objective, the impact of planning technique on clinical workflow efficiency was also evaluated.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 41 consecutive patients who underwent I-125 LDR monotherapy for low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer were accrued into this single-institution study between 2017 and 2018.
Patients were 1:1 randomized to receive treatment planning using a machine learning-based prostate implant planning algorithm (PIPA system) or conventional, manual technique.
Treatment plan modifications by the radiation oncologist were evaluated by computing the Dice coefficient of the prostate V150% isodose volume between either the PIPA-or conventional-and final approved plans.
Additional evaluations between groups evaluated the total planning time and dosimetric outcomes at preimplant and Day 30.
RESULTS: 21 and 20 patients were treated using the PIPA and conventional techniques, respectively.
No significant differences were observed in preimplant or Day 30 prostate D90%, V100%, rectum V100, or rectum D1cc between PIPA and conventional techniques.
Although the PIPA group had a larger proportion of patients with plans requiring no modifications (Dice = 1.00), there was no significant difference between the magnitude of modifications between each arm.
There was a large significant advantage in mean planning time for the PIPA arm (2.38 +/- 0.96 min) compared with the conventional (43.13 +/- 58.70 min) technique (p &gt;&gt; 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: A machine learning-based planning workflow for prostate LDR brachytherapy has the potential to offer significant time savings and operational efficiencies, while producing noninferior postoperative dosimetry to that of expert, conventional treatment planners.</TEXT>
