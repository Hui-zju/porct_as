<TEXT>Percutaneous lung biopsies: performance of an optical CT-based navigation system with a low-dose protocol.
OBJECTIVES: To compare patients' radiation exposure, technical feasibility, imaging quality and complication rate of percutaneous lung biopsies (PLBs) performed with a low-dose (LD) CT protocol under guidance of an optical navigation system.
METHODS: Fifty-two consecutive patients with suspected malignant lung lesions were enrolled and randomised into group 1 (PLBs under the guidance of the navigation system) and group 2 (PLBs under the guidance navigation system with an LD protocol).
Patients' demographics, lesion features, procedure-related variables and CT image quality for group 2 were recorded and compared.
RESULTS: Technical success was 100 % in both groups.
The radiation dose to patients' chest was significantly lower in group 2 than in group 1 (group 1: mean TDLP 206 +/- 59 mGy.cm, ~ 3.5 +/-
1.0 mSv; group 2: 54.2 +/- 46.2 mGy.cm, ~ 0.92 +/- 0.78 mSv; P &lt; 0.0001).
The PNX rate was 12 % in group 1 and 11.1 % in group 2.
The haemoptysis rate was 8.0 % in group 1 and 3.7 % in group 2.
CT image quality obtained in group 2 was always rated as adequate and as excellent in 15 cases (56.0 %).
CONCLUSIONS: An optical navigation system with LD CT protocol is useful for performing lung biopsies with decreased patient radiation exposure.
KEY POINTS: * Navigation systems are useful tools in percutaneous imaging-guided procedures. * For lung biopsies, low-dose (LD) CT protocols may be used.
* Combining LD protocols with optical CT navigation results in significantly reduced radiation exposure.</TEXT>
