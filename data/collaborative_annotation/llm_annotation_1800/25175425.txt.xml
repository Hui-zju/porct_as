<TEXT>Molecular profiling of ETS gene rearrangements in patients with prostate cancer registered in REDEEM clinical trial.
OBJECTIVE: Androgen-induced E26 transformation-specific (ETS) gene fusion-positive tumors have been associated with aggressive prostate cancer.
The aim is to evaluate the ETS gene rearrangement status on initial biopsy of patients registered in the Reduction by Dutasteride of Clinical Progression Events in Expectant Management trial study and determine if gene fusion status was associated with disease progression.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Initial biopsy material from 146 men registered in Reduction by Dutasteride of Clinical Progression Events in Expectant Management trial study treated with dutasteride (73/146, 50%) and as placebo (73/146, 50%) were reviewed, and ERG and SPINK1 immunohistochemistry was performed.
ERG- and SPINK1-negative cancer samples were evaluated for ETV1, ETV4, and ETV5 rearrangements by fluorescence in situ hybridization.
Frequency of ETS gene aberrations in both groups was correlated with cancer progression including prostate-specific antigen progression, Gleason progression, and progression-free survival by logistic analysis, pairwise differences, and chunk likelihood ratio tests for the genotype groups.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Of the 146 patients, 99 (67.8%) (placebo, 51; dutasteride, 48) samples displayed the following Gleason patterns: 3+3 = 6 in 80 (54.8%) (placebo, 39; dutasteride, 41), 3+4 = 7 in 18 (12.3%) (placebo, 11; dutasteride, 7), and 4+4 = 8 in 1(0.68%) (placebo, 1).
The remaining 47 samples showed atypical glands in 5 (3.4%) (placebo, 2; dutasteride, 3), HGPIN in 9 (6.1%) (placebo, 5; dutasteride, 4), and benign in 33 (22.6%) (placebo, 15; dutasteride, 18).
Immunohistochemistry findings were positive for ERG and SPINK1 in 56 (56%) (placebo, 31; dutasteride, 25) and 9 (6.1%) (placebo, 5; dutasteride, 4) cases, respectively.
ETV1 and ETV4 rearrangements were noted in 2 cases (1.4%) (placebo, 1; dutasteride, 1) and 1 (0.7%) (placebo, 1) case, respectively.
No significant differences in the incidence of prostate cancer molecular aberrations between the groups were observed.
There was no evidence that ETS fusion status was associated with disease progression.</TEXT>
