<TEXT>Outcomes of Two Treatments for Uncomplicated Pilonidal Sinus Disease: Karydakis Flap Procedure and Sinus Tract Ablation Procedure Using a 1,470 nm Diode Laser Combined With Pit Excision.
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: An ideal treatment for pilonidal disease should feature a low recurrence rate, minimal incision, and rapid return to daily activities.
We compared the outcomes of the well-defined Karydakis technique (KT) and a combination of pit excision (PE) and sinus tract ablation using 1,470-nm diode laser.
STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, from January 2016 to January 2018, patients diagnosed with uncomplicated early-stage pilonidal sinus disease were enrolled and were treated randomly, using KT (n = 28) or a PE/laser ablation technique (PE + LAT; n = 30).
RESULTS: The mean operative times were 36.4 (25-45) minutes in the KT group and 15.1 (12-20) minutes in the PE + LAT group.
Postoperative Visual Analog Scale pain scores were 4.4 in the KT group and 2.1 in the PE + LAT group.
The time periods to return to normal daily activities were 2.6 (1-5) days in the PE + LAT group and 12.8 (10-20) days in the KT group.
The mean Likert satisfaction scores were 3.8 in the KT group and 4.8 in the PE + LAT group.
The groups did not differ in terms of recurrence.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the KT, the PE + LAT was associated with a shorter operative time, a more rapid return to normal activities, less pain, and a higher level of subjective satisfaction.
We found that the PE + LAT was better than the KT for patients with early-stage disease.
