<TEXT>Assessment of the effect of platelet rich plasma on the healing of operated sacrococcygeal pilonidal sinus by lay-open technique: a randomized clinical trial.
BACKGROUND: Sacrococcygeal pilonidal sinus disease (PSD) is an infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue at the upper part of the natal cleft of the buttocks.
Excision and healing by granulation "lay-open" method is still more preferable than other methods of midline closure or using flaps but the healing time is lengthy.
The present study was performed to assess the healing promotion effect of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) on the pilonidal sinus wounds treated by the lay-open method.
METHODS: One hundred patients suffering from PSD were randomly divided into two groups, they were treated by the lay-open method, at General surgery department, Kafr El-Sheik University hospital, Egypt, during the period from December 2018 to December 2019.
Group (A) was adopted the regular dressing postoperatively, while group (B) was treated with PRP injection into the wound at 4 and 12 postoperative days.
RESULTS: Accelerated rate of wound healing was detected in group (B) in day 10, with a significant difference detected in days 15, 20, 25 and 30 postoperative, with a mean time of complete healing 45 +/- 2.6 days in group B, while it was 57 +/- 2.4 days in group A with a p-value of 0.001 which indicates considerable effect in the treated group.
CONCLUSIONS: PRP injection is an effective new technique in accelerating the healing of pilonidal wound after surgery, with a significant decrease in post-operative pain, complications and an early return to work.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: retrospectively registered.
TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: 12/35/1016 issued on December 2018 from the Institution Review Board at Kafr El Sheikh University.
