<TEXT>Efficacy of synbiotics to reduce acute radiation proctitis symptoms and improve quality of life: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot trial.
PURPOSE: To evaluate whether the daily intake of synbiotics interferes in radiation-induced acute proctitis symptoms and in quality of life in patients with prostate cancer.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty patients who underwent 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy for prostate cancer were randomized to intake either a synbiotic powder containing Lactobacillus reuteri 10(8) colony-forming units and 4.3 g of soluble fiber (Nestle) or placebo.
The questionnaire EORTC QLQ-PRT23 was applied before the beginning of radiation therapy and in every week for the first 4 weeks of treatment.
The sum of both the complete (proctitis symptoms plus quality of life) and partial (proctitis symptoms) scores of the EORTC QLQ-PRT23 (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Module for Proctitis-23 items) questionnaire were the main endpoints.
RESULTS: This pilot study showed that the complete questionnaire score (median [range]) was higher in the second (23 [21-30] vs 26.5 [22-34], P&lt;.05) and third (23 [21-32] vs 27.5 [24-33], P&lt;.01) weeks in the placebo group.
Proctitis symptoms were highest scored in the placebo group in both the second (19.5 [16-25]) and third (19 [17-24]) weeks than in the synbiotic group (week 2: 16.5 [15-20], P&lt;.05; week 3: 17 [15-23], P&lt;.01).
In both scores the placebo group had a significantly higher result (P&lt;.01) than the synbiotic group (repeated-measures analysis of variance).
CONCLUSIONS: Synbiotics reduce proctitis symptoms and improve quality of life in radiation-induced acute proctitis during radiation therapy for prostate cancer.</TEXT>
