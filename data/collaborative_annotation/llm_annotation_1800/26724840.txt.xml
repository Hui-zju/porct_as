<TEXT>Role of Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Prostate Cancer Screening: A Pilot Study Within the Goteborg Randomised Screening Trial.
BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and targeted biopsies (TB) have shown potential to more accurately detect significant prostate cancer compared with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and systematic biopsies (SB).
OBJECTIVE: To compare sequential screening (PSA+MRI) with conventional PSA screening.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Of 384 attendees in the 10th screening round of the Goteborg randomised screening trial, 124 men, median age 69.5 yr, had a PSA of &gt;/= 1.8 ng/ml and underwent a prebiopsy MRI.
Men with suspicious lesions on MRI and/or PSA &gt;/= 3.0ng/ml were referred for biopsy.
SB was performed blinded to MRI results and TB was performed in men with tumour-suspicious findings on MRI.
Three screening strategies were compared (PSA &gt;/= 3.0+SB; PSA &gt;/= 3.0+MRI+TB and PSA &gt;/= 1.8+MRI+TB).
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Cancer detection rates, sensitivity, and specificity were calculated per screening strategy and compared using McNemar's test.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: In total, 28 cases of prostate cancer were detected, of which 20 were diagnosed in biopsy-naive men.
Both PSA &gt;/= 3.0+MRI and PSA &gt;/= 1.8+MRI significantly increased specificity compared with PSA &gt;/= 3.0+SB (0.92 and 0.79 vs 0.52; p&lt;0.002 for both), while sensitivity was significantly higher for PSA &gt;/= 1.8+MRI compared with PSA &gt;/= 3.0+MRI (0.73 vs 0.46, p=0.008).
The detection rate of significant cancer was higher with PSA &gt;/= 1.8+MRI compared with PSA &gt;/= 3.0+SB (5.9% vs 4.0%), while the detection rate of insignificant cancer was lowered by PSA &gt;/= 3.0+MRI (0.3% vs 1.2%).
The primary limitation of this study is the small sample of men.
CONCLUSION: A screening strategy with a lowered PSA cut-off followed by TB in MRI-positive men seems to increase the detection of significant cancers while improving specificity.
If replicated, these results may contribute to a paradigm shift in future screening.
PATIENT SUMMARY: Major concerns in prostate-specific antigen screening are overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis.
We evaluated whether prostate magnetic resonance imaging could improve the balance of benefits to harm in prostate cancer screening screening, and we found a promising potential of using magnetic resonance imaging in addition to prostate-specific antigen.</TEXT>
