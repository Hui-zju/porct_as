<TEXT>Prospective randomized trial of hybrid NOTES colectomy versus conventional laparoscopic colectomy for left-sided colonic tumors.
BACKGROUND: We conducted a randomized study of a laparoscopic technique for removing left-sided colon tumors that can reduce postoperative pain and other wound-related complications compared to the conventional technique.
It is a novel technique of hybrid natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) colectomy (HNC) whereby laparoscopic colonic mobilization, transection, and anastomosis are performed intracorporeally.
The specimen is then delivered through the anus using the transanal endoscopic operation (TEO) device, precluding the need for mini-laparotomy.
We compared the short-term outcomes of patients who underwent HNC with those who underwent conventional laparoscopic colectomy (CL).
METHODS: Patients suffering left-sided colonic tumor were recruited and were randomized into two groups: HNC and CL.
Operative data and complications were prospectively recorded and analyzed.
RESULTS: During a 3-year period, we recruited 70 patients (35 per group).
No significant difference was observed between the two groups with respect to operating time (105 vs. 100 min, p = 0.851), blood loss (30 vs. 30 ml, p = 0.954), or length of hospital stay (5 vs. 5 days, p = 0.990).
The maximum pain score during the first week was significantly lower in the HNC group (1 vs. 2, p = 0.017).
No patients in the HNC group developed wound infection, whereas four patients in the CL group did so (p = 0.005).
CONCLUSIONS: With this hybrid NOTES technique, selected patients with left-sided colonic tumors can enjoy the full benefits of minimally invasive surgery with significantly less wound pain and a lower wound infection rate than are observed with CL.</TEXT>
