<TEXT>MIRROS: a randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase III trial of cytarabine +/- idasanutlin in relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia.
Patients with refractory or relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (R/R AML) have a poor prognosis, with a high unmet medical need.
Idasanutlin is a small-molecule inhibitor of MDM2, a negative regulator of tumor suppressor p53.
By preventing the p53-MDM2 interaction, idasanutlin allows for p53 activation, particularly in patients with TP53 wild-type (WT) status.
MIRROS (NCT02545283) is a randomized Phase III trial evaluating idasanutlin + cytarabine versus placebo + cytarabine in R/R AML.
The primary end point is overall survival in the TP53-WT population.
Secondary end points include complete remission rate (cycle 1), overall remission rate (cycle 1) and event-free survival in the TP53-WT population.
MIRROS has an innovative design that integrates a stringent interim analysis for futility; continuation criteria were met in mid-2017 and accrual is ongoing.
Trial registration number: NCT02545283.</TEXT>
