<TEXT>Lymphoma and Epstein-Barr virus DNA in blood during interleukin-2 therapy in antiretroviral-naive HIV-1-infected patients: a substudy of the ANRS 119 trial.
OBJECTIVES: Interleukin-2 (IL-2) therapy increased CD4 cell counts and delayed antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation in HIV-infected patients in the Agence Nationale de Recherche sur le SIDA et les Hepatites Virales (ANRS) 119 trial.
However, four cases of lymphoma were reported.
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) replication is associated with an increased risk of lymphoma in immunocompromised patients.
We assessed whether IL-2 had an impact on EBV replication and the development of lymphoma.
METHODS: A total of 130 ART-naive patients were randomized to receive IL-2 therapy (n = 66) or no treatment (n = 64).
Clinical data for patients with lymphomas were reviewed and tumours assessed for evidence of EBV infection and CD25 (the IL-2 receptor) expression.
EBV DNA levels were measured in whole blood and plasma in both arms using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), up to 48 weeks after baseline (BL).
RESULTS: Four lymphomas occurred, a median of 61 weeks [range 40-94 weeks] after randomization at a median CD4 cell count of 396 cells/muL (IQR 234-536 cells/muL).
In the IL-2 arm, two patients developed EBV-positive Hodgkin's lymphoma, and one developed EBV-negative Burkitt-type lymphoma.
One patient in the control group developed EBV-positive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
CD25 was negative in all cases.
Among the 41 of 55 (control arm) and 44 of 58 (IL-2 arm) patients with detectable EBV DNA in whole blood at both BL and week 48, the median change in EBV DNA between BL and week 48 was +0.04 log10 copies/ml in both arms (P = 0.7).
In plasma, EBV was detected at least once in 22 of 52 controls and 21 of 54 IL-2-treated patients (P = 0.8).
CONCLUSIONS: IL-2 therapy had no significant effect on EBV replication over 48 weeks in these ART-naive patients.
The occurrence of lymphomas did not seem to be associated with IL-2 therapy.</TEXT>
