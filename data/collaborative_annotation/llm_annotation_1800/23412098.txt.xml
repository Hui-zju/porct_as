<TEXT>Phase II randomised proof-of-concept study of the urokinase inhibitor upamostat (WX-671) in combination with gemcitabine compared with gemcitabine alone in patients with non-resectable, locally advanced pancreatic cancer.
BACKGROUND: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of the urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) inhibitor upamostat in combination with gemcitabine in locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma (LAPC).
METHODS: Within a prospective multicenter study, LAPC patients were randomly assigned to receive 1000 mg m(-2) of gemcitabine IV weekly either alone (arm A) or in combination with 200 mg (arm B) or 400 mg (arm C) oral upamostat daily.
Efficacy endpoints of this proof-of-concept study included response rate, time to first metastasis, progression-free and overall survival (OS).
RESULTS: Of the 95 enroled patients, 85 were evaluable for response and 93 for safety.
Median OS was 12.5 months (95% CI 8.2-18.2) in arm C, 9.7 months (95% CI 8.4-17.1) in arm B and 9.9 months (95% CI 7.4-12.1) in arm A; corresponding 1-year survival rates were 50.6%, 40.7% and 33.9%, respectively.
More patients achieved a partial remission (confirmed responses by RECIST) with upamostat combination therapy (arm C: 12.9%; arm B: 7.1%; arm A: 3.8%).
Overall, only 12 patients progressed by developing detectable distant metastasis (arm A: 4, arm B: 6, arm C: 2).
The most common adverse events considered to be related to upamostat were asthenia, fever and nausea.
CONCLUSION: In this proof-of-concept study targeting the uPA system in LAPC, the addition of upamostat to gemcitabine was tolerated well; similar survival results were observed for the three treatment arms.</TEXT>
