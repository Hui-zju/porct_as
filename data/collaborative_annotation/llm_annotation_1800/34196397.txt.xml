<TEXT>Assessment of the Validity of the Sinonasal Outcomes Test-22 in Pituitary Surgery: A Multicenter Prospective Trial.
OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Sinonasal Outcomes Test-22 (SNOT-22) is used widely as a patient-reported sinonasal quality-of-life (QOL) instrument for endoscopic endonasal pituitary surgery.
However, it has never been validated in this population.
This study explores the psychometric validity of SNOT-22 to determine if it is a valid scale in patients undergoing endoscopic pituitary surgery.
STUDY DESIGN: Multicenter prospective trial.
METHODS: Adult patients (n = 113) with pituitary tumors undergoing endoscopic surgery were enrolled in a multicenter study.
Patient-reported QOL was assessed using SNOT-22 and the Anterior Skull Base Nasal Inventory-12.
Face validity, internal consistency, responsiveness to clinical change, test-retest reliability, and concurrent validity were determined using standard statistical methods.
RESULTS: Internal consistency using Cronbach's alpha at baseline and 2 weeks postoperatively were 0.911 and 0.922, indicating SNOT-22 performed well as a single construct.
Mean QOL scores were significantly worse at 2 weeks than baseline (16.4 +/- 15.1 vs. 23.1 +/- 16.4, P &lt; .001), indicating the scale is responsive to clinical change.
However, only 11/22 items demonstrated significant changes in mean scores at 2 weeks.
Correlation between scores at 2 and 3 weeks was high, suggesting good test-retest reliability, r(107) = 0.75, P &lt; .001.
Factor analysis suggests the five-factor solution proposed for the SNOT-22 in rhinosinusitis patients is not valid in pituitary surgery patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The SNOT-22 is a valid QOL instrument in patients undergoing endoscopic pituitary surgery.
However, because it includes 22 items, can be applied only as a single construct, 50% of the items do not demonstrate changes after surgery, and is not as sensitive to change as other scales, shorter instruments developed specifically for this patient population may be preferable.
