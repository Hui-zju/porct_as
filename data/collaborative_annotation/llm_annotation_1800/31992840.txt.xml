<TEXT>Adult T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias with IL7R pathway mutations are slow-responders who do not benefit from allogeneic stem-cell transplantation.
The prognostic value of IL7-receptor pathway (IL7Rp) mutations in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) remains unclear.
We performed a comprehensive study of 200 adult patients with T-ALL included in the GRAALL2003/2005 protocols to address the clinical significance of IL7Rp mutations.
Next-generation sequencing of the IL7Rp (IL7R/JAK1/JAK3/STAT5B) revealed that IL7Rp mutations were frequent in adult T-ALL (28%) particularly in immature/early T-cell progenitor (ETP)-ALL.
They were associated with mutations of NOTCH-pathway, PHF6, and PRC2 components but not with K/NRAS.
IL7Rp mutated (IL7Rp(mut))
T-ALL were slow-responders, with a high rate of M2/M3 day-8 marrow compared with IL7Rp non-mutated (IL7Rp(WT)) T-ALL (p = 0.002) and minimal residual disease positivity at 6-weeks (MRD1) (p = 0.008) but no difference in MRD2 positivity at 12-weeks.
Despite this, no adverse prognosis was evidenced when censored for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).
In time-dependent analysis, HSCT did not benefit IL7Rp(mut) patients whereas it was of marked benefit to IL7Rp(WT) cases.
IL7Rp-mutations identify a subgroup of slow-responder T-ALLs which benefit from post-induction chemotherapy regimens but not from HSCT.
Our data suggest that prior knowledge of the mutation status of IL7Rp may influence HSCT decision and help to guide therapy reduction.</TEXT>
