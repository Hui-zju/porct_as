<TEXT>Effect of Subcutaneous Sterile Vitamin E Ointment on Incisional Surgical Site Infection after Elective Laparoscopic Colorectal Cancer Surgery.
BACKGROUND: Despite several interventions having been adopted to reduce the incidence of incisional surgical site infection (SSI), it still remains a challenge for surgeons, because incisional SSI is a common cause of health-care-associated infection, leading to increased morbidity, prolonged hospital stay, patient discomfort, and increased sanitary costs.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect on incisional SSI of vitamin E ointment in the subcutaneous tissue of patients undergoing a laparoscopic colorectal surgical procedure.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A randomized study was performed.
Patients with colorectal neoplasms undergoing an elective laparoscopic surgical procedure were included.
The patients were randomized into two groups: Those patients undergoing a subcutaneous vitamin E ointment application (Group 1) and those patients who did not receive it (Group 2).
Incisional SSI, post-operative pain, and analytical acute phase reactants were analyzed.
RESULTS: There were 108 patients who were assessed for eligibility, and 101 patients were analyzed.
The incisional SSI rate was 4% in Group 1 and 17.6% in Group 2 (p = 0.03).
Mean post-operative pain, 24 hours after operation, was 17.3 +/- 10.5 mm in Group 1 and 31.9 +/- 18.9 mm in Group 2 (p &lt; 0.001).
Median hospital stay was six days in Group 1 and eight days in Group 2 (p &lt; 0.001).
White blood cell count was significantly lower in Group 1 (p &lt; 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The subcutaneous application of sterile vitamin E acetate ointment leads to a reduction in the incisional SSI rate, lower post-operative pain, and decrease in C-reactive protein and white blood cell count.</TEXT>
