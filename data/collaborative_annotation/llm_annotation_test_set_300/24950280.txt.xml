OBJECTIVE: The primary objective was to compare overall survival (OS) in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) with nonresectable liver-only metastases treated by liver transplantation or chemotherapy.
BACKGROUND: CRC is the third most common cancer worldwide.
About 50% of patients will develop metastatic disease primarily to the liver and the lung.
The majority of patients with liver metastases receive palliative chemotherapy, with a median OS of trial patients of about 2 years, and less than 10% are alive at 5 years.
METHODS: Patients with nonresectable liver-only CRC metastases underwent liver transplantation in the SECA study (n = 21).
Disease-free survival (DFS) and OS of patients included in the SECA study were compared with progression-free survival (PFS) and OS in a similar cohort of CRC patients with liver-only disease included in a first-line chemotherapy study, the NORDIC VII study (n = 47).
PFS/DFS and OS were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method.
RESULTS: DFS/PFS in both groups were 8 to 10 months.
However, a dramatic difference in OS was observed.
The 5-year OS rate was 56% in patients undergoing liver transplantation compared with 9% in patients starting first-line chemotherapy.
The reason for the large difference in OS despite similar DFS/PFS is likely different metastatic patterns at relapse/progression.
Relapse in the liver transplantation group was often detected as small, slowly growing lung metastases, whereas progression of nonresectable liver metastases was observed in the chemotherapy group.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with chemotherapy, liver transplantation resulted in a marked increased OS in CRC patients with nonresectable liver-only metastases.]]></TEXT>
