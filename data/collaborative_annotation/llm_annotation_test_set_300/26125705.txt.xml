This study aimed to investigate the effect and mechanism of trauma flap healing promoted by the Zhikang capsule after radical breast cancer surgery.
The enrolled breast cancer patients were randomly divided into two groups: treatment and observation.
The patients in the treatment group were treated with the Zhikang capsule in addition to the conventional dressing changes, while patients in the observation group underwent only the regular dressing changes.
Serum samples of 98 breast cancer patients (with complete clinical data) who underwent modified radical mastectomy were collected and analyzed for expressions of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF).
The drainage fluid amount and tissue necrosis rate were found to be lower in the treatment group than in the observation group.
Moreover, bFGF expression in peripheral blood was higher in the treatment group than in the observation group.
However, no significant difference was found between the two groups in the expression of TGF-beta in peripheral blood.
In conclusion, Zhikang capsule is effective in promoting flap healing after radical breast cancer surgery, and the increase of bFGF expression in peripheral blood may be the underlying mechanism.]]></TEXT>
