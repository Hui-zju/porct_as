<TEXT><![CDATA[A multicenter phase III study comparing Simultaneous Integrated Boost (SIB) radiotherapy concurrent and consolidated with S-1 versus SIB alone in elderly patients with esophageal and esophagogastric cancer - the 3JECROG P-01 study protocol.
BACKGROUND: The importance of definitive radiotherapy for elderly patients with esophageal and esophagogastric-junction cancer is pronounced.
However, little is known in terms of the best way to combine radiotherapy with other treatment options.
This study aims to compare the efficiency of SIB radiotherapy alone with SIB radiotherapy concurrent and consolidated with S-1 for elderly patients.
Comprehensive geriatric assessment is also incorporated in the procedure of treatment.
METHODS/DESIGN: The study is a two arm, open, randomized multicenter Phase III trial with patients over 70 years old with stage IIA-IVB (UICC 2002, IVB only with metastasis to supraclavicular or celiac lymph nodes) squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma of esophagus or gastroesophageal junction.
A total of 300 patients will be randomized using a 1:1 allocation ratio stratified by disease stage and study site.
Patients allocated to the SIB arm will receive definitive SIB radiotherapy (95%PTV/PGTV 50.4Gy/59.92Gy/28f) while those randomized to SIB + S-1 arm will receive definitive SIB radiotherapy concurrent and consolidated with S-1.
The primary endpoint of the trial is 1-year overall survival.
Secondary objectives include progression-free survival, recurrence-free survival (local-regional and distant), disease failure pattern, toxicity profile as well as quality of life.
Besides, detailed radiotherapy protocol and quality assurance procedure have been incorporated into this trial.
DISCUSSION: The proportion of elderly patients in esophageal cancer is now growing, but there is a lack of evidence in term of treatment standard for this group of patients, which is what we aim to obtain through this prospective phase III study.
