BACKGROUND: Totally implantable venous access port (TIVAP)-related infections (RIs) remain a serious health problem in cancer patients receiving an intravenous (i.v.) therapy.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The ATAPAC study was a prospective, randomized, monocentric, phase IV trial evaluating the efficacy of taurolidine lock solution versus standard saline solution for primary TIVAP-RI prevention in nonhematological cancer patients receiving i.v.
chemotherapy.
The primary endpoint was the TIVAP-RI incidence rate.
From December 2014 to September 2015, 163 patients were enrolled in the study (taurolidine: n = 86 vs. CONTROL: n = 77).
Four patients in the control group (5%) had a Staphylococcus epidermidis TIVAP-RI, and 1 patient (1%) in the taurolidine group had a Staphylococcus aureus infection.
The TIVAP-RI incidence rate was 0.4 and 0.1 per thousand catheter-days, respectively (p = 0.21).
The infection-free TIVAP survival was not statistically significant (p = 0.09).
TIVAP-RI required a total of 22 hospitalization days in the taurolidine group versus 106 days in the control arm with associated costs of EUR 4,849 and EUR 36,020, respectively.
Taurolidine-related toxicity was transitory and classified as grade I. CONCLUSIONS: The ATAPAC trial did not show a significant risk-infection reduction by TauroLock.
A larger, prospective, randomized trial is needed to assess TauroLock efficacy for primary TIVAP-RI prevention in low-risk cancer patients.]]></TEXT>
