<TEXT><![CDATA[The brigatinib experience: a new generation of therapy for ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer.
Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer deaths in the world with 1.69 million deaths in 2015.
A total of 85% of lung cancer cases are non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs).
Driver mutations associated with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) have been identified in a variety of malignancies, including NSCLC.
An ALK inhibitor (crizotinib, ceritinib and alectinib) is the preferred therapeutic approach to those advanced ALK fusion variant-positive NSCLC patients.
Brigatinib, a next-generation ALK inhibitor, shows promising activity in ALK-rearranged NSCLC that have previously received crizotinib with response rates in ALTA ranging from 42-50%, intracranial response 42-67% and median progression-free survival 9.2-12.9 months.
Randomized Phase III trial, ALTA-1 L is investigating brigatinib in ALK inhibitor-naive patients.]]></TEXT>
