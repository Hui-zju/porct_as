BACKGROUND: Inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy (IFL) is part of the surgical treatment of different malignancies of the genital tract and/or the lower limb including vulvar carcinoma, penile carcinoma and melanoma.
IFL is associated with morbidity in up to 85% of the patients.
The aims of this MAMBO-IC study (Morbidity And Measurement of the Body) are to study the feasibility of using LigaSure for IFL and to assess the differences in the incidence of short-term complications using LigaSure versus conventional IFL randomized within each individual patient.
METHODS: In this multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT), women diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva with an indication for bilateral IFL were included.
It was randomly assigned for which groin the LigaSure was used; the other groin was treated with conventional IFL (sharp/diathermia).
We estimated the incidence of >/=1 complication(s) per groin using logistic regression and compared this between the two surgical methods, adjusting for possible confounders.
RESULTS: We included 40 groins of 20 patients.
The estimated incidence of >/=1 complication(s) was 29% after LigaSure versus 70% after conventional IFL (risk difference 41% (95% CI 19-62), p < 0.001).
Patients' reported restriction of daily living activities and maximum pain score were equal for both treatment methods.
There were no differences in the surgeon reported workload scores.
CONCLUSIONS: This RCT shows that LigaSure for IFL is feasible and associated with significantly less short-term surgical complications compared to conventional IFL.
Further studies with a larger sample size are needed to validate our findings.
