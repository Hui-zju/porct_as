<TEXT><![CDATA[A phase IIa dose-finding and safety study of first-line pertuzumab in combination with trastuzumab, capecitabine and cisplatin in patients with HER2-positive advanced gastric cancer.
BACKGROUND: Pertuzumab plus trastuzumab provides a more comprehensive blockade of HER2 signalling than trastuzumab alone.
Therefore, we conducted a phase IIa study of the pharmacokinetics and safety of pertuzumab plus trastuzumab and chemotherapy in advanced gastric cancer (aGC).
METHODS: Patients received pertuzumab 840 mg for cycle 1 and 420 mg q3w for cycles 2-6 (Arm A) or pertuzumab 840 mg q3w for six cycles (Arm B).
Trastuzumab, cisplatin and capecitabine were also given for six cycles, then trastuzumab q3w until disease progression or unmanageable toxicity.
The co-primary endpoints were day 43 pertuzumab serum trough concentration (Cmin) and safety.
RESULTS: Thirty patients were randomised.
Mean pertuzumab Cmin at day 43 was 40.0 mug ml(-1) (s.d.: 17.3) in Arm A and 62.7 mug ml(-1) (29.1) in Arm B. Mean day 43 Cmin in Arm A was ~37% lower than that seen in metastatic breast cancer.
The safety profiles were similar between arms and treatment was well tolerated.
Partial responses were achieved by 86% and 55% of patients in Arms A and B, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the pharmacokinetic and safety data, the 840 mg q3w pertuzumab dose has been selected for a phase III study of pertuzumab, trastuzumab and chemotherapy in HER2-positive aGC.]]></TEXT>
