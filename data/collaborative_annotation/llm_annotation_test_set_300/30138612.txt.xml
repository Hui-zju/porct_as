BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Sufficient bowel preparation is crucial for successful screening and surveillance colonoscopy.
However, the rates of inadequate preparation are still high.
We investigated the effects of reinforcing patient education and guidance by using the short message service (SMS).
METHODS: In this prospective, endoscopist-blinded, multicenter study, standard instructions pertaining to split-dose preparation were provided in a verbal and written format to all patients during the initial appointment.
Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to a group that received reinforced education starting 4 days before the colonoscopy (SMS group) or to the control group which did not receive further education.
The primary outcome was the percentage of insufficient preparation results (Boston Bowel Preparation Scale [BBPS] score <6).
The secondary outcomes included quality of bowel preparation according to the BBPS, polyp and adenoma detection rates, and patients' perceived discomfort in the preparation procedure.
RESULTS: The percentage of patients with insufficient bowel preparation was significantly lower in the SMS group (9%) than in the control group (19%) (P = .0013).
The mean BBPS score was significantly higher in the SMS group (7.4 +/- 0.1) than in the control group (6.5 +/- 0.1) (P < .0001).
Each colon segment had significantly higher BBPS scores in the SMS group.
The adenoma detection rate and number of detected adenomas in the right segment of the colon were higher in the SMS group.
SMS messages were accompanied by a lower level of discomfort during preparation (numeric rating scale) (5.2 SMS vs 5.8 controls) (P = .0042).
CONCLUSIONS: Reinforced patient education by using SMS messages during the 4 days before colonoscopy increased bowel cleanliness, adenoma detection in the right segment of the colon, and reduced discomfort.
