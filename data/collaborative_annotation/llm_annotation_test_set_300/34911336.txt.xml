Third-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as osimertinib, have demonstrated efficacy in patients with EGFR-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer; however, almost all patients will eventually relapse.
Amivantamab is an EGFR-MET bispecific antibody with immune cell-directing activity that targets activating and resistance EGFR mutations and MET mutations and amplifications.
In the ongoing CHRYSALIS study (NCT02609776), amivantamab in combination with lazertinib, a potent, brain-penetrant third-generation EGFR TKI, demonstrated antitumor activity in the treatment-naive and osimertinib-relapsed setting.
Here the authors present the methodology for the MARIPOSA study (NCT04487080), a phase 3, multicenter, randomized study designed to compare the efficacy and safety of amivantamab and lazertinib combination therapy versus single-agent osimertinib as first-line treatment for EGFR-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer.]]></TEXT>
