BACKGROUND: Reconstruction of face deformities resulting from skin cancer includes reconstructing the area with similar tissue.
This prospective study aimed to compare the functional and aesthetic outcomes between two types of local flaps (the island pedicle flap vs the bilobed flap) used in reconstruction of the ala and back nose.
METHODS: In this study, 120 patients with skin cancer of the nose underwent ala and back reconstruction: 60 patients using the island flap (IF group) and 60 patients using the bilobed flap (BF group).
The two groups were homogeneous for sex, age, and anatomic area.
Complications, scarring according to the scale of Vancouver, cosmetic appearance, and disorders of sensations were analyzed, and statistical analysis was performed using Chi-square and analysis of variance (ANOVA).
RESULTS: Early complications were more common in the BF group than in the IF group (p < 0.005).
The Vancouver Scar Scale scores were significantly better for the IF patients (p < 0,005), who also showed better results in the analysis of cosmetic outcomes (p < 0.005).
CONCLUSION: The study showed that the island flap used for ala and back nose reconstruction provides better functional and cosmetic results than the bilobed flap, from both functional and aesthetic points of view.
