<TEXT><![CDATA[The effect of information on prostate cancer screening decision process: a discrete choice experiment.
BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer screening is controversial because of uncertainty about its benefits and risks.
The aim of this survey was to reveal preferences of men concerning prostate cancer screening and to test the effect of an informative video on these preferences.
METHODS: A stated preferences questionnaire was sent by e-mail to men aged 50-75 with no history of prostate cancer.
Half of them were randomly assigned to view an informative video.
A discrete choice model was established to reveal men's preferences for six prostate cancer screening characteristics: mortality by prostate cancer, number of false positive and false negative results, number of overdiagnosis, out-of-pocket costs and recommended frequency.
RESULTS: A population-based sample composed by 1024 men filled in the entire questionnaire.
Each attribute gave the expected sign except for overdiagnosis.
The video seemed to increase the intention to abstain from prostate cancer screening.
CONCLUSIONS: The participants attached greater importance to a decrease in the number of false negatives and a reduction in prostate cancer mortality than to other risks such as the number of false positives and overdiagnosis.
Further research is needed to help men make an informed choice regarding screening.]]></TEXT>
