AIM: To present our preliminary experience with nerve-sparing minilaparoscopic radical hysterectomy plus pelvic lymphadenectomy for the surgical treatment of cervical cancer and to compare outcomes with those of the conventional laparoscopic approach.
METHODS: Data of 87 consecutive women who underwent minimally invasive surgery for early and locally advanced stage cervical cancer were prospectively collected.
Ten women who underwent laparoscopic surgery using a nerve-sparing technique performed through 3-mm ancillary ports were compared with the 77 patients who had standard laparoscopic surgery previously with 3 sovrapubic 5-mm trocars.
RESULTS: Minilaparoscopic radical hysterectomy was successfully accomplished in every case with no conversion to standard laparoscopy or open surgery.
Two (2.6%) conversions to open surgery occurred in the conventional laparoscopy group.
Surgical characteristics (operative time, estimated blood loss, and length of stay) and complication rate were similar between the 2 groups.
No differences in the amount of parametrial and vaginal tissue removed were observed.
The number of lymph nodes retrieved through minilaparoscopy was higher than conventional laparoscopy (30 [range = 26-38] vs 22 [range = 8-49]; P = .002).
However, no difference was observed when the analysis was restricted to the last 10 conventional procedures (30 [range = 26-38] vs 29 [range = 24-49]; P = .81).
CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that minilaparoscopic radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy is a feasible procedure if performed by skilled surgeons.]]></TEXT>
