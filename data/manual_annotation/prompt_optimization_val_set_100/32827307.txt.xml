A 2016 published randomized multicenter phase III trial of prophylactic nimodipine treatment in vestibular schwannoma surgery showed only a tendency for higher hearing preservation rates in the treatment group.
Gender was not included in statistical analysis at that time.
A retrospective analysis of the trial considering gender, preoperative hearing, and nimodipine treatment was performed.
The treatment group received parenteral nimodipine from the day before surgery until the seventh postoperative day.
The control group was not treated prophylactically.
Cochlear nerve function was determined by pure-tone audiometry with speech discrimination preoperatively, during in-patient care, and 1 year after surgery and classified according to the Gardner-Robertson grading scale (GR).
Logistic regression analysis showed a statistically significant effect for higher hearing preservation rates (pre- and postoperative GR 1-4) in 40 men comparing the treatment (n = 21) and the control (n = 19) groups (p = 0.028), but not in 54 women comparing 27 women in both groups (p = 0.077).
The results were also statistically significant for preservation of postoperative hearing with pre- and postoperative GR 1-3 (p = 0.024).
There were no differences in tumor sizes between the treatment and the control groups in men, whereas statistically significant larger tumors were observed in the female treatment group compared with the female control group.
Prophylactic nimodipine is safe, and an effect for hearing preservation in 40 men with preoperative hearing ability of GR 1-4 was shown in this retrospective investigation.
The imbalance in tumor size with larger tumors in females of the treatment group may falsely suggest a gender-related effect.
Further investigations are recommended to clarify whether gender has impact on nimodipine's efficacy.]]></TEXT>
