<TEXT><![CDATA[A Comparison of a Pulse-Based Diet and the Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes Diet in Combination with Exercise and Health Counselling on the Cardio-Metabolic Risk Profile in Women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
We compared the effects of a low-glycemic index pulse-based diet, containing lentils, beans, split peas, and chickpeas, to the Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes (TLC) diet on cardio-metabolic measures in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).
Ninety-five women (18(-)35 years) enrolled in a 16-week intervention; 30 women in the pulse-based and 31 in the TLC groups completed the study.
Women participated in aerobic exercise training (minimum 5 days/week for 45 min/day) and were counselled (monthly) about PCOS and lifestyle modification.
Women underwent longitudinal follow-up post-intervention.
The pulse-based group had a greater reduction in total area under the curve for insulin response to a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (mean change +/- SD: -121.0 +/-
229.9 vs. -27.4 +/- 110.2 microIU/mL x min; p = 0.05); diastolic blood pressure (-3.6 +/- 6.7 vs. -0.2 +/- 6.7 mmHg, p = 0.05); triglyceride (-0.2 +/- 0.6 vs. 0.0 +/- 0.5 mmol/L, p = 0.04); low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-0.2 +/- 0.4 vs. -0.1 +/- 0.4 mmol/L, p = 0.05); total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TC/HDL-C; -0.4 +/- 0.4 vs. 0.1 +/- 0.4, p < 0.001); and a greater increase in HDL-C (0.1 +/- 0.2 vs. -0.1 +/- 0.2 mmol/L, p < 0.01) than the TLC group.
Decreased TC/HDL-C (p = 0.02) at six-month and increased HDL-C and decreased TC/HDL-C (p </= 0.02) at 12-month post-intervention were maintained in the pulse-based group.
A pulse-based diet may be more effective than the TLC diet at improving cardio-metabolic disease risk factors in women with PCOS.
