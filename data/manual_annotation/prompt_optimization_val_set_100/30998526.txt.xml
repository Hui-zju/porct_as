<TEXT><![CDATA[A randomised controlled trial evaluating the effectiveness of Facebook compared to leaflets in raising awareness of melanoma and harmful sun-related behaviour among young adults.
This study describes a randomised control trial investigating whether printed leaflets or social media are more effective in increasing knowledge of the risks of sun exposure and melanoma in people aged 18-29.
The study participants were 18-29-year-old university students or graduates, recruited in London.
A baseline level of knowledge was measured using the Skin Cancer and Sun Knowledge questionnaire.
Study participants were then randomised into either a leaflet arm or Facebook arm.
Identical information was delivered through a SunSafe campaign via either posted leaflets or Facebook during a 10-day exposure window.
Following this, participants repeated the Skin Cancer and Sun Knowledge questionnaire.
Following the SunSafe intervention, the mean knowledge score improved in both groups to a statistically significant degree (Facebook = 1.82, leaflets = 3.04, P < 0.001).
Moreover, the improvement in knowledge score of the leaflet arm was statistically significantly greater than in the Facebook arm (95% confidence interval: 0.35-2.09, P = 0.0059).
Participants of lighter skin colour demonstrated greater levels of knowledge about skin cancer and sun exposure at baseline (P = 0.005; P < 0.05).
There was no correlation between sex and baseline knowledge (P = 0.7725).
There was no significant effect of skin tone or sex on the knowledge change (P = 0.139 and 0.643).
The findings suggest that printed information in the form of leaflets is more impactful in increasing knowledge than online platforms such as Facebook among a young adult demographic in the UK.
These findings should be considered when designing public health campaigns, acting as a reminder to not neglect traditional media in health promotion.]]></TEXT>
