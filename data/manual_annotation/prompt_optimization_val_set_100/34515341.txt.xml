Optimal sequencing of complementary therapies can help improve symptom management through nonpharmacological approaches.
A 12-week sequential multiple assignment randomized trial comparing home-based reflexology and meditative practices on severity of fatigue and other symptoms was conducted among patients with cancer and their informal caregivers.
Dyads were initially randomized to reflexology (N = 150), meditative practices (N = 150), or control (N = 47).
If patient's fatigue did not improve (nonresponse) after 4 weeks of reflexology or meditative practices, the dyad was rerandomized to either add the other therapy or continue with the original therapy for weeks 5-8.
Four decision rules (DRs) were compared: (1) Initiating reflexology, and if nonresponse on fatigue after 4 weeks, continue with reflexology for another 4 weeks, thus providing a higher dose; (2) Initiating reflexology, and if nonresponse on fatigue after 4 weeks, add meditative practices for the next 4 weeks; (3) Initiating meditative practices, and if nonresponse on fatigue after 4 weeks, continue meditative practices for another 4 weeks, thus providing a higher dose; and (4) Initiating meditative practices, and if nonresponse on fatigue after 4 weeks, add reflexology for the next 4 weeks.
Symptoms were evaluated weekly using the M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI).
Clinically, nurses can recommend either therapy since no differences were found among the 4 DRs, with the exception of lower severity for summed MDASI symptoms at week 8 for the use of reflexology only (DR-1) versus DR-2 (sequencing reflexology to meditative practices).
Adding the other therapy for nonresponders after 4 weeks may not be warranted.]]></TEXT>
