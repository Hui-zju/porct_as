<TEXT><![CDATA[Impact of an Endoscopic Quality Improvement Program Focused on Adenoma Detection on Sessile Serrated Adenoma/Polyp Detection.
BACKGROUND: Sessile serrated adenomas/polyps (SSA/P) are an under-recognized disease with a unique malignant pathway.
Improved endoscopic recognition and pathological interpretation is needed.
AIMS: To determine whether an educational intervention that improved adenoma detection rate (ADR) could improve SSA/P detection rate after reclassification of previously termed "hyperplastic" polyps.
METHODS: We reanalyzed data from a prospective randomized trial of an educational intervention aimed at increasing ADR.
All hyperplastic polyps >/=6 mm reported in a previously published study were rereviewed and reclassified using standardized criteria for serrated lesions.
Detection rates of sessile serrated adenomas/polyps and other clinically relevant serrated polyps were calculated in the baseline and post-training phases of the original study.
RESULTS: Of 263 available for rereview, 33 (12.5%) were reclassified as SSA/P (N = 32) or traditional serrated adenoma (TSA) (N = 1).
Reclassification was more common in the right colon (18 vs. 8%, p = 0.02).
Baseline SSA/P detection rate was 0.7% in the untrained group and 1.3% in the trained group.
Post-training, the SSA/P detection rate increased to 2.1 and 1.5%, respectively.
The clinically relevant serrated polyp detection rate at baseline was 14.2% in the untrained group and 11.3% in the trained group.
After the educational intervention, the clinically relevant serrated polyp detection rates increased to 16.5 and 14.8% in the untrained and trained groups, respectively.
The estimated odds of an endoscopist detecting either a SSA/P or other clinically relevant serrated polyp during colonoscopy increased by only 3% with the educational intervention (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.61-1.74, p = 0.91).
CONCLUSIONS: Pathological re-interpretation of larger serrated polyps resulted in the reclassification of 12.5% of lesions.
Quality improvement methods focused on adenoma detection did not impact SSA/P detection, and thus specific methods for serrated polyp detection are needed.]]></TEXT>
