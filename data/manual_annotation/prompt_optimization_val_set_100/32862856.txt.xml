<TEXT><![CDATA[Venetoclax in AML: Where We Are and Where We Are Headed.
The developmental path for venetoclax in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has been rapid and stands in stark contrast to the incremental progress that has characterized the field in previous decades.
For perspective, on December 31, 2013, the first AML patient was enrolled into a study using venetoclax; 59 months later, on November 21, 2018, venetoclax received accelerated approval by the FDA for use in AML.
In June 2020, Dr. DiNardo presented the results of the required confirmatory study at the European Hematology Association meeting, showing that venetoclax with azacitidine resulted in a superior response rate and overall survival compared to azacitidine alone for older, newly diagnosed AML patients.
This swift progress has provided a welcome and potent new therapy for patients with AML; with it come questions about how its role can be expanded, and how its use can be optimized.]]></TEXT>
