BACKGROUND: To compare the efficacy of three chemotherapeutic combinations for laparoscopic hyperthermic intraperitoneal perfusion chemotherapy (HIPPC) in the treatment of malignant ascites secondary to unresectable gastric cancer (GC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 2010 to December 2013, 38 GC patients were randomly divided into three groups and treated by laparoscopic HIPPC with one of the three following chemotherapy combinations: raltitrexed (Ra) with oxaliplatin [trans-(+/-)-diaminocyclohexane oxalatoplatinum (l-OHP)], Ra with cisplatin (DDP), and Ra with mitomycin C (MMC).
Perioperative complications, patients' quality of life, and survival were recorded and compared among the three groups.
RESULTS: The intraoperative course was successful in all patients, and no perioperative death or complication related to laparoscopic HIPPC was documented.
The median follow-up period was 9 months, and the median survival was 7.5 months for all patients.
Patients in the Ra/l-OHP group had a median survival of 8.7 months, the Ra/DDP group had a median survival of 5.6 months, and the Ra/MMC group had a median survival of 7.5 months.
Patients' median survival in the Ra/l-OHP group and Ra/MMC group was significantly longer than in the Ra/DDP group (P < .05).
No significant difference was found in total remission rate of ascites, increase in the Karnofsky Performance Scale, and incidence rate of port-site metastases among the three groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopy-assisted HIPPC provides modest yet encouraging efficacy for malignant ascites secondary to disseminated GC.
Our preliminary data indicate that the chemotherapeutic combination of Ra/l-OHP and Ra/MMC might be more beneficial compared with Ra/DDP in terms of patients' survival.]]></TEXT>
