OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of topical lidocaine spray compared to a placebo for relieving pain during colposcopic cervical biopsies and endocervical curettage.
METHODS: This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study included patients with abnormal cervical cytologic results requiring colposcopy and directed cervical punch biopsy with or without endocervical curettage (ECC).
The patients were randomly assigned to either the 10% lidocaine spray or the placebo group.
The patients were asked to rate the pain level immediately after the cervical biopsy and ECC, and mean pain scores of the 2 groups were compared.
RESULTS: A total of 214 women were included in the study: 104 in the lidocaine group and 110 in the control group.
Age, parity, and history of previous vaginal delivery and cesarean section were similar in both groups.
Mean +/- SD age was 41.5 +/- 10.6 years in the lidocaine group and 43 +/- 11.3 years in the control group.
Pain scores after cervical biopsy and ECC were also similar between the 2 groups.
Mean +/- SD pain scores associated with cervical biopsy were 2.18 +/- 1.7 in the lidocaine group and 2.31 +/- 1.6 in the control group.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: In our population, there is no evidence to recommend the use of routine locally sprayed lidocaine anesthesia before cervical punch biopsy or ECC.]]></TEXT>
