BACKGROUND: The relationship between collagen features (CFs) in the tumor microenvironment and the treatment response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) is still unknown.
This study aimed to develop and validate a perdition model based on the CFs and clinicopathological characteristics to predict the treatment response to nCRT among locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) patients.
METHODS: In this multicenter, retrospective analysis, 428 patients were included and randomly divided into a training cohort (299 patients) and validation cohort (129 patients) [7:3 ratio].
A total of 11 CFs were extracted from a multiphoton image of pretreatment biopsy, and a support vector machine (SVM) was then used to construct a CFs-SVM classifier.
A prediction model was developed and presented with a nomogram using multivariable analysis.
Further validation of the nomogram was performed in the validation cohort.
RESULTS: The CFs-SVM classifier, which integrated collagen area, straightness, and crosslink density, was significantly associated with treatment response.
Predictors contained in the nomogram included the CFs-SVM classifier and clinicopathological characteristics by multivariable analysis.
The CFs nomogram demonstrated good discrimination, with area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs) of 0.834 in the training cohort and 0.854 in the validation cohort.
Decision curve analysis indicated that the CFs nomogram was clinically useful.
Moreover, compared with the traditional clinicopathological model, the CFs nomogram showed more powerful discrimination in determining the response to nCRT.
CONCLUSIONS: The CFs-SVM classifier based on CFs in the tumor microenvironment is associated with treatment response, and the CFs nomogram integrating the CFs-SVM classifier and clinicopathological characteristics is useful for individualized prediction of the treatment response to nCRT among LARC patients.]]></TEXT>
