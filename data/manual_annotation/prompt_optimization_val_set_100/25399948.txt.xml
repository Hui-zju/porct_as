BACKGROUND: Infants with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) present with aggressive disease and a poor prognosis.
Early relapse within 6-9 months of diagnosis is common.
Approximately 75% of infants have MLL-rearranged (MLL-R) ALL with event free survival (EFS) ranging from 20% to 30%.
Children's Oncology Group (COG) P9407 used shortened (46 weeks), intensified therapy to address early relapse and poor EFS.
PROCEDURE: P9407 therapy was modified three times for induction toxicity resulting in three cohorts of therapy.
One hundred forty-seven infants were enrolled in the third cohort.
RESULTS: We report an overall 5-year EFS and OS of 42.3 +/- 6% and 52.9 +/- 6.5% respectively.
Poor prognostic factors included age </=90 days at diagnosis, MLL-R ALL and white cell count >/=50,000/mul.
For infants </=90 days of age, the 5-year EFS was 15.5 +/- 10.1% and 48.5 +/- 6.7% for those >90 days (P < 0.0001).
Among infants >90 days of age, 5-year EFS rates were 43.8 +/- 8% for MLL-R versus 69.1 +/- 13.6% for MLL-germline ALL (P < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Age </=90 days at diagnosis was the most important prognostic factor.
Despite shortened therapy with early intensification, EFS remained less than 50% overall in MLL-R ALL.]]></TEXT>
