PURPOSE: Optimal treatment strategies for advanced natural killer/T (NK/T)-cell lymphoma have not been fully defined.
We compared the safety and efficacy of DDGP and SMILE regimens for advanced NK/T-cell lymphoma in a randomized controlled, multicenter, and open-label clinical trial.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients were newly diagnosed in stages III-IV and had performance scores in 0 to 2.
Six cycles of DDGP (dexamethasone, cisplatin, gemcitabline, and pegaspargase) or SMILE (dexamethasone, methotrexate, ifosfamide, L-asparaginase, and etoposide) chemotherapy were randomly assigned to them.
The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS).
Secondary end points included response rate and overall survival (OS).
The trial is ongoing and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (No. NCT01501149).
RESULTS: Of 42 patients enrolled, 21 were treated with DDGP therapy, and 21 patients were treated with SMILE therapy.
The 1-year PFS and 2-year OS rates were better in the DDGP group than that in the SMILE group (86% vs. 38% for 1-year PFS, P = 0.006; 74% vs. 45% for 2-year OS, P = 0.027).
Complete remission (CR) rate and overall response rate (ORR) of the DDGP group were higher than that in the SMILE group (71% vs. 29%, P = 0.005 for CR rate; 95% vs. 67%, P = 0.018 for ORR).
The SMILE group showed more serious leucopenia (P = 0.030) and severe allergic reaction (P = 0.015) than the DDGP group.
In addition, two cases in the SMILE group underwent grade 4 mucosal reaction.
CONCLUSIONS: DDGP chemotherapy resulted in significant improvement in PFS, OS, and better tolerability compared with SMILE chemotherapy for newly diagnosed advanced NK/T-cell lymphoma patients.
