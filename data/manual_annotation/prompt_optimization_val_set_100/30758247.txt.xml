<TEXT><![CDATA[Smartphone Application Versus Pedometer to Promote Physical Activity in Prostate Cancer Patients.
Background: Recently, the application of smartphone in medical field has received great attention.
Introduction: The objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of smartphone-based and conventional pedometer-based exercise monitoring systems in promoting home exercise among prostate cancer patients.
Methods: Prostate cancer patients who have undergone surgery or androgen deprivation therapy were recruited.
All participants were provided with physical activity goals based on their activities and were advised to achieve these goals during their home exercise period.
The intervention group was instructed to use smartphone application to record their activities; they also received weekly remote consultations based on the activity record from the application, without visiting a clinic.
The control group was instructed to keep a written record of their daily activities based on pedometer readings; these records were checked by clinicians during follow-up visits.
The uptake, adherence, and completion rates of two groups were compared by intention-to-treat analysis.
Changes in physical function during the exercise period were analyzed.
Results: In total, 100 patients were recruited (smartphone: 5 and pedometer: 50).
No significant differences were detected between groups in rates of uptake (80.0% vs. 88.0%, p = 0.28), adherence (92.5% vs. 79.5%, p = 0.12), or completion (76.0% vs. 86.0%, p = 0.20).
Physical functions were significantly improved in both groups.
Conclusions: The smartphone-based exercise monitoring system and the pedometer yielded comparable results in promoting physical activity, as assessed by rates of uptake, adherence, and completion.
Exercise monitoring was effective in improving physical functions, in both methods.]]></TEXT>
