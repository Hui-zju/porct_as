OBJECTIVE: We conducted a prospective, randomized, open-label, multicenter study to compare busulfan plus fludarabine (BuFlu) with busulfan plus cyclophosphamide (BuCy) as the conditioning regimen in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in first complete remission (CR1).
METHODS: Totally 108 AML-CR1 patients undergoing allo-HSCT were randomized into BuCy (busulfan 1.6 mg/kg, q12 hours, -7 ~ -4d; cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg.d, -3 ~ -2d) or BuFlu (busulfan 1.6 mg/kg, q12 hours, -5 ~ -2d; fludarabine 30 mg/m2.d, -6 ~ -2d) group.
Hematopoietic engraftment, regimen-related toxicity (RRT), graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), transplant related mortality (TRM), and overall survival were compared between the two groups.
RESULTS: All patients achieved hematopoietic reconstitution except for two patients who died of RRT during conditioning.
All patients obtained complete donor chimerism by day +30 post-transplantation.
The incidence of total and III-IV RRT were 94.4% and 81.5% (P = 0.038), and 16.7% and 0.0% (P = 0.002), respectively, in BuCy and BuFlu group.
With a median follow up of 609 (range, 3-2130) days after transplantation, the 5-year cumulative incidence of TRM were 18.8 +/- 6.9% and 9.9 +/- 6.3% (P = 0.104); the 5-year cumulative incidence of leukemia relapse were 16.5 +/- 5.8% and 16.2 +/- 5.3% (P = 0.943); the 5-year disease-free survival and overall survival were 67.4 +/- 7.6% and 75.3 +/- 7.2% (P = 0.315), and 72.3 +/- 7.5% and 81.9 +/- 7.0% (P = 0.177), respectively in BuCy and BuFlu group.
CONCLUSION: Compared with BuCy, BuFlu as a myeloablative condition regimen was associated with lower toxicities and comparable anti-leukemic activity in AML-CR1 patients undergoing allo-HSCT.]]></TEXT>
