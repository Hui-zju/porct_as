Chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is the standard of care for locoregionally advanced squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (HNSCC).
The immune checkpoint inhibitors nivolumab and pembrolizumab were recently approved by the US FDA for treatment of recurrent or metastatic HNSCC that are refractory to platinum chemotherapy.
However, prospective studies incorporating immune checkpoint inhibitors in the definitive management of poor prognosis, nonmetastatic, locoregionally advanced HNSCC are lacking.
The JAVELIN Head and Neck 100 study is a multinational, Phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial assessing the efficacy of avelumab, a PD-L1 inhibitor, in combination with CRT compared with placebo in combination with CRT for high-risk HNSCC.
