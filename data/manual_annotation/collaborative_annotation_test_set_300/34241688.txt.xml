PURPOSE: The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the value of the combination of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) and blue dye (BD) for SLN detection in patients with clinically negative node breast cancer.
METHODS: Patients with clinically negative node breast cancer were randomized into two cohorts for SLN biopsy (SLNB): the combination method cohort using CEUS and BD together, and the single BD method cohort.
Standard axillary lymph node dissection was performed if any of the SLNs confirmed positive by pathology.
The identification rate, the number of SLNs removed and recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates were evaluated between two cohorts.
In addition, we assessed the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, false-negative rate of CEUS for diagnosis of SLNs based on patterns of CEUS enhancement.
RESULTS: 144 consecutive patients with clinically negative node breast cancer were randomized into two cohorts.
Each cohort consisted of 72 cases.
In the combination method cohort, contrast-enhanced lymphatic vessels were clearly visualized and SLNs were accurately localized in 72 cases.
The identification rate and the mean number of SLNs detected by the combination method were 100% (72/72) and 3.26 (1-9), respectively.
In contrast, in the single BD method cohort, SLNs in 69 cases were successfully identified.
The identification rate and the mean number of SLNs using BD alone were 95.8% (69/72) and 2.21 (1-4), respectively.
According to patterns of CEUS enhancement, the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and the FNR of CEUS for SLN diagnosis were 69.2%, 96.6%, 91.7%, and 30.8%, respectively.
After a median follow-up of 50 months for the combination method cohort and 51 months for the blue dye alone cohort, five patients in the combination method cohort and nine in the blue dye alone cohort had recurrence.
RFS rates showed no significant difference (P = 0.26) between two cohorts.
CONCLUSION: The combination of CEUS and BD is more effective than BD alone for SLNB in clinically negative node patients with an identification rate as high as 100%.
Use of BD and CEUS in combination may provide the possibility of a non-radioactive alternative method for SLNB in centers without access to radioisotope.]]></TEXT>
