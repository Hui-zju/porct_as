CONTEXT: Up to 40% of patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have prediabetes; an optimal pharmacotherapy regimen for diabetes prevention in PCOS is yet to be established.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate clinical efficacy of exenatide (EX), metformin (MET), or combination (COM) for prediabetes in PCOS.
DESIGN: Randomized, open-label, parallel-group controlled trial.
SETTING: Renji Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine.
PATIENTS: PCOS with prediabetes (fasting plasma glucose 5.6-6.9 mmol/L and/or 2 hour post glucose 7.8-11.0 mmol/L on oral glucose tolerance test [OGTT]).
A total of 150 out of 183 eligible enrollees completed the study.
INTERVENTION: EX (10-20mug daily), MET (1500-2000 mg daily), or COM (EX plus MET) for 12 weeks.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sustained remission rate of prediabetes (primary endpoint, a normal OGTT after 12 weeks of treatment followed by 12 weeks of washout on no drug treatment) along with anthropometric, hormonal, metabolic, and pancreatic beta-cell function parameters (secondary endpoints) and potential mechanisms were assessed.
RESULTS: Impaired glucose tolerance was found the dominant prediabetes phenotype.
Overall sustained prediabetes remission rate was 50.7%.
Remission rate of COM group (64%, 32/50) or EX group (56%, 28/50) was significantly higher than that of the MET group (32%, 16/50) (P = .003 and .027, respectively).
EX was associated with superior suppression of 2-hour glucose increment in OGTT.
A 2-step hyperglycemic clamp study revealed that EX had led to higher postprandial insulin secretion than MET, potentially explaining the higher remission rate.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with MET monotherapy, EX or COM achieved higher rate of remission of prediabetes among PCOS patients by improving postprandial insulin secretion.]]></TEXT>
