<TEXT><![CDATA[Once, Twice, Three Times a Finding: Reproducibility of Dendritic Cell Vaccine Trials Targeting Cytomegalovirus in Glioblastoma.
Despite standard of care for glioblastoma, including gross total resection, high-dose radiation, and dose-limited chemotherapy, this tumor remains one of the most aggressive and therapeutically challenging.
The relatively small number of patients with this diagnosis compared with more common solid tumors in clinical trials commits new glioblastoma therapies to testing in small, underpowered, nonrandomized settings.
Among approximately 200 registered glioblastoma trials identified between 2005 and 2015, nearly half were single-arm studies with sample sizes not exceeding 50 patients.
These constraints have made demonstrating efficacy for novel therapies difficult in glioblastoma and other rare and aggressive cancers.
Novel immunotherapies for glioblastoma such as vaccination with dendritic cells (DC) have yielded mixed results in clinical trials.
To address limited numbers, we sequentially conducted three separate clinical trials utilizing cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific DC vaccines in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma whereby each follow-up study had nearly doubled in sample size.
Follow-up data from the first blinded, randomized phase II clinical trial (NCT00639639) revealed that nearly one third of this cohort is without tumor recurrence at 5 years from diagnosis.
A second clinical trial (NCT00639639) resulted in a 36% survival rate at 5 years from diagnosis.
Results of the first two-arm trial (NCT00639639) showed increased migration of the DC vaccine to draining lymph nodes, and this increased migration has been recapitulated in our larger confirmatory clinical study (NCT02366728).
We have now observed that nearly one third of the glioblastoma study patient population receiving CMV-specific DC vaccines results in exceptional long-term survivors.]]></TEXT>
