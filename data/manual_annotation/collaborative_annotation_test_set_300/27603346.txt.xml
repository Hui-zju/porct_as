BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of S-1 plus cisplatin combined with concurrent radiotherapy (SCCCR) versus cisplatin alone combined with concurrent radiotherapy (CCCR) in Chinese patients with unresectable stage III nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
METHODS: Between January 2012 and December 2014, 72 eligible Chinese patients with NSCLC were included and randomly divided into 2 groups, each having 36 patients.
Patients in the SCCCR group received S-1 plus cisplatin with concurrent, radiotherapy.
The other 36 patients in the CCCR group were administered cisplatin with concurrent radiotherapy.
The primary outcome was the overall response rate.
The secondary outcomes were overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and adverse events.
RESULTS: The 3-year overall response rates for the SCCCR and CCCR groups were 60.1% and 53.3%, respectively (P = 0.041).
The median OS was 35.1 (range, 6.5-47.2) months and 24.6 (range, 2.8-24.3) months for the SCCCR and CCCR groups, respectively (P = 0.016).
The median PFS for the SCCCR and CCCR groups was 31.4 (range, 5.6-39.3) months and 22.3 (range, 2.4-36.5) months, respectively (P = 0.023).
The toxicity profiles were similar for both groups.
CONCLUSION: The efficacy and safety of SCCCR was more encouraging compared to those of CCCR in Chinese NSCLC patients.
In addition, the toxicities in both groups were tolerable.]]></TEXT>
