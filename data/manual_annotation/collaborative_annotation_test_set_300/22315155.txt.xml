PURPOSE: To evaluate the relative efficiency of leuprolide 3.75 mg, leuprolide 7.5 mg, and goserelin 3.6 mg in relation to the reduction in serum testosterone, regarding the levels of castration.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated prospectively 60 randomized patients with advanced prostate carcinoma, with indication for hormone blockade.
The patients were divided into 3 groups of 20: Group (1) received leuprolide 3.75 mg; Group (2) received leuprolide 7.5 mg; and Group (3) received goserelin 3.6 mg.
All groups were treated with monthly application of the respective drugs.
The patients' levels of serum testosterone were evaluated in two moments: before the treatment and 3 months after the treatment.
RESULTS: The patients' ages were similar within the three groups, with a median of 72, 70, and 70 in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively.
Of the patients that received leuprolide 3.75 mg, leuprolide 7.5 mg, and goserelin 3.6 mg, 26.3, 25, and 35%, respectively, did not reach castration levels, considering a testosterone cutoff </= 50 ng/dl. And 68.4, 30, and 45%, respectively, did not reach castration levels, considering a testosterone cutoff </= 20 ng/dl.
CONCLUSIONS: There were no statistically significant differences in the levels of castration when comparing leuprolide 3.75 mg, leuprolide 7.5 mg, and goserelin 3.6 mg, altogether.
When compared in groups of two, there was a statistically significant difference between leuprolide 3.75 mg and leuprolide 7.5 mg, the latter presented better results in reaching castration levels, cutoff </= 20 ng/dl.
The importance of this difference, however, must be measured with caution, since the comparison of the three groups simultaneously did not reach the established significance level, even though it came close.]]></TEXT>
