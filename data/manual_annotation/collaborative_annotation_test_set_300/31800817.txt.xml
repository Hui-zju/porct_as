OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of an auricular acupressure intervention on the quality of life of women with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy compared with those who did not undergo the intervention.
METHOD: A randomized clinical trial with 54 women followed weekly for 12 weeks, with 27 being allocated to the intervention group in which crystal pellets were applied to six acupoints (shen men, kidney, stomach, cardia, brainstem and endocrine), and 27 in the control group.
Quality of life was measured in five stages; the first before starting the intervention, and the following stages every three weeks using the Quality of Life Questionnaire - Core 30 and the Quality of Life Questionnaire - Breast Cancer BR-23 instruments.
RESULTS: There was improvement in all domains related to quality of life; however, there was significance regarding nausea, vomiting and breast symptoms in the intervention group.
CONCLUSION: Auricular acupressure has proven to be a safe, effective, low cost method with no side effects and easily applicable by trained nurses.
It may be recommended as complementary therapy in treating breast cancer to improve the quality of life of these women.
The study was registered in the Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials with the code no. RBR-36zcfg.]]></TEXT>
