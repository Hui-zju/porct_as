Low-dose methotrexate (MTX) plus vinblastine (VBL) chemotherapy is an effective treatment for desmoid-type fibromatosis (DF).
However, previous reports have described a weekly regimen, with no reports available on a biweekly one.
The aim of this study was to determine the clinical outcomes of a biweekly regimen in a cohort prospectively treated in our single institution.
Since 2010, we have prospectively treated refractory DF patients with biweekly MTX (30 mg/m(2) ) + VBL (6 mg/m(2) ).
Efficacy, progression-free survival (PFS), and correlating factors were analyzed.
Adverse events (AEs) were recorded.
In total, 38 patients received low-dose MTX + VBL therapy, and its efficacy was assessed in 37 of them.
Nineteen (51%) patients showed partial response (PR).
Clinical benefit rate was 95%.
PFS at 5 y was 80.8%.
In PR cases, median time to response was 10 mo.
Longer duration of therapy was significantly associated with the response of PR (P = .007) by univariate analysis.
There was no clear association between various clinicopathological factors, including tumor size, location, catenin beta-1 (CTNNB1) mutation status with effect.
Only 3 AEs of grade 3/4 were observed.
Tumor regrowth after MTX + VBL discontinuation was observed in 5 (20%) of 25 patients.
Biweekly administration of MTX + VBL chemotherapy was well tolerated compared with weekly administration, and its efficacy was anticipated in DF patents, although the time needed to achieve a response may be relatively long.
The treatment interval should be determined taking into account both the condition of the tumor and the patient's preference.]]></TEXT>
