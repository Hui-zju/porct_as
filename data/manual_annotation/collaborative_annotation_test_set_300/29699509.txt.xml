BACKGROUND: This pilot trial aimed to study the feasibility and effects on quality of life (QOL) and well-being of short-term fasting (STF) during chemotherapy in patients with gynecological cancer.
METHODS: In an individually-randomized cross-over trial patients with gynecological cancer, 4 to 6 planned chemotherapy cycles were included.
Thirty-four patients were randomized to STF in the first half of chemotherapies followed by normocaloric diet (group A;n = 18) or vice versa (group B;n = 16).
Fasting started 36 h before and ended 24 h after chemotherapy (60 h-fasting period).
QOL was assessed by the FACIT-measurement system.
RESULTS: The chemotherapy-induced reduction of QOL was less than the Minimally Important Difference (MID; FACT-G = 5) with STF but greater than the MID for non-fasted periods.
The mean chemotherapy-induced deterioration of total FACIT-F was 10.4 +/- 5.3 for fasted and 27.0 +/- 6.3 for non-fasted cycles in group A and 14.1 +/- 5.6 for non-fasted and 11.0 +/- 5.6 for fasted cycles in group B. There were no serious adverse effects.
CONCLUSION: STF during chemotherapy is well tolerated and appears to improve QOL and fatigue during chemotherapy.
Larger studies should prove the effect of STF as an adjunct to chemotherapy.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01954836 .]]></TEXT>
