BACKGROUND: Oesophagogastric cancer surgery is immunosuppressive.
This may be modulated by omega-3 fatty acids (O-3FAs).
The aim of this study was to assess the effect of perioperative O-3FAs on clinical outcome and immune function after oesophagogastric cancer surgery.
METHODS: Patients undergoing subtotal oesophagectomy and total gastrectomy were recruited and allocated randomly to an O-3FA enteral immunoenhancing diet (IED) or standard enteral nutrition (SEN) for 7 days before and after surgery, or to postoperative supplementation alone (control group).
Clinical outcome, fatty acid concentrations, and HLA-DR expression on monocytes and activated T lymphocytes were determined before and after operation.
RESULTS: Of 221 patients recruited, 26 were excluded.
Groups (IED, 66; SEN, 63; control, 66) were matched for age, malnutrition and co-morbidity.
There were no differences in morbidity (P = 0.646), mortality (P = 1.000) or hospital stay (P = 0.701) between the groups.
O-3FA concentrations were higher in the IED group after supplementation (P < 0.001).
The ratio of omega-6 fatty acid to O-3FA was 1.9:1, 4.1:1 and 4.8:1 on the day before surgery in the IED, SEN and control groups (P < 0.001).
There were no differences between the groups in HLA-DR expression in either monocytes (P = 0.538) or activated T lymphocytes (P = 0.204).
CONCLUSION: Despite a significant increase in plasma concentrations of O-3FA, immunonutrition with O-3FA did not affect overall HLA-DR expression on leucocytes or clinical outcome following oesophagogastric cancer surgery.
