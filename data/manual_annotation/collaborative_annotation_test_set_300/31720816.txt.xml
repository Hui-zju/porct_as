PURPOSE: A randomized phase III trial demonstrated that gemcitabine plus cisplatin (GP) prolonged progression-free survival and overall survival compared with fluorouracil plus cisplatin (FP) as first-line chemotherapy in patients with metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).
The cost-effectiveness analysis was designed to identify the economic option for metastatic NPC from a Chinese societal perspective.
METHODS: We established a Markov model that involved three health states representing the stages of disease to simulate therapy.
Survival data of clinical outcomes were derived from the trial and adjusted to quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).
Transition probabilities and health utilities were obtained from the clinical trial and published literatures.
The cost-effective strategy was estimated for these treatments using a willing-to-pay (WTP) threshold.
A one-way sensitivity analysis was conducted to study the influences of parameters.
RESULTS: GP treatment group produced a gain of 0.37 QALYs with an incremental cost of $2520.80, yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $6812.97 per QALY, compared with FP treatment ($15,530.96 versus $13,010.16).
The ICER was lower than the accepted WTP threshold, which was 3 times gross domestic product per capita of China ($25,749 per QALY).
CONCLUSION: GP regimen is more cost-effective compared with FP regimen as the first-line treatment for Chinese patients with metastatic NPC.]]></TEXT>
