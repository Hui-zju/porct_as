Background: In the phase 3 RADIANT-2 study, everolimus plus octreotide long-acting repeatable (LAR) showed improvement of 5.1 months in median progression-free survival versus placebo plus octreotide LAR among patients with advanced neuroendocrine tumors associated with carcinoid syndrome.
The progression-free survival P-value was marginally above the prespecified threshold for statistical significance.
Here, we report final overall survival (OS) and key safety update from RADIANT-2.
Patients and methods: The RADIANT-2 trial compared everolimus (10 mg/day, orally; n = 216) versus placebo (n = 213), both in conjunction with octreotide LAR (30 mg, intramuscularly, every 28 days).
Patients, unblinded at the time of progression or after end of double-blind core phase following primary analysis, were offered open-label everolimus with octreotide LAR (open-label phase).
In the open-label phase, patients had similar safety and efficacy assessments as those in the core phase.
For OS, hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs using unadjusted Cox model and a Cox model adjusted for prespecified baseline covariates were calculated.
Results: A total of 170 patients received open-label everolimus (143 crossed over from the placebo arm; 27 in the everolimus arm continued to receive the same treatment after unblinding).
The median OS (95% CI) after 271 events was 29.2 months (23.8-35.9) for the everolimus arm and 35.2 months (30.0-44.7) for the placebo arm (HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.92-1.49).
HR adjusted for baseline covariates was 1.08 (95% CI, 0.84-1.38).
The most frequent drug-related grade 3 or 4 AEs reported during the open-label phase were diarrhea (5.3%), fatigue (4.7%), and stomatitis (4.1%).
Deaths related to pulmonary or cardiac failure were observed more frequently in the everolimus arm.
Conclusion: No significant difference in OS was observed for the everolimus plus octreotide LAR and placebo plus octreotide LAR arms of the RADIANT-2 study, even after adjusting for imbalances in the baseline covariates.
