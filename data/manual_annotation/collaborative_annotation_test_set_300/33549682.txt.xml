INTRODUCTION: Although African Americans have the highest colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality rates of any racial group, their screening rates remain low.
STUDY DESIGN/PURPOSE: This randomized controlled trial compared efficacy of two clinic-based interventions for increasing CRC screening among African American primary care patients.
METHODS: African American patients from 11 clinics who were not current with CRC screening were randomized to receive a computer-tailored intervention (n = 335) or a non-tailored brochure (n = 358) designed to promote adherence to CRC screening.
Interventions were delivered in clinic immediately prior to a provider visit.
Univariate and multivariable logistic regression models analyzed predictors of screening test completion.
Moderators and mediators were determined using multivariable linear and logistic regression analyses.
RESULTS: Significant effects of the computer-tailored intervention were observed for completion of a stool blood test (SBT) and completion of any CRC screening test (SBT or colonoscopy).
The colonoscopy screening rate was higher among those receiving the computer-tailored intervention group compared to the nontailored brochure but the difference was not significant.
Predictors of SBT completion were: receipt of the computer-tailored intervention; being seen at a Veterans Affairs Medical Center clinic; baseline stage of adoption; and reason for visit.
Mediators of intervention effects were changes in perceived SBT barriers, changes in perceived colonoscopy benefits, changes in CRC knowledge, and patient-provider discussion.
Moderators of intervention effects were age, employment, and family/friend recommendation of screening.
CONCLUSION: This one-time computer-tailored intervention significantly improved CRC screening rates among low-income African American patients.
This finding was largely driven by increasing SBT but the impact of the intervention on colonoscopy screening was strong.
Implementation of a CRC screening quality improvement program in the VA site that included provision of stool blood test kits and follow-up likely contributed to the strong intervention effect observed at that site.
The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT00672828.]]></TEXT>
