We conducted a prospective randomized study to investigate the effect of daikenchuto (DKT) on abdominal symptoms following laparoscopic colectomy in patients with left-sided colon cancer.
Patients who suffered from abdominal pain or distention on postoperative day 1 were randomized to either the DKT group or non-DKT group.
The primary endpoints were the evaluation of abdominal pain, abdominal distention, and quality of life.
The metabolome and gut microbiome analyses were conducted as secondary endpoints.
A total of 17 patients were enrolled: 8 patients in the DKT group and 9 patients in the non-DKT group.
There were no significant differences in the primary endpoints and postoperative adverse events between the two groups.
The metabolome and gut microbiome analyses showed that the levels of plasma lipid mediators associated with the arachidonic acid cascade were lower in the DKT group than in the non-DKT group, and that the relative abundance of genera Serratia and Bilophila were lower in the DKT group than in the non-DKT group.
DKT administration did not improve the abdominal symptoms following laparoscopic colectomy.
The effects of DKT on metabolites and gut microbiome have to be further investigated.]]></TEXT>
