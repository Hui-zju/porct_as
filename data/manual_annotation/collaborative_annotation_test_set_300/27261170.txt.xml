Cancer related cognitive impairments (CRCI) are frequently reported by patients prior to, during and after medical treatment.
Although this cognitive decline severely affects patients' quality of life, little is known about effective treatments.
Exercise programs represent a promising supportive strategy in this field.
However, evidence is sparse and existing studies display methodological limitations.
In the planned study, 83 men and women newly diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) will be randomized into one of three treatment groups.
During 4weeks of induction chemotherapy with Anthracycline and Cytarabin patients allocated to exercise group will cycle 3x/week for 30min at moderate to vigorous intensity on an ergometer.
Patients allocated to placebo group will receive a supervised myofascial release training (3x/week, approx. 30min) and patients at control group will get usual care.
As primary endpoints a cognitive test battery will be conducted measuring performances depending on verbal/spatial memory and executive functioning.
Secondary endpoints will be self-perceived cognitive functioning, as well as neurotrophic and inflammatory serum markers.
All assessments will be conducted immediately after hospitalization and before chemotherapy is commenced, immediately before discharge of hospital after 4-5weeks as well as before continuing medical treatment 3-4weeks after discharge.
This will be the first study investigating the impact of an aerobic exercise training on CRCI in AML/MDS patients.
We hope that the study design and the state-of-the-art assessments will help to increase knowledge about CRCI in general and exercise as potential treatment option in this under investigated population.]]></TEXT>
