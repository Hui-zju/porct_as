PURPOSE: To compare the receipt of clofarabine plus cytarabine (Clo+Ara-C arm) with cytarabine (Ara-C arm) in patients >
/= 55 years old with refractory or relapsed acute myelogenous leukemia (AML).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive either clofarabine (Clo) 40 mg/m(2) or a placebo followed by Ara-C 1 g/m(2) for five consecutive days.
The primary end point was overall survival (OS).
Secondary end points included event-free survival (EFS), 4-month EFS, overall remission rate (ORR; complete remission [CR] plus CR with incomplete peripheral blood count recovery), disease-free survival (DFS), duration of remission (DOR), and safety.
RESULTS: Among 320 patients with confirmed AML (median age, 67 years), the median OS was 6.6 months in the Clo+Ara-C arm and 6.3 months in the Ara-C arm (hazard ratio [HR], 1.00; 95% CI, 0.78 to 1.28; P = 1.00).
The ORR was 46.9% in the Clo+Ara-C arm (35.2% CR) versus 22.9% in the Ara-C arm (17.8% CR; P < .01).
EFS (HR: 0.63; 95% CI, 0.49 to 0.80; P < .01) and 4-month EFS (37.7% v 16.6%; P < .01) favored the Clo+Ara-C arm compared with Ara-C arm, respectively.
DFS and DOR were similar in both arms.
Overall 30-day mortality was 16% and 5% for CLO+Ara-C and Ara-C arms, respectively.
In the Clo+Ara-C and Ara-C arms, the most common grade 3 to 4 toxicities were febrile neutropenia (47% v 35%, respectively), hypokalemia (18% v 11%, respectively), thrombocytopenia (16% v 17%, respectively), pneumonia (14% v 10%, respectively), anemia (13% v 0%, respectively), neutropenia (11% v 9%, respectively), increased AST (11% v 2%, respectively), and increased ALT (10% v 3%, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Although the primary end point of OS did not differ between arms, Clo+Ara-C significantly improved response rates and EFS.
Study follow-up continues, and the role of clofarabine in the treatment of adult patients with AML continues to be investigated.]]></TEXT>
