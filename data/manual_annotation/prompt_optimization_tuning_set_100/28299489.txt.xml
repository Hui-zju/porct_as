<TEXT><![CDATA[A split-face comparison of Q-switched Nd:YAG 1064-nm laser for facial rejuvenation in Nevus of Ota patients.
We aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of using the 1064-nm Q-switched neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) laser (QSNYL) for skin rejuvenation in patients with Nevus of Ota.
A retrospective, randomized, split-faced, clinical study was conducted.
Twenty-nine patients with unilateral moderate to severe Nevus of Ota were enrolled.
The participants completed 3-13 sessions of QSNYL treatments 3-6 months apart.
Two independent physicians compared the treated and untreated sides of the face to evaluate the clearance of Nevus of Ota, the wrinkle severity rating scale (WSRS), the global aesthetic improvement scale (GAIS), and adverse event reporting.
Patients' satisfaction levels were also considered.
Of the 29 patients, 28 (96.6%) achieved nearly complete pigmentation clearance.
After an average of 7.76 +/- 2.99 sessions, statistically significant improvement in wrinkles and skin texture were observed, compared with the untreated side.
The degree of skin rejuvenation was positively correlated with the number of treatment sessions.
No clinically adverse effects were observed.
Repeated QSNYL treatments not only remove the pigment in Nevus of Ota effectively and safely but also improve facial rejuvenation.]]></TEXT>
