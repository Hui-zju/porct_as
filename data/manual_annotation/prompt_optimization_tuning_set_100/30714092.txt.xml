Aneuploidy is common in paediatric B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL).
Specific subgroups, such as high hyperdiploidy (>50 chromosomes or DNA Index >/=1.16) and hypodiploidy (<45 chromosomes), predict outcome of patients after primary treatment.
Whether aneuploidy has a prognostic value for relapsed disease is yet to be determined.
Using DNA index and centromere screening by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, we investigated aneuploidy in 413 children treated for first relapse of B-cell precursor ALL according to the ALL-REZ BFM 2002 protocol.
Ten-year event-free survival of patients with high hyperdiploid relapses approached 70%, whereas it was only 40% in low hyperdiploid relapses.
Three patients with apparent hyperdiploid relapse had TP53 mutations.
In these cases, array-based allelotyping revealed a hypodiploid origin with absence of the hypodiploid founder clone (masked hypodiploidy).
Collectively, patients with evident or masked hypodiploid relapses showed an extremely low event-free survival rate of 9%.
Importantly, the current relapse risk stratification did not identify cases with masked hypodiploidy as high-risk patients, due to their favourable clinical presentation.
In multivariate analysis, hypodiploidy proved to be an independent prognostic factor.
This finding supports stratification of relapses with hypodiploid origin into high-risk arms in future trials or allocation of patients to alternative treatment approaches.]]></TEXT>
