<TEXT><![CDATA[The effects of spinach-derived thylakoid supplementation in combination with calorie restriction on anthropometric parameters and metabolic profiles in obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.
BACKGROUND: There is a promising outlook regarding the potential effect of spinach-derived thylakoids in the management of obesity and its associated metabolic disturbances.
This research aimed to evaluate the effects of spinach-derived thylakoids supplementation combined with a calorie-restricted diet on anthropometric and metabolic profiles in obese women with the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).
METHODS: In a 12-week double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial, 48 females with obesity and PCOS were randomly allocated into either intervention (5 g/day thylakoid) or placebo (5 g/day cornstarch) groups along with calorie-restricted diets.
Anthropometric measures, physical activity levels, dietary intakes, insulin resistance markers, as well as serum levels of insulin, fasting blood glucose (FBG), non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), and sex hormones including dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and free androgen index (FAI) were evaluated pre-and post-intervention.
RESULTS: After the 12-week intervention, there were significant decreases in weight (- 6.97 +/- 0.52 vs. -3.19 +/- 0.72 kg; P < 0.001), waist circumference (- 7.78 +/- 2.50 vs. -3.73 +/- 1.40 cm; P < 0.001), fat mass (- 5.19 +/- 0.53 vs. -1.36 +/- 0.39 kg; P < 0.001), and insulin levels (- 5.40 +/- 1.86 vs. -1.19 +/- 0.85 muU/mL; P < 0.001) in the spinach-derived thylakoid group compared to the placebo group.
Furthermore, insulin resistance markers and serum levels of testosterone decreased significantly in the thylakoid group compared to the placebo group (P < 0.05).
The changes in other parameters did not show significant differences between the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Spinach-derived thylakoid supplementation resulted in more favorable improvements in anthropometric indices and insulin sensitivity compared to the calorie restriction alone.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Research Vice-chancellor of Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran, and was registered in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (registration ID: IRCT20140907019082N9 ).]]></TEXT>
