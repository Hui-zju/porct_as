BACKGROUND: Plasma D-dimer levels have been associated with tumor progression and oncological outcomes in several cancers.
This study assessed the relationships of D-dimer levels with clinicopathological features and survival outcomes in patients with gastric cancer undergoing gastrectomy.
METHODS: Data from 666 patients with gastric cancer who underwent gastrectomy between June 2012 and December 2015 were collected and analyzed; these data were acquired during a previous randomized clinical trial (PROTECTOR trial, NCT01448746).
Optimal cut-off values of preoperative, immediate postoperative, postoperative-day 1, postoperative-day 4, and postoperative-day 30 D-dimer levels for predicting overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were determined using Contal and O'Quigley's method.
The optimal cut-off value of the immediate postoperative D-dimer level for predicting OS was 3.33.
Patients were divided into D-dimer high and low groups based on these cut-off values.
RESULTS: High immediate postoperative D-dimer levels were significantly associated with advanced T stage and TNM stage (P = 0.001 and P = 0.006, respectively).
OS and DFS were significantly lower for patients in the D-dimer high group than for patients in the D-dimer low group; this relationship was consistent for preoperative, immediate postoperative, postoperative-day 1, and postoperative-day 30 D-dimer levels.
Multivariate analysis identified the immediate postoperative D-dimer level as an independent prognostic factor for OS (hazard ratio, 2.52; P = 0.010).
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated immediate postoperative D-dimer level was predictive of poor long-term outcomes in patients with gastric cancer after gastrectomy.
Immediate postoperative D-dimer levels may offer simple and inexpensive clinical decision-making guidance for patients with gastric cancer after gastrectomy.]]></TEXT>
