<TEXT><![CDATA[Effect of a Perioperative Nutritional Supplementation with Oral Impact(R) in Patients undergoing Hepatic Surgery for Liver Cancer: A Prospective, Placebo-Controlled, Randomized, Double-Blind Study.
Perioperative nutrition with supplements containing L-arginine, omega3-polyunsaturated fatty acids, and nucleotides could boost liver function recovery, immune response, and resistance to infection after hepatic resection.
We conducted a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind study to assess the effect of a perioperative nutritional supplementation with Oral Impact(R) in patients undergoing hepatic surgery for liver cancer.
Treatment was given three times daily for 7 days before and 3 days after surgery.
Primary outcome was factor V, 3 days after surgery.
Thirty-five patients (placebo: 17; Oral Impact: 18) were included.
Five patients (placebo: three; Oral Impact: two) were not operated and five (placebo: two; Oral Impact: three) did not undergo hepatic resection.
Factor V (mean +/- SD) was 70 +/- 27% and 79 +/- 25% (P = 0.409) 3 days after surgery and 90 +/- 30% and 106 +/- 16% (P = 0.066) 5 days after surgery, in placebo and Oral Impact groups, respectively.
There were no significant differences between groups on other outcomes assessing liver function recovery (bile production, gamma-glutamyl transferase, alpha-fetoprotein), immune response (CD3, CD4, CD8 cells, CD4/CD8 ratio, natural killer cells, B lymphocytes), number of infections, and tolerance.
A 10-day perioperative nutritional supplementation with Oral Impact does not improve hepatic function, immune response, and resistance to infection in patients undergoing hepatic surgery for liver cancer.]]></TEXT>
