BACKGROUND AND AIM: Current chemoradiotherapy doesn't usually effectively control oesophageal cancer progression.
This study assessed the efficacy and toxicity profiles of paclitaxel/lobaplatin (TL)- and cisplatin/5-fluorouracil (PF)-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) in patients with advanced inoperable oesophageal cancer.
METHODS: A total of such 68 patients was recruited and randomised to receive TL or PF-based CCRT.
Radiotherapy was given at a total dose of 60-70 Gy over 6 weeks.
In the TL group of patients, paclitaxel 60 mg/m(2) was administered intravenously on day 1, 8 and 15 and lobaplatin 30 mg/m(2) was administered on day 2 in two cycles at 3-week intervals.
In the PF group, cisplatin 75 mg/m(2) was administered intravenously on day 1, and 5-fluorouracil 500 mg/m(2) and leucovorin 200 mg/m(2) were administered intravenously daily for 5 days in two cycles at 3-week intervals.
Adverse events, treatment response and follow-up data were collected.
RESULTS: The treatment response rates were 73.53% and 50.00% in the TL and PF groups respectively (P = 0.040).
The median tumour progression-free survival (PFS) was 13.0 and 6.5 months in the TL and PF groups respectively (P = 0.034).
Compared with PF group, the TL group demonstrated decreased grade 3/4 nausea and vomiting (5.88% vs 35.29%, P = 0.003), decreased granulocytopenia (11.76% vs 32.35%, P = 0.041) and platelet count reduction (32.5% vs 8.8%, P = 0.016).
CONCLUSIONS: The TL treatment regimen demonstrated higher efficacy with less overall toxicity in patients with advanced inoperable oesophageal cancer compared with the PF regimen.
Further study is warranted to validate our current observations.]]></TEXT>
