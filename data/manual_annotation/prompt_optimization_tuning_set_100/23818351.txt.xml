<TEXT><![CDATA[D-dimer is a marker of response to chemotherapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.
PURPOSE: D-dimer, LDH and tumor markers are usually overexpressed in colorectal carcinomas (CRC).
Our purpose was to assess the prognostic role of D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), CEA, CA19-9 and CA72-4 in patients with metastatic CRC treated with XELOX chemotherapy.
METHODS: Thirty-eight CRC patients who had evidence of distant metastasis were enrolled in the study and blood samples were taken before chemotherapy for estimation of the tumor markers CEA, CA19-9 and CA72-4, and for D-dimer and LDH.
Patients were randomized into 3 groups: those with partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), and progressive disease (PD) according to their clinical and radiologic evaluation after 3 cycles of XELOX chemotherapy.
All parameters were reevaluated after the 3rd cycle of chemotherapy.
RESULTS: Eighteen patients (47.3%) achieved PR, 10 (26.3%) SD, and 10 (26.3%) showed PD.
After 3 cycles of XELOX CEA (20.55 vs 11.97 ng7sol;ml; p=0.002), LDH (357.50 vs 214.0 U7sol; lt; p=0.001) and D-dimer (1.56 vs 1.17 mugFEU/ml; p=0.022) levels were significantly decreased in the PR group.
D-dimer levels were also notably decreased (1.36 vs 0.77 mugFEU/ml; p=0.021) in the SD group.
In the PD group a considerable increase was seen in CA 19-9 (119.5 vs 243.09 U/ml; p=0.025), CA 72-4 (5.18 vs 25.8 U/ml; p=0.036) and D-dimer levels (1.77 vs 1.88 mugFEU/ml; p=0.012).
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that D-dimer, LDH and tumor markers can be helpful in determining CRC prognosis in patients with metastatic disease.
D-dimer, LDH and tumor markers provided unique prognostic information in advanced CRC patients.]]></TEXT>
