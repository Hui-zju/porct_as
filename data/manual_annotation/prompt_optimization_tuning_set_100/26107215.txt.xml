BACKGROUND: The research was to compare the efficacy and side effects of cisplatin or lobaplatin in combination with mitomycine (MMC) and vincristine in treating patients with cervical squamous carcinoma.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cervical squamous carcinoma patients who were pathologically diagnosed with stage Ib-IIb from April 2012 to May 2013 in the general hospital of Chinese People's Libration Amy were enrolled.
All patients were confirmed without prior treatment and were randomly divided into two groups, Group A and B. Efficacy and side effects were evaluated after one cycle of chemotherapy.
RESULTS: Group A (n=42) were treated with Loubo(R) (Lobaplatin) 50mg/m2, MMC 16mg/m2 and Vincristine 2mg/m2 every 21 days.
Group B (n=44) were treated with Cisplatin 100mg/m2, MMC 16mg/m2 and Vincristine 2mg/m2 every 21 days.
All 86 patients completed one cycle of chemotherapy with cisplatin or lobaplatin in combination with MMC and vincristine.
No difference was observed regardiing short-term effect between two groups.
Main side effects were bone marrow suppression and gastrointestinal reactions including decrease of white blood cells, platelet and nausea/vomiting.
Grade III-VI liver and kidney impairment was not reported in two groups.
In group A the incidence of uterine artery spasm in the process of drug delivery was significantly lower than the group B. CONCLUSIONS: Cisplatin or lobaplatin with MMC and Vincristine in the interventional treatment of cervical squamous carcinoma were effective, especially after uterine artery perfusion chemotherapy at tumor reduction and tumor downstaging period.
The adverse reactions of concurrent chemotherapy are tolerable, and low physical and mental pressure even more less stimulation of vascular in treatment with lobaplatin.
However, the long-term effects of this treatment need further observation.]]></TEXT>
