high risk (HR): KMT2A-rearranged and older than 6 months with WBC count 300 x 10(9)/L or more or a poor prednisone response; and medium risk (MR): all other KMT2A-rearranged cases.Patients in the MR and HR groups were randomly assigned to receive the lymphoid course low-dose cytosine arabinoside [araC], 6-mercaptopurine, cyclophosphamide (IB) or experimental myeloid courses, namely araC, daunorubicin, etoposide (ADE) and mitoxantrone, araC, etoposide (MAE).RESULTS: A total of 651 infants were included, with 6-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival of 46.1% (SE, 2.1) and 58.2% (SE, 2.0).In West European/North American groups, 6-year EFS and overall survival were 49.4% (SE, 2.5) and 62.1% (SE, 2.4), which were 10% to 12% higher than in other countries.The 6-year probability of disease-free survival was comparable for the randomized arms (ADE+MAE 39.3% [SE 4.0;

B = 3.112, P = 0.039, bias-corrected and accelerated (BCa) 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.371 to 6.014) and greater sensory pain (B = 0.695, P = 0.023, BCa 95% CI = 0.085 to 1.210) were associated with greater aftersensation pain at 15 seconds.Greater sensory pain scores were associated with greater aftersensation pain at 30 seconds (B = 0.286, P = 0.045, BCa 95% CI = 0.008 to 0.513).Depression was not associated with aftersensation pain.The overall models accounted for 44.5% and 40.4% of the variance in aftersensation pain at 15 and 30 seconds, respectively.Conclusions.Longer SOL and higher subjective sensory pain were related to greater aftersensation of experimentally induced pain in women postsurgery for gynecologic cancers.Interventions that improve sleep and subjective sensory pain during the perisurgical period may reduce risk for central sensitization of pain."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Please ascertain whether the article meets all of the following criteria (criterion by criterion).\n\n# Criteria\n- format: The article must provide a detailed description of the RCT design, including randomization methods, control group setup, etc.\n- population: The article must clearly state that the study subjects are patients diagnosed with cancer.\n- purpose: The article must show the results of cancer treatment evaluation, such as progression-free survival, overall survival, response rates, etc. Note: Articles with poor results also meet the criteria.\n- biomarker: The article must clearly mention that the study involves treatment strategies related to the patient's genetic and molecular characteristics, such as CD30-positive, hormone receptor-positive, HR+, HER2-, etc.\n\n# Response\nProvide your response in JSON format, as follows:\n{\"justification\": \"Provide a brief analysis if the article meets each criterion.\", \"whether_meet_all_criteria\": \"Yes/No\"}\n\n# Options\n- Yes\n- No\n\nANSWER:\n"}]}], [{"response": "```json\n{\n  \"justification\": {\n    \"format\": \"The article provides a detailed description of the RCT design, including randomization methods, control group setup, etc.\",\n    \"population\": \"The article does not specify that the study subjects are patients diagnosed with cancer.

applications on smartphones can communicate a large amount of personalized, real-time health information, including advice on skin cancer prevention, but their effectiveness may be affected by whether recipients can be convinced to use them.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a smartphone mobile application (Solar Cell) delivering real-time advice about sun protection for a second time in a randomized clinical trial.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A previous trial conducted in 2012 used a randomized pretest-posttest design.For the present trial, we collected data from a volunteer sample of 202 adults 18 years or older who owned a smartphone.Participants were recruited nationwide through online promotions.Screening procedures and a 3-week run-in period were added to increase the use of the mobile application.We conducted follow-ups at 3 and 8 weeks after randomization to examine the immediate and the longer-term effects of the intervention.INTERVENTIONS: Use of the mobile application.The application gave feedback on sun protection (ie, sun-safety practices and the risk for sunburn) and alerted users to apply or to reapply sunscreen and to get out of the sun.The application also displayed the hourly UV Index and vitamin D production based on the forecast UV Index, time, and location.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Percentage of days with the use of sun protection, time spent outdoors in the midday sun (days and hours), and the number of sunburns in the last 3 months.RESULTS: Participants in the intervention group used wide-brimmed hats more at 7 weeks than control participants (23.8% vs 17.4%; F = 4.07; P = .045).Women who used the mobile application reported using all sun protection combined more than men (46.4% vs 43.3%; F = 1.49; P = .04), whereas men and older individuals reported less use of sunscreen (32.7% vs 35.5%; F = 5.36; P = .02) and hats (15.6% vs 17.9%; F = 4.72; P = .03).CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The mobile application initially appeared to confer weak improvement of sun protection.Use of the mobile application was greater than in a previous trial and was associated with greater sun protection, especially among women.Strategies to increase the use of the mobile application are needed if the application is to be deployed effectively to the general adult population."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Please ascertain whether the

longitudinal follow-up post-intervention.The pulse-based group had a greater reduction in total area under the curve for insulin response to a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (mean change +/- SD: -121.0 +/-229.9 vs. -27.4 +/- 110.2 microIU/mL x min; p = 0.05); diastolic blood pressure (-3.6 +/- 6.7 vs. -0.2 +/- 6.7 mmHg, p = 0.05); triglyceride (-0.2 +/- 0.6 vs. 0.0 +/- 0.5 mmol/L, p = 0.04); low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-0.2 +/- 0.4 vs. -0.1 +/- 0.4 mmol/L, p = 0.05); total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TC/HDL-C; -0.4 +/- 0.4 vs. 0.1 +/- 0.4, p < 0.001); and a greater increase in HDL-C (0.1 +/- 0.2 vs. -0.1 +/- 0.2 mmol/L, p < 0.01) than the TLC group.Decreased TC/HDL-C (p = 0.02) at six-month and increased HDL-C and decreased TC/HDL-C (p </= 0.02) at 12-month post-intervention were maintained in the pulse-based group.A pulse-based diet may be more effective than the TLC diet at improving cardio-metabolic disease risk factors in women with

activity among recently diagnosed breast and prostate cancer survivors.BACKGROUND: Cancer treatment -related side effects may have a negative impact on quality of life among cancer survivors and may limit participation in physical activity (PA).HYPOTHESIS: Cancer-specific concerns will be reduced throughout a 10-month diet and exercise intervention among recently diagnosed cancer survivors.Additionally, participants reporting greater levels of PA will also report fewer cancer-specific concerns.STUDY DESIGN: This study is an exploratory analysis of 452 recently diagnosed, early-stage breast and prostate cancer survivors who participated in the FRESH START diet and exercise trial.Data were collected at baseline and 1-year follow-up.RESULTS: At baseline, chief concerns among prostate cancer survivors included ability to have an erection (mean score [standard deviation] = 1.0 [1.3]) and urinary frequency (2.5 [1.4]), whereas among breast cancer survivors, eminent concerns were not feeling sexually attractive (2.0 [1.3]) and worry about cancer in other members of their family (2.1 [1.3]).At 1 year, there was a significant improvement in cancer-specific concerns on breast cancer-specific concerns (P < .01) but not on prostate cancer-specific concerns.At baseline, women who were self-conscious about their dress had higher levels of PA, whereas men reporting issues with incontinence reported lesser increases in PA in response to the intervention.CONCLUSION: Cancer-specific concerns diminish over time, especially among breast cancer survivors.Among prostate cancer survivors, incontinence is a significant barrier that hinders benefit from PA interventions.Thus, there is a need either for medical interventions to ameliorate incontinence or for behavioral interventions to address this issue among survivors."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Please ascertain whether the article meets all of the following criteria (criterion by criterion).\n\n#

Randomized Phase II Study.Introduction: Oral nutritional supplementation (ONS) in cancer patients is justified by the low food intake caused by several factors.However, ONS can be affected by adverse events (AEs) correlated to treatment.This study aimed to compare the safety and efficacy of ONS (whey protein isolated, leucin, zinc-IMMAX(R)) during oncologic treatment.Methods: Patients in chemo/chemoradiotherapy were randomly assigned to receive IMMAX(R)+nutritional counseling (NC) according to daily requirements (S arm) or NC alone (C arm) for 4 weeks.Body weight (BW), %fat-free mass (%FFM) and nutrition intake were assessed before and after.In S arm, calories from IMMAX met the energy requirements.AEs were classified according to CTC-AE-NCI.Results: Eighty-five patients were included (51 females).After 4 weeks, the median of caloric intake, BW and %FFM were not statistically different in C arm.In S arm, median ONS intake was 81 g/332 kcal/day, protein intake was higher (pre: 66.75 +/- 31.57 g; post: 88.57 +/- 35.11 g; p < 0.01) and calories as well (pre: 1,549 +/- 596 kcal; post: 1,756 +/- 614 kcal; p = 0.02).The most common treatment related AEs were anemia, nausea/vomiting, not different between the arms.AEs supplement related were constipation and diarrhea (2 patients/4.6% each).Conclusion: IMMAX was safe, well tolerated, it did not interfere with oncologic treatment and provided significant amount of protein intake in this patient population, with few related AEs."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Please ascertain whether the article meets all

95% CI, 0.50 to 0.98).The percentage of patients who received subsequent antineoplastic therapy was balanced between the groups (68.9% in the ribociclib group and 73.2% in the placebo group).The time from randomization to disease progression during receipt of second-line therapy or to death was also longer in the ribociclib group than in the placebo group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.69;

Trial.OBJECTIVES: To evaluate sites of failure and long-term survival outcomes of locally advanced stage cervical cancer patients who had standard concurrent chemo-radiation (CCRT) versus those along with adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) after CCRT.METHODS: Patients aged 18-70 years who had FIGO stage IIB-IVA without para-aortic lymph node enlargement (excluding by International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) 2018 stage IIIC2r), The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scores 0-2, and non-aggressive histopathology were randomized to have CCRT with weekly cisplatin followed by observation (arm A) or ACT with paclitaxel plus carboplatin every 4 weeks for 3 cycles (arm B).RESULTS: From 2015-2017, 259 patients were evaluated.The majority of patients were in stage II and had squamous cell carcinoma with a median tumor size of 5 cm.After the median follow-up of 40.87 months, 17.1% of the patients in arm A and 12.3% of the patients in arm B experienced recurrences (p=0.280).Adding all events of failure (persistence/progression/recurrence), treatment failures tended to be lower in arm A than in arm B: 13.2 versus 21.5 % for loco-regional failure (p = 0.076) and 3.9 versus 6.9% for loco-regional failure and systemic failure (p = 0.278).On the other hand, systemic failure tended to be higher in arm A than in arm B: 13.2% versus 6.9% (p =0.094).The 5-year progression-free survival and 5-year overall survival of patients in both arms were not significantly different.CONCLUSIONS: ACT with paclitaxel plus carboplatin after CCRT did not improve

unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (DANUBE): a randomised, open-label, multicentre, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Survival outcomes are poor for patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma who receive standard, first-line, platinum-based chemotherapy.We assessed the overall survival of patients who received durvalumab (a PD-L1 inhibitor), with or without tremelimumab (a CTLA-4 inhibitor), as a first-line treatment for metastatic urothelial carcinoma.METHODS: DANUBE is an open-label, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial in patients with untreated, unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma, conducted at 224 academic research centres, hospitals, and oncology clinics in 23 countries.Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1.We randomly assigned patients (1:1:1) to receive durvalumab monotherapy (1500 mg) administered intravenously every 4 weeks; durvalumab (1500 mg) plus tremelimumab (75 mg) administered intravenously every 4 weeks for up to four doses, followed by durvalumab maintenance (1500 mg) every 4 weeks; or standard-of-care chemotherapy (gemcitabine plus cisplatin or gemcitabine plus carboplatin, depending on cisplatin eligibility) administered intravenously for up to six cycles.Randomisation was done through an interactive voice-web response system, with stratification by cisplatin eligibility, PD-L1 status, and presence or absence of liver metastases, lung metastases, or both.The coprimary endpoints were overall survival compared between the durvalumab monotherapy versus chemotherapy groups in the population of patients with high PD-L1 expression (the high PD-L1 population) and between the durvalumab plus tremelimumab versus chemotherapy groups in the intention-to-treat population (all randomly assigned patients).The study has completed enrolment and the final analysis of overall survival is reported.The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02516241, and the EU Clinical Trials Register, EudraCT number 2015-001633-24.FINDINGS: Between Nov 24, 2015, and March 21, 2017, we randomly assigned 1032 patients to receive durvalumab (n=346), durvalumab plus tremelimumab (n=342), or chemotherapy (n=344).At data cutoff (Jan 27, 2020), median follow-up for survival was 41.2 months (IQR 37.9-43.2) for all patients.In the high PD-L1 population, median overall survival was 14.4 months (95% CI 10.4-17.3) in the durvalumab monotherapy group (n=209) versus 12.1 months (10.4-15.0) in the chemotherapy group (n=207; hazard ratio 0.89, 95% CI 0.71-1.11; p=0.30).In the intention-to-treat population, median overall survival was 15.1 months (13.1-18.0) in the durvalumab plus tremelimumab group versus 12.1 months (10.9-14.0) in the chemotherapy group (0.85, 95% CI 0.72-1.02; p=0.075).In the safety population, grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 47 (14%) of 345 patients in the durvalumab group, 93 (27%) of 340 patients in the durvalumab plus tremelimumab group, and in 188 (60%) of 313 patients in the chemotherapy group.The most common grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse event was increased lipase in the durvalumab group (seven [2%] of 345 patients) and in the durvalumab plus tremelimumab group (16 [5%] of 340 patients), and neutropenia in the chemotherapy group (66 [21%] of 313 patients).Serious treatment-related adverse events occurred in 30 (9%) of 345 patients in the durvalumab group, 78 (23%) of 340 patients in the durvalumab plus tremelimumab group, and 50 (16%) of 313 patients in the chemotherapy group.Deaths due to study drug toxicity were reported in two (1%) patients in the durvalumab group (acute hepatic failure and hepatitis), two (1%) patients in the durvalumab plus tremelimumab group (septic shock and pneumonitis), and one (<1%) patient in the chemotherapy group (acute kidney injury).INTERPRETATION: This study did not meet either of its coprimary endpoints.Further research to identify the patients with previously untreated metastatic urothelial carcinoma who benefit from treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors, either alone or in combination regimens, is warranted.FUNDING: AstraZeneca."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Please ascertain whether the article meets all of the following criteria

during hyper-CVAD (fractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone alternating with methotrexate and high-dose cytarabine, with methylprednisolone premedication) chemotherapy is associated with poor outcomes of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).PATIENTS AND METHODS: To examine whether an intensive insulin regimen could improve outcomes compared with conventional antidiabetic pharmacotherapy, a randomized trial was conducted that compared glargine plus aspart vs. conventional therapy (control).Between April 2004 and July 2008, 52 patients newly diagnosed with ALL, Burkitt lymphoma, or lymphoblastic lymphoma who were on hyper-CVAD in the inpatient setting and had a random serum glucose level >180 mg/dL on >/=2 occasions during chemotherapy were enrolled.RESULTS: The trial was terminated early due to futility regarding ALL clinical outcomes despite improved glycemic control.Secondary analysis revealed that molar insulin-to-C-peptide ratio (I/C) > 0.175 (a surrogate measure of exogenous insulin usage) was associated with decreased overall survival, complete remission duration and progression-free survival (PFS), whereas metformin and/or thiazolidinedione usage were associated with increased PFS.In multivariate analyses, factors that significantly predicted short overall survival included age >/= 60 years (P = .0002), I/C >/= 0.175 (P = .0016), and average glucose level >/= 180 mg/dL (P = .0236).Factors that significantly predicted short PFS included age >/= 60 years (P = .0008), I/C >/= 0.175 (P = .0002), high systemic risk (P = .0173) and average glucose level >/= 180 mg/dL (P = .0249).I/C >/= 0.175 was the only significant (P = .0042) factor that predicted short complete remission duration.CONCLUSIONS: A glargine-plus-aspart intensive insulin regimen did not improve ALL outcomes in patients with hyperglycemia.Exogenous insulin may be associated with poor outcomes, whereas metformin and thiazolidinediones may be associated with improved outcomes.Analysis of these results suggests that the choice of antidiabetic pharmacotherapy may influence ALL outcomes."}, {"role": "user",

Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a significant problem for cancer patients, and there are limited treatment options for this often debilitating condition.Neuromodulatory interventions could be a novel modality for patients trying to manage CIPN symptoms; however, they are not yet the standard of care.This study examined whether electroencephalogram (EEG) neurofeedback (NFB) could alleviate CIPN symptoms in survivors.METHODS: This was a randomized controlled trial with survivors assigned to an NFB group or a wait-list control (WLC) group.The NFB group underwent 20 sessions of NFB, in which visual and auditory rewards were given for voluntary changes in EEGs.The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) worst-pain item was the primary outcome.The BPI, the Pain Quality Assessment Scale, and EEGs were collected before NFB and again after treatment.Outcomes were assessed with general linear modeling.RESULTS: Cancer survivors with CIPN (average duration of symptoms, 25.3 mo), who were mostly female and had a mean age of 62.5 years, were recruited between April 2011 and September 2014.One hundred percent of the participants starting the NFB program completed it (30 in the NFB group and 32 in the WLC group).The NFB group demonstrated greater improvement than the controls on the BPI worst-pain item (mean change score, -2.43 [95% confidence interval, -3.58 to -1.28] vs 0.09 [95% confidence interval, -0.72 to -0.90]; P =..001; effect size, 0.83).CONCLUSIONS: NFB appears to be effective at reducing CIPN symptoms.There was evidence of neurological changes in

Results from a sequential multiple assignment randomized trial.Optimal sequencing of complementary therapies can help improve symptom management through nonpharmacological approaches.A 12-week sequential multiple assignment randomized trial comparing home-based reflexology and meditative practices on severity of fatigue and other symptoms was conducted among patients with cancer and their informal caregivers.Dyads were initially randomized to reflexology (N = 150), meditative practices (N = 150), or control (N = 47).If patient's fatigue did not improve (nonresponse) after 4 weeks of reflexology or meditative practices, the dyad was rerandomized to either add the other therapy or continue with the original therapy for weeks 5-8.Four decision rules (DRs) were compared: (1) Initiating reflexology, and if nonresponse on fatigue after 4 weeks, continue with reflexology for another 4 weeks, thus providing a higher dose; (2) Initiating reflexology, and if nonresponse on fatigue after 4 weeks, add meditative practices for the next 4 weeks; (3) Initiating meditative practices, and if nonresponse on fatigue after 4 weeks, continue meditative practices for another 4 weeks, thus providing a higher dose; and (4) Initiating meditative practices, and if nonresponse on fatigue after 4 weeks, add reflexology for the next 4 weeks.Symptoms were evaluated weekly using the M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI).Clinically, nurses can recommend either therapy since no differences were found among the 4 DRs, with the exception of lower severity for summed MDASI symptoms

for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: development of a prognostic model through a crowdsourced challenge with open clinical trial data.BACKGROUND: Improvements to prognostic models in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer have the potential to augment clinical trial design and guide treatment strategies.In partnership with Project Data Sphere, a not-for-profit initiative allowing data from cancer clinical trials to be shared broadly with researchers, we designed an open-data, crowdsourced, DREAM (Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessments and Methods) challenge to not only identify a better prognostic model for prediction of survival in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer but also engage a community of international data scientists to study this disease.METHODS: Data from the comparator arms of four phase 3 clinical trials in first-line metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer were obtained from Project Data Sphere, comprising 476 patients treated with docetaxel and prednisone from the ASCENT2 trial, 526 patients treated with docetaxel, prednisone, and placebo in the MAINSAIL trial, 598 patients treated with docetaxel, prednisone or prednisolone, and placebo in the VENICE trial, and 470 patients treated with docetaxel and placebo in the ENTHUSE 33 trial.Datasets consisting of more than 150 clinical variables were curated centrally, including demographics, laboratory values, medical history, lesion sites, and previous treatments.Data from ASCENT2, MAINSAIL, and VENICE were released publicly to be used as training data to predict the outcome of interest-namely, overall survival.Clinical data were also released for ENTHUSE 33, but data for outcome variables (overall survival and event status) were hidden from the challenge participants so that ENTHUSE 33 could be used for independent validation.Methods were evaluated using the integrated time-dependent area under the curve (iAUC).The reference model, based on eight clinical variables and a penalised Cox proportional-hazards model, was used to compare method performance.Further validation was done using data from a fifth trial-ENTHUSE M1-in which 266 patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer were treated with placebo alone.FINDINGS: 50 independent methods were developed to predict overall survival and were evaluated through the DREAM challenge.The top performer was based on an ensemble of penalised Cox regression models (ePCR), which uniquely identified predictive interaction effects with immune biomarkers and markers of hepatic and renal function.Overall, ePCR outperformed all other methods (iAUC 0.791; Bayes factor >5) and surpassed the reference model (iAUC 0.743; Bayes factor >20).Both the ePCR model and reference models stratified patients in the ENTHUSE 33 trial into high-risk and low-risk groups with significantly different overall survival (ePCR: hazard ratio 3.32, 95% CI 2.39-4.62, p<0.0001; reference model: 2.56, 1.85-3.53, p<0.0001).The new model was validated further on the ENTHUSE M1 cohort with similarly high performance (iAUC 0.768).Meta-analysis across all methods confirmed previously identified predictive clinical variables and revealed aspartate aminotransferase as an important, albeit previously under-reported, prognostic biomarker.INTERPRETATION: Novel prognostic factors were delineated, and the assessment of 50 methods developed by independent international teams establishes a benchmark for development of methods in the future.The results of this effort show that data-sharing, when combined with a crowdsourced challenge, is a robust and powerful framework to develop new prognostic models in advanced prostate cancer.FUNDING: Sanofi US Services, Project Data Sphere."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Please ascertain whether the article meets all of the following criteria (criterion by criterion).\n\n#

Model could improve sexual satisfaction for women diagnosed with breast cancer.METHODS: Adult women diagnosed with breast cancer were recruited from a hospital in Qazvin, Iran.Participants were randomly assigned to either an intervention group (n=40) or a control group (n=40).All participants were administered a demographic questionnaire and an Index of Sexual Satisfaction (ISS) pre-intervention, immediately post-intervention, and 1, 2, and 3 months following the intervention.The control group completed the assessments along the same time line as the intervention group.Women in the experimental group were provided three sessions of a psychological individual intervention which included psychoeducation regarding their diagnosis and personalized intervention strategies to improve their overall sexual satisfaction with sexual intercourse.Each intervention took between 60 and 90min to administer.RESULTS: The experimental and control group participants were well balanced in terms of demographic characteristics and sexual satisfaction scores before the intervention.The intervention group showed a positive increasing trend in the sexual satisfaction scores over time while the control group participants had a negative trend (p<0.05).There were also statistical differences in the sexual satisfaction scores at each follow-up month (p<0.05) adjusted for the baseline score and relevant demographical variables, showing longer term effects with a significant increase in sexual satisfaction over time.CONCLUSION: Providing a psychoeducational based intervention

prediction of oral cancer (OC) risk.To identify new targets for prevention, we performed a systematic survey of transcripts associated with an increased risk of oral cancer and overexpressed in OC vs normal mucosa (NM).Methods: We used gene expression profiles of 86 patients with OL and available outcomes from a chemoprevention trial of OC and NM.MET expression was evaluated using immunohistochemistry in 120 OL patients, and its association with OC development was tested in multivariable analysis.Sensitivity to pharmacological Met inhibition was tested invitro in premalignant and OC cell lines (n = 33) and invivo using the 4-NQO model of oral chemoprevention (n = 20 mice per group).All statistical tests were two-sided.Results: The overlap of 693 transcripts associated with an increased risk of OC with 163 transcripts overexpressed in OC compared with NM led to the identification of 23 overlapping transcripts, including MET.MET overexpression in OL was associated with a hazard ratio of 3.84 (95% confidence interval = 1.59 to 9.27, P = .003) of developing OC.Met activation was found in OC and preneoplastic cell lines.Crizotinib activity in preneoplastic and OC cell lines was comparable.ARQ 197 was more active in preneoplastic compared with OC cell lines.In the 4-NQO model, squamous cell carcinoma, dysplasia, and hyperkeratosis were observed in 75.0%, 15.0%, and 10.0% in the control group, and in 25.0%, 70.0%, and 5.0% in the crizotinib group (P < .001).Conclusion: Together, these data suggest that MET activation may represent an early driver in oral

(pancreaticoduodenectomy) with preoperatively-placed intrabiliary stents: protocol for a randomised controlled trial.INTRODUCTION: Among surgical oncology patients, incisional surgical site infection is associated with substantially increased morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs.Moreover, while adults undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy with preoperative placement of an intrabiliary stent have a high risk of this type of infection, and wound protectors may significantly reduce its risk, no relevant studies of wound protectors yet exist involving this patient population.This study will evaluate the efficacy of a dual-ring wound protector for prevention of incisional surgical site infection among adults undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy with preoperatively-placed intrabiliary stents.METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study will be a parallel, dual-arm, randomised controlled trial that will utilise a more explanatory than pragmatic attitude.All adults (>/=18 years) undergoing a pancreaticoduodenectomy at the Foothills Medical Centre in Calgary, Alberta, Canada with preoperative placement of an intrabiliary stent will be considered eligible.Exclusion criteria will include patient age <18 years and those receiving long-term glucocorticoids.The trial will employ block randomisation to allocate patients to a commercial dual-ring wound protector (the Alexis Wound Protector) or no wound protector and the current standard of care.The main outcome measure will be the rate of surgical site infection as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria within 30 days of the index operation date as determined by a research assistant blinded to treatment allocation.Outcomes will be analysed by a statistician blinded to allocation status by calculating risk ratios and 95% CIs and compared using Fisher's exact test.ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This will be the first randomised trial to evaluate the efficacy of a dual-ring wound protector for prevention of incisional surgical site infection among patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy.Results of this study are expected to be available in 2016/2017 and will be disseminated using an integrated and end-of-grant knowledge translation strategy.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01836237."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Please ascertain whether the article

global, double-blind, randomised, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Based on the encouraging activity and manageable safety profile observed in a phase 1 study, the ECHELON-2 trial was initiated to compare the efficacy and safety of brentuximab vedotin, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone (A+CHP) versus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) for the treatment of CD30-positive peripheral T-cell lymphomas.METHODS: ECHELON-2 is a double-blind, double-dummy, randomised, placebo-controlled, active-comparator phase 3 study.Eligible adults from 132 sites in 17 countries with previously untreated CD30-positive peripheral T-cell lymphomas (targeting 75% with systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma) were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive either A+CHP or CHOP for six or eight 21-day cycles.Randomisation was stratified by histological subtype according to local pathology assessment and by international prognostic index score.All patients received cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m(2) and doxorubicin 50 mg/m(2) on day 1 of each cycle intravenously and prednisone 100 mg once daily on days 1 to 5 of each cycle orally, followed by either brentuximab vedotin 1.8 mg/kg and a placebo form of vincristine intravenously (A+CHP group) or vincristine 1.4 mg/m(2) and a placebo form of brentuximab vedotin intravenously (CHOP group) on day 1 of each cycle.The primary endpoint, progression-free survival according to blinded independent central review, was analysed by intent-to-treat.This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01777152.FINDINGS: Between Jan 24, 2013, and Nov 7, 2016, 601 patients assessed for eligibility, of whom 452 patients were enrolled and 226 were randomly assigned to both the A+CHP group and the CHOP group.Median progression-free survival was 48.2 months (95% CI 35.2-not evaluable) in the A+CHP group and 20.8 months (12.7-47.6) in the CHOP group (hazard ratio 0.71 [95% CI 0.54-0.93], p=0.0110).Adverse events, including incidence and severity of febrile neutropenia (41 [18%] patients in the A+CHP group and 33 [15%] in the CHOP group) and peripheral neuropathy (117 [52%] in the A+CHP group and 124 [55%] in the CHOP group), were similar between groups.Fatal adverse events occurred in seven (3%) patients in the A+CHP group and nine (4%) in the CHOP group.INTERPRETATION: Front-line treatment with A+CHP is superior to CHOP for patients with CD30-positive peripheral T-cell lymphomas as shown by a significant improvement in progression-free survival and overall survival with a manageable safety profile.FUNDING: Seattle Genetics Inc, Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc, a wholly owned subsidiary of Takeda Pharmacuetical Company Limited, and National Institutes of Health

an herbal medicine, on chemotherapy-induced nausea, vomiting, and anorexia in uterine cervical or corpus cancer patients treated with cisplatin and paclitaxel: results of a randomized phase II study (JORTC KMP-02).OBJECTIVE: Rikkunshito, an herbal medicine, is widely prescribed in Japan for the treatment of anorexia and functional dyspepsia, and has been reported to recover reductions in food intake caused by cisplatin.We investigated whether rikkunshito could improve chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) and anorexia in patients treated with cisplatin.METHODS: Patients with uterine cervical or corpus cancer who were to receive cisplatin (50 mg/m(2) day 1) and paclitaxel (135 mg/m(2) day 0) as first-line chemotherapy were randomly assigned to the rikkunshito group receiving oral administration on days 0-13 with standard antiemetics, or the control group receiving antiemetics only.The primary endpoint was the rate of complete control (CC: no emesis, no rescue medication, and no significant nausea) in the overall phase (0-120 hours).Two-tailed p<0.20 was considered significant in the planned analysis.RESULTS: The CC rate in the overall phase was significantly higher in the rikkunshito group than in the control group (57.9% vs. 35.3%, p=0.175), as were the secondary endpoints: the CC rate in the delayed phase (24-120 hours), and the complete response (CR) rates (no emesis and no rescue medication) in the overall and delayed phases (63.2% vs. 35.3%, p=0.095; 84.2% vs. 52.9%, p=0.042; 84.2% vs. 52.9%, p=0.042, respectively), and time to treatment failure (p=0.059).Appetite assessed by visual analogue scale (VAS) appeared to be superior in the rikkunshito group from day 2 through day 6.CONCLUSION: Rikkunshito provided additive effect

randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the effects of soy isoflavones on breast tissue in postmenopausal women.METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 80 women (aged >/= 45 y and with amenorrhea >12 mo) with vasomotor symptoms were randomized to receive either 250 mg of standardized soy extract corresponding to isoflavone 100 mg/day (n = 40) or placebo (n = 40) for 10 months.Breasts were evaluated through mammographic density and breast parenchyma using ultrasound (US) at baseline and 10-month follow-up.Independent t test, analysis of variance, Mann-Whitney U test, and chi2 trend test were used in statistical analysis.RESULTS: Baseline clinical characteristics showed no significant differences between the isoflavone group and the placebo group, with mean (SD) age of 55.1 (6.0) and 56.2 (7.7) years, mean (SD) menopause duration of 6.6 (4.8) and 7.1 (4.2) years, and mean (SD) body mass index of 29.7 (5.0) and 28.5 (4.9) kg/m2, respectively (P > 0.05).The study was completed by 32 women on isoflavone and 34 women on placebo.The groups did not differ in mammographic density or breast parenchyma by US (P > 0.05).Within each group, the baseline and final moments did not differ in mammography or US parameters significantly (P > 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: The use of soy isoflavone

Adenoma Detection on Sessile Serrated Adenoma/Polyp Detection.BACKGROUND: Sessile serrated adenomas/polyps (SSA/P) are an under-recognized disease with a unique malignant pathway.Improved endoscopic recognition and pathological interpretation is needed.AIMS: To determine whether an educational intervention that improved adenoma detection rate (ADR) could improve SSA/P detection rate after reclassification of previously termed \"hyperplastic\" polyps.METHODS: We reanalyzed data from a prospective randomized trial of an educational intervention aimed at increasing ADR.All hyperplastic polyps >/=6 mm reported in a previously published study were rereviewed and reclassified using standardized criteria for serrated lesions.Detection rates of sessile serrated adenomas/polyps and other clinically relevant serrated polyps were calculated in the baseline and post-training phases of the original study.RESULTS: Of 263 available for rereview, 33 (12.5%) were reclassified as SSA/P (N = 32) or traditional serrated adenoma (TSA) (N = 1).Reclassification was more common in the right colon (18 vs. 8%, p = 0.02).Baseline SSA/P detection rate was 0.7% in the untrained group and 1.3% in the trained group.Post-training, the SSA/P detection rate increased to 2.1 and 1.5%, respectively.The clinically relevant serrated polyp detection rate at baseline was 14.2% in the untrained group and 11.3% in the trained group.After the educational intervention, the clinically relevant serrated polyp detection rates increased to 16.5 and 14.8% in the untrained and trained groups, respectively.The estimated odds of an endoscopist detecting either a SSA/P or other clinically relevant serrated polyp during colonoscopy increased by only 3% with the educational intervention (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.61-1.74, p = 0.91).CONCLUSIONS: Pathological re-interpretation of larger serrated polyps resulted in the reclassification of 12.5% of lesions.Quality improvement methods focused on adenoma detection did not impact SSA/P detection, and thus specific methods for serrated polyp detection are needed."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Please ascertain whether the article meets all of the following

Effective Dose as a Better Predictor of Radiation Pneumonitis Risk Than Mean Lung Dose: Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Trial.PURPOSE: To confirm the superiority of effective dose (Deff) over mean lung dose (MLD) for predicting risk of radiation pneumonitis (RP), using data from patients on a randomized trial of intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) versus passively scattered proton therapy (PSPT).METHODS AND MATERIALS: The prescribed target dose for the 203 evaluated patients was 66 to 74 Gy (relative biological effectiveness) in 33 to 37 fractions with concurrent carboplatin/paclitaxel.Time to grade >/=2 RP was computed from the start of radiation therapy, with disease recurrence or death considered censoring events.Generalized Lyman models of censored time to RP were constructed with MLD or Deff as the dosimetric parameter.Smoking status (current, former, never) was also analyzed.RESULTS: Of the 203 patients, 46 experienced grade >/=2 RP (crude incidence 23%) at a median 3.7 months (range, 0.6-12.6 months).The volume parameter estimated for the Deff model was n = 0.5, confirming estimates from earlier studies.Compared with MLD (in which n = 1), the dosimetric parameter Deff, computed using n = 0.5, resulted in a better fit of the Lyman model to the clinical data (P = .010).Using Deff, the model describes RP risk for IMRT and PSPT data combined because no further improvement was found from separate fits (P = .558).Based on Deff, predicted RP risk per patient ranged from 24 percentage points lower to 19 percentage points higher than predictions based on MLD.For patients with similar MLD, Deff predicted higher risk, on average, for PSPT over IMRT.Current smokers had a lower risk of RP compared with former smokers and nonsmokers (P = .021).CONCLUSIONS: We used data from a randomized trial to validate our previous finding that Deff with n = 0.5 (corresponding to root mean squared dose) is a better predictor of RP than is MLD.Differences between Deff and MLD indicate that delivering higher doses to smaller lung volumes (vs lower doses to larger volumes) increases RP risk.We further corroborated that current smoking is associated with decreased RP risk."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Please ascertain whether the article meets all of the following criteria (criterion by criterion).\n\n# Criteria\n- format: The

10% (2/21) of participants were Hispanic or Latina.All participants reported using RealRisks after being granted access to the DA.In total, 4 overarching themes emerged from the qualitative analyses: the acceptability of the intervention, specifically endorsed elements of the DA, recommendations for improvements, and information needs.All women found RealRisks to be acceptable and considered it to be helpful (21/21, 100%).Most women (13/21, 62%) reported that RealRisks was easy to navigate, user-friendly, and easily accessible on the web.The majority of women (18/21, 86%) felt that RealRisks improved their knowledge about breast cancer risk and chemoprevention options and that RealRisks informed their (17/21, 81%) decision about whether or not to take chemoprevention.Some women (9/21, 43%) shared recommendations for improvements, as they wanted more tailoring based on user characteristics, felt that the DA was targeting a narrow population of Hispanic or Latina by using graphic novel-style narratives, wanted more understandable terminology, and felt that the tool placed a strong emphasis on chemoprevention drugs.CONCLUSIONS: This qualitative study demonstrated the acceptability of the RealRisks web-based DA among a diverse group of high-risk women, who provided some recommendations for improvement."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Please ascertain whether the article meets all of the following criteria (criterion by criterion).\n\n# Criteria\n- format: The article must provide a detailed description of the RCT design, including randomization methods, control group setup, etc.\n- population: The article must clearly state that the study subjects are patients diagnosed with cancer.\n- purpose: The article must show the results of cancer treatment evaluation, such as progression-free survival, overall survival, response rates, etc. Note: Articles with poor results also meet the criteria.\n- biomarker: The article must clearly mention that the study involves treatment strategies related to the patient's genetic and molecular characteristics, such as CD30-positive, hormone receptor-positive, HR+, HER2-, etc.\n\n# Response\nProvide your response in JSON format, as follows:\n{\"justification\": \"Provide a brief analysis if the article meets each criterion.\", \"whether_meet_all_criteria\": \"Yes/No\"}\n\n# Options\n- Yes\n- No\n\nANSWER:\n"}]}], [{"response": "```json\n{\n  \"justification\": \"The article does not meet all the criteria.

was examined among high-risk participants in the UK Lung Cancer Screening (UKLS) Pilot Trial of low-dose CT screening.METHODS: High-risk individuals aged 50-75 years who completed baseline questionnaires were randomised to CT screening (intervention) or usual care (no screening control).Smoking habit was determined at baseline using self-report.Smokers were asked whether they had quit smoking since joining UKLS at T1 (2 weeks after baseline scan results or control assignment) and T2 (up to 2 years after recruitment).Intention-to-treat (ITT) regression analyses were undertaken, adjusting for baseline lung cancer distress, trial site and sociodemographic variables.RESULTS: Of a total 4055 individuals randomised to CT screening or control, 1546 were baseline smokers (759 intervention, 787 control).Smoking cessation rates were 8% (control n=36/479) versus 14% (intervention n=75/527) at T1 and 21% (control n=79/377) versus 24% (intervention n=115/488) at T2.ITT analyses indicated that the odds of quitting among screened participants were significantly higher at T1 (adjusted OR (aOR) 2.38, 95% CI 1.56 to 3.64, p<0.001) and T2 (aOR 1.60, 95% CI 1.17 to 2.18, p=0.003) compared with control.Intervention participants who needed additional clinical investigation were more likely to quit in the longer term compared with the control group (aOR 2.29, 95% CI 1.62 to 3.22, p=0.007) and those receiving a negative result (aOR 2.43, 95% CI 1.54 to 3.84, p<0.001).CONCLUSIONS: CT lung cancer screening for high-risk participants presents a teachable moment for smoking cessation, especially among those who receive a positive scan result.Further behavioural research is needed to evaluate optimal strategies for integrating smoking cessation intervention with

cancer-related pain and fatigue on health-related quality of life in patients with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer receiving apalutamide (240 mg/day) or placebo, with continuous androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), in the phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled TITAN trial (NCT02489318).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patient-reported outcomes for pain and fatigue were evaluated using the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form and Brief Fatigue Inventory.Time to deterioration (TTD) was estimated by Kaplan-Meier method; hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using Cox proportional hazards model.General estimating equations for logistic regression estimated treatment-related differences in the likelihood of worsening pain or fatigue.RESULTS: Compliance for completing the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form and Brief Fatigue Inventory was high (96% to 97%) in the first year.Median followup times were similar between treatments (19 to 22 months).Median pain TTD was longer with apalutamide than placebo for \"pain at its least in the last 24 hours\" (28.7 vs 21.8 months, respectively; p=0.0146), \"pain interfered with mood\" (not

52.9 +/- 6.5% respectively.Poor prognostic factors included age </=90 days at diagnosis, MLL-R ALL and white cell count >/=50,000/mul.For infants </=90 days of age, the 5-year EFS was 15.5 +/- 10.1% and 48.5 +/- 6.7% for those >90 days (P < 0.0001).Among infants >90 days of age, 5-year EFS rates were 43.8 +/- 8% for MLL-R versus 69.1 +/- 13.6% for MLL-germline ALL (P < 0.0001).CONCLUSIONS: Age

MONALEESA-3 Phase III trial of patients with hormone receptor-positive human epidermal growth factor receptor-negative advanced breast cancer, ribociclib plus fulvestrant significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).Here, we present patient-reported outcomes from the trial, including health-related quality of life (HRQOL).METHODS: Patients were randomized (2:1) to receive ribociclib plus fulvestrant or placebo plus fulvestrant.Time to definitive 10% deterioration (TTD) from baseline in HRQOL (global health status [GHS] from the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire) and pain (BPI-SF questionnaire) were assessed using Kaplan-Meier estimates; a stratified Cox regression model was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% CIs.RESULTS: Deterioration >/=10% in the EORTC-QLQ-C30 GHS was observed in 33% of patients in the ribociclib group vs 34% of patients in the placebo (reference) group (HR for TTD >/= 10% = 0.81 [95% CI, 0.62-1.1]).Similar findings were noted for TTD >/=5% (HR = 0.79 [95% CI, 0.61-1.0]) and TTD >/=15% (HR = 0.81 [95% CI, 0.60-1.08]).TTD >/=10% in emotional functioning (HR = 0.76 [95% CI, 0.57-1.01]) trended in favor of the ribociclib group, whereas results for fatigue and pain were similar between arms.TTD >/=10% in BPI-SF pain severity index score (HR = 0.77 [95% CI, 0.57-1.05]) and worst pain item score (HR = 0.81 [95% CI, 0.58-1.12]) trended in favor of ribociclib vs placebo.CONCLUSIONS: In addition to significantly prolonging PFS and OS compared with placebo plus fulvestrant, adding

Study.BACKGROUND: In Japan, the rate of cervical cancer screening is remarkably low, especially among women in their twenties and thirties, when cervical cancer is now increasing dramatically.The aim of this study was to test whether a modified government reminder for 20-year-old women to engage in cervical cancer screening, acting through maternal education and by asking for a maternal recommendation to the daughter to receive the screening, could increase their participation rate.METHODS: In two Japanese cities, 20-year-old girls who had not received their first cervical cancer screening before October of fiscal year 2014 were randomized into two study arms.One group of 1,274 received only a personalized daughter-directed reminder leaflet for cervical cancer screening.In the second group of 1,274, the daughters and their mothers received a combination package containing the same reminder leaflet as did the first group, plus an additional informational leaflet for the mother, which requested that the mother recommend that her daughter undergo cervical cancer screening.The subsequent post-reminder screening rates of these two study arms were compared.RESULTS: The cervical cancer screening rate of 20-year-old women whose mothers received the information leaflet was significantly higher than that for women who received only a leaflet for themselves (11% vs 9%, P = 0.0049).CONCLUSIONS: An intervention with mothers, by sending them a cervical cancer information leaflet with a request that they recommend that their daughter receive cervical cancer screening,

Group V patients (50) with melanoma underwent a single-stage surgery--radical excision of the tumour with sentinel lymph node biopsy (study group \"V\").Group D patients (50) with melanoma underwent two-stage surgery; initially primary diagnostic excision of the tumour (0.5 cm from margins of the lesion) followed by a radical re-excision of the post-operative scar and sentinel lymph node biopsy (study group \"D\").RESULTS: Study groups \"V\" and \"D\" were tested for homogeneity with regard to age, melanoma thickness, location of melanoma, type of melanoma, and ulceration.The groups were found to be homogenous.The average number of removed sentinel lymph nodes in group \"D\" was 1.0 more than in group \"V\" (p < 0.05).The averages were 3.7 and 2.7 respectively with a SD of 1.8.The relationship between the SL node staining and type of surgery was (p < 0.05).49.6% stained radioactive sentinel lymphnodes at the time of surgery was found in group \"V\", while 33.9% in group \"D\".CONCLUSIONS: Using two different early-stage cutaneous melanoma management techniques significantly more sentinel lymph nodes (p = 0.006) were detected using the two-stage surgery approach.However, there was no significant difference between the two approaches regarding the number of sentinel lymph nodes with micrometastases that were detected and excised."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Please ascertain whether the article meets all of the following criteria (criterion by criterion).\n\n# Criteria\n- format: The article must provide a detailed description of the RCT design, including randomization methods, control group setup, etc.\n- population: The article must clearly state that the study subjects are patients diagnosed with cancer.\n- purpose: The article must show the results of cancer treatment evaluation, such as progression-free survival, overall survival, response rates, etc. Note: Articles with poor results also meet the criteria.\n- biomarker: The article must clearly mention that the study involves treatment strategies related to the patient's genetic and molecular characteristics, such as CD30-positive, hormone receptor-positive, HR+, HER2-, etc.\n\n# Response\nProvide your response in JSON format, as follows:\n{\"justification\": \"Provide a brief analysis if the article meets each criterion.\", \"whether_meet_all_criteria\": \"Yes/No\"}\n\n# Options\n- Yes\n- No\n\nANSWER:\n"}]}], [{"response": "```\n{\n  \"justification\": \"The article does not meet all the criteria.

Prostate Cancer Patients.Background: Recently, the application of smartphone in medical field has received great attention.Introduction: The objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of smartphone-based and conventional pedometer-based exercise monitoring systems in promoting home exercise among prostate cancer patients.Methods: Prostate cancer patients who have undergone surgery or androgen deprivation therapy were recruited.All participants were provided with physical activity goals based on their activities and were advised to achieve these goals during their home exercise period.The intervention group was instructed to use smartphone application to record their activities; they also received weekly remote consultations based on the activity record from the application, without visiting a clinic.The control group was instructed to keep a written record of their daily activities based on pedometer readings; these records were checked by clinicians during follow-up visits.The uptake, adherence, and completion rates of two groups were compared by intention-to-treat analysis.Changes in physical function during the exercise period were analyzed.Results: In total, 100 patients were recruited (smartphone: 5 and pedometer: 50).No significant differences were detected between groups in rates of uptake (80.0% vs. 88.0%, p = 0.28), adherence (92.5% vs. 79.5%, p = 0.12), or completion (76.0% vs. 86.0%, p = 0.20).Physical functions were significantly improved in both groups.Conclusions: The smartphone-based exercise monitoring system and the pedometer yielded

to randomize 340 cancer patients (stomach, colonic/rectal cancer, gynecological cancer, melanoma) at five centers to an intervention group (care by patient navigators based on standardized operating procedures) or a control group in a one-to-one ratio.The primary target parameter is the number of hospitalizations within the 12-month intervention period.The participants are asked to complete various questionnaires on patient-related outcomes at baseline and at 3 and 12 months (SF 36, HADS, PAM 13, and others).Data on drug therapy, utilization of health services, and medical expenses will

Compared With Embolization With Microspheres Alone.PURPOSE: Transarterial chemoembolization is accepted therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).No randomized trial has demonstrated superiority of chemoembolization compared with embolization, and the role of chemotherapy remains unclear.This randomized trial compares the outcome of embolization using microspheres alone with chemoembolization using doxorubicin-eluting microspheres.MATERIALS AND METHODS: At a single tertiary referral center, patients with HCC were randomly assigned to embolization with microspheres alone (Bead Block [BB]) or loaded with doxorubicin 150 mg (LC Bead [LCB]).Random assignment was stratified by number of embolizations to complete treatment, and assignments were generated by permuted blocks in the institutional database.The primary end point was response according to RECIST 1.0 (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) using multiphase computed tomography 2 to 3 weeks post-treatment and then at quarterly intervals, with the reviewer blinded to treatment allocation.Secondary objectives included safety and tolerability, time to progression, progression-free survival, and overall survival.This trial is currently closed to accrual.RESULTS: Between December 2007 and April 2012, 101 patients were randomly assigned: 51 to BB and 50 to LCB.Demographics were comparable: median age, 67 years; 77% male; and 22% Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage A and 78% stage B or C. Adverse events occurred with similar frequency in both groups: BB, 19 of 51 patients (38%); LCB, 20 of 50 patients (40%; P = .48), with no difference in RECIST response: BB, 5.9% versus LCB, 6.0% (difference, -0.1%; 95% CI, -9% to 9%).Median PFS was 6.2 versus 2.8 months (hazard ratio, 1.36; 95% CI, 0.91 to 2.05; P = .11), and overall survival, 19.6 versus 20.8 months (hazard ratio, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.71 to 1.76; P = .64) for BB and LCB, respectively.CONCLUSION: There was no apparent difference between the treatment arms.These results challenge the use of doxorubicin-eluting beads for

Risk Breast Cancer in the EORTC 10041/BIG 3-04 MINDACT Phase III Trial.PURPOSE: MINDACT demonstrated that 46% of patients with early breast cancer at high clinical but low genomic risk on the basis of MammaPrint may safely avoid adjuvant chemotherapy.A second random assignment (R-C) compared docetaxel-capecitabine with an anthracycline-based regimen.PATIENTS AND METHODS: R-C randomly assigned patients 1:1 between standard anthracycline-based regimens, with or without taxanes (control) and experimental docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) intravenously plus oral capecitabine 825 mg/m(2) two times per day for 14 days (DC) every 3 weeks for 6 cycles.The primary end point was disease-free survival (DFS).Secondary end points included overall survival and safety.RESULTS: Of 2,832 patients, 1,301 (45%) were randomly assigned, and 97% complied with R-C assignment.In the control arm, 29.6% only received taxanes (0.5% of N0 patients).DFS events (n = 148) were much less than required (n = 422) as a result of a lower-than-expected accrual and event rate.At 5 years of median follow-up, DFS was not different between DC (n = 652) and control (n = 649; 90.7% [95% CI, 88% to 92.8%] v 88.8% [95% CI, 85.9% to

[95% CI, 0.58 to 1.21]) were similar in both arms.DC led to more grade 1 neuropathy (27.1% v 11.2%) and more grade 2 hand/foot syndrome (28.5% v 3.3%) and diarrhea (13.7% v 5.8%).Serious cardiac events occurred in 9 patients (control, n = 4; DC, n = 5).Fifty-three patients developed second cancers (control, n = 32; DC, n = 21; leukemia: 2 v 1).Five treatment-related deaths occurred (control,

controversial because of uncertainty about its benefits and risks.The aim of this survey was to reveal preferences of men concerning prostate cancer screening and to test the effect of an informative video on these preferences.METHODS: A stated preferences questionnaire was sent by e-mail to men aged 50-75 with no history of prostate cancer.Half of them were randomly assigned to view an informative video.A discrete choice model was established to reveal men's preferences for six prostate cancer screening characteristics: mortality by prostate cancer, number of false positive and false negative results, number of overdiagnosis, out-of-pocket costs and recommended frequency.RESULTS: A population-based sample composed by 1024 men filled in the entire questionnaire.Each attribute gave the expected sign except for overdiagnosis.The video seemed to increase the intention to abstain from prostate cancer screening.CONCLUSIONS: The participants attached greater importance to a decrease in the number of false negatives and a reduction in prostate cancer mortality than to other risks such as the number of false positives and overdiagnosis.Further research is needed to help

FOLFIRI Alone as Second-line Treatment for Metastatic Colorectal Cancer.PURPOSE: We evaluated the influence of RAS mutation status on the treatment effect of panitumumab in a prospective-retrospective analysis of a randomized, multicenter phase III study of panitumumab plus fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) versus FOLFIRI alone as second-line therapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC; ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT0039183).EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Outcomes were from the study's primary analysis.RAS mutations beyond KRAS exon 2 (KRAS exons 3, 4; NRAS exons 2, 3, 4; BRAF exon 15) were detected by bidirectional Sanger sequencing in wild-type KRAS exon 2 tumor specimens.Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were coprimary endpoints.RESULTS: The RAS ascertainment rate was 85%; 18% of wild-type KRAS exon 2 tumors harbored other RAS mutations.For PFS and OS, the hazard ratio (HR) for panitumumab plus FOLFIRI versus FOLFIRI alone more strongly favored panitumumab in the wild-type RAS population than in the wild-type KRAS exon 2 population [PFS HR, 0.70 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.54-0.91); P = 0.007 vs. 0.73 (95% CI, 0.59-0.90); P = 0.004; OS HR, 0.81 (95% CI, 0.63-1.03); P = 0.08 vs. 0.85 (95% CI, 0.70-1.04); P = 0.12].Patients with RAS mutations were unlikely to benefit from panitumumab.Among RAS wild-type patients, the objective response rate was 41% in the panitumumab-FOLFIRI group versus 10% in the FOLFIRI group.CONCLUSIONS: Patients with RAS mutations were unlikely to benefit from panitumumab-FOLFIRI and the benefit-risk of panitumumab-FOLFIRI was improved in the wild-type RAS population compared with the wild-type KRAS exon 2 population.These findings support RAS testing for patients with mCRC.Clin

Patients with Malignant Ascites Secondary to Unresectable Gastric Cancer.BACKGROUND: To compare the efficacy of three chemotherapeutic combinations for laparoscopic hyperthermic intraperitoneal perfusion chemotherapy (HIPPC) in the treatment of malignant ascites secondary to unresectable gastric cancer (GC).MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 2010 to December 2013, 38 GC patients were randomly divided into three groups and treated by laparoscopic HIPPC with one of the three following chemotherapy combinations: raltitrexed (Ra) with oxaliplatin [trans-(+/-)-diaminocyclohexane oxalatoplatinum (l-OHP)], Ra with cisplatin (DDP), and Ra with mitomycin C (MMC).Perioperative complications, patients' quality of life, and survival were recorded and compared among the three groups.RESULTS: The intraoperative course was successful in all patients, and no perioperative death or complication related to laparoscopic HIPPC was documented.The median follow-up period was 9 months, and the median survival was 7.5 months for all patients.Patients in the Ra/l-OHP group had a median survival of 8.7 months, the Ra/DDP group had a median survival of 5.6 months, and the Ra/MMC group had a median survival of 7.5 months.Patients' median survival in the Ra/l-OHP group and Ra/MMC group was significantly longer than in the Ra/DDP group (P < .05).No significant difference was found in total remission rate of ascites, increase in the Karnofsky Performance Scale, and incidence rate of port-site metastases among the three groups.CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopy-assisted HIPPC provides modest yet encouraging efficacy for malignant ascites secondary to disseminated GC.Our preliminary data indicate that the chemotherapeutic combination of Ra/l-OHP and Ra/MMC might be more beneficial compared with Ra/DDP in terms of patients' survival."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Please ascertain whether the article meets all of the following criteria (criterion by criterion).\n\n#

wide panel of physicochemical studies as well as preclinical studies in vitro and in vivo.International multicenter phase III clinical trial was conducted to comparatively assess efficacy and safety of BCD-022 and reference trastuzumab in combination with paclitaxel used as the therapy of metastatic HER2(+) breast cancer.Pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity were also studied.METHODS: Patients with no previous treatment for metastatic HER2(+) breast cancer were randomly assigned 1:1 to BCD-022 or reference trastuzumab and were treated with trastuzumab + paclitaxel.Therapy continued for 6 cycles of therapy (every 3 weeks), until progression of the disease or unbearable toxicity.Primary study endpoint was overall response rate.Study goal was to prove equivalent efficacy of BCD-022 and reference trastuzumab.Equivalence margins for 95% CI for difference in overall response rates were set at [- 20%; 20%].RESULTS: In total 225 patients were enrolled into the study, 115 in BCD-022 arm and 110 in reference trastuzumab arm.Overall response rate was 49.6% in BCD-022 arm and 43.6% in reference trastuzumab arm.Limits of 95% CI for difference of overall response rates between arms were [(- 8.05)-19.89%], thus, they lied within predetermined equivalence margins [- 20%; 20%].Profile of adverse events was similar between groups (any AEs were reported in 93.81% of patients in BCD-022 arm and 94.55% of patients in reference arm).No unexpected adverse reactions were reported throughout the study.No statistically significant differences regarding antibody occurrence rate (either BAb or NAb) was found between BCD-022 (n = 3; 2.65%) and comparator (n = 4; 3.64%).Both drug products are characterized with low occurrence rate and short life of anti-trastuzumab antibodies.Pharmacokinetics assessment after 1st and 6th study drug injection also demonstrated equivalent PK parameters by all outcome measures: AUC0-504, capital ES, Cyrillicmsmall a, Cyrillicsmall ha, Cyrillic, capital TE, Cyrillicmax, T1/2.Analysis of Ctrough did not reveal any significant inter-group differences as well.CONCLUSIONS: Thus, results of this study have demonstrated therapeutic

epidemiological studies have examined the association between use of dairy products and risk of ovarian cancer, but results are conflicting.Using data from a large Danish population-based case-control study we here further examined the association between dairy consumption, lactose, and calcium and risk of overall ovarian cancer and histological types of ovarian cancer.MATERIAL AND METHODS: In the period 1995-1999 we included 554 women with epithelial ovarian cancer and 1554 randomly selected age-matched controls (35-79 years).All women participated in a detailed personal interview that included questions about dairy consumption.Data were analysed using multiple logistic regression models.RESULTS: Total dairy intake was associated with ovarian cancer risk (OR = 1.11; 95% CI: 1.07-1.15 per 100 ml/day).The association was strongest for milk [OR = 1.14; 95% CI: 1.03-1.27 per glass (200 ml)/day], soured milk products [OR = 1.49; 95% CI: 1.22-1.81 per portion (250 ml)/day] and yoghurt [OR = 1.65; 95% CI: 1.22-2.23 per portion (250 ml)/day].In contrast, intake of cheese was associated with a decreased risk [OR = 0.70; 95% CI: 0.55-0.89 for > 1 portion (100 ml)/day compared with no intake].Intake of lactose, but not calcium, was also associated with an increased ovarian cancer risk (OR = 1.24; 95% CI: 1.10-1.40 per 10 g of lactose/day).Similar risk patterns were observed for the different histological types of ovarian cancer, indicating virtually identical aetiologies with regard to dairy intake, lactose, and calcium.CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that intake of dairy products is associated with a modest increased risk of ovarian cancer.In addition, ovarian cancer development was associated with lactose intake."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Please ascertain

paclitaxel plus carboplatin plus veliparib placebo (twice a day); or paclitaxel plus carboplatin placebo (every 3 weeks for four cycles) plus veliparib placebo.Following segment 1, all patients were assigned to segment 2 in which they received doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide every 2-3 weeks for four cycles.Randomisation for segment 1 was stratified by germline BRCA mutation status, nodal stage, and planned schedule of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide administration.The primary endpoint was pathological complete response in breast and lymph nodes as determined by site pathologists following completion of neoadjuvant therapy.Efficacy analyses were done by intention to treat and safety analyses included all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment.These are the first results of an ongoing clinical trial; the data cutoff for the analyses presented was Dec 8, 2016.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02032277.FINDINGS: Between April 4, 2014, and March 18, 2016, 634 patients were randomly assigned: 316 to paclitaxel plus carboplatin plus veliparib, 160 to paclitaxel plus carboplatin, and 158 to paclitaxel alone.The proportion of patients who achieved a pathological complete response was higher in the paclitaxel, carboplatin, and veliparib group than in patients receiving paclitaxel alone (168 [53%] of 316 patients vs 49 [31%] of 158, p<0.0001), but not compared with patients receiving paclitaxel plus carboplatin (92 [58%] of 160 patients, p=0.36).Grade 3 or 4 toxicities, and serious adverse events were more common in patients receiving carboplatin, whereas veliparib did not substantially increase toxicity.The most common grade 3 or 4 events overall were neutropenia (352 [56%] of 628 patients), anaemia (180 [29%]), and thrombocytopenia (75 [12%]) through complete treatment, and febrile neutropenia (88 [15%] of 601 patients) during segment 2.The most common serious adverse events were febrile neutropenia (80 [13%] of 628 patients) and anaemia (20 [3%]).INTERPRETATION: Although the addition of veliparib and carboplatin to paclitaxel followed by doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide improved the proportion of patients with triple-negative breast cancer who achieved a pathological complete response, the addition of veliparib to carboplatin and paclitaxel did not.Increased toxicities with the addition of carboplatin (with or without veliparib) to paclitaxel were manageable and did not substantially affect treatment delivery of paclitaxel followed by doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide.Given the consistent results with previous studies, the addition of carboplatin appears to have a favourable risk to benefit profile and might be considered as a potential component of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for patients with high-risk, triple-negative breast cancer.FUNDING: AbbVie."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Please ascertain whether the article meets all of the following criteria (criterion by criterion).\n\n# Criteria\n- format: The article must provide a detailed description of the RCT design, including randomization methods, control group setup, etc.\n- population: The article must clearly state that the study subjects are patients diagnosed with cancer.\n- purpose: The article must show the results of cancer treatment evaluation, such as progression-free survival, overall survival, response rates, etc. Note: Articles with poor results also meet the criteria.\n- biomarker: The article must clearly mention that the study involves treatment strategies related to the patient's genetic and molecular characteristics, such as CD30-positive, hormone receptor-positive, HR+, HER2-, etc.\n\n# Response\nProvide your response in JSON format, as follows:\n{\"justification\": \"Provide a brief analysis if the article meets each criterion.\", \"whether_meet_all_criteria\": \"Yes/No\"}\n\n# Options\n- Yes\n- No\n\nANSWER:\n"}]}], [{"response": "```json\n{\n  \"justification\": {\n    \"format\": \"The article provides a detailed description of the RCT design, including randomization methods and control group setup.\",\n    \"population\": \"The article clearly states that the study subjects are patients diagnosed with cancer.\",\n    \"purpose\": \"The article shows the results of cancer treatment evaluation related to spiritual well-being, but does not mention traditional cancer treatment evaluation such as progression-free survival, overall survival, etc.\",\n    \"biomarker\": \"The article does not mention any specific treatment strategies related to the patient's genetic and molecular characteristics.\"\n  },\n  \"whether_meet_all_criteria\": \"No\"\n}\n```", "message": [{"role": "system", "content": "As an expert annotator with a focus on scientific article content analysis, your role involves ascertaining whether the article meets the set criteria.\n\n# Article\nA randomized, blinded study of the impact of intercessory prayer on spiritual well-being in patients with cancer.CONTEXT: Cochrane reviews have analyzed multiple studies on intercessory prayer that treatment teams had added to health interventions; however, the reviewers could draw no conclusions about the efficacy of prayer because the studies showed either positive or no effects and used different endpoints and methodologies.OBJECTIVE: The study intended to determine whether researchers could measure the impact of intercessory prayer on spiritual well-being.DESIGN: The research team conducted a randomized blinded trial of intercessory prayer added to normal cancer treatment with participants agreeing to complete quality of life (QOL) and spiritual well-being scales at baseline and 6 months later.The research team had shown previously that spiritual well-being is an important, unique domain in the assessment of QOL.Participants remained blinded to the randomization.Based on a previous study, the research team determined that the study required a sample of 1000 participants to detect small differences (P = .05, 2-tailed, 80% power).SETTING The research team performed this research at the Royal Adelaide Hospital Cancer Centre, South Australia, Australia.PARTICIPANTS: Participants were patients at the cancer center between June 2003 and May 2008.Of 999 participants with mixed diagnoses who completed the baseline questionnaires, 66.6% provided follow-up.The average age was 61 years, and most participants were married/de facto (living with partners), were Australians or New Zealanders living in Australia, and were Christian.Intervention The research team asked an external group offering Christian intercessory prayer to add the study's participants to their usual prayer lists.They received details about the participants, but this information was not sufficient to identify them.Outcome Measures The research team used the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Spiritual Well-being questionnaire to assess spiritual wellbeing and QOL.Results The intervention group showed significantly greater improvements over time for the primary endpoint of spiritual well-being as compared to the control group (P = .03, partial eta2 = .01).The study found a similar result for emotional well-being (P = .04, partial eta2 = .01) and functional well-being (P = .06, partial eta2 = .01).CONCLUSIONS: Participants with cancer whom the research team randomly allocated to the experimental group to receive remote intercessory prayer showed small but significant improvements in spiritual well-being."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Please ascertain whether the article meets all of the following criteria (criterion by criterion).\n\n# Criteria\n- format: The article must provide a detailed description of the RCT design, including randomization methods, control group setup, etc.\n- population: The article must clearly state that the study subjects are patients diagnosed with cancer.\n- purpose: The article must show the results of cancer treatment evaluation, such as progression-free survival, overall survival, response rates, etc. Note: Articles with poor results also meet the criteria.\n- biomarker: The article must clearly mention that the study involves treatment strategies related to the patient's genetic and molecular characteristics, such as CD30-positive, hormone receptor-positive, HR+, HER2-, etc.\n\n# Response\nProvide your response in JSON format, as follows:\n{\"justification\": \"Provide a brief analysis if the article meets each criterion.\", \"whether_meet_all_criteria\": \"Yes/No\"}\n\n# Options\n- Yes\n- No\n\nANSWER:\n"}]}], [{"response": "```json\n{\n  \"justification\": \"The article does not meet all the specified criteria.\",\n  \"whether_meet_all_criteria\": \"No\"\n}\n```", "message": [{"role": "system", "content": "As an expert annotator with a focus on scientific article content analysis, your role involves ascertaining whether the article meets the set criteria.\n\n# Article\nDermoscopy-guided Mohs micrographic surgery in post-laser basal cell carcinomas: is dermoscopy helpful for demarcation of the surgical margin?BACKGROUND: Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) in cases where the tumor margin is poorly defined to the naked eye can lead to the need to take an increased number of Mohs stages.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the usefulness of dermoscopy in determining MMS surgical margins of BCCs with a history of ablative laser treatment.METHODS: Patients were randomly allocated to naked eye (n = 69) or dermoscopy (n = 64) groups by the surgical margin detection method.Surgical outcomes of 133 post-laser BCC patients treated with MMS were analyzed.RESULTS: The lateral margin involvement rate at the first MMS stage was significantly lower in the dermoscopy group than in the naked eye group (4.7% vs. 29.0%;

comparing neoadjuvant chemotherapy with two and four courses of cisplatin/S-1 and docetaxel/cisplatin/S-1 as neoadjuvant chemotherapy for locally advanced gastric cancer.BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is a promising method of improving the survival of resectable gastric cancer.Cisplatin/S-1 (CS) and docetaxel/cisplatin/S-1 (DCS) are both effective against metastatic gastric cancer.This report clarified the impact of these regimens on early endpoints, including the pathological responses, chemotherapy-related toxicities, and surgical results.METHODS: Patients with M0 and either T4 or T3 in case of junctional cancer or scirrhous type received two or four courses of cisplatin (60 mg/m2 at day 8)/S-1 (80 mg/m2 for 21 days with 1 week rest) or docetaxel (40 mg/m2 at day 1)/cisplatin (60 mg/m2 at day 1)/S-1 (80 mg/m2 for 14 days with 2 weeks rest) as NAC.Patients then underwent D2 gastrectomy and adjuvant S-1 chemotherapy for 1 year.The primary endpoint was the 3-year overall survival.RESULTS: Between October 2011 and September 2014, 132 patients were assigned to receive CS (n = 66; 33 in 2 courses and 33 in 4 courses) or DCS (n = 66; 33 in 2 courses and 33 in 4 courses).The respective major grade 3 or 4 hematological toxicities (CS/DCS) were leukocytopenia (14.1%/26.2%), neutropenia (29.7%/47.7%), anemia (14.1%/12.3%), and platelet reduction (3.1%/1.5%).The rate of pathological response, defined as a complete response or < 10% residual cancer remaining, was 19.4% in the CS group and 15.4% in the DCS group, and 15.6% in the two-course group and 19.0% in the 4-course group.The R0 resection rate was 72.7% in the CS group and 81.8% in the DCS group and 80.3% in the two-course group and the 74.2% in the four-course group.No treatment-related deaths were observed.CONCLUSIONS: Our results do not support three-drug therapy with a taxane over two-drug therapy, or any further treatment beyond two cycles as an attractive candidate for the test arm of

RESEARCH VARIABLES: Body composition (total fat, trunk fat, and lean mass), insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1, and sex hormone-binding globulin.FINDINGS: In the 36 PCSs with baseline and 12-month data, total fat (p = 0.02) and trunk fat (p = 0.06) mass decreased in the training group compared to gains in controls.Loss of total and trunk fat each mediated the relationship between groups and one-year change in insulin (p < 0.05).Age moderated the insulin response to exercise where insulin reductions were smaller with increasing age (p = 0.03).CONCLUSIONS: Resistance and impact exercise

Open-label Study in China.PURPOSE: Optimal treatment strategies for advanced natural killer/T (NK/T)-cell lymphoma have not been fully defined.We compared the safety and efficacy of DDGP and SMILE regimens for advanced NK/T-cell lymphoma in a randomized controlled, multicenter, and open-label clinical trial.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients were newly diagnosed in stages III-IV and had performance scores in 0 to 2.Six cycles of DDGP (dexamethasone, cisplatin, gemcitabline, and pegaspargase) or SMILE (dexamethasone, methotrexate, ifosfamide, L-asparaginase, and etoposide) chemotherapy were randomly assigned to them.The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS).Secondary end points included response rate and overall survival (OS).The trial is ongoing and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (No. NCT01501149).RESULTS: Of 42 patients enrolled, 21 were treated with DDGP therapy, and 21 patients were treated with SMILE therapy.The 1-year PFS and 2-year OS rates were better in the DDGP group than that in the SMILE group (86% vs. 38% for 1-year PFS, P = 0.006; 74% vs. 45% for 2-year OS, P = 0.027).Complete remission (CR) rate and overall response rate (ORR) of the DDGP group were higher than that in the SMILE group (71% vs. 29%, P = 0.005 for CR rate; 95% vs. 67%, P = 0.018 for ORR).The SMILE group showed more serious leucopenia (P = 0.030) and severe allergic reaction (P = 0.015) than the DDGP group.In addition, two cases in the SMILE group underwent grade 4 mucosal reaction.CONCLUSIONS: DDGP chemotherapy resulted in significant improvement in PFS, OS, and

neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) is still unknown.This study aimed to develop and validate a perdition model based on the CFs and clinicopathological characteristics to predict the treatment response to nCRT among locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) patients.METHODS: In this multicenter, retrospective analysis, 428 patients were included and randomly divided into a training cohort (299 patients) and validation cohort (129 patients) [7:3 ratio].A total of 11 CFs were extracted from a multiphoton image of pretreatment biopsy, and a support vector machine (SVM) was then used to construct a CFs-SVM classifier.A prediction model was developed and presented with a nomogram using multivariable analysis.Further validation of the nomogram was performed in the validation cohort.RESULTS: The CFs-SVM classifier, which integrated collagen area, straightness, and crosslink density, was significantly associated with treatment response.Predictors contained in the nomogram included the CFs-SVM classifier and clinicopathological characteristics by multivariable analysis.The CFs nomogram demonstrated good discrimination, with area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs) of 0.834 in the training cohort and 0.854 in the validation cohort.Decision curve analysis indicated that the CFs nomogram was clinically useful.Moreover, compared with the traditional clinicopathological model, the CFs nomogram showed more powerful discrimination in determining the response to nCRT.CONCLUSIONS: The CFs-SVM classifier based on CFs in the tumor microenvironment is associated with treatment response, and the CFs nomogram integrating the CFs-SVM classifier and clinicopathological characteristics is useful for individualized prediction of the

retrospective analysis of the trial considering gender, preoperative hearing, and nimodipine treatment was performed.The treatment group received parenteral nimodipine from the day before surgery until the seventh postoperative day.The control group was not treated prophylactically.Cochlear nerve function was determined by pure-tone audiometry with speech discrimination preoperatively, during in-patient care, and 1 year after surgery and classified according to the Gardner-Robertson grading scale (GR).Logistic regression analysis showed a statistically significant effect for higher hearing preservation rates (pre- and postoperative GR 1-4) in 40 men comparing the treatment (n = 21) and the control (n = 19) groups (p = 0.028), but not in 54 women comparing 27 women in both groups (p = 0.077).The results were also statistically significant for preservation of postoperative hearing with pre- and postoperative GR 1-3 (p = 0.024).There were no differences in tumor sizes between the treatment and the control groups in men, whereas statistically significant larger tumors were observed in the female treatment group compared with the female control group.Prophylactic nimodipine is safe, and an effect for hearing preservation in 40 men with preoperative hearing ability of GR 1-4 was shown in this retrospective investigation.The imbalance in tumor size with larger tumors in females of the treatment group may falsely suggest a gender-related effect.Further investigations are recommended to clarify whether gender has impact on nimodipine's efficacy."}, {"role": "user",

emergent treatment.Many nonsurgical treatments to palliate obstruction have been developed in clinics.The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical effects of transanal drainage tube (TDT) and metallic stent for the decompression of acute left-sided malignant colorectal obstruction.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-nine patients with acute left-sided malignant colorectal obstruction were enrolled in this study from January 2005 to December 2010, they were randomly divided into TDT group (13 patients) and metallic stent group (16 patients).RESULTS: There were 13 cases in TDT group (male:female=8:5, age from 65 to 80 y, mean age was 72.6+/-4.7 y).The sites of lesions were located in the rectum of 3 patients, sigmoid colon of 7 patients, and descending colon of 3 patients.TDT was successfully inserted in 11 cases (84.6%).Among the 11 patients, 1-stage operation with sufficient lymph node dissection was performed in 8 cases after adequate lavage without complications.One case underwent emergent Hartmann operation because of colonic tumor perforation 3 days after ileus tube decompression.Two cases were discharged without surgery after relief of symptom.There were 16 cases in the metallic stent group (male:female=10:6 age from 48 to 86 y, mean age was 73.3+/-8.5 y).The sites of the lesions were located in the rectum of 4 patients, sigmoid colon of 6 patients, and descending colon of 6 patients.Successful stent placement was achieved in 13 cases (81.3%) with no severe complications.Among the 13 patients, 1-stage operation with sufficient lymph node dissection was performed in 7 cases and 6 cases refused to underwent surgery with stent as the definitive palliative treatment.The price of a TDT is only one third of an expandable metallic stent.CONCLUSIONS: Both TDT and metallic stent can achieve preoperative colonic lavage for 1-stage operation for patients with acute left-sided malignant colorectal obstruction with no increase in complications."},

Versus Regorafenib in Locally Advanced Unresectable or Metastatic GI Stromal Tumor: A Randomized, Open-Label Phase III Study.PURPOSE: Primary or secondary mutations in KIT or platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) underlie tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance in most GI stromal tumors (GISTs).Avapritinib selectively and potently inhibits KIT- and PDGFRA-mutant kinases.In the phase I NAVIGATOR study (NCT02508532), avapritinib showed clinical activity against PDGFRA D842V-mutant and later-line KIT-mutant GIST.VOYAGER (NCT03465722), a phase III study, evaluated efficacy and safety of avapritinib versus regorafenib as third-line or later treatment in patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST.PATIENTS AND METHODS: VOYAGER randomly assigned patients 1:1 to avapritinib 300 mg once daily (4 weeks continuously) or regorafenib 160 mg once daily (3 weeks on and 1 week off).Primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) by central radiology per RECIST version 1.1 modified for GIST.Secondary end points included objective response rate, overall survival, safety, disease control rate, and duration of response.Regorafenib to avapritinib crossover was permitted upon centrally confirmed disease progression.RESULTS: Four hundred seventy-six patients were randomly assigned (avapritinib, n = 240; regorafenib, n = 236).Median PFS was not statistically different between avapritinib and regorafenib (hazard ratio, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.99 to 1.57; 4.2 v 5.6 months; P = .055).Overall survival data were immature at cutoff.Objective response rates were 17.1% and 7.2%, with durations of responses of 7.6 and 9.4 months for avapritinib and regorafenib; disease control rates were 41.7% (95% CI, 35.4 to 48.2) and 46.2% (95% CI, 39.7 to 52.8).Treatment-related adverse events (any grade, grade >/= 3) were similar for avapritinib (92.5% and 55.2%) and regorafenib (96.2% and 57.7%).CONCLUSION: Primary end point was not met.There was no significant difference in median PFS between avapritinib and regorafenib in patients with molecularly unselected, late-line GIST."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Please ascertain whether the article meets all of the following

advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (REGARD): an international, randomised, multicentre, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2)-mediated signalling and angiogenesis can contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of gastric cancer.We aimed to assess whether ramucirumab, a monoclonal antibody VEGFR-2 antagonist, prolonged survival in patients with advanced gastric cancer.METHODS: We did an international, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial between Oct 6, 2009, and Jan 26, 2012, at 119 centres in 29 countries in North America, Central and South America, Europe, Asia, Australia, and Africa.Patients aged 24-87 years with advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma and disease progression after first-line platinum-containing or fluoropyrimidine-containing chemotherapy were randomly assigned (2:1), via a central interactive voice-response system, to receive best supportive care plus either ramucirumab 8 mg/kg or placebo, intravenously once every 2 weeks.The study sponsor, participants, and investigators were masked to treatment assignment.The primary endpoint was overall survival.Analysis was by intention to treat.This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00917384.FINDINGS: 355 patients were assigned to receive ramucirumab (n=238) or placebo (n=117).Median overall survival was 5.2 months (IQR 2.3-9.9) in patients in the ramucirumab group and 3.8 months (1.7-7.1) in those in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.776, 95% CI 0.603-0.998; p=0.047).The survival benefit with ramucirumab remained unchanged after multivariable adjustment for other prognostic factors (multivariable HR 0.774, 0.605-0.991; p=0.042).Rates of hypertension were higher in the ramucirumab group than in the placebo group (38 [16%] vs nine [8%]), whereas rates of other adverse events were mostly similar between groups (223 [94%] vs 101 [88%]).Five (2%) deaths in the ramucirumab group and two (2%) in the placebo group were considered to be related to study drug.INTERPRETATION: Ramucirumab is the first biological treatment given as a single drug that has survival benefits in patients with advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma progressing after first-line chemotherapy.Our findings validate VEGFR-2 signalling as an important therapeutic target in advanced gastric cancer.FUNDING: ImClone Systems."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Please ascertain whether the article meets

gynecological cancer and impact on quality-of-life: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The pathogenesis of enteritis after abdominal radiotherapy (RT) is unknown, although changes in fecal microbiota may be involved.Prebiotics stimulate the proliferation of Lactobacillus spp and Bifidobacterium spp, and this may have positive effects on the intestinal mucosa during abdominal RT.SUBJECTS/METHODS: We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving patients with gynecological cancer who received abdominal RT after surgery.Patients were randomized to receive prebiotics or placebo.The prebiotic group received a mixture of fiber (50 inulin and 50% fructo-oligosaccharide), and the placebo group received 6 g of maltodextrin twice daily from 1 week before to 3 weeks after RT.The number of bowel movements and stool consistency was recorded daily.Diarrhea was evaluated according to the Common Toxicity Criteria of the National Cancer Institute.Stool consistency was assessed using the 7-point Bristol scale.Patients' quality-of-life was evaluated at baseline and at completion of RT using the EORTC-QLQ-C30 (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality-of-life Questionnaire C30) test.RESULTS: Thirty-eight women with a mean age of 60.3+/-11.8 years participated in the study.Both groups (prebiotic (n=20) and placebo (n=18)) were comparable in their baseline characteristics.The number of bowel movements per month increased in both groups during RT.The number of bowel movements per day increased in both groups.The number of days with watery stool (Bristol score 7) was lower in the prebiotic group (3.3+/-4.4 to 2.2+/-1.6) than in the placebo group (P=0.08).With respect to quality-of-life, the symptoms with the highest score in the placebo group were insomnia at baseline and diarrhea toward the end of the treatment.In the prebiotic group, insomnia was the symptom with the highest score at both assessments, although the differences were not statistically significant.CONCLUSIONS: Prebiotics can improve the consistency of stools in gynecologic cancer patients on RT.This finding could have important implications in the quality-of-life of these patients during treatment."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Please ascertain whether the article meets all of the

absence of protocol-directed antidiarrheal prophylaxis or a formal diarrhea management plan using data from Extended Adjuvant Treatment of Breast Cancer with Neratinib (ExteNET).METHODS: ExteNET is a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized phase III trial involving community-based and academic institutions in 40 countries.Women with HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer with prior standard primary therapy and trastuzumab-based (neo)adjuvant therapy were randomized to neratinib 240 mg/day or placebo for 12 months.Safety, a secondary outcome, was assessed using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria version 3.0.Health-related quality of life by diarrhea grade was assessed using Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B).RESULTS: Two thousand eight hundred sixteen women (1408 per group) were safety-evaluable.Grade 3 and 4 diarrhea occurred in 561 (39.8%) and 1 (0.1%) patients with neratinib versus 23 (1.6%) and 0 patients with placebo, respectively.In the neratinib group, 28.6% of patients had grade 3 events during month 1 decreasing to </= 6% after month 3.The median cumulative duration of grade 3/4 diarrhea with neratinib was 5 days (interquartile range, 2-9).Serious diarrheal events (n = 22, 1.6%) and diarrheal events requiring hospitalization (n = 20, 1.4%)were rare with neratinib.Changes in FACT-B total score by diarrhea grade in the neratinib group did not meet the threshold for clinically important differences.CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of antidiarrheal prophylaxis, neratinib-related diarrhea is short-lived and not associated with complications or long-term sequelae.This suggests that targeted preventive management with antidiarrheal prophylaxis early during neratinib treatment is

analysis of afatinib versus pemetrexed-cisplatin for first-line treatment of locally advanced or metastatic EGFR mutation positive non-small-cell lung cancer from the Singapore healthcare payer's perspective.BACKGROUND: Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 85% of all lung cancers and is associated with a poor prognosis.Afatinib is an irreversible ErbB family blocker recommended in clinical guidelines as a first-line treatment for NSCLC which harbours an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation.The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of afatinib versus pemetrexed-cisplatin for first-line treatment of locally advanced or metastatic EGFR mutation positive NSCLC in Singapore.METHODS: A partitioned survival model with three health states (progression-free, progressive disease and death) was developed from a healthcare payer perspective.Survival curves from the LUX-Lung 3 trial (afatinib versus pemetrexed-cisplatin chemotherapy) were extrapolated beyond the trial period to estimate the underlying progression-free survival and overall survival parametric distributions.Rates of adverse reactions were also estimated from LUX-Lung 3 while health utilities from overseas were derived from the literature in the absence of local estimates.Direct costs were sourced from public healthcare institutions in Singapore.Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated over a 5 year time horizon.Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses and additional scenario analyses were conducted to explore the impact of uncertainties and assumptions on the cost-effectiveness results.RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, the ICER for afatinib versus pemetrexed-cisplatin was SG$137,648 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained and SG$109,172 per life-year gained.One-way sensitivity analysis showed the ICER was most sensitive to variations in the utility values, the cost of afatinib and time horizon.Scenario analyses showed that even reducing the cost of afatinib by 50% led to a high ICER which was unlikely to represent a cost-effective use of healthcare resources.CONCLUSIONS: Compared with pemetrexed-cisplatin, afatinib is not cost-effective as a first-line treatment for advanced EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC in Singapore.The findings from our study will be useful to inform local healthcare decision-making and resource allocations for NSCLC treatments, together with other considerations such as clinical effectiveness, safety and affordability of TKIs."}, {"role": "user",

hepatectomy (hemihepatectomy or trisectionectomy) for biliary tract cancer (BTC).BACKGROUND: Standardized adjuvant therapy is not performed after major hepatectomy for BTC, and we determined the recommended dose in the former study (KHBO1003).METHODS: We performed a multicenter, randomized phase II study.The primary measure was 1-year recurrence-free survival (RFS); the secondary measures were other RFS, overall survival (OS), and others.The following 6-month adjuvant chemotherapy was administered within 12 weeks of R0/1: GEM (1000 mg/m) every 2 weeks; or S-1 (80 mg/m/d) for 28 days every 6 weeks.Thirty-five patients were assigned to each arm (alpha error, 10%; beta error, 20%).RESULTS: No patients were excluded for the per-protocol analysis.There were no statistically significant differences in the patient characteristics of the 2 arms.The 1-year RFS and 1-year OS rates of the GEM arm were 51.4% and 80.0%, respectively, whereas those of the S-1 group were 62.9% and 97.1%.The comparison of the 2 arms revealed that 2-year RFS rate, 1 and 2-year OS rates, and OS curve of the S-1 arm were superior to GEM.With regard to OS, the hazard ratio of the S-1 group was 0.477 (90% confidence interval 0.245-0.927).CONCLUSION: The comparison of the survival of the 2 groups revealed that adjuvant S-1 therapy may be superior to adjuvant GEM therapy after major hepatectomy for

pembrolizumab versus placebo in resected stage III melanoma (EORTC 1325-MG/KEYNOTE-054): distant metastasis-free survival results from a double-blind, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 1325/KEYNOTE-054 trial assessed pembrolizumab versus placebo in patients with resected high-risk stage III melanoma.At 15-month median follow-up, pembrolizumab improved recurrence-free survival (hazard ratio [HR] 0.57 [98.4% CI 0.43-0.74], p<0.0001) compared with placebo, leading to its approval in the USA and Europe.This report provides the final results for the secondary efficacy endpoint, distant metastasis-free survival and an update of the recurrence-free survival results.METHODS: This double-blind, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial was done at 123 academic centres and community hospitals across 23 countries.Patients aged 18 years or older with complete resection of cutaneous melanoma metastatic to lymph node, classified as American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system, seventh edition (AJCC-7) stage IIIA (at least one lymph node metastasis >1 mm), IIIB, or IIIC (without in-transit metastasis), and with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 were eligible.Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) via a central interactive voice response system to receive intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg or placebo every 3 weeks for up to 18 doses or until disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity.Randomisation was stratified according to disease stage and region, using a minimisation technique, and clinical investigators, patients, and those collecting or analysing the data were masked to treatment assignment.The two coprimary endpoints were recurrence-free survival in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population and in patients with PD-L1-positive tumours.The secondary endpoint reported here was distant metastasis-free survival in the ITT and PD-L1-positive populations.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02362594, and EudraCT, 2014-004944-37.FINDINGS: Between Aug 26, 2015, and Nov 14, 2016, 1019 patients were assigned to receive either pembrolizumab (n=514) or placebo (n=505).At an overall median follow-up of 42.3 months (IQR 40.5-45.9), 3.5-year distant metastasis-free survival was higher in the pembrolizumab group than in the placebo group in the ITT population (65.3% [95% CI 60.9-69.5] in the pembrolizumab group vs 49.4% [44.8-53.8] in the placebo group; HR 0.60 [95% CI 0.49-0.73]; p<0.0001).In the 853 patients with PD-L1-positive tumours, 3.5-year distant metastasis-free survival was 66.7% (95% CI 61.8-71.2) in the pembrolizumab group and 51.6% (46.6-56.4) in the placebo group (HR 0.61 [95% CI 0.49-0.76]; p<0.0001).Recurrence-free survival remained longer in the pembrolizumab group 59.8% (95% CI 55.3-64.1) than the placebo group 41.4% (37.0-45.8) at this 3.5-year follow-up in the ITT population (HR 0.59 [95% CI 0.49-0.70]) and in those with PD-L1-positive tumours 61.4% (56.3-66.1) in the pembrolizumab group and 44.1% (39.2-48.8) in the placebo group (HR 0.59 [95% CI 0.49-0.73]).INTERPRETATION: Pembrolizumab adjuvant therapy provided a significant and clinically meaningful improvement in distant metastasis-free survival at a 3.5-year median follow-up, which was consistent with the improvement in recurrence-free survival.Therefore, the results of this trial support the indication to use adjuvant pembrolizumab therapy in patients with resected high risk stage III cutaneous melanoma.FUNDING: Merck Sharp & Dohme."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Please ascertain whether the article meets all of the following criteria (criterion by criterion).\n\n# Criteria\n- format: The

To assess the optimal pancreatic phase delay in terms of parenchymal enhancement and tumor-to-pancreas contrast with a bolus-tracking method.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients referred for suspicion of pancreatic tumor and undergoing 64-detector computed tomography scanner were randomized to an individualized scan delay of 10, 20, or 30 seconds of nonionic contrast material (370 mg I/mL) after aortic enhancement above 150 Hounsfield units.The volume of contrast was adjusted to patient weight.Pancreatic and tumor enhancements were measured.Statistical analysis included analysis of variance and post hoc Tukey tests.RESULTS: One hundred and fifty patients were randomized to individualized scan delays of 10, 20, or 30 seconds.Pancreatic parenchymal enhancement in all patients (n = 150) was significantly higher with a delay of 20 or 30 seconds than that with 10 seconds (P < .001 for both).Tumor-to-pancreas contrast for solid tumors (n = 59) was significantly higher with a delay of 30 seconds than that with 10 seconds (P = .015).Adenocarcinoma-to-pancreas contrast during pancreatic phase was significantly higher for a 20- or 30-second delay than for a 10-second delay (P = .027 and .011, respectively) for one reader.CONCLUSIONS: With a flow rate of 4 mL/s and weight-adjusted contrast volume, an individualized scan delay of 30 seconds after aortic transit time revealed higher pancreatic enhancement and tumor-to-pancreas contrast than that with a delay of 10 seconds."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Please ascertain whether the article meets all of the following criteria
