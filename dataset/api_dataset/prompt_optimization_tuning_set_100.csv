25867139,"Randomized phase II/III clinical trial of elpamotide for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer: PEGASUS-PC Study.Gemcitabine is a key drug for the treatment of pancreatic cancer; however, with its limitation in clinical benefits, the development of another potent therapeutic is necessary.Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 is an essential target for tumor angiogenesis, and we have conducted a phase I clinical trial using gemcitabine and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 peptide (elpamotide).Based on the promising results of this phase I trial, a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase II/III clinical trial has been carried out for pancreatic cancer.The eligibility criteria included locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer.Patients were assigned to either the Active group (elpamotide + gemcitabine) or Placebo group (placebo + gemcitabine) in a 2:1 ratio by the dynamic allocation method.The primary endpoint was overall survival.The Harrington-Fleming test was applied to the statistical analysis in this study to evaluate the time-lagged effect of immunotherapy appropriately.A total of 153 patients (Active group, n = 100; Placebo group, n = 53) were included in the analysis.No statistically significant differences were found between the two groups in the prolongation of overall survival (Harrington-Fleming P-value, 0.918; log-rank P-value, 0.897; hazard ratio, 0.87, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.486-1.557).Median survival time was 8.36 months (95% CI, 7.46-10.18) for the Active group and 8.54 months (95% CI, 7.33-10.84) for the Placebo group.The toxicity observed in both groups was manageable.Combination therapy of elpamotide with gemcitabine was well tolerated.Despite the lack of benefit in overall survival, subgroup analysis suggested that the patients who experienced severe injection site reaction, such as ulceration and erosion, might have better survival.",1,1,1,0
32001832,"Predictive factors of 5-year relapse-free survival in HR+/HER2- breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant endocrine therapy: pooled analysis of two phase 2 trials.BACKGROUND: Few data are available on survival and predictive factors in early breast cancer (BC) patients treated with neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (NET).METHODS: This is a pooled analysis of two multicentre, randomised non-comparative phase 2 clinical trials evaluating neoadjuvant anastrozole and fulvestrant efficacy for postmenopausal HR+/HER2- breast cancer patients: HORGEN (NCT00871858) and CARMINA02 (NCT00629616) studies.RESULTS: In total, 236 patients were included in CARMINA02 and HORGEN trials.Modified intention-to-treat analysis was available for 217 patients.Median follow-up was 65.2 months.Relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) at 5 years were 83.7% (95% CI: 77.9-88) and 92.7% (95% CI: 88.2-95.6), respectively, with no difference between treatment arms.On univariate analysis, tumour staging (T2 vs T3-4; p = 0.0001), Ki-67 at surgery (</=10% vs >10%; p = 0.0093), pathological tumour size (pT1-2 vs pT3-4; p = 0.0012) and node status (pN negative vs positive; p = 0.007), adjuvant chemotherapy (p = 0.0167) and PEPI score (PEPI group I + II vs III; p = 0.0004) were associated with RFS.No events were observed in patients with pathological response according to the Sataloff classification.Multivariate analysis showed that preoperative endocrine prognostic index (PEPI) group III was associated with significantly worse RFS (p = 0.0069, hazard ratio = 3.33 (95% CI: 1.39-7.98)).CONCLUSIONS: Postmenopausal HR+/HER2- breast cancer patients receiving NET generally have a favourable outcome.The PEPI score identifies a subset of patients of poorer prognosis who are candidates for further additional treatment.",0,0,0,0
23019151,"Radiation therapy following surgery for localized breast cancer: outcome prediction by classical prognostic factors and approximated genetic subtypes.The purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcome prediction power of classical prognostic factors along with surrogate approximation of genetic signatures (AGS) subtypes in patients affected by localized breast cancer (BC) and treated with postoperative radiotherapy.We retrospectively analyzed 468 consecutive female patients affected by localized BC with complete immunohistochemical and pathological information available.All patients underwent surgery plus radiotherapy.Median follow-up was 59 months (range, 6-132) from the diagnosis.Disease recurrences (DR), local and/or distant, and contralateral breast cancer (CBC) were registered and analyzed in relation to subtypes (luminal A, luminal B, HER-2, and basal), and classical prognostic factors (PFs), namely age, nodal status (N), tumor classification (T), grading (G), estrogen receptors (ER), progesterone receptors and erb-B2 status.Bootstrap technique for variable selection and bootstrap resampling to test selection stability were used.Regarding AGS subtypes, HER-2 and basal were more likely to recur than luminal A and B subtypes, while patients in the basal group were more likely to have CBC.However, considering PFs along with AGS subtypes, the optimal multivariable predictive model for DR consisted of age, T, N, G and ER.A single-variable model including basal subtype resulted again as the optimal predictive model for CBC.In patients bearing localized BC the combination of classical clinical variables age, T, N, G and ER was still confirmed to be the best predictor of DR, while the basal subtype was demonstrated to be significantly and exclusively correlated with CBC.",0,0,0,0
25670810,"Leadership training to improve adenoma detection rate in screening colonoscopy: a randomised trial.OBJECTIVE: Suboptimal adenoma detection rate (ADR) at colonoscopy is associated with increased risk of interval colorectal cancer.It is uncertain how ADR might be improved.We compared the effect of leadership training versus feedback only on colonoscopy quality in a countrywide randomised trial.DESIGN: 40 colonoscopy screening centres with suboptimal performance in the Polish screening programme (centre leader ADR </= 25% during preintervention phase January to December 2011) were randomised to either a Train-Colonoscopy-Leaders (TCLs) programme (assessment, hands-on training, post-training feedback) or feedback only (individual quality measures).Colonoscopies performed June to December 2012 (early postintervention) and January to December 2013 (late postintervention) were used to calculate changes in quality measures.Primary outcome was change in leaders' ADR.Mixed effect models using ORs and 95% CIs were computed.RESULTS: The study included 24,582 colonoscopies performed by 38 leaders and 56,617 colonoscopies performed by 138 endoscopists at the participating centres.The absolute difference between the TCL and feedback groups in mean ADR improvement of leaders was 7.1% and 4.2% in early and late postintervention phases, respectively.The TCL group had larger improvement in ADR in early (OR 1.61; 95% CI 1.29 to 2.01; p<0.001) and late (OR 1.35; 95% CI 1.10 to 1.66; p=0.004) postintervention phases.In the late postintervention phase, the absolute difference between the TCL and feedback groups in mean ADR improvement of entire centres was 3.9% (OR 1.25; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.50; p=0.017).CONCLUSIONS: Teaching centre leaders in colonoscopy training improved important quality measures in screening colonoscopy.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT01667198.",1,0,0,0
23177515,"Efficacy and safety of regorafenib for advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumours after failure of imatinib and sunitinib (GRID): an international, multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Until now, only imatinib and sunitinib have proven clinical benefit in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST), but almost all metastatic GIST eventually develop resistance to these agents, resulting in fatal disease progression.We aimed to assess efficacy and safety of regorafenib in patients with metastatic or unresectable GIST progressing after failure of at least imatinib and sunitinib.METHODS: We did this phase 3 trial at 57 hospitals in 17 countries.Patients with histologically confirmed, metastatic or unresectable GIST, with failure of at least previous imatinib and sunitinib were randomised in a 2:1 ratio (by computer-generated randomisation list and interactive voice response system; preallocated block design (block size 12); stratified by treatment line and geographical region) to receive either oral regorafenib 160 mg daily or placebo, plus best supportive care in both groups, for the first 3 weeks of each 4 week cycle.The study sponsor, participants, and investigators were masked to treatment assignment.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS).At disease progression, patients assigned placebo could crossover to open-label regorafenib.Analyses were by intention to treat.This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01271712.RESULTS: From Jan 4, to Aug 18, 2011, 240 patients were screened and 199 were randomised to receive regorafenib (n=133) or matching placebo (n=66).Data cutoff was Jan 26, 2012.Median PFS per independent blinded central review was 4.8 months (IQR 1.4-9.2) for regorafenib and 0.9 months (0.9-1.8) for placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0.27, 95% CI 0.19-0.39; p<0.0001).After progression, 56 patients (85%) assigned placebo crossed over to regorafenib.Drug-related adverse events were reported in 130 (98%) patients assigned regorafenib and 45 (68%) patients assigned placebo.The most common regorafenib-related adverse events of grade 3 or higher were hypertension (31 of 132, 23%), hand-foot skin reaction (26 of 132, 20%), and diarrhoea (seven of 132, 5%).INTERPRETATION: The results of this study show that oral regorafenib can provide a significant improvement in progression-free survival compared with placebo in patients with metastatic GIST after progression on standard treatments.As far as we are aware, this is the first clinical trial to show benefit from a kinase inhibitor in this highly refractory population of patients.FUNDING: Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals.",1,1,1,0
23428284,"Health beliefs associated with cervical cancer screening among Vietnamese Americans.BACKGROUND: Vietnamese American women represent one of the ethnic subgroups at great risk for cervical cancer in the United States.The underutilization of cervical cancer screening and the vulnerability of Vietnamese American women to cervical cancer may be compounded by their health beliefs.OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to explore the associations between factors of the Health Belief Model (HBM) and cervical cancer screening among Vietnamese American women.METHODS: Vietnamese American women (n=1,450) were enrolled into the randomized controlled trial (RCT) study who were recruited from 30 Vietnamese community-based organizations located in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.Participants completed baseline assessments of demographic and acculturation variables, health care access factors, and constructs of the HBM, as well as health behaviors in either English or Vietnamese.RESULTS: The rate of those who had ever undergone cervical cancer screening was 53% (769/1450) among the participants.After adjusting for sociodemographic variables, the significant associated factors from HBM included: believing themselves at risk and more likely than average women to get cervical cancer; believing that cervical cancer changes life; believing a Pap test is important for staying healthy, not understanding what is done during a Pap test, being scared to know having cervical cancer; taking a Pap test is embarrassing; not being available by doctors at convenient times; having too much time for a test; believing no need for a Pap test when feeling well; and being confident in getting a test.CONCLUSION: Understanding how health beliefs may be associated with cervical cancer screening among underserved Vietnamese American women is essential for identifying the subgroup of women who are most at risk for cervical cancer and would benefit from intervention programs to increase screening rates.",0,0,0,0
30297911,"Neoadjuvant versus adjuvant ipilimumab plus nivolumab in macroscopic stage III melanoma.Adjuvant ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4) and nivolumab (anti-PD-1) both improve relapse-free survival of stage III melanoma patients(1,2).In stage IV disease, the combination of ipilimumab + nivolumab is superior to ipilimumab alone and also appears to be more effective than nivolumab monotherapy(3).Preclinical work suggests that neoadjuvant application of checkpoint inhibitors may be superior to adjuvant therapy(4).To address this question and to test feasibility, 20 patients with palpable stage III melanoma were 1:1 randomized to receive ipilimumab 3 mg kg(-1) and nivolumab 1 mg kg(-1), as either four courses after surgery (adjuvant arm) or two courses before surgery and two courses postsurgery (neoadjuvant arm).Neoadjuvant therapy was feasible, with all patients undergoing surgery at the preplanned time point.However in both arms, 9/10 patients experienced one or more grade 3/4 adverse events.Pathological responses were achieved in 7/9 (78%) patients treated in the neoadjuvant arm.None of these patients have relapsed so far (median follow-up, 25.6 months).We found that neoadjuvant ipilimumab + nivolumab expand more tumor-resident T cell clones than adjuvant application.While neoadjuvant therapy appears promising, with the current regimen it induced high toxicity rates; therefore, it needs further investigation to preserve efficacy but reduce toxicity.",1,1,1,0

31627177,"Minocycline Reduces Chemoradiation-Related Symptom Burden in Patients with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Phase 2 Randomized Trial.PURPOSE: In patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CRT) exacerbates a cluster of difficult-to-manage symptoms, especially cancer-related fatigue.Minocycline is a readily available, low-cost antibiotic with antiinflammatory properties.We conducted a phase 2 randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial to investigate the effect of minocycline in reducing CRT-symptom burden in NSCLC.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients with NSCLC scheduled to receive CRT provided consent and were randomized to receive either minocycline (100 mg twice daily) or a matching placebo during 6 to 7 weeks of CRT.Patient-reported fatigue and other symptoms were assessed on MD Anderson Symptom Inventory weekly from the start of CRT for 12 weeks.The primary outcome was 12-week (+/-2 days) area under the curve for symptom burden, which was compared between treatment groups.RESULTS: Forty of 49 enrolled patients (80%) were evaluable (19 on minocycline and 21 on placebo).There were no grade 3 + adverse events related to the study medication.Fatigue was significantly reduced in the minocycline group compared with placebo group during the 12-week trial period (area under the curve = 31.2 +/-14.2 vs 45.0 +/- 20.9, P = .011), with a large effect size (Cohen's d = 0.77).Pain (Cohen's d = 0.54) and shortness of breath (Cohen's d = 0.55) were also significantly reduced in the minocycline group (all P < .05).CONCLUSIONS: Minocycline during CRT for NSCLC was feasible, had a low toxicity profile, and yielded a clinically and statistically significant positive signal in reducing symptom burden related to NSCLC and CRT.This study is a proof of concept so a larger trial in CRT patients is warranted.",1,1,0,0
25862143,"A Randomized Controlled Trial To Assess and Compare the Outcomes of Two-core Prostate Biopsy Guided by Fused Magnetic Resonance and Transrectal Ultrasound Images and Traditional 12-core Systematic Biopsy.BACKGROUND: Prostate biopsy guided by computer-assisted fusion of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) images (MRI group) has not yet been compared with 12-core random biopsy (RB; control group) in a randomized controlled trial (RCT).OBJECTIVE: To compare the rate of detection of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) between the two groups.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This RCT included 175 biopsy-naive patients with suspicion for prostate cancer, randomized to an MRI group (n=86) and a control group (n=89) between September 2011 and June 2013.INTERVENTION: In the MRI group, two-core targeted biopsy (TB) guided by computer-assisted fusion of MRI/TRUS images of MRI-suspicious lesions was followed by 12-core RB.In the control group, both two-core TB for abnormal digital rectal examination (DRE) and/or TRUS-suspicious lesions and 12-core RB were performed.In patients with normal MRI or DRE/TRUS, only 12-core RB was performed.OUTCOMES MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The detection rates for any cancer and csPCa were compared between the two groups and between TB and RB.RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Detection rates for any cancer (MRI group 51/86, 59%; control group 48/89, 54%; p=0.4) and csPCa (38/86, 44% vs 44/89, 49%; p=0.5) did not significantly differ between the groups.Detection of csPCa was comparable between two-core MRI/TRUS-TB (33/86, 38%) and 12-core RB in the control group (44/89, 49%; p=0.2).In a subset analysis of patients with normal DRE, csPCa detection was similar between two-core MRI/TRUS-TB (14/66, 21%) and 12-core RB in the control group (15/60, 25%; p=0.7).Among biopsy-proven csPCas in MRI group, 87% (33/38) were detected by MRI/TRUS-TB.The definition of csPCa was only based on biopsy outcomes.CONCLUSION: Overall csPCa detection was similar between the MRI and control groups.Two-core MRI/TRUS-TB was comparable to 12-core RB for csPCa detection.PATIENT SUMMARY: Our randomized controlled trial revealed a similar rate of prostate cancer detection between targeted biopsy guided by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) and 12-core random biopsy.The traditional 12-core random biopsy may be replaced by two-core MRI/TRUS targeted biopsy for detection of clinically significant prostate cancer.",1,1,0,0
27018037,"Risedronate may preserve bone microarchitecture in breast cancer survivors on aromatase inhibitors: A randomized, controlled clinical trial.UNLABELLED: This study provides preliminary evidence that risedronate not only preserves BMD but may also attenuate the loss of bone microarchitecture over 2years during a time of accelerated bone loss in post-menopausal breast cancer survivors on aromatase inhibitors.INTRODUCTION: Accelerated bone loss and elevated fracture risk are associated with the use of aromatase inhibitors (AIs) in women with breast cancer.We previously reported that the oral bisphosphonate, risedronate, can maintain bone mineral density (BMD) in the hip and spine over 2-years in post-menopausal breast cancer survivors on AIs.In this study, we examined whether oral bisphosphonates can also preserve bone microarchitecture as measured by the trabecular bone score (TBS) in this population.METHODS: This 2-year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial included postmenopausal women over age 55 with breast cancer on an AI who had low bone mass.Participants provided informed consent and were randomized to risedronate 35mg once weekly or placebo.We examined 12- and 24-month changes in spine TBS, analyzed using linear mixed models.RESULTS: One-hundred and nine women with a mean age of 70.5years were included in the analysis.In the placebo group, BMD declined at the spine and hip over the 24-month period but was preserved in the active treatment group (data previously reported).TBS declined in the placebo group by -2.1% and -2.3% at 12- and 24-months, respectively (p<0.005).The TBS percent change in bisphosphonate-treated patients was -0.9% and -1.3% at 12 and 24-months but did not reach statistical significance (p=0.24 and 0.14).The 12- and 24-month between-group differences were 0.9 (p=0.38) and 0.8 (p=0.44) percentage points.TBS change correlated with spine BMD changes in the placebo group at 12- and 24-months (r=0.33 and 0.34, p<0.01) but not in the active treatment group.CONCLUSION: The oral bisphosphonate risedronate preserves BMD and may attenuate loss of bone microarchitecture over 2years during a time of accelerated bone loss in breast cancer survivors on AIs, but more definitive evidence is needed.",1,1,0,0

29602646,"Combination nivolumab and ipilimumab or nivolumab alone in melanoma brain metastases: a multicentre randomised phase 2 study.BACKGROUND: Nivolumab monotherapy and combination nivolumab plus ipilimumab increase proportions of patients achieving a response and survival versus ipilimumab in patients with metastatic melanoma; however, efficacy in active brain metastases is unknown.We aimed to establish the efficacy and safety of nivolumab alone or in combination with ipilimumab in patients with active melanoma brain metastases.METHODS: This multicentre open-label randomised phase 2 trial was done at four sites in Australia, in three cohorts of immunotherapy-naive patients aged 18 years or older with melanoma brain metastases.Patients with asymptomatic brain metastases with no previous local brain therapy were randomly assigned using the biased coin minimisation method, stratified by site, in a 30:24 ratio (after a safety run-in of six patients) to cohort A (nivolumab plus ipilimumab) or cohort B (nivolumab).Patients with brain metastases in whom local therapy had failed, or who had neurological symptoms, or leptomeningeal disease were enrolled in non-randomised cohort C (nivolumab).Patients in cohort A received intravenous nivolumab 1 mg/kg combined with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks for four doses, then nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks; patients in cohort B or cohort C received intravenous nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks.The primary endpoint was intracranial response from week 12.Primary and safety analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis in all patients who received at least one dose of the study drug.This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02374242, and is ongoing for the final survival analysis.FINDINGS: Between Nov 4, 2014, and April 21, 2017, 79 patients were enrolled; 36 in cohort A, 27 in cohort B, and 16 in cohort C. One patient in cohort A and two in cohort B were found to be ineligible and excluded from the study before receiving the study drug.At the data cutoff (Aug 28, 2017), with a median follow up of 17 months (IQR 8-25), intracranial responses were achieved by 16 (46%; 95% CI 29-63) of 35 patients in cohort A, five (20%; 7-41) of 25 in cohort B, and one (6%; 0-30) of 16 in cohort C. Intracranial complete responses occurred in six (17%) patients in cohort A, three (12%) in cohort B, and none in cohort C. Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 34 (97%) of 35 patients in cohort A, 17 (68%) of 25 in cohort B, and eight (50%) of 16 in cohort C. Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 19 (54%) patients in cohort A, four (16%) in cohort B, and two (13%) in cohort C. No treatment-related deaths occurred.INTERPRETATION: Nivolumab combined with ipilimumab and nivolumab monotherapy are active in melanoma brain metastases.A high proportion of patients achieved an intracranial response with the combination.Thus, nivolumab combined with ipilimumab should be considered as a first-line therapy for patients with asymptomatic untreated brain metastases.FUNDING: Melanoma Institute Australia and Bristol-Myers Squibb.",1,1,1,0
32212089,"Prognostic Significance of VEGF and HIF-1 alpha in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Patients Receiving Sorafenib Versus Metformin Sorafenib Combination.BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major health problem.HCC burden has been increasing in Egypt in the past 10 years.Most HCC cases are diagnosed at an advanced stage with limited treatment options.Sorafenib is the standard therapy for advanced HCC, but the effectiveness is not satisfied.Metformin may decrease the risk of HCC development in diabetic patients, reduces tumor invasion, and augments sensitivity to sorafenib; however, safety and efficacy of combined treatment are still unclear.As HCC is characterized by high vascularity, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays an important role in vascularization, many studies questioned if VEGF and HIF-1 alpha could offer information about HCC response to sorafenib.We conducted this study to assess the benefits from adding metformin to HCC treatment, and appraise the role of VEGF and HIF-1 alpha in HCC prognosis.METHOD: This was a prospective, randomized study in which 80 advanced measurable patients consecutively treated with sorafenib plus metformin (arm A) or sorafenib alone (arm B), prognostic value of plasma, and tissue levels of VEGF and HIF-1 alpha were evaluated.RESULTS: We enrolled 61 men and 19 women with a median age of 60 years (range 49-68 years).Fifty-seven patients had Child-Pugh A while 23 had early B, the most common etiology of liver disease was hepatitis C (86%).Sixty percent of patients were diabetic.No significant difference was detected between arm A and arm B regarding response to treatment (p = 0.5), time to disease progression (p = 0.3), or overall survival (p = 0.6).Low VEGF and HIF-1 alpha plasma levels were significantly associated with better treatment response (p < 0.001 for both), and higher OS (p < 0.001).Patients with high expressions of VEGF and HIF in HCC tissue had significantly poor treatment outcome (p < 0.001, p = 0.03, respectively), and poor OS (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: No superior efficacy of adding metformin to sorafenib in HCC treatment.VEGF and HIF-1 alpha had promising prognostic value in HCC.",1,1,1,0

33962579,"Phase 3 multicenter randomized trial of PSMA PET/CT prior to definitive radiation therapy for unfavorable intermediate-risk or high-risk prostate cancer [PSMA dRT]: study protocol.BACKGROUND: Definitive radiation therapy (dRT) is an effective initial treatment of intermediate-risk (IR) and high-risk (HR) prostate cancer (PCa).PSMA PET/CT is superior to standard of care imaging (CT, MRI, bone scan) for detecting regional and distant metastatic PCa.PSMA PET/CT thus has the potential to guide patient selection and the planning for dRT and improve patient outcomes.METHODS: This is a multicenter randomized phase 3 trial (NCT04457245).We will randomize 312 patients to proceed with standard dRT (control Arm, n = 150), or undergo a PSMA PET/CT scan at the study site (both 18F-DCFPyL and 68Ga-PSMA-11 can be used) prior to dRT planning (intervention arm, n = 162).dRT will be performed at the treating radiation oncologist facility.In the control arm, dRT will be performed as routinely planned.In the intervention arm, the treating radiation oncologist can incorporate PSMA PET/CT findings into the RT planning.Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is administered per discretion of the treating radiation oncologist and may be modified as a result of the PSMA PET/CT results.We assume that approximately 8% of subjects randomized to the PSMA PET arm will be found to have M1 disease and thus will be more appropriate candidates for long-term systemic or multimodal therapy, rather than curative intent dRT.PET M1 patients will thus not be included in the primary endpoint analysis.The primary endpoint is the success rate of patients with unfavorable IR and HR PCa after standard dRT versus PSMA PET-based dRT.Secondary Endpoints (whole cohort) include progression free survival (PFS), metastasis-free survival after initiation of RT, overall survival (OS), % of change in initial treatment intent and Safety.DISCUSSION: This is the first randomized phase 3 prospective trial designed to determine whether PSMA PET/CT molecular imaging can improve outcomes in patients with PCa who receive dRT.In this trial the incorporation of PSMA PET/CT may improve the success rate of curative intent radiotherapy in two ways: to optimize patient selection as a biomarker and to personalizes the radiotherapy plan.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: UCLA IND#147591 o Submission: 02.27.2020 o Safe-to-proceed letter issued by FDA: 04.01.2020 UCLA IRB #20-000378 ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT04457245 .Date of Registry: 07.07.2020.Essen EudraCT 2020-003526-23.",1,1,0,0
28350928,"Effect of Total Laparoscopic Hysterectomy vs Total Abdominal Hysterectomy on Disease-Free Survival Among Women With Stage I Endometrial Cancer: A Randomized Clinical Trial.Importance: Standard treatment for endometrial cancer involves removal of the uterus, tubes, ovaries, and lymph nodes.Few randomized trials have compared disease-free survival outcomes for surgical approaches.Objective: To investigate whether total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) is equivalent to total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH) in women with treatment-naive endometrial cancer.Design, Setting, and Participants: The Laparoscopic Approach to Cancer of the Endometrium (LACE) trial was a multinational, randomized equivalence trial conducted between October 7, 2005, and June 30, 2010, in which 27 surgeons from 20 tertiary gynecological cancer centers in Australia, New Zealand, and Hong Kong randomized 760 women with stage I endometrioid endometrial cancer to either TLH or TAH.Follow-up ended on March 3, 2016.Interventions: Patients were randomly assigned to undergo TAH (n = 353) or TLH (n = 407).Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was disease-free survival, which was measured as the interval between surgery and the date of first recurrence, including disease progression or the development of a new primary cancer or death assessed at 4.5 years after randomization.The prespecified equivalence margin was 7% or less.Secondary outcomes included recurrence of endometrial cancer and overall survival.Results: Patients were followed up for a median of 4.5 years.Of 760 patients who were randomized (mean age, 63 years), 679 (89%) completed the trial.At 4.5 years of follow-up, disease-free survival was 81.3% in the TAH group and 81.6% in the TLH group.The disease-free survival rate difference was 0.3% (favoring TLH; 95% CI, -5.5% to 6.1%; P = .007), meeting criteria for equivalence.There was no statistically significant between-group difference in recurrence of endometrial cancer (28/353 in TAH group [7.9%] vs 33/407 in TLH group [8.1%]; risk difference, 0.2% [95% CI, -3.7% to 4.0%]; P = .93) or in overall survival (24/353 in TAH group [6.8%] vs 30/407 in TLH group [7.4%]; risk difference, 0.6% [95% CI, -3.0% to 4.2%]; P = .76).Conclusions and Relevance: Among women with stage I endometrial cancer, the use of total abdominal hysterectomy compared with total laparoscopic hysterectomy resulted in equivalent disease-free survival at 4.5 years and no difference in overall survival.These findings support the use of laparoscopic hysterectomy for women with stage I endometrial cancer.Trial Registration: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00096408; Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry: CTRN12606000261516.",1,1,1,0

28279941,"Long-term outcome of the REMAGUS 02 trial, a multicenter randomised phase II trial in locally advanced breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy with or without celecoxib or trastuzumab according to HER2 status.BACKGROUND: The REMAGUS-02 multicenter randomised phase II trial showed that the addition to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) of trastuzumab in patients with localised HER2-positive breast cancer (BC) increased the pathological complete response (pCR) rate and that the addition of celecoxib in HER2-negative cases did not increase the pCR rate.We report here the long-term follow-up results for disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS).PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 2004 to 2007, 340 stage II-III BC patients were randomly assigned to receive neoadjuvant EC-T (four cycles of epirubicin-cyclophosphamide followed by four cycles of docetaxel) +/- celecoxib in HER2-negative cases (n = 220) and +/-trastuzumab in HER2-positive cases (n = 120).From September 2005, all patients with HER2-positive BC received adjuvant T (n = 106).RESULTS: Median follow-up was nearly 8 years (94.4 months, 20-127 m).In the HER2-negative subgroup, addition of celecoxib was not associated with a DFS benefit.Favourable factors were smaller tumour size, expression of progesterone receptor status (PgR) and pCR.In the HER2-positive population, neoadjuvant trastuzumab was not associated with a DFS benefit.Axillary pCR was the only prognostic factor associated with DFS in this group [HR = 0.44, 95% CI = 0.2-0.97], p = 0.035].To note, DFS and OS were significantly higher in the HER2-positive than in HER2-negative BC patients (HR = 0.58 [0.36-0.92], p = 0.021).CONCLUSION: Celecoxib combined with NAC provided neither pCR nor survival benefit in patients with HER2-negative BC.Absence of PgR is a major prognostic factor.Neoadjuvant trastuzumab increased pCR rates without translation into a DFS or OS benefit compared with adjuvant trastuzumab only.Axillary pCR could be a more relevant surrogate of survival than in the breast in HER2-positive population.A retrospective comparison shows that patients with HER2-positive tumours have a better outcome than HER2-negative BC patients showing the impact of trastuzumab on the natural history of BC.",1,1,1,1
27059593,"Advance care planning--a multi-centre cluster randomised clinical trial: the research protocol of the ACTION study.BACKGROUND: Awareness of preferences regarding medical care should be a central component of the care of patients with advanced cancer.Open communication can facilitate this but can occur in an ad hoc or variable manner.Advance care planning (ACP) is a formalized process of communication between patients, relatives and professional caregivers about patients' values and care preferences.It raises awareness of the need to anticipate possible future deterioration of health.ACP has the potential to improve current and future healthcare decision-making, provide patients with a sense of control, and improve their quality of life.METHODS/DESIGN: We will study the effects of the ACP program Respecting Choices on the quality of life of patients with advanced lung or colorectal cancer.In a phase III multicenter cluster randomised controlled trial, 22 hospitals in 6 countries will be randomised.In the intervention sites, patients will be offered interviews with a trained facilitator.In the control sites, patients will receive care as usual.In total, 1360 patients will be included.All participating patients will be asked to complete questionnaires at inclusion, and again after 2.5 and 4.5 months.If a patient dies within a year after inclusion, a relative will be asked to complete a questionnaire on end-of-life care.Use of medical care will be assessed by checking medical files.The primary endpoint is patients' quality of life at 2.5 months post-inclusion.Secondary endpoints are the extent to which care as received is aligned with patients' preferences, patients' evaluation of decision-making processes, quality of end-of-life care and cost-effectiveness of the intervention.A complementary qualitative study will be carried out to explore the lived experience of engagement with the Respecting Choices program from the perspectives of patients, their Personal Representatives, healthcare providers and facilitators.DISCUSSION: Transferring the concept of ACP from care of the elderly to patients with advanced cancer, who on average are younger and retain their mental capacity for a larger part of their disease trajectory, is an important next step in an era of increased focus on patient centered healthcare and shared decision-making.TRIAL REGISTRATION: International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number: ISRCTN63110516.Date of registration: 10/3/2014.",1,1,0,0
25091221,"Endometrial preparation protocol of the frozen-thawed embryo transfer in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome.PURPOSE: To assess which is the optimal protocol in terms of endometrial preparation prior to frozen-thawed embryo transfer (FET) in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and to explore the effect in stimulated cycle with the addition of vaginal 17-beta oestradiol.METHODS: Five hundred and seventy-six patients with PCOS were prepared for FET using artificial cycle induced with oestradiol and progesterone supplementation (n = 291) and stimulated cycle induced by human menopausal gonadotrophin (HMG) within or without the addition of vaginal 17-beta oestradiol (n = 285).Then the FET was performed in a receptive endometrium.RESULTS: Endometrial thickness was similar (9.03 +/- 1.65 vs. 9.12 +/- 1.58, P > 0.05) in artificial and stimulated cycle.The two protocols resulted in clinical pregnancy rate (41.0 % vs. 41.6 %, P > 0.05), ongoing pregnancy rate (36.6 % vs. 34.7 %, P > 0.05), live birth rate (30.0 % vs. 31.7 %, P > 0.05), which were not statistically different.Nevertheless, the cancelled cycle rate made a significant difference (2.2 % vs. 5.4 %, P < 0.05).There is no significant difference in the clinical pregnancy rate in HMG, HMG added with vaginal oestradiol and HMG switch to vaginal oestradiol group (42.6 %, 41.1 %, and 33.3 %, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: The mean endometrial thickness, clinical pregnancy rate, ongoing pregnancy rate, live birth rate and implantation rate were similar in artificial and stimulated cycle for endometrial preparation prior to FET in PCOS.It was fine to add vaginal 17-beta oestradiol to stimulated cycle when necessary.However, stimulated cycles had a significantly higher cancelled cycle rate.We should follow the principles of individualization, securitization and optimization in endometrial preparation of the FET in patients with PCOS.",1,0,0,0
25851492,"Comparison of efficacy and toxicity profiles between paclitaxel/lobapoatin- and cisplatin/5-fluorouracil-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy of advanced inoperable oesophageal cancer.BACKGROUND AND AIM: Current chemoradiotherapy doesn't usually effectively control oesophageal cancer progression.This study assessed the efficacy and toxicity profiles of paclitaxel/lobaplatin (TL)- and cisplatin/5-fluorouracil (PF)-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) in patients with advanced inoperable oesophageal cancer.METHODS: A total of such 68 patients was recruited and randomised to receive TL or PF-based CCRT.Radiotherapy was given at a total dose of 60-70 Gy over 6 weeks.In the TL group of patients, paclitaxel 60 mg/m(2) was administered intravenously on day 1, 8 and 15 and lobaplatin 30 mg/m(2) was administered on day 2 in two cycles at 3-week intervals.In the PF group, cisplatin 75 mg/m(2) was administered intravenously on day 1, and 5-fluorouracil 500 mg/m(2) and leucovorin 200 mg/m(2) were administered intravenously daily for 5 days in two cycles at 3-week intervals.Adverse events, treatment response and follow-up data were collected.RESULTS: The treatment response rates were 73.53% and 50.00% in the TL and PF groups respectively (P = 0.040).The median tumour progression-free survival (PFS) was 13.0 and 6.5 months in the TL and PF groups respectively (P = 0.034).Compared with PF group, the TL group demonstrated decreased grade 3/4 nausea and vomiting (5.88% vs 35.29%, P = 0.003), decreased granulocytopenia (11.76% vs 32.35%, P = 0.041) and platelet count reduction (32.5% vs 8.8%, P = 0.016).CONCLUSIONS: The TL treatment regimen demonstrated higher efficacy with less overall toxicity in patients with advanced inoperable oesophageal cancer compared with the PF regimen.Further study is warranted to validate our current observations.",1,1,1,0
27447966,"Better pathologic complete response and relapse-free survival after carboplatin plus paclitaxel compared with epirubicin plus paclitaxel as neoadjuvant chemotherapy for locally advanced triple-negative breast cancer: a randomized phase 2 trial.BACKGROUND: No standard chemotherapy is used as neoadjuvant therapy in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC).This study has compared carboplatin plus paclitaxel with commonly used epirubicin plus paclitaxel as neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in TNBC.RESULTS: 91 patients with a median age of 47 years (PC 47 patients, EP 44 patients) were enrolled.65% of the patients were premenopausal.While the objective response rate was similar in the PC and EP arm (89.4% vs. 79.5%, P = 0.195), the pCR rate in the PC arm was significantly higher (38.6% vs. 14.0%, P = 0.014).The median follow-up time was 55.0 months.5-year RFS were 77.6% and 56.2%, significantly higher in the PC arm, P = 0.043.No significant difference in OS was observed between the two arms (P = 0.350).Adverse events were similar, except for more thrombocytopenia in the PC arm (P = 0.001).METHODS: Patients with stage II/III TNBC were randomized to receive either paclitaxel (175 mg/m2, day1) plus carboplatin (Area Under the Curve = 5, day2) (PC) or epirubicin (75mg/m2, day1) plus paclitaxel (175 mg/m2, day2) (EP) as NAC every three weeks for 4-6 cycles.The primary endpoint was rate of pathologic complete response (pCR).The secondary endpoints included relapse-free survival (RFS), overall survival (OS) and safety.CONCLUSIONS: This study suggested that the addition of carboplatin to paclitaxel was superior to the regimen of epirubicin plus paclitaxel as NAC for TNBC in terms of improving pCR rate and RFS.Further phase 3 study has already started.",1,1,1,0

29846017,"Long-term prognostic impact of surgical complications in the German Rectal Cancer Trial CAO/ARO/AIO-94.BACKGROUND: The influence of postoperative complications on survival in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer undergoing combined modality treatment is debatable.This study evaluated the impact of surgical complications on oncological outcomes in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer treated within the randomized CAO/ARO/AIO-94 (Working Group of Surgical Oncology/Working Group of Radiation Oncology/Working Group of Medical Oncology of the Germany Cancer Society) trial.METHODS: Patients were assigned randomly to either preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) followed by total mesorectal excision (TME) or postoperative CRT between 1995 and 2002.Anastomotic leakage and wound healing disorders were evaluated prospectively, and their associations with overall survival, and distant metastasis and local recurrence rates after a long-term follow-up of more than 10 years were determined.Medical complications (such as cardiopulmonary events) were not analysed in this study.RESULTS: A total of 799 patients were included in the analysis.Patients who had anterior or intersphincteric resection had better 10-year overall survival than those treated with abdominoperineal resection (63.1 versus 51.3 per cent; P < 0.001).Anastomotic leakage was associated with worse 10-year overall survival (51 versus 65.2 per cent; P = 0.020).Overall survival was reduced in patients with impaired wound healing (45.7 versus 62.2 per cent; P = 0.009).At 10 years after treatment, patients developing any surgical complication (anastomotic leakage and/or wound healing disorder) had impaired overall survival (46.6 versus 63.8 per cent; P < 0.001), a lower distant metastasis-free survival rate (63.2 versus 72.0 per cent; P = 0.030) and more local recurrences (15.5 versus 6.4 per cent; P < 0.001).In a multivariable Cox regression model, lymph node metastases (P < 0.001) and surgical complications (P = 0.008)were the only independent predictors of reduced overall survival.CONCLUSION: Surgical complications were associated with adverse oncological outcomes in this trial.",1,1,0,0
25109850,"Effects of priming with recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor on conditioning regimen for high-risk acute myeloid leukemia patients undergoing human leukocyte antigen-haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: a multicenter randomized controlled study in southwest China.HLA-haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (haplo-HSCT) is an effective and immediate treatment for high-risk acute myeloid leukemia (HR-AML) patients lacking matched donors.Relapse remains the leading cause of death for HR-AML patients after haplo-HSCT.Accordingly, the prevention of relapse remains a challenge in the treatment of HR-AML.In a multicenter randomized controlled trial in southwestern China, 178 HR-AML patients received haplo-HSCT with conditioning regimens involving recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) or non-rhG-CSF.The cumulative incidences of relapse and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), 2-year leukemia-free survival (LFS), and overall survival (OS) were evaluated.HR-AML patients who underwent the priming conditioning regimen with rhG-CSF had a lower relapse rate than those who were treated with non-rhG-CSF (38.2%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 28.1% to 48.3% versus 60.7%, 95% CI, 50.5% to 70.8%; P < .01).The cumulative incidences of acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, transplantation-related toxicity, and infectious complications appeared to be equivalent.In total, 53 patients in the rhG-CSF-priming group and 31 patients in the non-rhG-CSF-priming group were still alive at the median follow-up time of 42 months (range, 24 to 80 months).The 2-year probabilities of LFS and OS in the rhG-CSF-priming and non-rhG-CSF-priming groups were 55.1% (95% CI, 44.7% to 65.4%) versus 32.6% (95% CI, 22.8% to 42.3%) (P < .01) and 59.6% (95% CI, 49.4% to 69.7%) versus 34.8% (95% CI, 24.9% to 44.7%) (P < .01), respectively.Multivariate analyses indicated that the 2-year probability of LFS of patients who achieved complete remission (CR) before transplantation was better than that of patients who did not achieve CR.The 2-year probability of LFS of patients with no M4/M5/M6 subtype was better than that of patients with the M4/M5/M6 subtype in the G-CSF-priming group (67.4%; 95% CI, 53.8% to 80.9% versus 41.9%; 95% CI, 27.1% to 56.6%; P < .05).This study suggests that the rhG-CSF-priming conditioning regimen is an acceptable choice for HR-AML patients, especially for the patients with no M4/M5/M6 subtype who achieved CR before transplantation.",1,1,1,0

31401675,"High-intensity interval training can modulate the systemic inflammation and HSP70 in the breast cancer: a randomized control trial.OBJECTIVE: Exercise training is recently considered as a trend in adjuvant therapies for cancer patients, but its mechanisms need to be scrutinized further.This study is aimed to test the hypothesis that the patients who perform the high-intensity interval exercise training (HIIT) during hormone therapy would show improvements in low-grade inflammation and HSP70 compared to the controls receiving standard care.METHODS: Fifty two non-metastatic and hormone-responsive breast cancer patients were randomly assigned to high-intensity interval exercise (HIIT) (n = 26) and usual care (n = 26) groups.The HIIT groups participated in a high-intensity interval training protocol on a treadmill 3 days/week for 12 weeks.The training intensity was determined according to the predicted maximal heart rate.Demographic characteristics and medical history were collected via an interviewer-administered questionnaire at the baseline visit.Body fat was estimated based on skinfold thickness measured with calipers on the participant's nonsurgery side at the triceps, suprailiac crest.[Formula: see text] was estimated by 1-Mile Rockport Walk Test.Blood samples were collected 48 h before starting the exercise protocol and 48 h after the last exercise session.TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1beta, IL-10, and HSP70 levels in serum were measured using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method according to the manufacture's instruction.Supernatant cytokine concentrations were determined by ELISA for IL-4 and IFN-gamma.The data were analyzed by ANCOVA test that the pretest values were considered as covariate at P </= 0.05.RESULTS: HIIT improved [Formula: see text] in the HIIT group compared to the usual care group (P = 0.002).The serum levels of TNF-alpha (P = 0.001), IL-6 (P = 0.007), and IL-10 (P = 0.001) were lower in the HIIT group.The level of IL-4 (P = 0.050) in the stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells significantly increased in the HIIT group compared to the usual care group.Furthermore, the serum level of the HSP70 was significantly higher in the HIIT group in comparison to the usual care group (P = 0.050).The TNF-alpha/IL-10 (P = 0.050) and IL-6/IL-10 (P = 0.042) ratios were lower in the HIIT group.CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicated that HIIT has positive impacts on the cardiorespiratory fitness and inflammatory cytokines in the breast cancer patients undergoing hormone therapy.",1,1,0,0
26169621,"BREATH: Web-Based Self-Management for Psychological Adjustment After Primary Breast Cancer--Results of a Multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial.PURPOSE: Early breast cancer survivors (BCSs) report high unmet care needs, and easily accessible care is not routinely available for this growing population.The Breast Cancer E-Health (BREATH) trial is a Web-based self-management intervention to support the psychological adjustment of women after primary treatment, by reducing distress and improving empowerment.PATIENTS AND METHODS: This multicenter, randomized, controlled, parallel-group trial evaluated whether care as usual (CAU) plus BREATH is superior to CAU alone.BREATH is delivered in sixteen fully automated weekly modules covering early survivorship issues.Two to 4 months post-treatment, BCSs were randomly assigned to receive CAU + BREATH (n = 70) or CAU alone (n = 80) using a stratified block design (ratio 1:1).Primary outcomes were distress (Symptom Checklist-90) and empowerment (Cancer Empowerment Questionnaire), assessed before random assignment (baseline, T0) and after 4 (T1), 6 (T2), and 10 months (T3) of follow-up.Statistical (analysis of covariance) and clinical effects (reliable change index) were tested in an intention-to-treat analysis (T0 to T1).Follow-up effects (T0 to T3) were assessed in assessment completers.RESULTS: CAU + BREATH participants reported significantly less distress than CAU-alone participants (-7.79; 95% CI, -14.31 to -1.27; P = .02) with a small-to-medium effect size (d = 0.33), but empowerment was not affected (-1.71; 95% CI, 5.20 to -1.79; P = .34).More CAU + BREATH participants (39 of 70 [56%]; 95% CI, 44.1 to 66.8) than CAU-alone participants (32 of 80 [40%]; 95% CI, 30.0 to 51.0) showed clinically significant improvement (P = .03).This clinical effect was most prominent in low-distress BCSs.Secondary outcomes confirmed primary outcomes.There were no between-group differences in primary outcomes during follow-up.CONCLUSION: Access to BREATH reduced distress among BCSs, but this effect was not sustained during follow-up.",1,1,0,0
31676895,"Association between time interval from neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy to surgery and complete histological tumor response in esophageal and gastroesophageal junction cancer: a national cohort study.The optimal time interval from neoadjuvant therapy to surgery in the treatment of esophageal cancer is not known.The aim of this study was to investigate if a prolonged interval between completed neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and surgery was associated with improved histological response rates and survival in a population-based national register cohort.The population-based cohort study included patients treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and esophagectomy due to cancer in the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction.Patients were divided into two groups based on the median time from completed neoadjuvant treatment to surgery.The primary outcome was complete histological response.Secondary outcomes were lymph node tumor response, postoperative complications, R0 resection rate, 90-day mortality, and overall survival.In total, 643 patients were included, 344 (54%) patients underwent surgery within 49 days, and 299 (47%) after 50 days or longer.The groups were similar concerning baseline characteristics except for a higher clinical tumor stage (P = 0.009) in the prolonged time to surgery group.There were no significant differences in complete histological response, R0 resection rate, postoperative complications, 90-day mortality, or overall survival.Adjusted odds ratio for ypT0 in the prolonged time to surgery group was 0.99 (95% confidence interval: 0.64-1.53).Complete histological response in the primary tumor (ypT0) was associated with significantly higher overall survival: adjusted hazard ratio: 0.55 (95% CI 0.41-0.76).If lymph node metastases were present in these patients, the survival was, however, significantly lower: adjusted hazard ratio for ypT0N1: 2.30 (95% CI 1.21-4.35).In this prospectively collected, nationwide cohort study of esophageal and junctional type 1 and 2 cancer patients, there were no associations between time to surgery and histological complete response, postoperative outcomes, or overall survival.The results suggest that it is safe for patients to postpone surgery at least 7 to 10 weeks after completed chemoradiotherapy, but no evidence was seen in favor of recommending a prolonged time to surgery after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for esophageal cancer.A definitive answer to this question requires a randomized controlled trial of standard vs. prolonged time to surgery.",0,0,0,0
22851563,"IGH@ translocations, CRLF2 deregulation, and microdeletions in adolescents and adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.PURPOSE: To determine the prevalence and prognostic impact of significant acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) -related genes: CRLF2 deregulation (CRLF2-d), IGH@ translocations (IGH@-t), and deletions of CDKN2A/B, IKZF1, PAX5, ETV6, RB1, BTG1, and EBF1 in adolescents and adults.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The cohort comprised 454 patients (age 15 to 60 years old) treated on the multicenter United Kingdom Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia Trial XII/Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 2993 trial (UKALLXII/ECOG2993) with Philadelphia-negative B-cell precursor ALL.Fluorescent in situ hybridization and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification were used to detect these genetic alterations.RESULTS: Twenty patients (5%) had CRLF2-d (P2RY8-CRLF2, n = 7; IGH@-CRLF2, n = 13), and 36 patients (8%) harbored an IGH@-t with a different partner gene.There was little overlap between IGH@-t, CRLF2-d, and established chromosomal abnormalities.Deletions of CDKN2A/B, IKZF1, PAX5, ETV6, RB1, BTG1, or EBF1 were prevalent with 101 (33%) of 304 patients harboring one and 102 (33%) harboring two or more alterations, occurring with varying frequency in all cytogenetic subgroups.The 5-year event-free survival, relapse-free survival (RFS), and overall survival (OS) rates for the whole cohort were 40%, 55%, and 43%, respectively.Patients with CRLF2-d, IGH@-t, and IKZF1 deletions were associated with an inferior outcome in univariate but not multivariate analysis.In particular, CRLF2-d patients had a lower RFS compared with other patients (30%), whereas those with IGH@-t or IKZF1 deletions had a lower OS (27% and 35%, respectively).CONCLUSION: CRLF2-d and IGH@-t represent distinct subtypes of adolescent and adult ALL.Deletions of key B-cell differentiation and cell cycle control genes are highly prevalent but vary in frequency by cytogenetic subgroup.CRLF2-d, IGH@-t, and IKZF1 deletions are associated with poor outcome in adolescent and adult ALL.",0,0,0,0

21816640,"A non-comparative randomized phase II study of 2 doses of ATN-224, a copper/zinc superoxide dismutase inhibitor, in patients with biochemically recurrent hormone-naive prostate cancer.OBJECTIVE: ATN-224 (choline tetrathiomolybdate) is an oral Cu(2+)/Zn(2+)-superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) inhibitor with preclinical antitumor activity.We hypothesized that ATN-224 may induce antitumor effects as an antiangiogenic agent at low dose-levels while possessing direct antitumor activity at higher dose-levels.The objective of this study was to screen its clinical activity in patients with biochemically recurrent hormone-naive prostate cancer.METHODS: Biochemically-recurrent prostate cancer patients with prostate specific antigen doubling times (PSADT) < 12 months, no radiographic evidence of metastasis, and no hormonal therapy within 6 months (with serum testosterone levels > 150 ng/dl) were eligible.ATN-224 was administered at 2 dose-levels, 300 mg (n = 23) or 30 mg (n = 24) daily, by way of randomization.PSA progression was defined as a >/= 50% increase (and >5 ng/ml) in PSA from baseline or post-treatment nadir.Endpoints included the proportion of patients who were free of PSA progression at 24 weeks, changes in PSA slope/PSADT, and safety.The study was not powered to detect differences between the 2 treatment groups.RESULTS: At 24 weeks, 59% (95% CI 33%-82%) of men in the low-dose arm and 45% (95% CI 17%-77%) in the high-dose arm were PSA progression-free.Median PSA progression-free survival was 30 weeks (95% CI 21-40(+)) and 26 weeks (95% CI 24-39(+)) in the low-dose and high-dose groups, respectively.Pre- and on-treatment PSA kinetics analyses showed a significant mean PSA slope decrease (P = 0.006) and a significant mean PSADT increase (P = 0.032) in the low-dose arm only.Serum ceruloplasmin levels, a biomarker for ATN-224 activity, were lowered in the high-dose group, but did not correlate with PSA changes.CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose ATN-224 (30 mg daily) may have biologic activity in men with biochemically-recurrent prostate cancer, as suggested by an improvement in PSA kinetics.However, the clinical significance of PSA kinetics changes in this patient population remains uncertain.The absence of a dose-response effect also reduces enthusiasm, and there are currently no plans to further develop this agent in prostate cancer.",1,1,1,0
23964657,"Lean body mass and muscle function in head and neck cancer patients and healthy individuals--results from the DAHANCA 25 study.INTRODUCTION: Loss of lean body mass is common following radiotherapy in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and may reduce maximal muscle strength and functional performance.However, the associations between lean body mass, muscle strength and functional performance are unclear and no studies in HNSCC patients have compared the levels of these variables to the levels seen in healthy individuals.PURPOSE: The purpose of the present study was to investigate the associations between lean body mass, maximal muscle strength and functional performance in HNSCC patients and to compare the levels of these variables after radiotherapy and after progressive resistance training with the levels in healthy individuals.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Lean body mass (dual energy X-ray absorptiometry), maximal muscle strength (isokinetic dynamometry) and functional performance (10 m max gait speed, 30 s chair rise, 30 s arm curl, stair climb) from HNSCC patients from the DAHANCA 25 trials and data from 24 healthy individuals were included.RESULTS: Lean body mass and maximal muscle strength were significantly associated according to the gender and age-adjusted linear regression model (p < 0.0001).In addition, maximal muscle strength were associated with 30 s arm curl performance, 10 m max gait speed and 30 s chair rise (p < 0.0001).Multiple regression analyses showed that HNSCC patients expressed significant lower levels of the investigated variables after radiotherapy than healthy individuals (p < 0.0001), and that all differences were evened out after training.CONCLUSIONS: Significant associations were found between lean body mass, maximal muscle strength and functional performance in HNSCC patients.Patients expressed lower levels of these variables compared with healthy individuals, suggesting that lean body mass is a clinically relevant health factor in HNSCC patients.",0,0,0,0

Results of a three-year multicenter prospective randomized trial.BACKGROUND: The aim of the present trial on ultrasound (US)-guided laser ablation therapy (LAT) of solid thyroid nodules is to assess long-term clinical efficacy, side effects, and predictability of outcomes in different centers operating with the same procedure.PATIENTS: Two hundred consecutive patients were randomly assigned to a single LAT session (group 1, 101 cases) or to follow-up (group 2, 99 cases) at four thyroid referral centers.Entry criteria were: solid thyroid nodule with volume of 6-17 mL, repeat benign cytological findings, normal thyroid function, no autoimmunity, and no thyroid gland treatment.METHODS: Group 1: LAT was performed in a single session with two optical fibers, a 1064 nm Nd-YAG laser source, and an output power of 3 W. Volume and local symptom changes were evaluated 1, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months after LAT.Side effects and tolerability of treatment were registered.Group 2: Follow-up with no treatment.RESULTS: One patient was lost to follow-up in each group.Group 1: Volume decrease after LAT was -49 +/- 22%, -59 +/- 22%, -60 +/- 24%, and -57 +/- 25% at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months, respectively (P < .001 vs baseline).LAT resulted in a nodule reduction of >50% in 67.3% of cases (P < .001).Local symptoms decreased from 38 to 8% of cases (P = .002) and cosmetic signs from 72 to 16% of cases (P = .001).Baseline size, presence of goiter (P = .55), or US findings (fluid component </= 20% [P = .84], halo [P = .46], vascularization [P = .98], and calcifications [P = .06]) were not predictive factors of a volume decrease > 50%.The procedure was well tolerated in most (92%) cases.No changes in thyroid function or autoimmunity were observed.In group 2, nodule volume increased at 36 months (25 +/- 42%; P = .04).The efficacy and tolerability of the procedure were similar in different centers.CONCLUSIONS: A single LAT treatment of solid nodules results in significant and persistent volume reduction and local symptom improvement, in the absence of thyroid function changes.",1,0,0,0

Dose-escalated IMRT did not reduce LRP with an adjusted HR of 1.13 [95%CI = 0.64-1.98] (p = 0.68).Survival was not different (adjusted HR: 1.19 [95%CI = 0.78-1.81], p = 0.42).No interaction between p16 and treatment effect was found.CONCLUSION: Dose-escalated IMRT did not improve LRC in LA-HNSCC patients treated with concomitant CRT over standard 3D-RT.This trial reinforces the evidence showing IMRT reduces xerostomia in LA-HNSCC treated with radiotherapy.Clinicaltrial.gov: NCT00158678.",1,1,1,0
32930387,"Nintedanib plus mFOLFOX6 as second-line treatment of metastatic, chemorefractory colorectal cancer: The randomised, placebo-controlled, phase II TRICC-C study (AIO-KRK-0111).Nintedanib is a triple angiokinase inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1-3, fibroblast growth factor receptor 1-3 and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-a/-b.Thereby, it targets angiogenic escape mechanisms.The trial TyRosine kinase Inhibitor for the treatment of Chemorefractory Colorectal Cancer (TRICC-C) trial evaluates the addition of nintedanib to mFOLFOX6 (fluorouracil, folinic acid and oxaliplatin) in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).TRICC-C is a randomised controlled, double-blinded, phase II trial in mCRC patients that received a first-line non-oxaliplatin containing chemotherapy.Patients received mFOLFOX6 + nintedanib (F + N) (2 x 200 mg p.o./d, d1-d14) or mFOLFOX6 + placebo (F + P), in a 1:1 ratio.Primary endpoint was median progression free survival (mPFS) and secondary overall response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS) and safety.Fifty-three patients (27 F + N; 26 F + P) were randomised between 12/2012 and 5/2016 (scheduled n = 180).The trial was terminated prematurely due to slow accrual.The trial did not reach its primary endpoint but mPFS, median overall survival (mOS) and disease control rate (DCR) were numerically higher in the F + N arm compared to the F + P arm; however, the difference was not significant (mPFS: F + P: 4.6 months vs F + N: 8.1 months; HR 0.65; 95% CI 0.32-1.30; P = .2156; mOS: F + P: 9.9 months vs F + N: 17.1 months; HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.48-2.23; P = .9387; DCR: F + P: 50% vs F + N: 66,7%; P = .2709).Toxicity was moderate and only different for neutropenia (F + P: 11.5%, F + N: 19.2%) and gastrointestinal disorders (F + P: 65.4%, F + N: 84.6%).Final results show safety and a nonsignificant trend towards improved PFS and DCR for the combination of mFOLFOX6 + nintedanib in the second-line therapy of mCRC.",1,1,1,0
31111509,"Parts greater than their sum: randomized controlled trial testing partitioned incentives to increase cancer screening.Promoting healthy behavior is a challenge for public health officials, especially in the context of asking patients to participate in preventive cancer screenings.Small financial incentives are sometimes used, but there is a little scientific basis to support a compelling description of the best-practice implementation of such incentives.We present a simple behavioral strategy based on mental accounting from prospect theory that maximizes the impact of incentives with no additional cost.We show how the partition of one incentive into two smaller incentives of equivalent total amount produces substantial behavioral changes, demonstrated in the context of colorectal cancer screening.In a randomized controlled trial, eligible patients aged 50-74 (n = 1652 patients) were allocated to receive either one euro10 incentive (upon completion of screening) or two euro5 incentives (at the beginning and at the end of screening).We show that cancer screening rates were dramatically increased by partitioning the financial incentive (61.1%), compared with a single installment at the end (41.4%).These results support the hedonic editing hypothesis from prospect theory, and underline the importance of implementing theoretically grounded healthcare interventions.Our results suggest that, when patient incentives are feasible, healthcare procedures should be framed as multistage events with smaller incentives offered at multiple points in time.",0,0,0,0

32387140,"Religious Coping in Cancer: A Quantitative Analysis of Expressive Writing Samples From Patients With Renal Cell Carcinoma.CONTEXT: Past religiosity/spirituality (R/S) research has mainly relied on self-report instruments, which may result in self-presentation and defensive biases.OBJECTIVES: To address these limitations, we reviewed the writing samples that were generated as part of an expressive writing (EW) trial, coded the samples for R/S content, and examined cross-sectional and prospective associations between R/S content and symptom and psychosocial outcomes.METHODS: Participants diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma who were randomized to the EW arm completed a standard writing protocol.Before randomization, they completed validated measures of R/S, depressive symptoms, social support, fatigue, and sleep disturbances and one, four, and 10 months after completing the intervention.Writing samples were coded for positive and negative religious coping (RC), and personal (e.g., private prayer) and collective (e.g., church attendance) religious engagement (RE).RESULTS: Of the 138 patients, 117 provided at least one writing sample, and 89% of participants made at least one R/S reference with 70% including at least one positive RC statement, and 45.3% revealed personal and 42.3% collective RE.Negative RC was rare (8%).Although positive RC and RE were significantly associated with the R/S Index (P < 0.01), negative RC was not.In prospective analyses, RE was associated with reduced cancer-related symptoms over time (P = 0.04), and negative RC was associated with increased psychological distress over time (P = 0.004).CONCLUSION: Behavioral coding of EW samples supported the literature suggesting that positive RC is common among patients with cancer.Although negative RC may be relatively rare, it may be associated with psychological distress.",0,0,0,0
25649903,"Laparoscopic surgery contributes more to nutritional and immunologic recovery than fast-track care in colorectal cancer.BACKGROUND: Many clinical trials had repeatedly shown that fast-track perioperative care and laparoscopic surgery are both preferred in the treatment of colorectal cancer.But few studies were designed to explore the diverse biochemical impacts of the two counterparts on human immunologic and nutritional status.METHODS: Ninety-two cases of colorectal cancer patients meeting the inclusion criteria were randomized to four groups: laparoscopy with fast-track treatment (LAFT); open surgery with fast-track treatment (OSFT); laparoscopy with conventional treatment (LAC); open surgery with conventional treatment (OSC).Peripheral blood tests including nutritional factors (albumin, prealbumin, and transferrin), humoral immunologic factors (IgG, IgM, and IgA), and cellular immunologic factors (T and NK cells) were evaluated.Blood samples were collected preoperatively (baseline) and 12 and 96 h after surgery (indicated as POH12 and POH96, respectively).RESULTS: Albumin, transferrin, prealbumin, and IgG levels were the highest in the LAFT group for both POH12 and POH96 time intervals.Repeated measures (two-way ANOVA) indicated that the difference of albumin, transferrin, and IgG level were attributed to surgery type (P < 0.05) and not perioperative treatment (P > 0.05).Only in the laparoscopy-included groups, the relative albumin and IgG levels of POH96 were obviously higher than that of POH12.CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic surgery accelerated postoperative nutrition and immune levels rising again while fast-track treatment retarded the drop of postoperative nutrition and immune levels.Laparoscopic surgery might play a more important role than fast-track treatment in the earlier postoperative recovery of nutritional and immunologic status.Combined laparoscopic surgery with fast-track treatment provided best postoperative recovery of nutrition and immune status.These results should be further compared with the clinical outcomes of our FTMDT trial (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01080547).",1,1,0,0
