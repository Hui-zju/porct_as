28687482,"Treatment Rationale and Design for J-SONIC: A Randomized Study of Carboplatin Plus Nab-paclitaxel With or Without Nintedanib for Advanced Non-Small-cell Lung Cancer With Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis.We describe the treatment rationale and procedure for a randomized study (J-SONIC; University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trials Registry identification no., UMIN000026799) of carboplatin plus nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) with or without nintedanib for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).The study was designed to examine the efficacy and safety of nintedanib administered with carboplatin plus nab-paclitaxel versus carboplatin plus nab-paclitaxel alone in chemotherapy-naive patients with advanced NSCLC associated with IPF.Eligible patients (enrollment target, n = 170) will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive 4 cycles of carboplatin (area under the curve, 6 on day 1) plus nab-paclitaxel (100 mg/m(2) on days 1, 8, and 15) administered every 3 weeks either without (arm A) or with (arm B) nintedanib (150 mg twice daily), to be followed in arm B by single-agent administration of nintedanib (150 mg twice daily).The present trial is the first randomized controlled study for the treatment of NSCLC associated with IPF.The goal of the study is to demonstrate that nintedanib combined with carboplatin plus nab-paclitaxel prolongs the interval to acute exacerbation of IPF compared with carboplatin plus nab-paclitaxel alone.",0,0,0,0
28459941,"German Adjuvant Intergroup Node-positive Study (GAIN): a phase III trial comparing two dose-dense regimens (iddEPC versus ddEC-PwX) in high-risk early breast cancer patients.BACKGROUND: Dose-dense (dd) regimens are one of the preferred options for the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer patients with intermediate to high risk.The German Adjuvant Intergroup Node-positive trial aimed at optimizing intense dd (idd) strategies by evaluating drug combinations and the addition of capecitabine.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Women (aged 18 years and biologically <65 years) with histologically involved axillary lymph nodes were randomly assigned to receive three courses each of epirubicin (E) 150 mg/m2, paclitaxel (P) 225 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide (C) 2500 mg/m2 (reduced to 2000 mg/m2 after recruitment of 1200 patients) q2w intravenously (i.v.) (iddEPC-regimen) or ddEC (E 112.5 mg/m2 + C 600 mg/m2, i.v.q2w for 4 cycles) followed by paclitaxel weekly (Pw 67.5 mg/m2 i.v.q8d for 10 weeks) plus capecitabine (X 2000 mg/m2 p.o.days 1-14, q22 for 4 cycles) (ddEC-PwX-regimen).Further randomization assigned patients to ibandronate for 2 years versus observation and to pegfilgrastim day 2 versus 4.RESULTS: From June 2004 to August 2008, 2994 patients were randomized to either iddEPC (N = 1498), or ddEC-PwX (N = 1496) and started treatment.Median age was 50 years; pN1 (37.8%), pN2 (35.3%); pN3 (26.9%); 46.4% were G3 tumors; 76.9% hormone receptor-positive and 22% HER2-positive.After a median follow-up of 74 months, 645 events and 383 deaths were recorded.Hematological adverse events grades 3-4 were more common with iddEPC (P < 0.001), nonhematological with ddEC-PwX (P = 0.04), even if the toxicity profile of the two regimens was different.At 5 years, estimated disease-free survival rates for ddEC-PwX and iddEPC were 81.7% [95% confidence interval (CI) 79.5-83.6] versus 80.2% (95% CI 78.0-82.2).Hazard ratio (HR)=0.95 (95% CI 0.81-1.11, log-rank P = 0.49).Five-year overall survival rates were 89.4% for ddEC-PwX (95% CI 87.7-91.0) and 89.0% for iddEPC (95% CI 87.2-90.6), HR = 0.85 (95% CI 0.69-1.04, log-rank P = 0.10).CONCLUSION: Adding capecitabine to ddEC-Pw did not improve outcome in comparison to iddEPC but increased toxicity and should not be recommended for further use.",1,1,1,0
32036471,"Cryotherapy for the prevention of weekly paclitaxel-induced peripheral adverse events in breast cancer patients.PURPOSE: This randomized phase II study was conducted to investigate the efficacy of cryotherapy in preventing peripheral neuropathy and dermatological adverse events in breast cancer patients treated with weekly paclitaxel.METHODS: Patients treated with 12 weekly doses of paclitaxel for breast cancer were randomized (1:1) into a cryotherapy or control group.The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients with a marked decrease in the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Neurotoxicity (FACT-NTX) score.The secondary endpoints were Patient Neurotoxicity Questionnaire (PNQ), Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event (CTCAE) for peripheral neuropathy, and FACT-Taxane score.RESULTS: Forty-four patients were randomly assigned to the cryotherapy (n = 22) or control groups (n = 22).The percentage of patients with a marked decrease in FACT-NTX scores was significantly lower in the cryotherapy group than in the control group (41 vs. 73%, p = 0.03).The incidence of CTCAE grade >/= 2 sensory (p = 0.001) and motor peripheral neuropathy (p = 0.01), and PNQ grade D or higher for sensory peripheral neuropathy (p = 0.02), and decrease in the FACT-Taxane score (p = 0.02) were also significantly lower in the cryotherapy group than in the control group.There were no serious side effects associated with cryotherapy.CONCLUSION: Cryotherapy is an effective approach for prevention of peripheral neuropathy and dermatological adverse events in breast cancer patients treated with weekly paclitaxel.",1,1,0,0
34768161,"A randomized, phase II trial of adjuvant immunotherapy with durable TKI-free survival in patients with chronic phase CML.PURPOSE: Chronic myeloid leukemia (CP-CML) patients can achieve undetectable minimal residual disease (UMRD) and discontinue tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).Cellular immunity plays an important role in CML disease control.We conducted a randomized, non-blinded phase II trial of adjuvant immunotherapy with TKIs to facilitate TKI discontinuation.METHODS: TKI-treated patients with CP-CML were randomized to receive the K562/GM-CSF vaccine (vaccine) OR Interferon-alpha + Sargramostim (IFN).If UMRD was achieved, then all treatment was stopped.Patients who did not achieve UMRD within one year, had a molecular relapse, or discontinued therapy for toxicity could crossover.RESULTS: Thirty-four patients were randomized to IFN (n = 18) or vaccine (n = 16), and 21 patients crossed over (IFNvaccine: n = 9, vaccineIFN, n = 12).TKIs at enrollment included imatinib (n = 31), nilotinib (n = 2), and dasatinib (n = 1).No patients discontinued vaccine due to side effects, while 33 % of IFN-treated patients discontinued treatment.More patients randomized to IFN (47.4 %, 95 % CI: 16.7-66.7 %) versus vaccine (25.0 %, 95 % CI: 0.5-43.5 %) achieved UMRD within one year.Seven patients randomized to IFN discontinued treatment with 28.6 % (95 % CI: 8.9-92.2 %) sustaining treatment-free remission (TFR) at 1 year, while three patients randomized to vaccine discontinued treatment with none sustaining TFR.Including crossover, there was a cumulative discontinuation success rate of 36.4 % (95 % CI: 16.6 %-79.5 %) after adjuvant IFN.Patients who sustained TFR received a median of 29 months of imatinib prior to discontinuation.CONCLUSION: Adjuvant IFN led to durable TFRs with limited prior TKI exposure with comparable success to prior discontinuation trials, but many patients stopped IFN early.",1,1,1,0
27603346,"S-1 plus cisplatin with concurrent radiotherapy versus cisplatin alone with concurrent radiotherapy in Chinese patients with nonsmall-cell lung cancer: A multicentre randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of S-1 plus cisplatin combined with concurrent radiotherapy (SCCCR) versus cisplatin alone combined with concurrent radiotherapy (CCCR) in Chinese patients with unresectable stage III nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).METHODS: Between January 2012 and December 2014, 72 eligible Chinese patients with NSCLC were included and randomly divided into 2 groups, each having 36 patients.Patients in the SCCCR group received S-1 plus cisplatin with concurrent, radiotherapy.The other 36 patients in the CCCR group were administered cisplatin with concurrent radiotherapy.The primary outcome was the overall response rate.The secondary outcomes were overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and adverse events.RESULTS: The 3-year overall response rates for the SCCCR and CCCR groups were 60.1% and 53.3%, respectively (P = 0.041).The median OS was 35.1 (range, 6.5-47.2) months and 24.6 (range, 2.8-24.3) months for the SCCCR and CCCR groups, respectively (P = 0.016).The median PFS for the SCCCR and CCCR groups was 31.4 (range, 5.6-39.3) months and 22.3 (range, 2.4-36.5) months, respectively (P = 0.023).The toxicity profiles were similar for both groups.CONCLUSION: The efficacy and safety of SCCCR was more encouraging compared to those of CCCR in Chinese NSCLC patients.In addition, the toxicities in both groups were tolerable.",1,1,1,0
34759002,"Exercise versus usual care after non-reconstructive breast cancer surgery (UK PROSPER): multicentre randomised controlled trial and economic evaluation.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether a structured exercise programme improved functional and health related quality of life outcomes compared with usual care for women at high risk of upper limb disability after breast cancer surgery.DESIGN: Multicentre, pragmatic, superiority, randomised controlled trial with economic evaluation.SETTING: 17 UK National Health Service cancer centres.PARTICIPANTS: 392 women undergoing breast cancer surgery, at risk of postoperative upper limb morbidity, randomised (1:1) to usual care with structured exercise (n=196) or usual care alone (n=196).INTERVENTIONS: Usual care (information leaflets) only or usual care plus a physiotherapy led exercise programme, incorporating stretching, strengthening, physical activity, and behavioural change techniques to support adherence to exercise, introduced at 7-10 days postoperatively, with two further appointments at one and three months.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Disability of Arm, Hand and Shoulder (DASH) questionnaire at 12 months, analysed by intention to treat.Secondary outcomes included DASH subscales, pain, complications, health related quality of life, and resource use, from a health and personal social services perspective.RESULTS: Between 26 January 2016 and 31 July 2017, 951 patients were screened and 392 (mean age 58.1 years) were randomly allocated, with 382 (97%) eligible for intention to treat analysis.181 (95%) of 191 participants allocated to exercise attended at least one appointment.Upper limb function improved after exercise compared with usual care (mean DASH 16.3 (SD 17.6) for exercise (n=132); 23.7 (22.9) usual care (n=138); adjusted mean difference 7.81, 95% confidence interval 3.17 to 12.44; P=0.001).Secondary outcomes favoured exercise over usual care, with lower pain intensity at 12 months (adjusted mean difference on numerical rating scale -0.68, -1.23 to -0.12; P=0.02) and fewer arm disability symptoms at 12 months (adjusted mean difference on Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast+4 (FACT-B+4) -2.02, -3.11 to -0.93; P=0.001).No increase in complications, lymphoedema, or adverse events was noted in participants allocated to exercise.Exercise accrued lower costs per patient (on average - pound387 (euro457; $533) (95% confidence interval - pound2491 to pound1718; 2015 pricing) and was cost effective compared with usual care.CONCLUSIONS: The PROSPER exercise programme was clinically effective and cost effective and reduced upper limb disability one year after breast cancer treatment in patients at risk of treatment related postoperative complications.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN Registry ISRCTN35358984.",1,1,0,0
24613543,"Nimotuzumab provides survival benefit to patients with inoperable advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck: a randomized, open-label, phase IIb, 5-year study in Indian patients.OBJECTIVE: Overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in many cancers makes it an attractive therapeutic target.This study evaluated the clinical utility of nimotuzumab, a monoclonal anti-EGFR antibody, used concurrently with radiotherapy (RT) and chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN).METHODS: This open-label study randomized 92 treatment-naive patients (1:1) with advanced SCCHN into chemoradiation (CRT +/- nimotuzumab) or radiation (RT +/- nimotuzumab) group by investigator's discretion; these were further randomized into CRT + nimotuzumab or CRT and RT + nimotuzumab or RT groups, respectively.Treatment included 6 cycles each of cisplatin (50 mg/week), nimotuzumab (200 mg/week), and RT (total dose, 60-66 Gy).Response (tumor size reduction) was assessed at Month 6 post-treatment and survival, at Month 60.RESULTS: Forty and 36 patients in the chemoradiation and radiation groups, respectively (intent-to-treat population) were evaluated.Overall response at Month 6 post-treatment was 100% with CRT + nimotuzumab, 70% with CRT, 76% with RT + nimotuzumab, and 37% with RT.At Month 60, overall survival was 57% with CRT + nimotuzumab, 26% with CRT (P = 0.03), 39% with RT + nimotuzumab, and 26% with RT (P > 0.05).Median overall survival was not reached for CRT + nimotuzumab; it was 21.94 months for CRT (P = 0.0078), 14.36 months for RT + nimotuzumab, and 12.78 months for RT (P = 0.45).Risk of death was 64% lower with CRT + nimotuzumab than with CRT (95%CI: 0.37, 1.56), and 24% lower with RT + nimotuzumab than with RT (95%CI: 0.16, 0.79).Thus nimotuzumab was safe and well tolerated with few mild to moderate self-limiting adverse events.CONCLUSION: Concurrent use of nimotuzumab with CRT/RT is safe and provides long-term survival benefit.",1,1,1,0

31567943,"Effect of physical fitness on colorectal tumor development in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis.Although accumulated epidemiological evidence indicates that a good physical fitness level may prevent the development of sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC), few studies have examined the effect of physical fitness level on familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP).This cross-sectional study aimed to examine the relationship between physical fitness and CRC development in patients with FAP.A total of 119 patients (54 male; 65 female) with FAP, aged 17 to 73 years, underwent a step test to induce exercise stress.Predicted maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) was calculated for each patient by using heart rate as an index of physical fitness.The association of VO2max with the presence or absence of CRC and polyp diameter was examined.Patients with FAP were divided into 3 categories according to their VO2max (high, medium, and low).The association between maximum polyp size and VO2max among the patients with FAP without a history of colectomy was examined.The risk of CRC was significantly higher in the low VO2max group than in the high VO2max group (odds ratio = 4.07; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-16.26).The maximum polyp diameter was significantly negatively correlated with the VO2max among the patients with FAP without a history of colectomy (r = -.44, P = .01).In the multiple linear regression analysis, maximum polyp diameter was independently correlated with VO2max.Our results suggest a preventive association between physical fitness and CRC development or colorectal adenoma growth exists in patients with FAP.",0,0,0,0
32065769,"Effects of Exercise Therapy Dosing Schedule on Impaired Cardiorespiratory Fitness in Patients With Primary Breast Cancer: A Randomized Controlled Trial.BACKGROUND: Current exercise guidelines for clinical populations recommend an exercise therapy (ET) prescription of fixed intensity (moderate), duration (40-50 minutes per session), and volume (120-160 min/wk).A critical overarching element of exercise programming that has received minimal attention is dose scheduling.We investigated the tolerability and efficacy of 2 exercise training dose regimens on cardiorespiratory fitness and patient-reported outcomes in patients with posttreatment primary breast cancer.METHODS: Using a parallel-group randomized trial, we randomly allocated 174 postmenopausal patients (2.8 years after adjuvant therapy) with impaired peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) to 1 of 2 supervised exercise training interventions delivered with a standard linear (LET) (fixed dose intensity per session for 160 min/wk) or nonlinear (NLET) (variable dose intensity per session for approximately 120 min/wk) schedule compared with a stretching attention control group for 16 consecutive weeks.Stretching was matched to exercise dosing arms on the basis of location, frequency, duration, and treatment length.The primary end point was change in VO2peak (mL O2.kg(-1).min(-1)) from baseline to after intervention.Secondary end points were patient-reported outcomes, tolerability, and safety.RESULTS: No serious adverse events were observed.Mean attendance was 64%, 75%, and 80% for attention control, LET, and NLET, respectively.In intention-to-treat analysis, VO2peak increased 0.6+/-1.7 mL O2.kg(-1).min(-1) (P=0.05) and 0.8+/-1.8 mL O2.kg(-1).min(-1) (P=0.07) in LET and NLET, respectively, compared with attention control.Change in VO2peak ranged from -2.7 to 4.1 mL O2.kg(-1).min(-1) and from -3.6 to 5.1 mL O2.kg(-1).min(-1) in LET and NLET, respectively.Approximately 40% of patients in both exercise dosing regimens were classified as VO2peak responders (ie, Delta >/=1.32 mL O2.kg(-1).min(-1)).NLET improved all patient-reported outcomes compared with attention control.CONCLUSIONS: Short-term exercise training, independently of dosing schedule, is associated with modest improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness in patients previously treated for early-stage breast cancer.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov.Unique identifier: NCT01186367.",1,1,0,0

28209746,"A Phase II Randomized Trial (GO27827) of First-Line FOLFOX Plus Bevacizumab with or Without the MET Inhibitor Onartuzumab in Patients with Metastatic Colorectal Cancer.BACKGROUND: Dysregulated hepatocyte growth factor/mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) signaling is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to vascular endothelial growth factor inhibition in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).We report outcomes from a double-blind, multicenter phase II trial of the MET inhibitor onartuzumab in combination with mFOLFOX-6 and bevacizumab for mCRC (GO27827; NCT01418222).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive onartuzumab (10 mg/kg intravenously [IV]) or placebo plus mFOLFOX-6 and bevacizumab (5 mg/kg IV).Oxaliplatin was given for 8-12 cycles; other agents were continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or death.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) in the intent-to-treat (ITT) and MET immunohistochemistry (IHC) expression-positive populations.RESULTS: Between September 2011 and November 2012, 194 patients were enrolled.In September 2013, an interim analysis recommended stopping onartuzumab treatment due to lack of efficacy.At the time of the final analysis in February 2014, no significant improvement in PFS was seen with onartuzumab versus placebo in either the ITT or MET IHC-positive populations.An improvement in PFS was noted in the MET IHC-negative population.Neither overall survival nor response rate was improved with onartuzumab.The incidence of fatigue, peripheral edema, and deep vein thrombosis was increased with onartuzumab relative to placebo.CONCLUSION: Onartuzumab combined with mFOLFOX-6 and bevacizumab did not significantly improve efficacy outcomes in either the ITT or MET IHC-positive populations.MET expression by IHC was not a predictive biomarker in this setting.The Oncologist 2017;22:264-271 IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The addition of onartuzumab to mFOLFOX-6 plus bevacizumab did not improve outcomes in patients with previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer in this randomized, phase II study.Although initial results with onartuzumab were promising, a number of phase II/III clinical trials have reported a lack of improvement in efficacy with onartuzumab combined with standard-of-care therapies in several tumor types.Furthermore, negative study data have been published for rilotumumab and ficlatuzumab, both of which block hepatocyte growth factor binding to the mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) receptor.MET immunohistochemistry was not a predictive biomarker.It remains to be seen if other biomarkers or small molecule inhibitors may be more appropriate for inhibiting this oncogenic pathway.",1,1,1,1
33539944,"A phase II randomized trial of cobimetinib plus chemotherapy, with or without atezolizumab, as first-line treatment for patients with locally advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (COLET): primary analysis.BACKGROUND: Resistance to standard chemotherapy in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) is associated with upregulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway.Cobimetinib, an MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK) inhibitor, may increase sensitivity to taxanes and programmed death-ligand 1 inhibitors.COLET is a three-cohort phase II study evaluating first-line cobimetinib plus chemotherapy, with or without atezolizumab, in patients with locally advanced or mTNBC.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were >/=18 years with locally advanced or mTNBC.Following a safety run-in, patients in cohort I were randomized 1:1 to cobimetinib (60 mg, D3-D23 of each 28-day cycle) or placebo, plus paclitaxel (80 mg/m(2), D1, 8, and 15).Additional patients were randomized (1:1) to cohort II or III to receive cobimetinib plus atezolizumab (840 mg, D1 and D15) and either paclitaxel (cohort II) or nab-paclitaxel [cohort III (100 mg/m(2), D1, D8, and D15)].Primary endpoints were investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) (cohort I) and confirmed objective response rate (ORR) (cohorts II/III).Safety and tolerability were also assessed.RESULTS: In the expansion stages, median PFS was 5.5 months for cobimetinib/paclitaxel versus 3.8 months for placebo/paclitaxel in cohort I [hazard ratio 0.73; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.43-1.24; P = 0.25].In cohort I, ORR was 38.3% (95% CI 24.40-52.20) for cobimetinib/paclitaxel and 20.9% (95% CI 8.77-33.09) for placebo/paclitaxel; ORRs in cohorts II and III were 34.4% (95% CI 18.57-53.19) and 29.0% (95% CI 14.22-48.04), respectively.Diarrhea was the most common grade >/=3 adverse events across all cohorts.CONCLUSIONS: Cobimetinib added to paclitaxel did not lead to a statistically significant increase in PFS or ORR, although a nonsignificant trend toward a numerical increase was observed.Cobimetinib plus atezolizumab and a taxane did not appear to increase ORR.This demonstrates the potential activity of a combinatorial MEK inhibitor, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy in this difficult-to-treat population.",1,1,1,1

22610788,"Sequential chemoradiotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin for locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma.We investigated a new chemoradiotherapy (CRT) regimen for locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).A total of 240 patients were randomly assigned to three different CRT regimens: sequential CRT [1 cycle chemotherapy + Phase I radiotherapy (RT) + 1 cycle chemotherapy + Phase II RT + 2 cycles chemotherapy] with a cisplatin-gemcitabine (GC) regimen (800 mg/m(2) gemcitabine on Days 1 and 8 and 20 mg/m(2) cisplatin on Days 1-5, every 4 weeks) (sGC-RT); sequential chemoradiotherapy with a cisplatin-fluorouracil (PF) regimen (20 mg/m(2) DDP and 500 mg/m(2) 5-FU on Days 1-5, every 4 weeks) (sPF-RT) and cisplatin-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy plus adjuvant PF chemotherapy (Con-RT + PF).The complete response rate was higher in the sGC + RT group than in the other two groups (98.75% vs. 92.50%, p < 0.01).The 3-year overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) rates in the sGC-RT group were significantly higher than those observed in the Con-RT group (OS, 95.0% vs. 76.3%, p < 0.001; DFS, 89.9% vs. 67.5%, p < 0.001; DMFS, 92.5% vs. 76.0%, p = 0.004) and in the sPF + RT group (OS, 95.0% vs. 73.6%, p < 0.001; DFS, 89.9% vs. 63.3%, p < 0.001; DMFS, 92.5% vs. 74.7%, p = 0.002).There were no significant differences in 3-year OS, DFS and MFS rates between the Con-RT and the sPF-RT groups.The GC-RT group experienced more hematologic toxicity, constipation and rash; however, there were no differences in late RT toxicity between the groups.These results demonstrate that a sGC-RT regimen is effective and well tolerated in patients with locoregionally advanced NPC.",1,1,1,0
27265347,"Adjuvant chemotherapy of S-1 versus gemcitabine for resected pancreatic cancer: a phase 3, open-label, randomised, non-inferiority trial (JASPAC 01).BACKGROUND: Although adjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine is standard care for resected pancreatic cancer, S-1 has shown non-inferiority to gemcitabine for advanced disease.We aimed to investigate the non-inferiority of S-1 to gemcitabine as adjuvant chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer in terms of overall survival.METHODS: We did a randomised, open-label, multicentre, non-inferiority phase 3 trial undertaken at 33 hospitals in Japan.Patients who had histologically proven invasive ductal carcinoma of the pancreas, pathologically documented stage I-III, and no local residual or microscopic residual tumour, and were aged 20 years or older were eligible.Patients with resected pancreatic cancer were randomly assigned (in a 1:1 ratio) to receive gemcitabine (1000 mg/m(2), intravenously administered on days 1, 8, and 15, every 4 weeks [one cycle], for up to six cycles) or S-1 (40 mg, 50 mg, or 60 mg according to body-surface area, orally administered twice a day for 28 days followed by a 14 day rest, every 6 weeks [one cycle], for up to four cycles) at the data centre by a modified minimisation method, balancing residual tumour status, nodal status, and institutions.The primary outcome was overall survival in the two treatment groups, assessed in the per-protocol population, excluding ineligible patients and those not receiving the allocated treatment.The protocol prespecified that the superiority of S-1 with respect to overall survival was also to be assessed in the per-protocol population by a log-rank test, if the non-inferiority of S-1 was verified.We estimated overall and relapse-free survival using the Kaplan-Meier methods, and assessed non-inferiority of S-1 to gemcitabine using the Cox proportional hazard model.The expected hazard ratio (HR) for mortality was 0.87 with a non-inferiority margin of 1.25 (power 80%; one-sided type I error 2.5%).This trial is registered at UMIN CTR (UMIN000000655).FINDINGS: 385 patients were randomly assigned to treatment between April 11, 2007, and June 29, 2010 (193 to the gemcitabine group and 192 to the S-1 group).Of these, three were exlcuded because of ineligibility and five did not receive chemotherapy.The per-protocol population therefore consisted of 190 patients in the gemcitabine group and 187 patients in the S-1 group.On Sept 15, 2012, following the recommendation from the independent data and safety monitoring committee, this study was discontinued because the prespecified criteria for early discontinuation were met at the interim analysis for efficacy, when all the protocol treatments had been finished.Analysis with the follow-up data on Jan 15, 2016, showed HR of mortality was 0.57 (95% CI 0.44-0.72, pnon-inferiority<0.0001, p<0.0001 for superiority), associated with 5-year overall survival of 24.4% (18.6-30.8) in the gemcitabine group and 44.1% (36.9-51.1) in the S-1 group.Grade 3 or 4 leucopenia, neutropenia, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase were observed more frequently in the gemcitabine group, whereas stomatitis and diarrhoea were more frequently experienced in the S-1 group.INTERPRETATION: Adjuvant chemotherapy with S-1 can be a new standard care for resected pancreatic cancer in Japanese patients.These results should be assessed in non-Asian patients.FUNDING: Pharma Valley Center, Shizuoka Industrial Foundation, Taiho Pharmaceutical.",1,1,1,0
34065997,"Effect of Elastic Abdominal Binder on Pain and Functional Recovery Following Gynecologic Cancer Surgery: A Randomized Controlled Trial.Background and Objectives: Clinicians have been using elastic abdominal binder for stabilizing incision site after major abdominal surgery.However, the benefits of that practice have never been formally assessed.The aim of this study was to examine the effects of the use of elastic abdominal binder on postoperative pain and recovery of gynecologic cancer patients.Materials and Methods: One-hundred and nine women diagnosed with cervical, endometrial, or ovarian cancer, who underwent open abdominal surgery were assigned randomly into two groups: intervention (56 patients) and control (53 patients).The women in the intervention group applied abdominal binder from postoperative day 1.For the control group, the women did not wear the binder or similar devices.The primary outcomes were pain and functional recovery.Subgroup analysis on participants age >/= 50 was also performed.Results: For the entire study cohort, the baseline, postoperative day 1, and postoperative day 2 pain scores in the intervention group were significantly lower than the control group.However, there was no significant difference between the groups for postoperative day 3 pain score and for the change in pain scores from the baseline value.Of note, the age >/= 50 subgroup represented a more balanced cohort with comparable baseline pain scores between the study groups.For this population, the pain scores for postoperative day 1-3 were significantly lower in the intervention group.The intervention group had a longer six-minute walking distance on postoperative day 3 with a trend toward a smaller difference in the day 3 distance from the baseline.Conclusions: The potential benefits of abdominal binder use in reducing postoperative pain and improving functional recovery after open gynecologic cancer surgery could be demonstrated only in those age >/= 50.",1,1,0,0

31520215,"Inverse association between changes in energetic cost of walking and vertical accelerations in non-metastatic breast cancer survivors.PURPOSE: With accelerometry, the utility to detect changes in physical activity are predicated on the assumption that walking energetics and gait mechanics do not change.The present work examined associations between changes () in walking energetics, exercise self-efficacy, and several accelerometer-derived metrics.METHODS: Secondary analyses were performed among a sub-sample (n = 29) of breast cancer survivors participating in a larger randomized trial.During 4 min of treadmill walking (0.89 m s(-1), 0% grade), indirect calorimetry quantified steady-state energy expenditure (EE), wherein, participants were fitted with a heart rate monitor and hip-worn triaxial accelerometer.Exercise self-efficacy was measured using a 9-item questionnaire, while vector magnitude (VM) and individual planes (e.g., mediolateral, vertical, and anteroposterior) of the movement were extracted for data analyses.Evaluations were made at baseline and after 3 months.RESULTS: From baseline to 3 months, the energetic cost of walking (kcals min(-1)) significantly decreased by an average of - 5.1% (p = 0.001; d = 0.46).Conversely, VM significantly increased (p = 0.007; d = 0.53), exclusively due to greater vertical accelerations (acc) (+ 5.7 +/- 7.8 acc; p = 0.001; d = 0.69).Changes in vertical accelerations were inversely and positively associated with walking EE (r = - 0.37; p = 0.047) and exercise self-efficacy (r = 0.39; p = 0.034), respectively.CONCLUSION: Hip-worn accelerometers do not appear well-suited to correctly detect changes in ease of walking as evidenced by reduced energetic cost.Further research should determine if a divergence between measured EE and vertical accelerations could contribute to erroneous inferences in free-living physical activity.",0,0,0,0

30094545,"Randomized phase III trial to evaluate radiopharmaceuticals and zoledronic acid in the palliation of osteoblastic metastases from lung, breast, and prostate cancer: report of the NRG Oncology RTOG 0517 trial.BACKGROUND: Skeletal-related events (SREs), common sequelae of metastatic cancer, are reduced by bisphosphonates.In this study, it was postulated that radiopharmaceuticals, added to bisphosphonates, could further decrease the incidence of SREs.METHODS: NRG Oncology RTOG 0517 randomized patients with breast, lung, and prostate cancer and blastic bone metastases to either zoledronic acid (ZA) alone or ZA plus radiopharmaceuticals (Sr-89 or Sm-153).The primary endpoint was time to development of SREs.Secondary objectives included quality of life (QOL), pain control, overall survival (OS), and toxicity.RESULTS: 261 patients (median age 68; 62% male; 55% prostate, 35% breast, 10% lung) were accrued between July 2006 and February 2011.The study closed early due to a lower than expected rate of SREs.52 (42%) patients in the ZA arm and 49 (40%) in the radiopharmaceutical arm experienced an SRE.Median time free of SREs was 29.9 and 27.4 months, respectively (p = 0.84).Median OS in the ZA arm and radiopharmaceutical arms was 32.1 and 26.9 months, respectively (p = 0.37).Cox proportional hazards regression model showed that primary disease site (lung) and number of bone metastases (> 2) had a negative impact on OS (p < 0.0001, p = 0.01, respectively).The addition of radiopharmaceuticals to ZA led to a significant reduction in pain at 1 month based on BPI worst score (p = 0.02).No other group differences were noted for QOL or toxicity.CONCLUSION: The addition of radiopharmaceuticals to bisphosphonates did not alter time to SREs or OS for patients with breast, lung, prostate cancers and blastic bone metastases, although it was associated with significant pain reduction at 1 month.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRY: This protocol (RTOG 0517) is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00365105), and may be viewed online at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00365105?term=RTOG+0517&rank=1 .",1,1,1,0
25975527,"Clip closure of defect after endoscopic resection in patients with larger colorectal tumors decreased the adverse events.BACKGROUND: Clip closure of large colorectal mucosal defects may reduce the rate of adverse events in a cost-effective manner.OBJECTIVE: To assess the adverse events and outcomes of clip closure of defects after endoscopic resection in patients with large colorectal tumors.DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, controlled study.SETTING: Single tertiary referral center.PATIENTS AND INTERVENTIONS: Patients with lesions measuring 1 to 4 cm who were scheduled for endoscopic resection between March 2012 and December 2014 were randomly assigned to a clip-closure group and a no-closure group.In the clip-closure group, the defect of the resection site was completely closed with an endoclip.In the no-closure group, the defect was left open.The following primary outcome measures were assessed: delayed postoperative bleeding, postpolypectomy coagulation syndrome, perforation, and abdominal pain.Secondary outcome measures of length of hospital stay, time required for procedure, and patient's satisfaction were also assessed.RESULTS: Patients and lesions had similar characteristics across both groups.For patients who underwent clip closure (n = 174), the rates of delayed postoperative bleeding (1.1% [2/174]) and postpolypectomy coagulation syndrome (0.6% [1/174]) were lower than those in the no-closure group (6.9% [12/174], P = .01 and 4.6% [8/174], P = .03).Two patients experienced perforation, 1 in each group.In the clip-closure group, 4 patients reported abdominal pain as opposed to 26 in the no-closure group (2.8% vs 16.7%, P < .01).The procedure took longer in the closure group (38.1 minutes vs 30.9 minutes, P = .04).The length of hospitalization was shorter in the closure group (3.1 days vs 4.7 days, P = .03).Total medical expense was similar between the 2 groups.Patients who underwent closure reported greater satisfaction.LIMITATION: This was a single-center analysis.CONCLUSIONS: Clip closure of endoscopic resection defects in patients with large colorectal tumors decreased the rate of procedure-related adverse events and did not increase the cost of hospitalization.",1,1,1,0
33616652,"Addition of lenalidomide to intensive treatment in younger and middle-aged adults with newly diagnosed AML: the HOVON-SAKK-132 trial.Lenalidomide, an antineoplastic and immunomodulatory drug, has therapeutic activity in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but definitive studies about its therapeutic utility have been lacking.In a phase 3 study, we compared 2 induction regimens in newly diagnosed patients age 18 to 65 years with AML: idarubicine-cytarabine (cycle 1) and daunorubicin and intermediate-dose cytarabine (cycle 2) without or with lenalidomide (15 mg orally on days 1-21).One final consolidation cycle of chemotherapy or autologous stem cell transplantation (auto-SCT) or allogeneic SCT (allo-SCT) was provided according to a prognostic risk and minimal residual disease (MRD)-adapted approach.Event-free survival (EFS; primary end point) and other clinical end points were assessed.A second random assignment in patients in complete response or in complete response with incomplete hematologic recovery after cycle 3 or auto-SCT involved 6 cycles of maintenance with lenalidomide (10 mg on days 1-21) or observation.In all, 392 patients were randomly assigned to the control group, and 388 patients were randomly assigned to lenalidomide induction.At a median follow-up of 41 months, the study revealed no differences in outcome between the treatments (EFS, 44% +/- 2% standard error and overall survival, 54% +/- 2% at 4 years for both arms) although in an exploratory post hoc analysis, a lenalidomide benefit was suggested in SRSF2-mutant AML.In relation to the previous Dutch-Belgian Hemato-Oncology Cooperative Group and Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research (HOVON-SAKK) studies that used a similar 3-cycle regimen but did not pursue an MRD-guided approach, these survival estimates compare markedly more favorably.MRD status after cycle 2 lost prognostic value in intermediate-risk AML in the risk-adjusted treatment context.Maintenance with lenalidomide showed no apparent effect on relapse probability in 88 patients randomly assigned for this part of the study.",1,1,1,0

31699709,"Combined Vaccination with NY-ESO-1 Protein, Poly-ICLC, and Montanide Improves Humoral and Cellular Immune Responses in Patients with High-Risk Melanoma.Given its ability to induce both humoral and cellular immune responses, NY-ESO-1 has been considered a suitable antigen for a cancer vaccine.Despite promising results from early-phase clinical studies in patients with melanoma, NY-ESO-1 vaccine immunotherapy has not been widely investigated in larger trials; consequently, many questions remain as to the optimal vaccine formulation, predictive biomarkers, and sequencing and timing of vaccines in melanoma treatment.We conducted an adjuvant phase I/II clinical trial in high-risk resected melanoma to optimize the delivery of poly-ICLC, a TLR-3/MDA-5 agonist, as a component of vaccine formulation.A phase I dose-escalation part was undertaken to identify the MTD of poly-ICLC administered in combination with NY-ESO-1 and montanide.This was followed by a randomized phase II part investigating the MTD of poly-ICLC with NY-ESO-1 with or without montanide.The vaccine regimens were generally well tolerated, with no treatment-related grade 3/4 adverse events.Both regimens induced integrated NY-ESO-1-specific CD4(+) T-cell and humoral responses.CD8(+) T-cell responses were mainly detected in patients receiving montanide.T-cell avidity toward NY-ESO-1 peptides was higher in patients vaccinated with montanide.In conclusion, NY-ESO-1 protein in combination with poly-ICLC is safe, well tolerated, and capable of inducing integrated antibody and CD4(+) T-cell responses in most patients.Combination with montanide enhances antigen-specific T-cell avidity and CD8(+) T-cell cross-priming in a fraction of patients, indicating that montanide contributes to the induction of specific CD8(+) T-cell responses to NY-ESO-1.",0,0,0,0
23871490,"2 years versus 1 year of adjuvant trastuzumab for HER2-positive breast cancer (HERA): an open-label, randomised controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Trastuzumab has established efficacy against breast cancer with overexpression or amplification of the HER2 oncogene.The standard of care is 1 year of adjuvant trastuzumab, but the optimum duration of treatment is unknown.We compared 2 years of treatment with trastuzumab with 1 year of treatment, and updated the comparison of 1 year of trastuzumab versus observation at a median follow-up of 8 years, for patients enrolled in the HERceptin Adjuvant (HERA) trial.METHODS: The HERA trial is an international, multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial comparing treatment with trastuzumab for 1 and 2 years with observation after standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy, adjuvant chemotherapy, or both in 5102 patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer.The primary endpoint was disease-free survival.The comparison of 2 years versus 1 year of trastuzumab treatment involved a landmark analysis of 3105 patients who were disease-free 12 months after randomisation to one of the trastuzumab groups, and was planned after observing at least 725 disease-free survival events.The updated intention-to-treat comparison of 1 year trastuzumab treatment versus observation alone in 3399 patients at a median follow-up of 8 years (range 0-10) is also reported.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00045032.FINDINGS: We recorded 367 events of disease-free survival in 1552 patients in the 1 year group and 367 events in 1553 patients in the 2 year group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.99, 95% CI 0.85-1.14, p=0.86).Grade 3-4 adverse events and decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction during treatment were reported more frequently in the 2 year treatment group than in the 1 year group (342 [20.4%] vs 275 [16.3%] grade 3-4 adverse events, and 120 [7.2%] vs 69 [4.1%] decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction, respectively).HRs for a comparison of 1 year of trastuzumab treatment versus observation were 0.76 (95% CI 0.67-0.86, p<0.0001) for disease-free survival and 0.76 (0.65-0.88, p=0.0005) for overall survival, despite crossover of 884 (52%) patients from the observation group to trastuzumab therapy.INTERPRETATION: 2 years of adjuvant trastuzumab is not more effective than is 1 year of treatment for patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer.1 year of treatment provides a significant disease-free and overall survival benefit compared with observation and remains the standard of care.FUNDING: F Hoffmann-La Roche (Roche).",1,1,1,1

32529467,"A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of B-cell lymphoma 2 homology 3 mimetic gossypol combined with docetaxel and cisplatin for advanced non-small cell lung cancer with high expression of apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1.Background Overexpression of apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) is an important cause of poor chemotherapeutic efficacy in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.Gossypol, a new inhibitor of APE1, in combination with docetaxel and cisplatin is believed to improve the efficacy of chemotherapy for advanced NSCLC with high APE1 expression.Methods Sixty-two patients were randomly assigned to two groups.Thirty-one patients in the experimental group received 75 mg/m(2) docetaxel and 75 mg/m(2) cisplatin on day 1 with gossypol administered at 20 mg once daily on days 1 to 14 every 21 days.The control group received placebo with the same docetaxel and cisplatin regimen.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS); secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), response rate, and toxicity.Results There were no significant differences in PFS and OS between the experimental group and the control group.The median PFS (mPFS) in the experimental and control groups was 7.43 and 4.9 months, respectively (HR = 0.54; p = 0.06), and the median OS (mOS) was 18.37 and 14.7 months, respectively (HR = 0.68; p = 0.27).No significant differences in response rate and serious adverse events were found between the groups.Conclusion The experimental group had a better mPFS and mOS than did the control group, though no significant difference was observed.Because the regimen of gossypol combined with docetaxel and cisplatin was well tolerated, future studies with larger sample sizes should be performed.",1,1,1,1
23093864,"Intrabone transplant of cord blood stem cells establishes a local engraftment store: a functional PET/FDG study.BACKGROUND: Despite advancements in comprehension of molecular mechanisms governing bone marrow (BM) homing of hematopoietic stem cells, cord blood transplant (CBT) suffers from a slow rate of hematopoietic recovery.Intrabone (i.b.)injection has been proposed as a method able to improve speed of BM engraftment with respect to conventional i.v.protocols.However, the mechanisms underlying this benefit are largely unknown.AIM: To verify whether i.b.-CBT determines a local engraftment able to predict the reconstitution of recipient hematopoiesis.DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty-one patients with hematologic malignancies received i.b. injection into both iliac crests of 3.2 +/-0.68 * 107/kg cord blood cells.One month following i.b.-CBT, PET-CT imaging was performed.Maximal standardized uptake values (SUVs) were assessed in BM of both iliac crests and in all lumbar vertebrae.RESULTS: Maximal SUV within iliac crests was higher than in lumbar vertebrae (4.1 +/- 1.7 versus 3.2 +/- 0.7, resp., P = 0.01).However, metabolic activity in these two different BM districts was significantly correlated (r = 0.7, P < 0.001).Moreover, FDG uptake values within the injection site closely predicted platelet recovery 100 days after i.b.-CBT (r = 0.72, P < 0.01).CONCLUSIONS: The metabolic activity of injected BM predicts the subsequent rate of hematopoietic recovery after i.b.-CBT, suggesting a pivotal role of the local engraftment in the reconstitution of recipient hematopoiesis.",0,0,0,0
24290734,"Bioequivalence of Liposome-Entrapped Paclitaxel Easy-To-Use (LEP-ETU) formulation and paclitaxel in polyethoxylated castor oil: a randomized, two-period crossover study in patients with advanced cancer.BACKGROUND: Preclinical studies comparing paclitaxel formulated with polyethoxylated castor oil with the sonicated formulation of liposome-entrapped paclitaxel (LEP) have demonstrated that LEP was associated with reduced toxicity while maintaining similar efficacy.Preliminary studies on the pharmacokinetics in patients support earlier preclinical data, which suggested that the LEP Easy-to-Use (LEP-ETU) formulation and paclitaxel formulated with castor oil may have comparable pharmacokinetic properties.OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were: (1) to determine bioequivalence of paclitaxel pharmaceutically formulated as LEP-ETU (test) and paclitaxel formulated with castor oil (reference); and (2) to assess the tolerability of LEP-ETU following intravenous administration.METHODS: Patients with advanced cancer were studied in a randomized, 2-period crossover bioequivalence study.Patients received paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2) administered as an intravenous infusion over 180 minutes, either as a single-treatment cycle of the test formulation followed by a single-treatment cycle of the reference formulation, or vice versa.RESULTS: Thirty-two of 58 patients were evaluable and were included in the analysis for bioequivalence.Mean total paclitaxel Cmax values for the test and reference formulations were 4955.0 and 5108.8 ng/mL, respectively.Corresponding AUC0-infinity values were 15,853.8 and 18,550.8 ng.h/mL, respectively.Treatment ratios of the geometric means were 97% (90% CI, 91%-103%) for Cmax and 84% (90% CI, 80%-90%) for AUC0-infinity.These results met the required 80% to 125% bioequivalence criteria.The most frequently reported adverse events after LEP-ETU administration were fatigue, alopecia, and myalgia.CONCLUSION: At the studied dose regimen, LEP-ETU showed bioequivalence with paclitaxel formulated with polyethoxylated castor oil.",1,1,0,0
26931369,"Immunobiological effects of gemcitabine and capecitabine combination chemotherapy in advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.BACKGROUND: Preclinical studies suggest that chemotherapy may enhance the immune response against pancreatic cancer.METHODS: The levels of granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) and the associated inflammatory marker C-reactive protein (CRP) were assessed in 38 patients receiving gemcitabine and capecitabine combination chemotherapy for advanced pancreatic cancer within the TeloVac trial.Apoptosis (M30) and total immune response (delayed-type hypersensitivity and/or T-cell response) were also assessed and levels of apoptosis induction correlated with immune response.The telomerase GV1001 vaccine was given either sequentially (n=18) or concomitantly (n=24) with the combination chemotherapy.RESULTS: There were no differences between baseline and post-treatment levels of CRP (P=0.19), IL-6 (P=0.19) and GM-CSF (P=0.71).There was a positive correlation between post-chemotherapy CRP and IL-6 levels (r=0.45, P=0.005) and between CRP with carbohydrate antigen-19-9 (CA19-9) levels at baseline (r=0.45, P=0.015) and post treatment (r=0.40, P=0.015).The change in CRP and IL-6 levels was positively correlated (r=0.40, P=0.012).Hazard ratios (95% CI) for baseline CA19-9 (1.30 (1.07-1.59), P=0.009) and CRP (1.55 (1.00-2.39), P=0.049) levels were each independently predictive of survival.The M30 mean matched differences between pre- and post-chemotherapy showed evidence of apoptosis in both the sequential (P=0.058) and concurrent (P=0.0018) chemoimmunotherapy arms.Respectively, 5 of 10 and 9 of 20 patients had a positive immune response but there was no association with apoptosis.CONCLUSIONS: Combination gemcitabine and capecitabine chemotherapy did not affect circulating levels of GM-CSF, IL-6 and CRP.Chemotherapy-induced apoptosis was not associated with the immunogenicity induced by the GV1001 vaccine in advanced pancreatic cancer.",0,0,0,0
28322759,"Validation and Refinement of Prediction Models to Estimate Exercise Capacity in Cancer Survivors Using the Steep Ramp Test.OBJECTIVE: To further test the validity and clinical usefulness of the steep ramp test (SRT) in estimating exercise tolerance in cancer survivors by external validation and extension of previously published prediction models for peak oxygen consumption (Vo2peak) and peak power output (Wpeak).DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.SETTING: Multicenter.PARTICIPANTS: Cancer survivors (N=283) in 2 randomized controlled exercise trials.INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prediction model accuracy was assessed by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and limits of agreement (LOA).Multiple linear regression was used for model extension.Clinical performance was judged by the percentage of accurate endurance exercise prescriptions.RESULTS: ICCs of SRT-predicted Vo2peak and Wpeak with these values as obtained by the cardiopulmonary exercise test were .61 and .73, respectively, using the previously published prediction models.95% LOA were +/-705mL/min with a bias of 190mL/min for Vo2peak and +/-59W with a bias of 5W for Wpeak.Modest improvements were obtained by adding body weight and sex to the regression equation for the prediction of Vo2peak (ICC, .73; 95% LOA, +/-608mL/min) and by adding age, height, and sex for the prediction of Wpeak (ICC, .81; 95% LOA, +/-48W).Accuracy of endurance exercise prescription improved from 57% accurate prescriptions to 68% accurate prescriptions with the new prediction model for Wpeak.CONCLUSIONS: Predictions of Vo2peak and Wpeak based on the SRT are adequate at the group level, but insufficiently accurate in individual patients.The multivariable prediction model for Wpeak can be used cautiously (eg, supplemented with a Borg score) to aid endurance exercise prescription.",0,0,0,0
26715229,"Long-Term Effects of Two Formats of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia Comorbid with Breast Cancer.STUDY OBJECTIVES: The goal of this randomized controlled trial, conducted in breast cancer patients, was to assess the long-term efficacy of a video-based cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (VCBT-I), as compared to a professionally administered intervention (PCBT-I) and to a no-treatment group (CTL).An earlier report revealed that, at posttreatment, VCBT-I patients showed significantly greater sleep improvements than CTL, but that PCBT-I produced superior effects than VCBT-I on some sleep and secondary outcomes.In this report, long-term effects are compared.METHODS: Two hundred forty-two women with breast cancer and with insomnia symptoms or using hypnotic medications participated to this three-arm randomized controlled trial: (1) PCBT-I (n = 81); (2) VCBT-I (n = 80); or (3) no treatment (CTL; n = 81) group.PCBT-I was composed of six weekly, individual sessions of approximately 50 min, whereas VCBT-I comprised a 60-min animated video and six booklets.RESULTS: Study measures (sleep and secondary variables) were administered at pretreatment and posttreatment, and at a 3-, 6-, and 12-mo follow-up.Treatment gains were well sustained at follow-up in both PCBT-I and VCBT-I. As at posttreatment, the remission rate of insomnia at follow-up was greater in PCBT-I than in VCBT-I, which was greater than in CTL.CONCLUSIONS: Although face-to-face therapy remains the optimal format to efficaciously administer CBT for insomnia in cancer patients, a minimal intervention, such as the video-based intervention tested in this study, produces significant and sustainable treatment effects.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00674830.",1,1,0,0

24924798,"Patient-reported genitourinary dysfunction after laparoscopic and open rectal cancer surgery in a randomized trial (COLOR II).BACKGROUND: This article reports on patient-reported sexual dysfunction and micturition symptoms following a randomized trial of laparoscopic and open surgery for rectal cancer.METHODS: Patients in the COLOR II randomized trial, comparing laparoscopic and open surgery for rectal cancer, completed the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-CR38 questionnaire before surgery, and after 4 weeks, 6, 12 and 24 months.Adjusted mean differences on a 100-point scale were calculated using changes from baseline value at the various time points in the domains of sexual functioning, sexual enjoyment, male and female sexual problems, and micturition symptoms.RESULTS: Of 617 randomized patients, 385 completed this phase of the trial.Their mean age was 67.1 years.Surgery caused an anticipated reduction in genitourinary function after 4 weeks, with no significant differences between laparoscopic and open approaches.An improvement in sexual dysfunction was seen in the first year, but some male sexual problems persisted.Before operation 64.5 per cent of men in the laparoscopic group and 55.6 per cent in the open group reported some degree of erectile dysfunction.This increased to 81.1 and 80.5 per cent respectively 4 weeks after surgery, and 76.3 versus 75.5 per cent at 12 months, with no significant differences between groups.Micturition symptoms were less affected than sexual function and gradually improved to preoperative levels by 6 months.Adjusting for confounders, including radiotherapy, did not change these results.CONCLUSION: Sexual dysfunction is common in patients with rectal cancer, and treatment (including surgery) increases the proportion of patients affected.A laparoscopic approach does not change this.REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT00297791 (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov).",0,0,0,0
28679552,"Randomized controlled trial of dietary fiber for the prevention of radiation-induced gastrointestinal toxicity during pelvic radiotherapy.Background: Therapeutic radiotherapy is an important treatment of pelvic cancers.Historically, low-fiber diets have been recommended despite a lack of evidence and potentially beneficial mechanisms of fiber.Objective: This randomized controlled trial compared low-, habitual-, and high-fiber diets for the prevention of gastrointestinal toxicity in patients undergoing pelvic radiotherapy.Design: Patients were randomly assigned to low-fiber [</=10 g nonstarch polysaccharide (NSP)/d], habitual-fiber (control), or high-fiber (>/=18 g NSP/d) diets and received individualized counseling at the start of radiotherapy to achieve these targets.The primary endpoint was the difference between groups in the change in the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire-Bowel Subset (IBDQ-B) score between the starting and nadir (worst) score during treatment.Other measures included macronutrient intake, stool diaries, and fecal short-chain fatty acid concentrations.Results: Patients were randomly assigned to low-fiber (n = 55), habitual-fiber (n = 55), or high-fiber (n = 56) dietary advice.Fiber intakes were significantly different between groups (P < 0.001).The difference between groups in the change in IBDQ-B scores between the start and nadir was not significant (P = 0.093).However, the change in score between the start and end of radiotherapy was smaller in the high-fiber group (mean +/- SD: -3.7 +/- 12.8) than in the habitual-fiber group (-10.8 +/-13.5; P = 0.011).At 1-y postradiotherapy (n = 126) the difference in IBDQ-B scores between the high-fiber (+0.1 +/- 14.5) and the habitual-fiber (-8.4 +/- 13.3) groups was significant (P = 0.004).No significant differences were observed in stool frequency or form or in short-chain fatty acid concentrations.Significant reductions in energy, protein, and fat intake occurred in the low- and habitual-fiber groups only.Conclusions: Dietary advice to follow a high-fiber diet during pelvic radiotherapy resulted in reduced gastrointestinal toxicity both acutely and at 1 y compared with habitual-fiber intake.Restrictive, non-evidence-based advice to reduce fiber intake in this setting should be abandoned.This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT 01170299.",1,1,0,0

33947608,"Time to Resolution of Axitinib-Related Adverse Events After Treatment Interruption in Patients With Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma.INTRODUCTION: Combined axitinib and immuno-oncology (IO) therapy is approved for first-line advanced renal cell carcinoma.Overlapping toxicities represent a clinical challenge.Calculating the time to resolution (TTR) of common axitinib-related adverse events (AEs) after treatment interruption may help to identify AE etiology and determine appropriate management strategies.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from 5 randomized or single-arm axitinib monotherapy or combination studies were analyzed.Patients with histologically confirmed clear cell advanced renal cell carcinoma were pooled into 3 cohorts based on treatment received: axitinib monotherapy, axitinib + IO, and other tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).Any grade and grade >/=3 treatment-emergent diarrhea, fatigue, hypertension, nausea, and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome were assessed.TTR was defined as the time from treatment interruption/discontinuation to resolution.RESULTS: The axitinib monotherapy cohort comprised 532 patients, the axitinib + IO cohort 541 patients, and the other TKI cohort 882 patients.Median TTR for all AEs (any grade) in the axitinib monotherapy cohort ranged from 1 to 3 days, except for fatigue (8 days).For diarrhea, hypertension, nausea, and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome, median TTRs were longer in the axitinib + IO (4-11 days) and other TKI (7-8 days) cohorts versus the monotherapy cohort.Results were similar when only AEs of grade >/=3 were considered.CONCLUSIONS: The TTR of monotherapeutic axitinib-related AEs is </=3 days, except for fatigue, and generally shorter than for other single-agent TKIs and axitinib + IO.This has important implications for identifying AE etiology with combined axitinib-IO therapy and implementation of appropriate management strategies.ClinicalTrials.org identifiers: NCT00678392, NCT00920816, NCT02493751, NCT02684006, NCT02853331.",0,0,0,0

30998694,"""Hey, that could be me"": The role of similarity in narrative persuasion.Stories are often used in health communication because of accumulating evidence of their potential to affect people's attitudes and health behavioral intentions.Similarity between the reader and the story's protagonist appears to positively influence narrative persuasion, but the exact role of similarity on persuasive outcomes is debated, as some research finds clear effects of similarity manipulations whereas others do not.Possibly, these mixed results were found because the similarity manipulations were not always relevant to the topic of the story.We conducted an experiment (N = 582) in which we varied the age and gender of the protagonist, features that were of central relevance to the story's topic, namely breast cancer versus testicular cancer.There were two groups of participants: 324 students (mean age: 21.46 years) and 258 older adults (mean age: 56.83 years).Age similarity (but not gender similarity) had an effect on identification with the protagonist, transportation (i.e. the experience of being absorbed into a story), and the intention to donate, but only for students.For older adults, age or gender of the protagonist did not seem to matter, as nearly no differences in persuasive measures were found.As far as the underlying mechanism is concerned, the results of structural equation modeling showed that the concept of 'perceived similarity' would be a relevant addition to models of narrative persuasion, as it was significantly related to the narrative processes of transportation and identification, which, in turn, predicted attitudes and behavioral intentions, both directly-in the case of transportation-or indirectly, via the emotion of compassion.We conclude that both manipulated and perceived similarity are important for narrative persuasion, and that it should be kept on the research agenda of health communication.",0,0,0,0
24670844,"Comparative effectiveness of sphincter-sparing surgery versus abdominoperineal resection in rectal cancer: patient-reported outcomes in National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project randomized trial R-04.OBJECTIVE: National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) R-04 was a randomized controlled trial of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in patients with resectable stage II-III rectal cancer.We hypothesized that patients who underwent abdominoperineal resection (APR) would have a poorer quality of life than those who underwent sphincter-sparing surgery (SSS).METHODS: To obtain patient-reported outcomes (PROs) we administered two symptom scales at baseline and 1 year postoperatively: the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Colorectal (FACT-C) and the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer module for patients with Colorectal Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-CR38).Scoring was stratified by nonrandomly assigned definitive surgery (APR vs SSS).Analyses controlled for baseline scores and stratification factors: age, sex, stage, intended surgery, and randomly assigned chemoradiotherapy.RESULTS: Of 1,608 randomly assigned patients, 987 had data for planned analyses; 62% underwent SSS; 38% underwent APR.FACT-C total and subscale scores were not statistically different by surgery at 1 year.For the EORTC QLQ-CR38 functional scales, APR patients reported worse body image (70.3 vs 77.0, P = 0.0005) at 1 year than did SSS patients.Males undergoing APR reported worse sexual enjoyment (43.7 vs 54.7, P = 0.02) at 1 year than did those undergoing SSS.For the EORTC QLQ-CR38 symptom scale scores, APR patients reported worse micturition symptoms than the SSS group at 1 year (26.9 vs 21.5, P = 0.03).SSS patients reported worse gastrointestinal tract symptoms than did the APR patients (18.9 vs 15.2, P < 0.0001), as well as weight loss (10.1 vs 6.0, P = 0.002).CONCLUSIONS: Symptoms and functional problems were detected at 1 year by EORTC QLQ-CR38, reflecting different symptom profiles in patients who underwent APR than those who underwent SSS.Information from these PROs may be useful in counseling patients anticipating surgery for rectal cancer.",0,0,0,0
31553661,"Adjuvant Whole-Brain Radiation Therapy Compared With Observation After Local Treatment of Melanoma Brain Metastases: A Multicenter, Randomized Phase III Trial.PURPOSE: The brain is a common site of metastasis for patients with high-risk melanoma.Although surgery or stereotactic radiosurgery are highly effective local treatments for a small number of metastases, there is a high risk of developing additional brain metastases.The role of adjuvant whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) in reducing new metastases is controversial, with a lack of high-level evidence specifically for melanoma.METHODS: In this randomized phase III trial, patients who had local treatment of one to three melanoma brain metastases were randomly assigned to WBRT or observation.The primary end point was distant intracranial failure within 12 months, and secondary end points included time to intracranial failure, survival, and time to deterioration in performance status.RESULTS: Between April 2009 and September 2017, 215 patients were randomly assigned from 24 centers.Median follow-up was 48.1 months (range, 39.6 to 68 months).Forty-two percent of patients in the WBRT group and 50.5% of those in the observation developed distant intracranial failure within 12 months (odds ratio, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.41 to 1.23; P = .22) and the rates over the entire follow-up period were 52.0% and 57.9%, respectively (odds ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.45 to 1.36; P = .39).Local failure rate was lower after WBRT (20.0% v 33.6%; P = .03).At 12 months, 41.5% of patients in the WBRT group and 51.4% of patients in the observation group had died (P = .28), with no difference in the rate of neurologic death.Median time to deterioration in performance status was 3.8 months after WBRT and 4.4 months with observation (P = .32).WBRT was associated with more grade 1 to 2 acute toxicity.CONCLUSION: After local treatment of one to three melanoma brain metastases, adjuvant WBRT does not provide clinical benefit in terms of distant intracranial control, survival, or preservation of performance status.",1,1,0,0

31720816,"Cost-effectiveness analysis of gemcitabine plus cisplatin versus fluorouracil plus cisplatin in the first-line setting for Chinese patients with metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma.PURPOSE: A randomized phase III trial demonstrated that gemcitabine plus cisplatin (GP) prolonged progression-free survival and overall survival compared with fluorouracil plus cisplatin (FP) as first-line chemotherapy in patients with metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).The cost-effectiveness analysis was designed to identify the economic option for metastatic NPC from a Chinese societal perspective.METHODS: We established a Markov model that involved three health states representing the stages of disease to simulate therapy.Survival data of clinical outcomes were derived from the trial and adjusted to quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).Transition probabilities and health utilities were obtained from the clinical trial and published literatures.The cost-effective strategy was estimated for these treatments using a willing-to-pay (WTP) threshold.A one-way sensitivity analysis was conducted to study the influences of parameters.RESULTS: GP treatment group produced a gain of 0.37 QALYs with an incremental cost of $2520.80, yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $6812.97 per QALY, compared with FP treatment ($15,530.96 versus $13,010.16).The ICER was lower than the accepted WTP threshold, which was 3 times gross domestic product per capita of China ($25,749 per QALY).CONCLUSION: GP regimen is more cost-effective compared with FP regimen as the first-line treatment for Chinese patients with metastatic NPC.",0,0,0,0
31036088,"A multicenter phase III study comparing Simultaneous Integrated Boost (SIB) radiotherapy concurrent and consolidated with S-1 versus SIB alone in elderly patients with esophageal and esophagogastric cancer - the 3JECROG P-01 study protocol.BACKGROUND: The importance of definitive radiotherapy for elderly patients with esophageal and esophagogastric-junction cancer is pronounced.However, little is known in terms of the best way to combine radiotherapy with other treatment options.This study aims to compare the efficiency of SIB radiotherapy alone with SIB radiotherapy concurrent and consolidated with S-1 for elderly patients.Comprehensive geriatric assessment is also incorporated in the procedure of treatment.METHODS/DESIGN: The study is a two arm, open, randomized multicenter Phase III trial with patients over 70 years old with stage IIA-IVB (UICC 2002, IVB only with metastasis to supraclavicular or celiac lymph nodes) squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma of esophagus or gastroesophageal junction.A total of 300 patients will be randomized using a 1:1 allocation ratio stratified by disease stage and study site.Patients allocated to the SIB arm will receive definitive SIB radiotherapy (95%PTV/PGTV 50.4Gy/59.92Gy/28f) while those randomized to SIB + S-1 arm will receive definitive SIB radiotherapy concurrent and consolidated with S-1.The primary endpoint of the trial is 1-year overall survival.Secondary objectives include progression-free survival, recurrence-free survival (local-regional and distant), disease failure pattern, toxicity profile as well as quality of life.Besides, detailed radiotherapy protocol and quality assurance procedure have been incorporated into this trial.DISCUSSION: The proportion of elderly patients in esophageal cancer is now growing, but there is a lack of evidence in term of treatment standard for this group of patients, which is what we aim to obtain through this prospective phase III study.TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov NCT02979691 .Registered November 22, 2016.",1,1,1,0
30807234,"Cyclin E1 Expression and Palbociclib Efficacy in Previously Treated Hormone Receptor-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer.PURPOSE: A large-panel gene expression analysis was conducted to identify biomarkers associated with the effectiveness of adding palbociclib to fulvestrant.METHODS: The PALOMA-3 ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01942135) trial randomly assigned 521 endocrine-pretreated patients with metastatic breast cancer to receive palbociclib plus fulvestrant or placebo plus fulvestrant.Primary analysis was first conducted on 10 genes on the basis of pathway biology and evidence from previous studies followed by a systematic panel-wide search among 2,534 cancer-related genes.The association of gene expression with the effect of palbociclib on progression-free survival (PFS) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, with gene expression as a continuous variable or dichotomized by median.An independent breast cancer cohort from the Preoperative Palbociclib (POP) Clinical Trial ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02008734) was used for validation, in 61 patients with primary breast cancer treated with 2 weeks of palbociclib.RESULTS: In the PALOMA-3 trial, 302 patients had tumor tissue analyzed (palbociclib arm, 194 patients; placebo arm, 108 patients).Palbociclib efficacy was lower in patients with high versus low cyclin E1 (CCNE1) mRNA expression (median PFS: palbociclib arm, 7.6 v 14.1 months; placebo arm, 4.0 v 4.8 months, respectively; interaction P unadjusted = .00238; false discovery rate-adjusted P = .0238).CCNE1 mRNA was more predictive in metastatic than in archival primary biopsy tissue samples.No significant interaction was found between treatment and expression levels of CDK4, CDK6, cyclin D1, and RB1.Palbociclib was efficacious in both luminal A and luminal B tumors.High CCNE1 mRNA expression was associated with poor antiproliferative activity of palbociclib in the POP trial (P = .005).CONCLUSION: Addition of palbociclib to fulvestrant demonstrated efficacy in all biomarker groups, although high CCNE1 mRNA expression was associated with relative resistance to palbociclib.",1,1,1,1
31573911,"Tailored Web-Based Information for Younger and Older Patients with Cancer: Randomized Controlled Trial of a Preparatory Educational Intervention on Patient Outcomes.BACKGROUND: Many patients with cancer, including older patients (aged >/=65 years), consult the Web to prepare for their doctor's visit.In particular, older patients have varying needs regarding the mode in which information is presented (eg, via textual, visual, or audiovisual modes) owing to age-related sensory (eg, impaired vision and hearing) and cognitive decline (eg, reduced processing speed).Therefore, Web-based information targeted at older patient populations is likely to be used and processed more effectively, and evaluated more positively, when tailored to age-related capabilities and preferences.This, in turn, may benefit patient outcomes.OBJECTIVE: This randomized controlled trial tested the effects of a Web-based tailored educational intervention among newly diagnosed younger (<65 years) and older (>/=65 years) patients with cancer.We compared the intervention group who viewed a mode-tailored website (ie, enabling patients to tailor information using textual, visual, and audiovisual modes) with 3 control groups view a nontailored website (ie, text only, text with images, and text with videos).We examined website experience outcomes (ie, website satisfaction, website involvement, knowledge, anxiety, and communication self-efficacy) and consultation experience outcomes (ie, question asking during consultation, anxiety, and information recall).METHODS: Patients from a multidisciplinary outpatient clinic (N=232) viewed a mode-tailored or nontailored website as preparation before their hospital consultations to discuss diagnosis and treatment.Data were collected before (T1), during (T2), and after (T3) visitation.Website experience outcomes were assessed with questionnaires (T1).Patients' question asking was coded from videotaped consultations, and anxiety was assessed through a questionnaire (T2).Telephone interviews were conducted to assess knowledge acquired from the website before (T1) and after consultation (T3), and information recall from the consultation (T3).RESULTS: The preparatory website was well used across all conditions (mean 34 min).Younger patients viewing the mode-tailored website were more satisfied before consultation (P=.02) and reported lower anxiety after consultation (P=.046; vs text only).This pattern was not found in older patients.Mode tailoring yielded no other significant differences in patient outcomes.Regression analyses showed that website involvement (beta=.15; P=.03) and, to a lesser extent, website satisfaction (beta=.15; P=.05) positively associated with knowledge before consultation (T1).In turn, higher knowledge before consultation (beta=.39; P<.001), together with time on the website (beta=.21; P=.002; T1), predicted information recall from consultations (T3).Patients with higher knowledge before consultation (T1) also reported higher knowledge from the website afterward (T3; beta=.22; P=.003).CONCLUSIONS: Offering preparatory online information before consultations benefits information processing and patient outcomes of both younger and older newly diagnosed patients with cancer.Younger patients benefit even more when information is offered in a mode-tailored manner.We discuss the theoretical, methodological, and practical implications for patient-provider communication research in an electronic health era.CLINICAL TRIAL: Netherlands Trial Register NTR5904; https://www.trialregister.nl/trial/5750.",1,1,0,0
23706168,"Difference in overall and age-specific prevalence of high-risk human papillomavirus infection in Italy: evidence from NTCC trial.BACKGROUND: Although among women a decreasing prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection with increasing age has been consistently observed in high-resource countries, different age profiles have been reported elsewhere.METHODS: We compared the age profile of high-risk (HR)-HPV prevalence in nine different areas of Northern and Central Italy by studying the women recruited in the intervention arm of the New Technologies in Cervical Cancer study and tested by Hybrid Capture 2.Differences in the age-distribution of HPV infection were investigated in each centre by the joinpoint approach in a logistic model.46,900 women aged 25 to 60 years were included in the analysis.RESULTS: The HR-HPV age-standardised (on Italian population) prevalence ranged from 5.7% (Trento) to 10.3% (Ravenna).HR-HPV prevalence decreased as a logistic function of increasing age in 6 of 9 centres (Trento, Verona, Florence, Bologna, Imola, and Viterbo).The effect of age on HR-HPV prevalence slopes did not differ significantly among these 6 centres, whereas significant heterogeneity in intercepts (p < 0.001) was found, reflecting different overall HR-HPV prevalence between centres.One significant joinpoint was observed in 2 centres (Padua and Ravenna), indicating that the decrease in HR-HPV prevalence by age was better described using a function composed with two logistic segments.In Padua HR-HPV prevalence decreased only slightly up to 39 years but showed a steep downturn thereafter.In Ravenna HR-HPV prevalence decreased steeply down to 45 years of age and then showed a plateau.Finally, in Turin two significant joinpoints were observed: prevalence decreased only after age 29 and showed a plateau after age 39.CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed substantial differences in overall and age-specific HR-HPV prevalence across Italian areas.These findings may be related to different timing of changes in sexual behaviours across regions.Age-specific HR-HPV prevalence in Italy does not support an influence of age per se.",0,0,0,0

24950280,"Chemotherapy or liver transplantation for nonresectable liver metastases from colorectal cancer?OBJECTIVE: The primary objective was to compare overall survival (OS) in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) with nonresectable liver-only metastases treated by liver transplantation or chemotherapy.BACKGROUND: CRC is the third most common cancer worldwide.About 50% of patients will develop metastatic disease primarily to the liver and the lung.The majority of patients with liver metastases receive palliative chemotherapy, with a median OS of trial patients of about 2 years, and less than 10% are alive at 5 years.METHODS: Patients with nonresectable liver-only CRC metastases underwent liver transplantation in the SECA study (n = 21).Disease-free survival (DFS) and OS of patients included in the SECA study were compared with progression-free survival (PFS) and OS in a similar cohort of CRC patients with liver-only disease included in a first-line chemotherapy study, the NORDIC VII study (n = 47).PFS/DFS and OS were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method.RESULTS: DFS/PFS in both groups were 8 to 10 months.However, a dramatic difference in OS was observed.The 5-year OS rate was 56% in patients undergoing liver transplantation compared with 9% in patients starting first-line chemotherapy.The reason for the large difference in OS despite similar DFS/PFS is likely different metastatic patterns at relapse/progression.Relapse in the liver transplantation group was often detected as small, slowly growing lung metastases, whereas progression of nonresectable liver metastases was observed in the chemotherapy group.CONCLUSIONS: Compared with chemotherapy, liver transplantation resulted in a marked increased OS in CRC patients with nonresectable liver-only metastases.",1,1,1,0

26643072,"A web-based intervention (RESTORE) to support self-management of cancer-related fatigue following primary cancer treatment: a multi-centre proof of concept randomised controlled trial.PURPOSE: Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is a frequent and distressing symptom experienced after cancer treatment.RESTORE is the first web-based resource designed to enhance self-efficacy to manage CRF following curative-intent treatment.The aim of this study is to test the proof of concept and inform the design of an effectiveness trial.METHODS: A multi-centre parallel-group two-armed (1:1) exploratory randomised controlled trial (RCT) with qualitative process evaluation was employed in the study.Participants (>/=18 years; </=5 years post treatment with moderate to severe fatigue) were recruited and randomly assigned to RESTORE or a leaflet.Feasibility and acceptability were measured by recruitment, attrition, intervention adherence, completion of outcome measures and process evaluation.Change in self-efficacy to manage CRF was also explored.Outcome measures were completed at baseline (T0), 6 weeks (T1) and 12 weeks (T2).Data were analysed using mixed-effects linear regression and directed content analysis.RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-three people participated in the trial and 19 in the process evaluation.The intervention was feasible (39 % of eligible patients consented) and acceptable (attrition rate 36 %).There was evidence of higher fatigue self-efficacy at T1 in the intervention group vs comparator (mean difference 0.51 [-0.08 to 1.11]), though the difference in groups decreased by 12 weeks.Time since diagnosis influenced perceived usefulness of the intervention.Modifications were suggested.CONCLUSION: Proof of concept was achieved.The RESTORE intervention should be subject to a definitive trial with some adjustments.Provision of an effective supportive resource would empower cancer survivors to manage CRF after treatment completion.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN67521059.",1,1,0,0
22669453,"Tumor budding is an independent predictor of outcome in AJCC/UICC stage II colorectal cancer.BACKGROUND: In colorectal cancer, the morphology of the invasive tumor margin may reflect aggressiveness of tumor growth, thus providing important prognostic information.The tumor growth pattern according to Jass and the extent of tumor budding were analyzed in patients with American Joint Committee on Cancer/Union for International Cancer Control (AJCC/UICC) stage II disease.METHODS: Tumors of 120 randomly selected patients with AJCC/UICC stage II disease were retrospectively reviewed for tumor growth pattern (expanding vs. infiltrating) and the extent of tumor budding, with high-grade budding reflecting presence of 10 or more budding foci scattered at the invasive tumor margin.Progression-free and cancer-specific survivals were determined by the Kaplan-Meier method.For multivariable analysis, Cox's proportional hazards regression models were performed.RESULTS: The infiltrating growth pattern was significantly associated with histological subtype and lymphovascular invasion, while high-grade budding was significantly associated with tumor grade and lymphovascular invasion.High-grade budding, but not the infiltrating growth pattern, was significantly associated with outcome in univariable analysis.Cox's proportional hazards regression models proved tumor budding to be an independent predictor of disease progression (hazard ratio 3.91, 95 % confidence interval 1.3-11.77; P = 0.02) and cancer-related death (hazard ratio 5.90, 95 % confidence interval 1.62-21.51; P = 0.007).The combination of infiltrating growth pattern and high-grade budding did not have a stronger prognostic significance than tumor budding alone.CONCLUSIONS: Tumor budding independently predicted patient outcome in patients with AJCC/UICC stage II colorectal cancer and may therefore be used for accurate prognostication, patient counseling, and design of clinical trials by using integrated multimodal therapy.",0,0,0,0

22575719,"Experiences with advanced cancer among Latinas in a public health care system.CONTEXT: Cultural dimensions related to illness are triggered at significant times in an illness trajectory, such as at illness onset or when death approaches.These factors influence views on how illness is understood and managed, which is likely more difficult for minority populations.Although Latinos experience barriers to high-quality health care, late-stage cancer diagnoses, and poor health outcomes, little is known about their experiences with advanced, life-threatening cancers.OBJECTIVES: We examined Latinas' experiences with advanced, metastatic cancers to identify sociocultural beliefs that influenced their care.METHODS: We interviewed 24 Latinas taking part in a randomized controlled trial focused on improving quality-of-life outcomes for co-occurring cancer and depression and explored their beliefs about the cause, course, and cure of cancer.This study used a phenomenological analytical approach to explore women's lived experiences of having advanced cancer.RESULTS: Themes revealed issues about experiencing advanced cancer that included the following: initial reactions to cancer, disbelief about the lack of pain, economic impact, beliefs about the cause, coping with cancer, beliefs about the cure, and confusion about cancer severity.Sociocultural factors influence misunderstanding and confusion about cancer care but also can be a source of strength.CONCLUSION: Providers need to become culturally sensitive to the needs of underserved Latinas.Denial or ignorance of these issues can create other problems, such as gaps in patient-centered decision making from diagnosis through the end of life.",0,0,0,0
23031619,"Breast density as indicator for the use of mammography or MRI to screen women with familial risk for breast cancer (FaMRIsc): a multicentre randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: To reduce mortality, women with a family history of breast cancer often start mammography screening at a younger age than the general population.Breast density is high in over 50% of women younger than 50 years.With high breast density, breast cancer incidence increases, but sensitivity of mammography decreases.Therefore, mammography might not be the optimal method for breast cancer screening in young women.Adding MRI increases sensitivity, but also the risk of false-positive results.The limitation of all previous MRI screening studies is that they do not contain a comparison group; all participants received both MRI and mammography.Therefore, we cannot empirically assess in which stage tumours would have been detected by either test.The aim of the Familial MRI Screening Study (FaMRIsc) is to compare the efficacy of MRI screening to mammography for women with a familial risk.Furthermore, we will assess the influence of breast density.METHODS/DESIGN: This Dutch multicentre, randomized controlled trial, with balanced randomisation (1:1) has a parallel grouped design.Women with a cumulative lifetime risk for breast cancer due to their family history of >/=20%, aged 30-55 years are eligible.Identified BRCA1/2 mutation carriers or women with 50% risk of carrying a mutation are excluded.Group 1 receives yearly mammography and clinical breast examination (n = 1000), and group 2 yearly MRI and clinical breast examination, and mammography biennially (n = 1000).Primary endpoints are the number and stage of the detected breast cancers in each arm.Secondary endpoints are the number of false-positive results in both screening arms.Furthermore, sensitivity and positive predictive value of both screening strategies will be assessed.Cost-effectiveness of both strategies will be assessed.Analyses will also be performed with mammographic density as stratification factor.DISCUSSION: Personalized breast cancer screening might optimize mortality reduction with less over diagnosis.Breast density may be a key discriminator for selecting the optimal screening strategy for women < 55 years with familial breast cancer risk; mammography or MRI.These issues are addressed in the FaMRIsc study including high risk women due to a familial predisposition.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Netherland Trial Register NTR2789.",1,1,0,0

23415048,"A prospective trial of real-time magnetic resonance-guided catheter placement in interstitial gynecologic brachytherapy.PURPOSE: To present outcome and toxicity results of the first real-time intraoperative MRI-guided interstitial approach to gynecologic cancer.METHODS AND MATERIALS: From February 2004 to December 2006, 25 patients with gynecologic malignancies were enrolled and treated in a prospective clinical trial of real-time MRI-guided interstitial brachytherapy.This was followed by a confirmatory CT imaging scan.Statistical analyses included Kaplan-Meier estimates for overall and relapse-free survival.RESULTS: MRI visualization of needles during placement permitted accurate placement with no inadvertent insertions.This prevented unnecessary normal-tissue perforation as confirmed by CT simulation.With a mean followup of 3.8 years (range, 2-6.8), 1-, 2-, and 3-year overall survival rates were 80%, 60% and 43%, respectively; corresponding relapse-free survival rates were 79%, 65%, and 59%, respectively.Actuarial acute toxicity rates for any grade were 0% at 0-14 days and 80% (all grade 1) at 14-90 days.Long-term (>180 days) actuarial toxicity rates were 8% gastrointestinal, 4% bladder and 4% vaginal.CONCLUSIONS: Real-time MRI guidance during insertion of interstitial needles followed by 3D-planning maximized opportunities for tumor targeting and sparing of normal tissues.Although image guidance requires additional anesthesia time, clinical outcomes indicate potential for a successful reduction in toxicity using 3D image-guided in addition to 3D image-planned brachytherapy.",0,0,0,0
32079739,"Evaluation of ultrasound-guided rhomboid intercostal nerve block for postoperative analgesia in breast cancer surgery: a prospective, randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Mastectomy has many potential sources of pain.Rhomboid intercostal block (RIB) is a recently described plane block.The primary hypothesis of the study is that ultrasound-guided RIB combined with general anesthesia would accelerate global quality of recovery scores of patients following mastectomy surgery.Secondary hypothesis is that RIB would reduce postoperative opioid consumption, pain scores, and the need for rescue analgesia.METHODS: Patients aged between 18 and 70 years, with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I-II and scheduled for an elective unilateral modified radical mastectomy surgery with axillary lymph node dissection were enrolled to the study.Following endotracheal intubation, patients were randomly allocated into two groups.Patients in the first group (group R) received ultrasound-guided RIB with 30 mL 0.25% bupivacaine.In the control group (group C), no block intervention was applied.All patients received intravenous dexamethasone 8 mg, dexketoprofen trometamol 50 mg intraoperatively and tramadol 1 mg/kg 30 min before the end of surgery for postoperative analgesia.All patients received intravenous morphine patient-controlled analgesia device at the arrival to the recovery room.RESULTS: The descriptive variables of the patients were comparable between group R and group C. Mean quality of recovery-40 score at 24 hours was 164.8+/-3.9 in group R and 153.5+/-5.2 in group C (mean difference 11.4 (95% CI 8.8 to 13.9; p<0.001).At 24th hour, median morphine consumption was 5 mg (IQR 4-7 mg) in group R and 10 mg (IQR 8-13 mg) in group C, p<0.001.Intraoperative fentanyl administration, pain scores and the need for rescue postoperative analgesia was similar between groups.CONCLUSIONS: In the current study, ultrasound-guided RIB promoted enhanced recovery and decreased opioid consumption after mastectomy surgery.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ACTRN12619000879167.",1,1,0,0

A Randomized Placebo-controlled Trial and Mechanistic Insights.Rationale: Effective cough treatments are a significant unmet need in patients with lung cancer.Aprepitant is a licensed treatment for nausea and vomiting, which blocks substance P activation of NK-1 (neurokinin 1) receptors, a mechanism also implicated in cough.Objectives: To assess aprepitant in patients with lung cancer with cough and evaluate mechanisms in vagal nerve tissue.Methods: Randomized double-blind crossover trial of patients with lung cancer and bothersome cough.They received 3 days of aprepitant or matched placebo; after a 3-day washout, patients crossed to the alternative treatment.The primary endpoint was awake cough frequency measured at screening and Day 3 of each treatment; secondary endpoints included patient-reported outcomes.In vitro, the depolarization of isolated guinea pig and human vagus nerve sections in grease-gap recording chambers, indicative of sensory nerve activation, was measured to evaluate the mechanism.Measurements and Main Results: Twenty patients with lung cancer enrolled, with a mean age 66 years (+/-7.7); 60% were female and 80% had non-small cell cancer, 50% had advanced stage, and 55% had World Health Organization performance status 1.Cough frequency improved with aprepitant, reducing by 22.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.8-37.7%) over placebo while awake (P = 0.03), 30.3% (95% CI, 12.7-44.3) over 24 hours (P = 0.002), and 59.8% (95% CI, 15.1-86.0) during sleep (P = 0.081).Patient-reported outcomes all significantly improved.Substance P depolarized both guinea pig and human vagus nerve.Aprepitant significantly inhibited substance P-induced depolarization by 78% in guinea pig (P = 0.0145) and 94% in human vagus (P = 0.0145).Conclusions: Substance P activation of NK-1 receptors appears to be an important mechanism driving cough in lung cancer, and NK-1 antagonists show promise as antitussive therapies.",1,1,0,0
26878247,"Dual-focus versus conventional magnification endoscopy for the diagnosis of superficial squamous neoplasms in the pharynx and esophagus: a randomized trial.BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Conventional magnification narrow-band imaging (CM-NBI) endoscopy has demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy for superficial squamous neoplasms in the pharynx and esophagus.This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic utility of the newly developed dual-focus NBI (DF-NBI) compared with that of CM-NBI.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We recruited patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in the head and neck, or esophagus, or with a history of SCC.The primary endpoint of this prospective controlled non-inferiority trial was the sensitivity of DF-NBI and CM-NBI for detecting superficial carcinoma in the pharynx and esophagus.Secondary endpoints included other diagnostic values and the resolving power of each endoscope.Superficial carcinoma was defined as high grade dysplasia and SCC invading up to the submucosal layer.RESULTS: The study included 93 patients.A total of 28 superficial carcinomas were detected in the pharynx and esophagus.The sensitivities of DF-NBI and CM-NBI for superficial carcinoma were 82 % and 71 %, respectively.The lower limit of the 90 % confidence interval for the difference between the sensitivities exceeded the non-inferiority threshold.The specificity and overall accuracy of DF-NBI vs. CM-NBI were 93 % vs. 90 % and 91 % vs. 86 %, respectively (both non-significant differences).The maximum resolving power of a conventional magnification endoscope was significantly higher than a dual-focus endoscope (7.2 microm vs. 11.6 microm: P < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate the non-inferiority of DF-NBI versus CM-NBI in detecting superficial carcinoma in the pharynx and esophagus.DF-NBI appears to have a resolving power that, although significantly lower, is sufficient to achieve high diagnostic accuracy, comparable to that of CM-NBI.University Hospital Medical Information Network (UMIN, No. 000007585).",0,0,0,0
29849515,"Effect of Community-Based Occupational Therapy on Health-Related Quality of Life and Engagement in Meaningful Activities of Women with Breast Cancer.We aimed to evaluate the short-term effects of community-based occupational therapy on health-related quality of life and engagement in meaningful activities among women with breast cancer.An open label randomized controlled trial study design was applied.The participants were members of various societies of women with cancer.In total, 22 women have participated in the study.Participants of the experimental group (n = 11) participated in a 6-week community-based occupational therapy program and the usual activities of various societies, whereas the control group (n = 11) women participated in the usual activities of the societies only.1 of the participants withdrew during the course; therefore 21 completed the study successfully.Participants of both groups were assessed for health-related quality of life and the participants of the experimental group were assessed for engagement in meaningful activities.The evaluation was carried out during the nonacute period of the disease-at the beginning of the study and after 6 weeks.Women of the experimental group demonstrated statistically significantly better scores in the global quality of life, role functions, physical, emotional, cognitive, and social functions, fatigue, insomnia, financial impact, systemic therapy side effects, and breast symptoms scales compared to the control group participants (p < 0.05) after the 6 weeks, as measured by the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire and its breast cancer module QLQ-BR23.Furthermore, women of the experimental group demonstrated significant greater engagement in meaningful activities when applying community-based occupational therapy (p < 0.05), as measured by using the Engagement in Meaningful Activities Survey (EMAS).The evaluation of the associations between the women's engagement in meaningful activities and changes in health-related quality of life showed that greater engagement in meaningful activities was associated with better emotional functions and a lower level of insomnia (p < 0.05).Based on the results of our study, we recommend applying occupational therapy in the field of community healthcare in order to maintain or improve breast cancer patients' health-related quality of life and suggest involving women into meaningful activities during community-based occupational therapy after clarifying which activities are important to them.",1,1,0,0

22614994,"Reach out to enhance wellness home-based diet-exercise intervention promotes reproducible and sustainable long-term improvements in health behaviors, body weight, and physical functioning in older, overweight/obese cancer survivors.PURPOSE: Diet and exercise interventions have been tested in cancer survivors as a means to reduce late effects and comorbidity, but few have assessed adherence and health outcomes long term.METHODS: Between July 2005 and May 2007, the Reach Out to Enhance Wellness (RENEW) trial accrued 641 locoregionally staged, long-term (>/= 5 years from diagnosis) colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer survivors in the United States (21 states), Canada, and the United Kingdom.All participants were sedentary (< 150 minutes of physical activity [PA] a week), overweight or obese (body mass index, 25 to 40 kg/m(2)), and over age 65 years.The trial tested a diet-exercise intervention delivered via mailed print materials and telephone counseling.RENEW used a wait-list control, cross-over design (ie, participants received the year-long intervention immediately or after a 1-year delay), which allowed the opportunity to assess program efficacy (previously reported primary outcome), durability, and reproducibility (reported herein).Measures included diet quality (DQ), PA, BMI, and physical function (PF).RESULTS: No significant relapse was observed in the immediate-intervention arm for DQ, PA, and BMI; however, rates of functional decline increased when the intervention ceased.From year 1 to year 2, significant improvements were observed in the delayed-intervention arm; mean change scores in behaviors and BMI and PF slopes were as follows: DQ score, 5.2 (95% CI, 3.4 to 7.0); PA, 45.8 min/wk (95% CI, 26.9 to 64.6 min/wk); BMI, -0.56 (95% CI, -0.75 to -0.36); and Short Form-36 PF, -1.02 versus -5.52 (P < .001 for all measures).Overall, both arms experienced significant improvements in DQ, PA, and BMI from baseline to 2-year follow-up (P < .001).CONCLUSION: Older cancer survivors respond favorably to lifestyle interventions and make durable changes in DQ and PA that contribute to sustained weight loss.These changes positively reorient functional decline trajectories during intervention delivery.",1,1,0,0
25968598,"Effect of Sulforaphane in Men with Biochemical Recurrence after Radical Prostatectomy.Increases in serum levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) occur commonly in prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy and are designated ""biochemical recurrence."" Because the phytochemical sulforaphane has been studied extensively as an anticancer agent, we performed a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter trial with sulforaphane in 78 patients (mean age, 69 +/- 6 years) with increasing PSA levels after radical prostatectomy.Treatment comprised daily oral administration of 60 mg of a stabilized free sulforaphane for 6 months (M0-M6) followed by 2 months without treatment (M6-M8).The study was designed to detect a 0.012 log (ng/mL)/month decrease in the log PSA slope in the sulforaphane group from M0 to M6.The primary endpoint was not reached.For secondary endpoints, median log PSA slopes were consistently lower in sulforaphane-treated men.Mean changes in PSA levels between M6 and M0 were significantly lower in the sulforaphane group (+0.099 +/- 0.341 ng/mL) than in placebo (+0.620 +/- 1.417 ng/mL; P = 0.0433).PSA doubling time was 86% longer in the sulforaphane than in the placebo group (28.9 and 15.5 months, respectively).PSA increases >20% at M6 were significantly greater in the placebo group (71.8%) than in the sulforaphane group (44.4%); P = 0.0163.Compliance and tolerance were very good.Sulforaphane effects were prominent after 3 months of intervention (M3-M6).After treatment, PSA slopes from M6 to M8 remained the same in the 2 arms.Daily administration of free sulforaphane shows promise in managing biochemical recurrences in prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.",1,1,1,0

A non-inferiority design with a 6% noninferiority margin and null hypothesis (H0) that the infection risk is at least 6% higher in the experimental (E) than in the control (C) group; H0: C (AMP-group) - E (no AMP-group) >/= Delta (6% noninferiority margin).A multivariable, logistic regression was performed for AMP and post-TURB fever with covariates: tumor size and (clot-) retention.The R Project((R)) for statistical computing was used for statistical analysis and a p value of 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.RESULTS: 459 Patients were included and 202/459 (44.1%) received AMP vs 257/459 (55.9%) without AMP.Fever occurred in 6/202 [2.9%; 95% CI (1.2-6.6%)] patients with AMP vs 8/257 [3.1%; 95% CI (1.5%-6.1%)] without AMP (p = 0.44).Multivariable, logistic regression showed no significant harm in omitting AMP when controlled for (clot-)retention and tumor size (p = 0.85) and an adjusted risk difference in developing post-TURB fever of 0.0016; 95% CI [- 0.029; 0.032].CONCLUSION: Our data suggest the safety of omitting AMP in patients undergoing TURB without an indwelling, pre-operative catheter/nephrostomy/DJ and a negative pre-operative urinary culture.",1,1,0,0
33549682,"Computer-tailored intervention increases colorectal cancer screening among low-income African Americans in primary care: Results of a randomized trial.INTRODUCTION: Although African Americans have the highest colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality rates of any racial group, their screening rates remain low.STUDY DESIGN/PURPOSE: This randomized controlled trial compared efficacy of two clinic-based interventions for increasing CRC screening among African American primary care patients.METHODS: African American patients from 11 clinics who were not current with CRC screening were randomized to receive a computer-tailored intervention (n = 335) or a non-tailored brochure (n = 358) designed to promote adherence to CRC screening.Interventions were delivered in clinic immediately prior to a provider visit.Univariate and multivariable logistic regression models analyzed predictors of screening test completion.Moderators and mediators were determined using multivariable linear and logistic regression analyses.RESULTS: Significant effects of the computer-tailored intervention were observed for completion of a stool blood test (SBT) and completion of any CRC screening test (SBT or colonoscopy).The colonoscopy screening rate was higher among those receiving the computer-tailored intervention group compared to the nontailored brochure but the difference was not significant.Predictors of SBT completion were: receipt of the computer-tailored intervention; being seen at a Veterans Affairs Medical Center clinic; baseline stage of adoption; and reason for visit.Mediators of intervention effects were changes in perceived SBT barriers, changes in perceived colonoscopy benefits, changes in CRC knowledge, and patient-provider discussion.Moderators of intervention effects were age, employment, and family/friend recommendation of screening.CONCLUSION: This one-time computer-tailored intervention significantly improved CRC screening rates among low-income African American patients.This finding was largely driven by increasing SBT but the impact of the intervention on colonoscopy screening was strong.Implementation of a CRC screening quality improvement program in the VA site that included provision of stool blood test kits and follow-up likely contributed to the strong intervention effect observed at that site.The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT00672828.",1,0,0,0
23173717,"Are mammographic changes in the tumor bed more pronounced after intraoperative radiotherapy for breast cancer? Subgroup analysis from a randomized trial (TARGIT-A).Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) with low-energy x-rays is increasingly used in breast-conserving therapy (BCT).Previous non-randomized studies have observed mammographic changes in the tumor bed to be more pronounced after IORT.The purpose of this study was to reassess the postoperative changes in a randomized single-center subgroup of patients from a multicenter trial (TARGIT-A).In this subgroup (n = 48) 27 patients received BCT with IORT, 21 patients had BCT with standard whole-breast radiotherapy serving as controls.Overall 258 postoperative mammograms (median follow-up 4.3 years, range 3-8) were retrospectively evaluated by two radiologists in consensus focusing on changes in the tumor bed.Fat necroses showed to be significantly more frequent (56% versus 24%) and larger (8.7 versus 1.6 sq cm, median) after IORT than those in controls.Scar calcifications were also significantly more frequent after IORT (63% versus 19%).The high incidence of large fat necroses in our study confirms previous study findings.However, the overall higher incidence of calcifications in the tumor bed after IORT represents a new finding, requiring further attention.",0,0,0,0
34367541,"Artificial Intelligence Algorithm-Based Ultrasound Image Segmentation Technology in the Diagnosis of Breast Cancer Axillary Lymph Node Metastasis.This paper aimed to investigate the application of ultrasound image segmentation technology based on the back propagation neural network (BPNN) artificial intelligence algorithm in the diagnosis of breast cancer axillary lymph node metastasis, thereby providing a theoretical basis for clinical diagnosis.In this study, 90 breast cancer patients with axillary lymph node metastasis were selected as the research objects and rolled randomly into an experimental group and a control group.Besides, all of them were examined by ultrasound.The BPNN algorithm for the ultrasound image segmentation diagnosis method was applied to the patiens from the experimental group, while the control group was given routine ultrasound diagnosis.Thus, the value of this algorithm in ultrasonic diagnosis was compared and explored.The results showed that when the number of hidden layer nodes based on the BPNN artificial intelligence algorithm was 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, the corresponding segmentation accuracy was 97.3%, 96.5%, 94.8%, 94.8%, and 94.1% in turn.Among them, the segmentation accuracy was the highest when the number of hidden layer nodes was 2.The correlation of independent variable bubble plot analysis showed that the presence or absence of capsules, the presence of crab feet or burrs in breast cancer lesions was critical influencing factors for the occurrence of axillary lymph node metastasis, and the standardized importance was 99.7% and 70.8%, respectively.Besides, the area under the two-dimensional receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the BPNN artificial intelligence algorithm model classification was always greater than the area under the curve of manual segmentation, and the segmentation accuracy was 90.31%, 94.88%, 95.48%, 95.44%, and 97.65% in sequence.In addition, the segmentation specificity of different running times was higher than that of manual segmentation.In conclusion, the BPNN artificial intelligence algorithm had high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for ultrasound image segmentation, with a better segmentation effect.Therefore, it had a better diagnostic effect for breast cancer axillary lymph node metastasis.",0,0,0,0
33429441,"Evaluation of the effects of an artificial intelligence system on endoscopy quality and preliminary testing of its performance in detecting early gastric cancer: a randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is a prerequisite for detecting upper gastrointestinal lesions especially early gastric cancer (EGC).An artificial intelligence system has been shown to monitor blind spots during EGD.In this study, we updated the system (ENDOANGEL), verified its effectiveness in improving endoscopy quality, and pretested its performance in detecting EGC in a multicenter randomized controlled trial.METHODS: ENDOANGEL was developed using deep convolutional neural networks and deep reinforcement learning.Patients undergoing EGD in five hospitals were randomly assigned to the ENDOANGEL-assisted group or to a control group without use of ENDOANGEL.The primary outcome was the number of blind spots.Secondary outcomes included performance of ENDOANGEL in predicting EGC in a clinical setting.RESULTS: 1050 patients were randomized, and 498 and 504 patients in the ENDOANGEL and control groups, respectively, were analyzed.Compared with the control group, the ENDOANGEL group had fewer blind spots (mean 5.38 [standard deviation (SD) 4.32] vs. 9.82 [SD 4.98]; P < 0.001) and longer inspection time (5.40 [SD 3.82] vs. 4.38 [SD 3.91] minutes; P < 0.001).In the ENDOANGEL group, 196 gastric lesions with pathological results were identified.ENDOANGEL correctly predicted all three EGCs (one mucosal carcinoma and two high grade neoplasias) and two advanced gastric cancers, with a per-lesion accuracy of 84.7 %, sensitivity of 100 %, and specificity of 84.3 % for detecting gastric cancer.CONCLUSIONS: In this multicenter study, ENDOANGEL was an effective and robust system to improve the quality of EGD and has the potential to detect EGC in real time.",1,0,0,0
25435541,"Population testing for cancer predisposing BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations in the Ashkenazi-Jewish community: a randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Technological advances raise the possibility of systematic population-based genetic testing for cancer-predisposing mutations, but it is uncertain whether benefits outweigh disadvantages.We directly compared the psychological/quality-of-life consequences of such an approach to family history (FH)-based testing.METHODS: In a randomized controlled trial of BRCA1/2 gene-mutation testing in the Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) population, we compared testing all participants in the population screening (PS) arm with testing those fulfilling standard FH-based clinical criteria (FH arm).Following a targeted community campaign, AJ participants older than 18 years were recruited by self-referral after pretest genetic counseling.The effects of BRCA1/2 genetic testing on acceptability, psychological impact, and quality-of-life measures were assessed by random effects regression analysis.All statistical tests were two-sided.RESULTS: One thousand, one hundred sixty-eight AJ individuals were counseled, 1042 consented, 1034 were randomly assigned (691 women, 343 men), and 1017 were eligible for analysis.Mean age was 54.3 (SD = 14.66) years.Thirteen BRCA1/2 carriers were identified in the PS arm, nine in the FH arm.Five more carriers were detected among FH-negative FH-arm participants following study completion.There were no statistically significant differences between the FH and PS arms at seven days or three months on measures of anxiety, depression, health anxiety, distress, uncertainty, and quality-of-life.Contrast tests indicated that overall anxiety (P = .0001) and uncertainty (P = .005) associated with genetic testing decreased; positive experience scores increased (P = .0001); quality-of-life and health anxiety did not change with time.Overall, 56% of carriers did not fulfill clinical criteria for genetic testing, and the BRCA1/2 prevalence was 2.45%.CONCLUSION: Compared with FH-based testing, population-based genetic testing in Ashkenazi Jews doesn't adversely affect short-term psychological/quality-of-life outcomes and may detect 56% additional BRCA carriers.",1,0,0,0
32409106,"Safety Analysis of Five Randomized Controlled Studies of Daratumumab in Patients With Multiple Myeloma.BACKGROUND: Multiple studies have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of daratumumab for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM) and primary treatment for transplant-eligible and -ineligible patients.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted an integrated safety analysis to characterize the frequency, severity, natural history, and outcomes of adverse events (AEs) with daratumumab versus comparators.Data were pooled from 5 completed phase III randomized controlled studies that had included 1798 daratumumab-treated and 1797 comparator-treated patients with MM as a first line in both transplant-eligible and transplant-ineligible patients and for relapsed/refractory disease.Safety analyses included reporting of AEs using crude and exposure-adjusted incidence rates.RESULTS: The median follow-up duration was 16.84 months (range, 7.4-28 months) for both daratumumab-treated and comparator-treated patients.Discontinuation for any reason occurred less often with daratumumab (22% vs. 33.9%), although discontinuation because of AEs occurred at similar rates (25% vs. 26%) as did deaths owing to AEs (2.25% vs. 1.84%).When adjusted for exposure, neutropenia, lymphopenia, diarrhea, fatigue, dyspnea, pneumonia, and hypertension were the only common grade 3/4 AEs reported more often with daratumumab than with the comparators.The prevalence of common grade 3/4 AEs with daratumumab were < 7% apart from neutropenia, lymphopenia, and pneumonia (45.9% vs. 32.3%, 13% vs. 7.5%, and 10.6% vs. 7.2%, respectively).Grade 3/4 daratumumab infusion-related reactions happened in 3.8% of patients.The majority of infusion-related reactions occurred after the first infusion.CONCLUSIONS: These results from an integrated analysis support a favorable benefit/risk profile of daratumumab in patients with MM.",0,0,0,0
24737199,"Associations between circulating 1,25(OH)(2)D concentration and odds of metachronous colorectal adenoma.Cellular-level studies demonstrate that the availability of the secosteroid hormone 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D] to colon cells promotes anti-carcinogenic activities.Although epidemiological data are relatively sparse, suggestive inverse trends have been reported between circulating 1,25(OH)2D concentration and colorectal neoplasia.We therefore sought to evaluate the relationship between circulating 1,25(OH)2D concentrations and odds for metachronous colorectal adenomas among 1,151 participants from a randomized trial of ursodeoxycholic acid for colorectal adenoma prevention.No relationship between 1,25(OH)2D and overall odds for metachronous lesions was observed, with ORs (95% CIs) of 0.80 (0.60-1.07) and 0.81 (0.60-1.10) for participants in the second and third tertiles, respectively, compared with those in the lowest (p-trend = 0.17).However, a statistically significant inverse association was observed between circulating 1,25(OH)2D concentration and odds of proximal metachronous adenoma, with an OR (95% CI) of 0.71 (0.52-0.98) for individuals in the highest tertile of 1,25(OH)2D compared with those in the lowest (p-trend = 0.04).While there was no relationship overall between 1,25(OH)2D and metachronous distal lesions, there was a significantly reduced odds for women, but not men, in the highest 1,25(OH)2D tertile compared with the lowest (OR 0.53; 95% CI 0.27-1.03; p-trend = 0.05; p-interaction = 0.08).The observed differences in associations with proximal and distal adenomas could indicate that delivery and activity of vitamin D metabolites in different anatomic sites in the colorectum varies, particularly by gender.These results identify novel associations between 1,25(OH)2D and metachronous proximal and distal colorectal adenoma, and suggest that future studies are needed to ascertain potential mechanistic differences in 1,25(OH)2D action in the colorectum.",0,0,0,0

RESULTS: The intervention was associated with increased physical activity (beta = 0.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.14;0.59), general self-efficacy (beta = 2.41, 95%CI = 0.35;4.73), and mastery (beta = 1.75, 95%CI = 0.36;2.78).Further, the intervention had both a direct effect on fatigue (beta = -1.09, 95%CI = -2.12;0.01), and an indirect effect (beta = -0.54, 95%CI = -1.00;-0.21) via physical activity (beta = -0.29, 95%CI = -0.64;-0.07) and general self-efficacy (beta = -0.25, 95%CI = -0.61;-0.05).The intervention had a borderline significant direct effect on reduced distress (beta = -1.32, 95%CI = -2.68;0.11), and a significant indirect effect via increased general self-efficacy and mastery (beta = -1.06, 95%CI = -1.89;-0.38).Reductions in fatigue (beta = -1.33, 95%CI =-1.85;-0.83) and distress (beta = -0.86, 95%CI = -1.25;-0.52) were associated with improved QoL. Further, increased physical activity was directly associated with improved QoL (beta = 3.37, 95%CI = 1.01;5.54).CONCLUSION: The beneficial effect of group-based physical exercise on QoL was mediated by increased physical activity, general self-efficacy and mastery, and subsequent reductions in fatigue and distress.In addition to physical activity, future interventions should target self-efficacy and mastery.This may lead to reduced distress and fatigue, and consequently improved QoL of cancer survivors.",1,1,0,0
29771337,"Randomized Trial of the Impact of Empowering Childhood Cancer Survivors With Survivorship Care Plans.Background: A survivorship care plan (SCP), that is, individualized treatment summary and schedule of off-therapy surveillance, will be mandated by January 2019.It is unclear whether SCPs improve adherence to recommended follow-up care in the community.In this trial, we evaluated the impact of randomly assigning childhood cancer survivors to 1) SCPs to be taken to their primary care physician (PCP) to implement or 2) survivorship clinic (SC) on health care quality measures.Methods: Eligibility included cancer diagnosis younger than age 18 years (2000-2012), cancer free, one or more years off therapy, and no prior survivorship clinic attendance.At 12 months, the random assignment groups were compared (SCP+PCP vs SC) by intent-to-treat analysis with two-sided statistical tests in terms of patient adherence to guideline-recommended surveillance tests (eg, echocardiogram) and number of newly identified late complications of therapy.Results: From 2011 to 2013, 96 participants (46.9% female, mean age = 15.9 +/- 6.1 years) were randomly assigned.Adherence to 14 evaluated guideline-recommended surveillance tests ranged from 0% to 46.9% in the SCP+PCP group (n = 47) and from 50.0% to 86.4% in the SC group (n = 47).Adherence to 10 tests was statistically significantly different between the groups (all P < .05).One mild new late complication was identified in the SCP+PCP group compared with 21 late complications, ranging from mild to severe, identified in 11 patients in the SC group (2.1% vs 23.4% of patients, respectively, P = .003).Conclusions: Our randomized trial suggests that empowering childhood cancer survivors with SCPs to be implemented by their PCPs is not sufficient to meet consensus follow-up recommendations.",1,1,0,0
26291768,"Docetaxel Alone or in Combination With a Therapeutic Cancer Vaccine (PANVAC) in Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer: A Randomized Clinical Trial.IMPORTANCE: Previous phase 1 and 2 trials of PANVAC, a poxviral-based cancer vaccine, have suggested clinical efficacy in some patients with breast, ovarian, and colorectal cancer and have shown evidence of immunologic activity.Preclinical data have shown that docetaxel can modify tumor phenotype, making tumor cells more amenable to T cell-mediated killing.OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to determine if the treatment combination of docetaxel and PANVAC improves clinical outcomes in patients with metastatic breast cancer compared with docetaxel treatment alone.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Between May 2006 and February 2012, this open-label, phase 2 randomized clinical trial enrolled 48 patients with metastatic breast cancer of all subtypes, without limitation on other lines of previous therapy, to receive treatment with either docetaxel with PANVAC (arm A) or docetaxel alone (arm B).Final clinical data were collected on September 16, 2013.All patients were treated at either the National Cancer Institute or the Department of Breast Medical Oncology, MD Anderson Cancer Center.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS), using a phase 2.5 statistical design, with the intent of identifying a trend toward benefit (defined as 1-sided P</=.10) to guide a larger trial design.Secondary end points included safety and immunologic correlative studies.RESULTS: Forty-eight participants were enrolled: 25 were randomized to the combination treatment arm A, and 23 to arm B. No patient remained in the study at the time of the final analysis.Patient and tumor characteristics were well matched.Analysis of adverse events in both treatment arms demonstrated very little difference between the 2 groups.In the combination treatment arm (arm A), statistically significant increases were noted in the frequency of grades 1 and 2 edema (P=.02, likely related to greater median number of docetaxel cycles) and injection-site reactions (P<.001).In the final data analysis, median PFS was 7.9 months in arm A vs 3.9 months in arm B (hazard ratio, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.34-1.14]; P=.09).CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results suggest that the combination of PANVAC with docetaxel in metastatic breast cancer may provide a clinical benefit.This study was hypothesis generating and provides both rationale and statistical assumptions for a larger definitive randomized study.TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00179309.",1,1,1,0
30305115,"Molecular profiling of hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancers from patients treated with neoadjuvant endocrine therapy in the CARMINA 02 trial (UCBG-0609).BACKGROUND: Postmenopausal women with large, hormone receptor (HR)-positive/HER2-negative and low-proliferative breast cancer derived a benefit from neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (NET) in the CARMINA02 trial.This study was designed to correlate gene expression and mutation profiles with both response to NET and prognosis.METHODS: Gene expression profiling using RNA sequencing was performed in 86 pre-NET and post-NET tumor samples.Targeted next-generation sequencing of 91 candidate breast cancer-associated genes was performed on DNA samples from 89 patients.Molecular data were correlated with radiological response and relapse-free survival.RESULTS: The transcriptional profile of tumors to NET in responders involved immune-associated genes enriched in activated Th1 pathway, which remained unchanged in non-responders.Immune response was confirmed by analysis of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs).The percentage of TILs was significantly increased post-NET compared to pre-NET samples in responders (p = 0.0071), but not in non-responders (p = 0.0938).Gene expression revealed that lipid metabolism was the main molecular function related to prognosis, while PPARgamma is the most important upstream regulator gene.The most frequently mutated genes were PIK3CA (48.3%), CDH1 (20.2%), PTEN (15.7%), TP53 (10.1%), LAMA2 (10.1%), BRCA2 (9.0%), MAP3K1 (7.9%), ALK (6.7%), INPP4B (6.7%), NCOR1 (6.7%), and NF1 (5.6%).Cell cycle and apoptosis pathway and PIK3CA/AKT/mTOR pathway were altered significantly more frequently in non-responders than in responders (p = 0.0017 and p = 0.0094, respectively).The average number of mutations per sample was significantly higher in endocrine-resistant tumors (2.88 vs. 1.64, p = 0.03), but no difference was observed in terms of prognosis.ESR1 hotspot mutations were detected in 3.4% of treatment-naive tumors.CONCLUSIONS: The Th1-related immune system and lipid metabolism appear to play key roles in the response to endocrine therapy and prognosis in HR-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer.Deleterious somatic mutations in the cell cycle and apoptosis pathway and PIK3CA/AKT/mTOR pathway may be relevant for clinical management.TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov ( NCT00629616 ) on March 6, 2008, retrospectively registered.",0,0,0,0
30408319,"The effect of preoperative chemotherapy on histological subtyping and staging of Wilms tumors: The United Kingdom Children's Cancer Study Group (UKCCSG) Wilms tumor trial 3 (UKW3) experience.BACKGROUND: Two principal approaches to Wilms tumor (WT) treatment are immediate surgery (IS) and preoperative chemotherapy (PCT), and both treatments use the risk-adapted approach that includes histological subclassification of the tumor, combined with additional prognostic factors.In the UKW3 trial, these two approaches were compared.The aim of the present study was to compare histological features between the two groups, to assess the impact of PCT on distribution of histological subtyping and staging and to evaluate whether PCT resulted in more staging discrepancies between local and central pathology review (CPR).MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cases were identified from the UKW3 trial database.The criteria for inclusion in the study were unilateral, nonmetastatic, nonanaplastic WTs, and submitted for CPR with an adequate number of slides.They were subclassified according to the NWTS and later the SIOP 9301 criteria.RESULTS: There were 244 WTs in the IS and 182 in the PCT group subclassified as follows: blastemal 86 (35%) vs 9 (5%), epithelial 34 (14%) vs 12 (7%), stromal 12 (5%) vs 25 (14%), mixed 112 (46%) vs 45 (25%), respectively, plus 40% regressive and 10% completely necrotic WTs in the PCT group.The differences between the two groups for blastemal and mixed types were statistically significant.In the PCT group, there was a significant decrease in stage III tumors.The discrepancies in staging between local and CPR were not significant.CONCLUSION: PCT significantly altered histological features and typing of WTs.It resulted in fewer stage III tumors, and staging discrepancies were equally represented in both groups.",0,0,0,0
32889876,"Assessment of Robotic Versus Laparoscopic Distal Gastrectomy for Gastric Cancer: A Randomized Controlled Trial.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the short-term outcomes of patients with GC who received RDG or LDG.SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Despite the increasing use of RDG in patients with GC, its safety and efficacy compared to those of LDG have not been elucidated in a randomized controlled trial.METHODS: Three hundred patients with cT1-4a and N0/+ between September 2017 and January 2020 were enrolled in this randomized controlled trial at a high-volume hospital in China.The short-term outcomes were compared between the groups.RESULTS: The modified intention-to-treat analysis included data from 283 patients (RDG group: n = 141) and (LDG group: n = 142).Patients in the RDG group exhibited faster postoperative recovery, milder inflammatory responses, and reduced postoperative morbidity (9.2% vs 17.6%, respectively, P = 0.039).Higher extraperigastric lymph nodes (LNs) were retrieved in the RDG group (17.6 +/- 5.8 vs 15.8 +/- 6.6, P = 0.018) with lower noncompliance rate (7.7% vs 16.9%, respectively, P = 0.006).Additionally, patients in the RDG group were more likely to initiate adjuvant chemotherapy earlier [median (interquartile range) postoperative days: 28 (24-32) vs 32 (26-42), P = 0.003].Although total hospital costs were higher in the robotic group than in the laparoscopic group, the direct cost was lower for RDG than for LDG (all P < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: RDG is associated with a lower morbidity rate, faster recovery, milder inflammatory responses, and improved lymphadenectomy.Additionally, faster postoperative recovery in the RDG group enables early initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy.Our results provide evidence for the application of RDG in patients with GC.",1,1,1,0
25556937,"Opportunistic testing versus organized prostate-specific antigen screening: outcome after 18 years in the Goteborg randomized population-based prostate cancer screening trial.BACKGROUND: It has been shown that organized screening decreases prostate cancer (PC) mortality, but the effect of opportunistic screening is largely unknown.OBJECTIVE: To compare the ability to reduce PC mortality and the risk of overdiagnosis between organized and opportunistic screening.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Goteborg screening study invited 10 000 randomly selected men for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing every 2 yr since 1995, with a prostate biopsy recommended for men with PSA >/=2.5 ng/ml.The control group of 10 000 men not invited has been exposed to a previously reported increased rate of opportunistic PSA testing.Both groups were followed until December 31, 2012.OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Observed cumulative PC incidence and mortality rates in both groups were calculated using the actuarial method.Using historical data from 1990-1994 (pre-PSA era), we calculated expected PC incidence and mortality rates in the absence of any PSA testing.The number needed to invite (NNI) and the number needed to diagnose (NND) were calculated by comparing the expected versus observed incidence and mortality rates.RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: At 18 yr, 1396 men were diagnosed with PC and 79 men died of PC in the screening group, compared to 962 and 122, respectively, in the control group.In the screening group, the observed cumulative PC incidence/mortality was 16%/0.98% compared to expected values of 6.8%/1.7%.The corresponding values for the control group were 11%/1.5% and 6.9%/1.7%.Organized screening was associated with an absolute PC-specific mortality reduction of 0.72% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.50-0.94%) and relative risk reduction of 42% (95% CI 28-54%).There was an absolute reduction in PC deaths of 0.20% (95% CI -0.06% to 0.47%) and a relative risk reduction of 12% (95% CI -5 to 26%) associated with opportunistic PSA testing.NNI and NND were 139 (95% CI 107-200) and 13 for organized biennial screening and 493 (95% CI 213- -1563) and 23 for opportunistic screening.The extent of opportunistic screening could not be measured; incidence trends were used as a proxy.CONCLUSIONS: Organized screening reduces PC mortality but is associated with overdiagnosis.Opportunistic PSA testing had little if any effect on PC mortality and resulted in more overdiagnosis, with almost twice the number of men needed to be diagnosed to save one man from dying from PC compared to men offered an organized biennial screening program.PATIENT SUMMARY: Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening within the framework of an organized program seems more effective than unorganized screening.",0,0,0,0
29346040,"Bevacizumab Maintenance Versus No Maintenance During Chemotherapy-Free Intervals in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer: A Randomized Phase III Trial (PRODIGE 9).Purpose Conflicting results are reported for maintenance treatment with bevacizumab during chemotherapy-free intervals (CFI) in metastatic colorectal cancer after induction chemotherapy.Patients and Methods In this open-label, phase III, randomized controlled trial, we compared the tumor control duration (TCD) observed with bevacizumab maintenance and with no treatment (observation) during CFI subsequent to induction chemotherapy with 12 cycles of fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan plus bevacizumab.After disease progression, the induction regimen was repeated for eight cycles, followed by a new CFI.Results From March 2010 to July 2013, 491 patients were randomly assigned.Disease progression or death occurred during induction chemotherapy in 85 patients (17%); 261 patients (53%) had at least one reinduction, 107 (22%) had two reinductions, and 56 (11%) had three or more reinductions.The median TCD was 15 months in both groups; the median progression-free survival (PFS) from randomization was 9.2 and 8.9 months in the maintenance group and observation groups, respectively.The TCD observed in both groups was higher compared with the TCD hypotheses of the trial.The median overall survival (OS) was 21.7 and 22.0 months in the maintenance and observation groups, respectively.In the per-protocol population, defined as patients with at least one reinduction after the first progression, the median duration of the first CFI was 4.3 months in both arms; the median TCD was 17.8 and 23.3 months ( P = .339), the median PFS was 9.9 and 9.5 months, and the median OS was 27.6 and 28.5 months in the maintenance and observation groups, respectively.Multivariable analysis revealed that female gender, WHO performance status >/= 2, and unresected primary tumors were associated with a shorter TCD.Conclusion Bevacizumab maintenance monotherapy did not improve TCD, CFI duration, PFS, or OS.",1,1,1,0

And the CTDIvol of group A (5.2 +/- 1.2 mGy) was obviously lower than that of group B (13.5 +/- 4.7 mGy) (P < 0.01).CONCLUSION: For patients of BMI </= 22 kg/m(2), low tube voltage and low contrast medium concentration scan condition with 50% ASiR algorithm is feasible for acquiring better quality image and ensuring significant reduction in effective dose.",1,1,0,0
34436521,"Effect of Cisplatin and Gemcitabine With or Without Berzosertib in Patients With Advanced Urothelial Carcinoma: A Phase 2 Randomized Clinical Trial.Importance: Preclinical studies suggest that inhibition of single-stranded DNA repair by ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 (ATR) may enhance the cytotoxicity of cisplatin, gemcitabine, and other chemotherapeutic agents.Cisplatin with gemcitabine remains the standard up-front therapy for treatment in patients with metastatic urothelial cancer.Objective: To determine whether the use of the selective ATR inhibitor, berzosertib, could augment the activity of cisplatin with gemcitabine.Design, Setting, and Participants: In a phase 2 randomized clinical trial, 87 patients across 23 centers in the National Cancer Institute Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network were randomized to receive either cisplatin with gemcitabine alone (control arm) or cisplatin with gemcitabine plus berzosertib (experimental arm).Key eligibility criteria included confirmed metastatic urothelial cancer, no prior cytotoxic therapy for metastatic disease, 12 months or more since perioperative therapy, and eligibility for cisplatin receipt based on standard criteria.The study was conducted from January 27, 2017, to December 15, 2020.Interventions: In the control arm, cisplatin, 70 mg/m2, was given on day 1 and gemcitabine, 1000 mg/m2, was given on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle.In the experimental arm, cisplatin, 60 mg/m2, was given on day 1; gemcitabine, 875 mg/m2, on days 1 and 8; and berzosertib, 90 mg/m2, on days 2 and 9 of a 21-day cycle.Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point of the study was progression-free survival.The analysis was on all patients who started therapy.Results: Of the total of 87 patients randomized, 41 patients received cisplatin with gemcitabine alone and 46 received cisplatin with gemcitabine plus berzosertib.Median age was 67 (range, 32-84) years, and 68 patients (78%) were men.Median progression-free survival was 8.0 months for both arms (Bajorin risk-adjusted hazard ratio, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.72-2.08).Median overall survival was shorter with cisplatin with gemcitabine plus berzosertib compared with cisplatin with gemcitabine alone (14.4 vs 19.8 months; Bajorin risk-adjusted hazard ratio, 1.42; 95% CI, 0.76-2.68).Higher rates of grade 3 vs grade 4 thrombocytopenia (59% vs 39%) and neutropenia (37% vs 27%) were observed with cisplatin with gemcitabine and berzosertib compared with cisplatin with gemcitabine alone; consequently, more dose reductions were needed in the experimental arm.Patients in the experimental arm received a median cisplatin dose of 250 mg/m2, which was significantly lower than the median dose of 370 mg/m2 in the control arm (P < .001).Conclusions and Relevance: The addition of berzosertib to cisplatin with gemcitabine did not prolong progression-free survival relative to cisplatin with gemcitabine alone in patients with metastatic urothelial cancer, and a trend toward inferior survival was observed with this combination.Berzosertib plus cisplatin with gemcitabine was associated with significantly higher hematologic toxicities despite attenuated dosing of cisplatin with gemcitabine.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02567409.",1,1,1,0
31400480,"Effect of a high-intensity interval training on serum microRNA levels in women with breast cancer undergoing hormone therapy. A single-blind randomized trial.BACKGROUND: The role of microRNAs (miRs) in hormone therapy (HT) is of keen interest in developing biomarkers and treatments for individuals with breast cancer.Although miRs are often moderate regulators under homeostatic conditions, their function is changed more in response to physical activity.OBJECTIVE: This single-blind randomized trial aimed to explore the effect of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on serum levels of miRs in individuals with early-stage breast cancer undergoing HT.METHODS: Hormone receptor-positive women with breast cancer and healthy women were randomly assigned to a healthy control group (n=15), healthy group with HIIT (n=15), breast cancer group with HT (HT, n=26), and breast cancer group with HT and HIIT (HT+HIIT, n=26).The exercise groups underwent interval uphill walking training on a treadmill 3 times a week for 12weeks.At the end of the study, we analyzed changes in levels of cancer-related miRs (oncomiRs) and tumour suppressor miRs (TSmiRs) in response to the HT and HIIT.RESULTS: In women with breast cancer versus healthy controls, the expression of some oncomiRs was significantly increased - miR-21 (P<0.001), miR-155 (P=0.001), miR-221 (P=0.008), miR-27a (P<0.001), and miR-10b (P=0.007) - and that of some TSmiRs was significantly decreased - miR-206 (P=0.048), miR-145 (P=0.011), miR-143 (P=0.008), miR-9 (P=0.020), and let-7a (P=0.005).Moreover, HT considerably downregulated oncomiRs and upregulated TSmiRs.HIIT for 12weeks with HT significantly decreased the expression of the oncomiRs and significantly increased that of the TSmiRs as compared with HT alone.CONCLUSIONS: HITT could amplify the decrease and/or increase in expression of miRs associated with HT in women with breast cancer.A prospective trial could determine whether the use of circulating miRs for monitoring treatment can be useful in therapy decisions.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (No.: IRCT201202289171N1).",1,1,0,0
23650416,"Randomized phase II, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of exemestane with or without entinostat in postmenopausal women with locally recurrent or metastatic estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer progressing on treatment with a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor.PURPOSE: Entinostat is an oral isoform selective histone deacetylase inhibitor that targets resistance to hormonal therapies in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer.This randomized, placebo-controlled, phase II study evaluated entinostat combined with the aromatase inhibitor exemestane versus exemestane alone.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Postmenopausal women with ER+ advanced breast cancer progressing on a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor were randomly assigned to exemestane 25 mg daily plus entinostat 5 mg once per week (EE) or exemestane plus placebo (EP).The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS).Blood was collected in a subset of patients for evaluation of protein lysine acetylation as a biomarker of entinostat activity.RESULTS: One hundred thirty patients were randomly assigned (EE group, n = 64; EP group, n = 66).Based on intent-to-treat analysis, treatment with EE improved median PFS to 4.3 months versus 2.3 months with EP (hazard ratio [HR], 0.73; 95% CI, 0.50 to 1.07; one-sided P = .055; two-sided P = .11 [predefined significance level of .10, one-sided]).Median overall survival was an exploratory end point and improved to 28.1 months with EE versus 19.8 months with EP (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.97; P = .036).Fatigue and neutropenia were the most frequent grade 3/4 toxicities.Treatment discontinuation because of adverse events was higher in the EE group versus the EP group (11% v 2%).Protein lysine hyperacetylation in the EE biomarker subset was associated with prolonged PFS.CONCLUSION: Entinostat added to exemestane is generally well tolerated and demonstrated activity in patients with ER+ advanced breast cancer in this signal-finding phase II study.Acetylation changes may provide an opportunity to maximize clinical benefit with entinostat.Plans for a confirmatory study are underway.",1,1,1,1
32719000,"Once, Twice, Three Times a Finding: Reproducibility of Dendritic Cell Vaccine Trials Targeting Cytomegalovirus in Glioblastoma.Despite standard of care for glioblastoma, including gross total resection, high-dose radiation, and dose-limited chemotherapy, this tumor remains one of the most aggressive and therapeutically challenging.The relatively small number of patients with this diagnosis compared with more common solid tumors in clinical trials commits new glioblastoma therapies to testing in small, underpowered, nonrandomized settings.Among approximately 200 registered glioblastoma trials identified between 2005 and 2015, nearly half were single-arm studies with sample sizes not exceeding 50 patients.These constraints have made demonstrating efficacy for novel therapies difficult in glioblastoma and other rare and aggressive cancers.Novel immunotherapies for glioblastoma such as vaccination with dendritic cells (DC) have yielded mixed results in clinical trials.To address limited numbers, we sequentially conducted three separate clinical trials utilizing cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific DC vaccines in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma whereby each follow-up study had nearly doubled in sample size.Follow-up data from the first blinded, randomized phase II clinical trial (NCT00639639) revealed that nearly one third of this cohort is without tumor recurrence at 5 years from diagnosis.A second clinical trial (NCT00639639) resulted in a 36% survival rate at 5 years from diagnosis.Results of the first two-arm trial (NCT00639639) showed increased migration of the DC vaccine to draining lymph nodes, and this increased migration has been recapitulated in our larger confirmatory clinical study (NCT02366728).We have now observed that nearly one third of the glioblastoma study patient population receiving CMV-specific DC vaccines results in exceptional long-term survivors.",0,0,0,0
32171426,"Pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and docetaxel for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (CLEOPATRA): end-of-study results from a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study.BACKGROUND: CLEOPATRA was a phase 3 study comparing the efficacy and safety of pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and docetaxel with placebo, trastuzumab, and docetaxel in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.In the primary analysis and subsequent reports, progression-free and overall survival were significantly improved in the pertuzumab group compared with the placebo group.Here, we report the end-of-study analysis of CLEOPATRA.METHODS: This was a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial that was done at 204 centres in 25 countries.Eligible patients were 18 years or older, had HER2-positive, metastatic breast cancer, had not received previous chemotherapy or biological treatment for their metastatic disease, and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1.All study drugs were given intravenously, every 3 weeks.Patients were assigned to receive either pertuzumab or placebo at a loading dose of 840 mg, and 420 mg thereafter; plus trastuzumab at 8 mg/kg loading dose and 6 mg/kg thereafter; and docetaxel at 75 mg/m(2), escalating to 100 mg/m(2) if tolerated.Pertuzumab or placebo and trastuzumab were given until disease progression; docetaxel was given for six cycles, or longer at the investigators' discretion.Randomisation (1:1) was done by use of an interactive voice-response system and was stratified by geographical region (Asia, Europe, North America, or South America) and previous treatment (previous adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy vs none).The primary endpoint was independent review facility-assessed progression-free survival, which has been reported previously.Since the confirmatory overall survival analysis had also occurred before this prespecified end-of-study analysis, analyses presented here are descriptive.Overall survival analyses were based on the intention-to-treat population with crossover patients analysed in the placebo group; analyses were not adjusted for crossover to the pertuzumab group and are likely to be conservative.Safety analyses were based on treatment received; crossover patients were counted in the placebo group up to the day before first pertuzumab dose.This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00567190.FINDINGS: Between Feb 12, 2008, and July 7, 2010, 1196 patients were assessed for eligibility, of whom 808 were enrolled and randomly assigned.402 patients were assigned to receive docetaxel plus trastuzumab plus pertuzumab, and 406 patients were assigned to receive docetaxel plus trastuzumab plus placebo.Clinical cutoff for this analysis was Nov 23, 2018.Between July 2012 and clinical cutoff, 50 patients crossed from the placebo to the pertuzumab group.Median follow-up was 99.9 months in the pertuzumab group (IQR 92.9-106.4) and 98.7 months (90.9-105.7) in the placebo group.Median overall survival was 57.1 months (95% CI 50-72) in the pertuzumab group and 40.8 months (36-48) in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0.69, 95% CI 0.58-0.82); 8-year landmark overall survival rates were 37% (95% CI 31-42) in the pertuzumab group and 23% (19-28) in the placebo group.The most common grade 3-4 adverse event was neutropenia (200 [49%] of 408 patients in the pertuzumab group, 183 [46%] of 396 patients in the placebo group).Five (1%) of 408 patients in the pertuzumab group and six (2%) of 396 patients in the placebo group had treatment-related deaths.One new serious adverse event suggestive of congestive heart failure (pertuzumab group) and one new symptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction (post-crossover) occurred since the previous analysis.INTERPRETATION: Our analysis shows that the previously observed improvements in overall survival with pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and docetaxel versus placebo, trastuzumab, and docetaxel were maintained after a median of more than 8 years of follow-up.The long-term safety and cardiac safety profiles of pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and docetaxel were maintained in the overall safety population and within crossover patients.HER2-targeted therapy has changed the natural history of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, with the dual blockade of pertuzumab and trastuzumab, with docetaxel, demonstrating an 8-year landmark overall survival rate of 37%.FUNDING: F Hoffmann-La Roche and Genentech.",1,1,1,1
21750964,"Pathological complete response rates following different neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens for operable breast cancer according to ER status, in two parallel, randomized phase II trials with an adaptive study design (ECTO II).Sequential doxorubicin/paclitaxel (AT) followed by CMF treatment was shown to be an active neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen in the first European Cooperative Trial in Operable Breast Cancer (ECTO I trial).The aim of the current study (ECTO II) is to assess the complete pathological response (pCR) rate following three different anthracycline and taxane-containing neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens, with or without capecitabine (X).Patients with operable, invasive breast cancer > 2.0 cm in diameter, were randomized to AT-->CMF, AT-->CMX or AC-->TX regimens in two parallel, randomized, open-label, phase II trials (within a single study) in patients with estrogen receptor negative (ER-) and estrogen receptor positive (ER+) diseases, respectively.Exemestane was delivered concomitantly with neoadjuvant chemotherapy in ER+ tumors.Achievement of pCR was more common in ER- than ER+ women (45.3 vs. 10.4%).Capecitabine was only associated with a higher frequency of pCR in ER+ patients receiving AT-->CMX.Overall response rates (ORR) ranged from 88 to 97%, and this translated into high rates of breast-conserving surgery (67% of ER- patients and 72% of ER+ patients).All three regimens were well tolerated.Febrile neutropenia and gastrointestinal effects were the most common grade >/= 3 adverse events.As expected, the ECTO II study showed higher pCR rates in patients with ER- disease.Substituting capecitabine for fluorouracil (+/- methotrexate) in anthracycline/taxane-containing regimens appeared to be beneficial only in ER+ tumors.Translational studies investigating interactions between therapeutic agents and tumor biology are warranted to refine patient selection and improve the results of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.",0,0,0,0
33479759,"Prognostic impact of geriatric assessment in elderly patients with non-small cell lung cancer: an integrated analysis of two randomized phase III trials (JCOG1115-A).OBJECTIVE: Patients' actual age and performance status do not always accurately identify the 'fit elderly' for chemotherapy.This study aimed to determine whether four geriatric assessment tools could predict prognosis.METHODS: This study were analyzed using the data of two randomized phase III trials (JCOG0207 and JCOG0803/WJOG4307L) for elderly patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer and included all eligible patients who were assessed before treatment with four geriatric assessment tools: the Barthel activities of daily living index, Lawton instrumental activities of daily living scale, Mini-Mental State Examination, and Geriatric Depression Scale-15.Univariable and multivariable analyses for overall survival, adjusted for baseline factors, were performed using a stratified Cox regression model with treatment regimen as strata.RESULTS: This analysis included 330 patients aged 70-74, 75-79 or 80 or more (n = 95/181/54), with a performance status of 0 or 1 (n = 119/211).Patients were divided into three groups based on Mini-Mental State Examination and two groups based on Geriatric Depression Scale, but over 80% of patients had perfect scores for both activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living.In overall survival subgroup analyses by GA tool, only Mini-Mental State Examination scores were associated with substantial outcome differences (median survival times: 21.2, 13.5 and 12.2 months for scores 30, 29-24 and </=23).After adjusting for baseline factors, the Mini-Mental State Examination, sex and performance status were tended to be worse overall survival.CONCLUSION: MMSE scores, performance status and sex, but not chronological age, effectively predicted the prognosis of elderly patients.Further studies should confirm that the Mini-Mental State Examination is useful for determining the indication of chemotherapy in elderly patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.",0,0,0,0
32780356,"A Randomized Controlled Trial on Evaluation of Plasma Epstein-Barr Virus Biomarker for Early Diagnosis in Patients With Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma.INTRODUCTION: Early diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) remains a major problem in Southern China.Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) biomarkers have been widely used in NPC screening.This study aims to evaluate the early diagnostic performances of individual EBV biomarkers in NPC.METHODS: The levels of EBV biomarkers-IgA antibodies against EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1-IgA), EBV capsid antigen (VCA-IgA), EBV early antigen (EA-IgA), EBV BZLF1 transcription activator protein (Zta-IgA) and IgG antibodies against EBV BRLF1 transcription activator protein (Rta-IgG)-from 106 NPC patients (stage I and II) and 150 normal subjects were measured.VCA-IgA and EA-IgA were detected by immunofluorescence assay (IFA), EBNA1-IgA, Rta-IgG and Zta-IgA were measure by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and EBV DNA was detected by qPCR.Statistical analyses of a single index were conducted to evaluate the significance of NPC early diagnosis and TNM classification.RESULTS: The level of EBNA1-IgA, EBV DNA, VCA-IgA, EA-IgA, Rta-IgG and Zta-IgA in early-stage NPC was significantly higher than in healthy controls (all P < 0.001).EBNA1-IgA yielded the biggest area under the curve (AUC) of 0.962 in distinguishing early-stage NPC patients from the normal subjects, with a sensitivity of 91.5% and a specificity of 98.7%.However, EBV biomarker levels were not associated with tumor size (all P > 0.050), whereas four biomarker levels (EBNA1-IgA, EBV DNA, VCA-IgA, EA-IgA) were related to lymph node metastasis (N0 and N1-2), among which EBNA1-IgA and EBV DNA showed good performance.Finally, high correlation was found between VCA-IgA and EA-IgA (r > 0.800).CONCLUSION: A single EBNA1-IgA exhibits excellent discrimination performance in early diagnosis of NPC and could become a promising marker for NPC screening.",1,1,0,0

27751846,"Safety and efficacy of regorafenib in patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma (REGOSARC): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial.BACKGROUND: Regorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor with proven activity in refractory gastrointestinal stromal tumours and chemotherapy-refractory advanced colorectal cancers.We assessed this agent's efficacy and safety in patients with metastatic soft tissue sarcomas previously treated with anthracycline.METHODS: In this randomised, double-blind, phase 2 trial undertaken in France and Austria, we enrolled patients aged 18 years and older with advanced soft tissue sarcomas who had received previous doxorubicin or other anthracycline treatment.These patients were randomly assigned (1:1) into one of the following four cohorts: liposarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, and other sarcomas.Participants were treated with oral regorafenib (160 mg per day 3 weeks on and 1 week off) or matched placebo.Patients receiving placebo were offered optional crossover in case of centrally confirmed disease progression.The random allocation schedule was computer-generated with permuted blocks of four patients, with two stratification factors: country (France or Austria) and previous exposure to pazopanib (yes or no).Eligibility criteria included patients with histologically proven advanced and inoperable soft tissue sarcomas with intolerance or failure to doxorubicin or other anthracycline-based chemotherapy and at least one unidimensionally or bidimensionally measurable lesion according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST; version 1.1).The primary endpoint was RECIST-based progression-free survival after central radiological review in the intention-to-treat population.Patients, physicians, and radiologists of the panel were masked to treatment allocation.This study is still open for recruitment for an additional stratum (patients previously treated with pazopanib) and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01900743.FINDINGS: From Aug 5, 2013, to Nov 26, 2014, 182 patients were randomly assigned to one of four cohorts and included in the final analysis.At the cutoff date (Jan 7, 2016), the number of required events was reached for the four cohorts.In the liposarcoma cohort, progression-free survival was 1.1 months (95% CI 0.9-2.3) with regorafenib versus 1.7 months (0.9-1.8) with placebo (HR 0.89 [95% CI 0.48-1.64] p=0.70).In the leiomyosarcoma cohort, progression-free survival was 3.7 months (95% CI 2.5-5.0) with regorafenib versus 1.8 (1.0-2.8) months with placebo (HR 0.46 [95% CI 0.46-0.80] p=0.0045).In the synovial sarcoma cohort, progression-free survival was 5.6 months (95% CI 1.4-11.6) with regorafenib versus 1.0 (0.8-1.4) with placebo (HR 0.10 [95% CI 0.03-0.35] p<0.0001).In the other sarcoma cohort, progression-free survival was 2.9 months (95% CI 1.0-7.8) with regorafenib versus 1.0 (0.9-1.9) with placebo (HR 0.46 [95% CI 0.25-0.81] p=0.0061).Before crossover, the most common clinically significant grade 3 or higher adverse events were arterial hypertension (17 [19%] events in the 89 patients in the regorafenib group vs two [2%] events in the 92 patients in the placebo group), hand and foot skin reaction (14 [15%] vs no events) and asthenia (12 [13%] vs six [6%]).One treatment-related death occurred in the regorafenib group due to liver failure.INTERPRETATION: Regorafenib has an important clinical antitumour effect in non-adipocytic soft tissue sarcomas, improving progression-free survival.Regorafenib should be further evaluated in this setting, and its therapeutic role has to be defined in the context of the growing therapeutic armamentarium, already including one approved multikinase inhibitor, pazopanib.FUNDING: Bayer HealthCare.",1,1,1,0
24608924,"Influence of interferon-alpha combined with chemo (radio) therapy on immunological parameters in pancreatic adenocarcinoma.Prognosis of patients with carcinoma of the exocrine pancreas is particularly poor.A combination of chemotherapy with immunotherapy could be an option for treatment of pancreatic cancer.The aim of this study was to perform an immunomonitoring of 17 patients with pancreatic cancer from the CapRI-2 study, and tumor-bearing mice treated with combination of chemo (radio) therapies with interferon-2alpha.Low doses of interferon-2alpha led to a decrease in total leukocyte and an increase in monocyte counts.Furthermore, we observed a positive effect of interferon-2alpha therapy on the dendritic cells and NK (natural killer) cell activation immediately after the first injection.In addition, we recorded an increased amount of interferon-gamma and IL-10 in the serum following the interferon-2alpha therapy.These data clearly demonstrate that pancreatic carcinoma patients also show an immunomodulatory response to interferon-2alpha therapy.Analysis of immunosuppressive cells in the Panc02 orthotopic mouse model of pancreatic cancer revealed an accumulation of the myeloid-derived suppressor cells in spleens and tumors of the mice treated with interferon-2alpha and 5-fluorouracil.The direct effect of the drugs on myeloid-derived suppressor cells was also registered in vitro.These data expose the importance of immunosuppressive mechanisms induced by combined chemo-immunotherapy.",0,0,0,0
27068497,"Efficacy and safety of S-1 (tegafur, gimeracil, and oteracil potassium) concurrent with 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy for newly diagnosed squamous cell carcinoma of the lung in elderly patients.PURPOSE: This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of the combination drug tegafur, gimeracil, and oteracil potassium (S-1) concurrent with 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy for newly diagnosed squamous cell carcinoma of the lung in elderly patients.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with pathologically or cytologically newly diagnosed lung squamous cell carcinoma (n=106) were randomly assigned to receive the combination of tegafur, gimeracil, and oteracil potassium (40mg/m(2), BID, d1-28, repeated every 6 weeks for 4 cycles) and concurrent 3D-conformal radiotherapy (60Gy; experimental group), or gemcitabine (800-1000mg/m(2), d1 and d8) repeated every 21 days for 4 cycles as well as 3D-conformal radiotherapy (control group).RESULTS: The overall response rate (complete and partial responses) of the experimental group was 68.6%, which was significantly higher than that of the control group (38.5%; P=0.002).The median progression-free survival rates of the experimental and control groups were 11.8 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.0-22.4) and 7.8 months (95% CI, 6.9-9.2), respectively (P=0.017).Adverse reactions included grade I/II radiation esophagitis and pneumonitis, with good tolerance.Grade III/IV adverse reactions of the experimental and control groups were leucopenia (20% cf.56.6%, respectively; P=0.027), thrombocytopenia (3.9% cf. 25%; P=0.037), and gastrointestinal reaction (1.9% cf. 3.5%; P=0.35).CONCLUSION: The efficacy of concurrent combination chemotherapy with tegafur, gimeracil, and oteracil potassium (S-1) and 3D-conformal radiotherapy for newly diagnosed squamous cell carcinoma of the lung in elderly patients was excellent, and all toxicities were well tolerated.This treatment might be considered a main regimen in the management of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung in elderly patients.",1,1,1,0
34528557,"A prospective randomized trial comparing accelerated concurrent chemoradiotherapy with conventional concurrent chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced carcinoma cervix (IIA-IVA).Introduction: Cervical cancer ranks fourth in women worldwide.The management requires a multidisciplinary approach.Concomitant chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin, followed by brachytherapy, is the standard approach.Accelerated radiotherapy (ART) can be used to decrease the treatment duration which can further lead to better outcomes.Materials and Methods: Stages II, III, and IVA of carcinoma cervix were studied for 1 year.Ninety patients were randomized in control and study arms, 45 patients in each arm.The total dose of radiation was 50 Gy/25#/5 weeks from Monday to Friday in the control arm and 50 Gy/25#/4 weeks from Monday to Saturday in the study arm, with injection cisplatin 40 mg/m (2) intravenous infusion weekly in both the arms.Results: The response was similar in both the arms at the first follow-up as well as at median follow-up.However, acute toxicities in the ART arm were more, but they were managed conservatively.Conclusion: ART can be used in patients of cervical cancers to decrease the total treatment time.The results were similar in both the groups but need to be studied over more number of patients.",1,1,1,0
31404106,"Improved detection of prostate cancer using a magneto-nanosensor assay for serum circulating autoantibodies.PURPOSE: To develop a magneto-nanosensor (MNS) based multiplex assay to measure protein and autoantibody biomarkers from human serum for prostate cancer (CaP) diagnosis.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 4-panel MNS autoantibody assay and a MNS protein assay were developed and optimized in our labs.Using these assays, serum concentration of six biomarkers including prostate-specific antigen (PSA) protein, free/total PSA ratio, as well as four autoantibodies against Parkinson disease 7 (PARK7), TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TARDBP), Talin 1 (TLN1), and Caldesmon 1 (CALD1) and were analyzed.Human serum samples from 99 patients (50 with non-cancer and 49 with clinically localized CaP) were evaluated.RESULTS: The MNS assay showed excellent performance characteristics and no cross-reactivity.All autoantibody assays showed a statistically significant difference between CaP and non-cancer samples except for PARK7.The most significant difference was the combination of the four autoantibodies as a panel in addition to the free/total PSA ratio.This combination had the highest area under the curve (AUC)- 0.916 in ROC analysis.CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that this autoantibody panel along with PSA and free PSA have potential to segregate patients without cancer from those with prostate cancer with higher sensitivity and specificity than PSA alone.",0,0,0,0
30637839,"Patient preferences for adjuvant radiotherapy in early breast cancer are strongly influenced by treatment received through random assignment.OBJECTIVE: TARGIT-A randomised women with early breast cancer to receive external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) or intraoperative radiotherapy (TARGIT-IORT).This study aimed to identify what extra risk of recurrence patients would accept for perceived benefits and risks of different radiotherapy treatments.METHODS: Patient preferences were determined by self-rated trade-off questionnaires in two studies: Stage (1) 209 TARGIT-A participants (TARGIT-IORTn = 108, EBRTn = 101); Stage (2) 123 non-trial patients yet to receive radiotherapy (pre-treatment group), with 85 also surveyed post-radiotherapy.Patients traded-off risks of local recurrence in preference selection between TARGIT-IORT and EBRT.RESULTS: TARGIT-IORT patients were more accepting of IORT than EBRT patients with 60% accepting the highest increased risk presented (4%-6%) compared to 12% of EBRT patients, and 2% not accepting IORT at all compared to 43% of EBRT patients.Pre-treatment patients were more accepting of IORT than post-treatment patients with 23% accepting the highest increased risk presented compared to 15% of post-treatment patients, and 15% not accepting IORT at all compared to 41% of pre-treatment patients.CONCLUSIONS: Breast cancer patients yet to receive radiotherapy accept a higher recurrence risk than the actual risk found in TARGIT-A. Measured patient preferences are highly influenced by experience of treatment received.This finding challenges the validity of post-treatment preference studies.",0,0,0,0
31574097,"Community-based football in men with prostate cancer: 1-year follow-up on a pragmatic, multicentre randomised controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Physical exercise has been shown to be effective in relation to fatigue, aerobic fitness, and lower body strength in men with prostate cancer.However, research into the clinically relevant effects of interventions conducted in heterogeneous patient populations and in real-life clinical practice settings is warranted.METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a pragmatic, multicentre, parallel randomised controlled trial in 5 Danish urological departments.Recruitment began in May 2015, the first participant was randomised in June 2015, and the last participant was included in February 2017.In total, 214 men with prostate cancer were randomly assigned to either 6 months of free-of-charge football training twice weekly at a local club (football group [FG]) (n = 109) or usual care (usual care group [UG]) (n = 105), including brief information on physical activity recommendations at randomisation.Participants were on average 68.4 (SD 6.2) years old, 157 (73%) were retired, 87 (41%) were on castration-based treatment, 19 (9%) had received chemotherapy, and 41 (19%) had skeletal metastases at baseline.In this 1-year follow-up study, we evaluated the effects of community-based football training on the following outcomes: primary outcome, quality of life; secondary outcomes: continuation of football after 6 months, hip and lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD), mental health score, fat and lean body mass, and safety outcomes, i.e., fractures, falls, and hospital admissions.Intention to treat (ITT) and per protocol (PP) analyses were conducted.No statistically significant between-group difference was observed in change in prostate-cancer-specific quality of life (ITT: 1.9 points [95% CI -1.9 to 5.8], p = 0.325; PP: 3.6 points [95% CI -0.9 to 8.2], p = 0.119).A statistically significant between-group difference was observed in change in total hip BMD, in favour of FG (0.007 g/cm2 [95% CI 0.004 to 0.013], p = 0.037).No differences were observed in change in lumbar spine BMD or lean body mass.Among patients allocated to football, 59% chose to continue playing football after the end of the 6-month intervention period.At 1-year follow-up in the PP population, FG participants had more improvement on the Mental Component Summary (2.9 [95% CI 0.0 to 5.7], p = 0.048 points higher) than UG participants, as well as a greater loss of fat mass (-0.9 kg [95% CI -1.7 to -0.1], p = 0.029).There were no differences between groups in relation to fractures or falls.Hospital admissions were more frequent in UG compared to FG (33 versus 20; the odds ratio based on PP analysis was 0.34 for FG compared to UG).There were 3 deaths in FG and 4 in UG.Main limitations of the study were the physically active control group and assessment of physical activity by means of self-report.CONCLUSIONS: In this trial, participants allocated to football appeared to have improved hip BMD and fewer hospital admissions.Men who played football more than once a week for 1 year lost fat mass and reported improved mental health.Community-based football proved to be acceptable, even when club membership was not subsidised.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02430792.",1,1,0,0
24214315,"Similar relationship between the time course of bone mineral density improvement and vertebral fracture risk reduction with denosumab treatment in postmenopausal osteoporosis and prostate cancer patients on androgen deprivation therapy.Denosumab has received approval in many countries and indications include treating women with postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO) at increased or high risk for fracture and men at high risk for fracture receiving androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for non-metastatic prostate cancer.Increases in total hip bone mineral density (BMD) with denosumab explained a large percentage of new vertebral fracture risk reduction in women with PMO; however, this effect has not been studied in men with prostate cancer receiving ADT.We compared the relationship between the time course of BMD changes and new vertebral fracture risk reduction with denosumab in women with PMO and men with prostate cancer.After adjusting for different baseline hazards, a significant and similar relationship between time course of total hip and lumbar spine BMD changes and new vertebral fracture risk was observed in both patient populations.Time course of total hip BMD changes with denosumab was the best predictor for changes in fracture risk and explained 88% of the new vertebral fracture risk reduction in women with PMO and 91% in men with prostate cancer.Therefore, total hip BMD is a useful surrogate to measure the clinical impact of denosumab on fracture risk reduction in both patient populations.",0,0,0,0
29574365,"Health-related quality of life from the FALCON phase III randomised trial of fulvestrant 500 mg versus anastrozole for hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer.BACKGROUND: The phase III randomised FALCON trial (NCT01602380) demonstrated improved progression-free survival with fulvestrant 500 mg versus anastrozole 1 mg in endocrine therapy-naive postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive (HR+) locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (LA/MBC).Furthermore, overall health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was maintained and comparable for fulvestrant and anastrozole.Here, we present additional analyses of patient-reported HRQoL outcomes from FALCON.METHODS: Women with endocrine therapy-naive HR+ LA/MBC were randomised 1:1 to fulvestrant (days 0, 14, 28, then every 28 d) or anastrozole (daily) until disease progression or discontinuation.HRQoL was assessed by FACT-B questionnaire (TOI and FACT-B total score) at randomisation and every 12 weeks during treatment.HRQoL data post-treatment (with or without progression) were also collected.RESULTS: In total, 462 patients were randomised (fulvestrant, n = 230; anastrozole, n = 232).Compliance to FACT-B overall ranged from 60.0 to 97.4%.Mean change from baseline in TOI and FACT-B total score remained broadly stable (approximately +/- 3 points to week 132) and was similar between arms during treatment.HRQoL was also maintained in FACT-B subscales.Approximately one-third of patients had improved TOI (>/=+6 points) and FACT-B (>/=+8 points) total scores from baseline up to week 120 and 132, respectively, of treatment with fulvestrant (ranges 26.4-45.0% and 22.4-35.8%, respectively) and anastrozole (ranges 18.6-32.9%, and 22.7-37.9%, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: Mean change from baseline in TOI and FACT-B total score was maintained for fulvestrant and anastrozole; similar proportions of patients in both arms had improved TOI and FACT-B total scores.CLINICALTRIALS.GOV IDENTIFIER: NCT01602380.",1,1,1,0
22374991,"Gastric cancer incidence among Hispanics in California: patterns by time, nativity, and neighborhood characteristics.BACKGROUND: Better understanding about gastric cancer incidence patterns among Hispanics by birthplace, socioeconomic status (SES), and acculturation can improve preventive strategies and disease models.METHODS: Incidence rates, rate ratios, and estimated annual percent change (EAPC) in rates of anatomic and histologic subtype-specific gastric cancer were calculated by age, sex, and nativity among Hispanics using California Cancer Registry data from 1988 through 2004.Incidence rates in 1998 to 2002 were compared by neighborhood SES and Hispanic enclave status according to 2000 US Census data.RESULTS: Incidence rates of diffuse gastric cancer increased from 1988 through 2004 among foreign-born Hispanic men (EAPC: 3.5%, 95% CI: 1.5%-5.5%) and U.S.-born Hispanic women (EAPC: 3.0%, 95% CI: 0.7%-5.3%).During the same time period, incidence rates of intestinal gastric cancer declined significantly and both cardia and noncardia gastric cancer were steady or declined among foreign-born and U.S.-born Hispanic men and women.Noncardia and both intestinal and diffuse gastric cancer were more common in foreign-born than U.S.-born Hispanic men and women, and in those from lower SES, higher enclave neighborhoods.By contrast, among younger and middle-aged Hispanic men, cardia tumors were more common in the U.S.-born than the foreign-born, and in higher SES, lower enclave neighborhoods.CONCLUSIONS: Varying gastric cancer risk factors among Hispanic subgroups and increasing rates of diffuse gastric cancer in foreign-born Hispanic men and U.S.-born Hispanic women merit further investigation to identify separate disease etiologies.IMPACT: Age, sex, birthplace, SES, and acculturation modify gastric cancer incidence in Hispanics and should be considered when examining disease risk and prevention.",0,0,0,0
30115593,"Bevacizumab and temozolomide in patients with first recurrence of WHO grade II and III glioma, without 1p/19q co-deletion (TAVAREC): a randomised controlled phase 2 EORTC trial.BACKGROUND: Bevacizumab is frequently used in the treatment of recurrent WHO grade II and III glioma, but without supporting evidence from randomised trials.Therefore, we assessed the use of bevacizumab in patients with first recurrence of grade II or III glioma who did not have 1p/19q co-deletion.METHODS: The TAVAREC trial was a randomised, open-label phase 2 trial done at 32 centres across Europe in patients with locally diagnosed grade II or III glioma without 1p/19q co-deletion, with a first and contrast-enhancing recurrence after initial radiotherapy or chemotherapy, or both.Previous chemotherapy must have been stopped at least 6 months before enrolment and radiotherapy must have been stopped at least 3 months before enrolment.Random group assignment was done electronically through the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer web-based system, stratified by a minimisation procedure using institution, initial histology (WHO grade II vs III), WHO performance status (0 or 1 vs 2), and previous treatment (radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or both).Patients were assigned to receive either temozolomide (150-200 mg/m(2), orally) monotherapy on days 1-5 every 4 weeks for a maximum of 12 cycles, or the same temozolomide regimen in combination with bevacizumab (10 mg/kg, intravenously) every 2 weeks until progression.The primary endpoint was overall survival at 12 months in the per-protocol population.Safety analyses were done in all patients who started their allocated treatment.The study is registered at EudraCT (2009-017422-39) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01164189), and is complete.FINDINGS: Between Feb 8, 2011, and July 31, 2015, 155 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive either monotherapy (n=77) or combination therapy (n=78).Overall survival in the per-protocol population at 12 months was achieved by 44 (61% [80% CI 53-69]) of 72 patients in the temozolomide group and 38 (55% [47-69]) of 69 in the combination group.The most frequent toxicity was haematological: 17 (23%) of 75 patients in the monotherapy group and 25 (33%) of 76 in the combination group developed grade 3 or 4 haematological toxicity.Other than haematological toxicities, the most common adverse events were nervous system disorders (59 [79%] of 75 patients in the monotherapy group vs 65 [86%] of 76 in the combination group), fatigue (53 [70%] vs 61 [80%]), and nausea (39 [52%] vs 43 [56%]).Infections were more frequently reported in the combination group (29 [38%] of 76 patients) than in the monotherapy group (17 [23%] of 75).One treatment-related death was reported in the combination group (infection after intratumoral haemorrhage during a treatment-related grade 4 thrombocytopenia).INTERPRETATION: We found no evidence of improved overall survival with bevacizumab and temozolomide combination treatment versus temozolomide monotherapy.The findings from this study provide no support for further phase 3 studies on the role of bevacizumab in this disease.FUNDING: Roche Pharmaceuticals.",1,1,1,1

24564888,"Wnt modulates MCL1 to control cell survival in triple negative breast cancer.BACKGROUND: Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) has higher rates of recurrence and distant metastasis, and poorer outcome as compared to non-TNBC.Aberrant activation of WNT signaling has been detected in TNBC, which might be important for triggering oncogenic conversion of breast epithelial cell.Therefore, we directed our focus on identifying the WNT ligand and its underlying mechanism in TNBC cells.METHODS: We performed large-scale analysis of public microarray data to screen the WNT ligands and the clinical significance of the responsible ligand in TNBC.WNT5B was identified and its overexpression in TNBC was confirmed by immunohistochemistry staining, Western blot and ELISA.ShRNA was used to knockdown WNT5B expression (shWNT5B).Cellular functional alteration with shWNT5B treatment was determined by using wound healing assay, mammosphere assay; while cell cycle and apoptosis were examined by flowcytometry.Mitochondrial morphology was photographed by electron microscope.Biological change of mitochondria was detected by RT-PCR and oxygen consumption assay.Activation of WNT pathway and its downstream targets were evaluated by liciferase assay, immunohistochemistry staining and immunoblot analysis.Statistical methods used in the experiments besides microarray analysis was two-tailed t-test.RESULTS: WNT5B was elevated both in the tumor and the patients' serum.Suppression of WNT5B remarkably impaired cell growth, migration and mammosphere formation.Additionally, G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and caspase-independent apoptosis was observed.Study of the possible mechanism indicated that these effects occurred through suppression of mitochondrial biogenesis, as evidenced by reduced mitochondrial DNA (MtDNA) and compromised oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS).In Vivo and in vitro data uncovered that WNT5B modulated mitochondrial physiology was mediated by MCL1, which was regulated by WNT/beta-catenin responsive gene, Myc.Clinic data analysis revealed that both WNT5B and MCL1 are associated with enhanced metastasis and decreased disease-free survival.CONCLUSIONS: All our findings suggested that WNT5B/MCL1 cascade is critical for TNBC and understanding its regulatory apparatus provided valuable insight into the pathogenesis of the tumor development and the guidance for targeting therapeutics.",0,0,0,0

A prospective randomized trial.BACKGROUND: The main problem in performing endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) of gastric neoplasms is that it is technically difficult, especially for beginners.METHODS: A total of 51 patients were randomly assigned to undergo transnasal endoscope-assisted or routine ESD performed by two endoscopists inexperienced in ESD while supervised by one expert.RESULTS: Total procedure time (p = 0.330), complete resection rate (p = 0.977), and complication rate (p = 0.157) were similar for the patients who underwent transnasal endoscope-assisted and routine ESD, but bleeding control time was significantly longer in the transnasal endoscope-assisted ESD group (p = 0.002).Three and six patients in the transnasal endoscope-assisted and routine ESD groups, respectively, were ""dropped out"" during the procedures (p = 0.291).The endoscopists tended to regard the traction with the transnasal endoscopeas more useful for large tumors (p = 0.062).Bleeding control in patients who underwent the transnasal endoscope-assisted ESD was significantly longer for patients with tumors located in the anterior wall, posterior wall, and lesser curvature of the stomach (p = 0.001).CONCLUSION: Transnasal endoscope-assisted ESD does not result in improved outcomes when performed by beginners, except for some large tumors.The traction method used by beginners was not superior to proper supervision and advice by an expert during ESD and allowing the expert to perform the procedure when the risk of complications is high or the procedure is delayed.",1,1,0,0
22453059,"Effects of vitamin D on cardiovascular disease risk factors in polycystic ovary syndrome women with vitamin D deficiency.BACKGROUND: Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent among women, including patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).Some studies have suggested that vitamin D may have a role in cardiovascular disease (CVD).There is very limited data on the vitamin D effect on CVD risk factors in women with PCOS and vitamin D deficiency.AIM: To investigate the effect of cholecalciferol on CVD risk factors in PCOS women with vitamin D deficiency.METHODS: The study was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double blinded trial.Fifty PCOS women with vitamin D deficiency (vitamin D, no. = 24; placebo, no. = 26) aged 20-40 yr, were randomly assigned to receive 3 oral capsules of 50,000 IU vitamin D3 or a placebo (one capsule every 20 days) for two months.Serum vitamin D, PTH, lipid profile, apolipoprotein AI (APO-AI), and high sensitive C- reactive protein (hs-CRP) were measured at baseline and after treatment.RESULTS: Vitamin D3 therapy in PCOS patients, increased serum vitamin D (7.00 +/- 2.80 to 22.9 +/- 6.14 ng/ml), decreased serum total cholesterol (196.6 +/- 32.8 to 179.1 +/- 34.1 mg/dl), triglyceride (156.8 +/- 73.0 to 130.5 +/- 56.5 mg/dl), and VLDL (31.4 +/- 14.6 to 26.1 +/- 11.3 mg/dl) levels significantly (p < 0.05), but it did not affect serum HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, APO-AI, and hs-CRP concentrations.There was no change in variables in the placebo group.CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that vitamin D3 therapy had beneficial effects on some CVD risk factors in PCOS patients with vitamin D deficiency.The trial was registered at IRCT.ir (IRCT138904113140N2).",1,0,0,0
22492244,"Occurrence of vaccine and non-vaccine human papillomavirus types in adolescent Finnish females 4 years post-vaccination.Control of human papillomavirus (HPV)-related cancers by inclusion of HPV vaccination into national vaccination programmes is likely.One open question is replacement of the vaccine types with other high-risk (hr) HPV types in the vaccination era.We studied occurrence of HPV types in adolescent females participating in a population-based vaccination trial.A total of 4,808 16- to 17-year-old females from Finland were enrolled in the 1:1 randomized phase III (PATRICIA) trial of the efficacy of vaccination with the AS04-adjuvanted HPV-16/18 virus-like particle vaccine as compared to hepatitis A virus (HAV) vaccine.HPV infection was assessed from cervical samples taken every 6 months for 4 years post-vaccination by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for genital oncogenic HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 58, 59, 66, 68, and 73 as well as low-risk types HPV-6 and HPV-11.The HPV-16/18 vaccine coverage ranged between 1 and 22% by age-cohort and study community.Odds ratios (ORs) for infections with different HPV types in baseline PCR negative HPV-16/18 vs. HAV vaccinated women, and Poisson regression derived HPV incidence rate ratios (IRRs) in baseline positive vs. negative women were calculated.The OR and IRR estimates for acquisition of any genital HPV types showed no excess risk neither in baseline HPV DNA-negative HPV-16/18-vaccinated women compared to baseline HPV DNA-negative HAV vaccinated women nor in HPV-16/18-vaccinated baseline HPV-16/18-positive women compared to baseline HPV-16/18-negative women.In the HAV-vaccinated, baseline HPV-18-positive women showed an increased risk of acquiring other clade A7 HPV types (39, 45, 59, 68) (IRR 1.8, 95% confidence interval = 1.01.-3.1).We found no increased occurrence of non-vaccine HPV types suggestive of type-replacement 1-4 years post-vaccination among HPV-16/18-vaccinated Finnish adolescents.",1,0,0,0
27197293,"Exercise-Induced Dose-Response Alterations in Adiponectin and Leptin Levels Are Dependent on Body Fat Changes in Women at Risk for Breast Cancer.BACKGROUND: Dysregulation of adipokines, such as adiponectin and leptin, is associated with a variety of chronic diseases, including cancer.Physical activity protects against breast cancer and one of the mechanisms which may underlie this association is exercise-induced changes in adipokine levels.The WISER Sister Trial was a three-armed randomized controlled trial in premenopausal women (n = 137) with an elevated risk for breast cancer.METHODS: A 5-menstrual-cycle-long dosed aerobic exercise intervention compared low-dose exercise (150 min/wk; n = 44) or high-dose exercise (300 min/wk; n = 48) with a control group asked to maintain usual activity levels (n = 45).Exercise intensity progressed to and was maintained at 70% to 80% of age predicted heart rate max.Body composition and adipokine levels were measured at baseline and follow-up.RESULTS: We observed significant linear trends for increased fitness capacity (Delta%: -2.0% control, 10.1% low dose, 13.1% high dose), decreased fat tissue-to-total tissue mass (Delta%: 0.7% control, -2.9% low dose, -3.7% high dose), increased body fat adjusted adiponectin (Delta%: -0.6% control, 0.6% low dose, 0.9% high dose), and decreased body fat adjusted leptin (Delta%: 0.7% control, -8.2% low dose, -10.2% high dose).CONCLUSIONS: In this randomized clinical trial of premenopausal women at risk for breast cancer, we demonstrate a dose-response effect of exercise on adiponectin and leptin and that dose response is dependent on changes in body fat.IMPACT: Improved adipokine levels, achieved by aerobic exercise training-induced decreases in body fat, may decrease breast cancer risk for high-risk premenopausal women.Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 25(8); 1195-200.(c)2016 AACR.",1,0,0,0
29917140,"Predictive Biomarkers for Endocrine Therapy: Retrospective Study in Tamoxifen and Exemestane Adjuvant Multinational (TEAM) Trial.Background: Aromatase inhibitors improve disease-free survival compared with tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.The Tamoxifen and Exemestane Adjuvant Multinational (TEAM) trial compared exemestane monotherapy with sequential therapy of tamoxifen followed by exemestane.The trial failed to show a statistically significant difference between treatment arms.A robust translational program was established to investigate predictive biomarkers.Methods: A tissue microarray was retrospectively constructed using a subset of patient tissues (n = 4631) from the TEAM trial (n = 9766).Immunohistochemistry was performed for biomarkers, classed into three groups: MAPK pathway, NF-kappa B pathway, and estrogen receptor (ER) phosphorylation.Expression was analyzed for association with relapse-free survival (RFS) at 2.5 and 10 years and treatment regimen using Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank analysis.All statistical tests were two-sided.Results: In univariate analysis, ER167 (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.59 to 0.85, P < .001), IKKalpha (HR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.60 to 0.92, P = .005), Raf-1338 (HR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.52 to 0.80, P < .001), and p44/42 MAPK202/204 (HR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.64 to 0.92, P = .004) were statistically significantly associated with improved RFS at 10 years in patients receiving sequential therapy.Associations were strengthened when IKKalpha, Raf-1338, and ER167 were combined into a cumulative prognostic score (HR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.52 to 0.77, P < .001).Patients with an all negative IKKalpha, Raf-1338, and ER167 score favored exemestane monotherapy (odds ratio = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.35 to 0.90).In multivariable analysis, the IKKalpha, Raf-1338, and ER167 score (P = .001) was an independent prognostic factor for RFS at 10 years in patients receiving sequential therapy.Conclusions: The IKKalpha, Raf-1338, and ER167 score is an independent predictive biomarker for lower recurrence on sequential therapy.Negative expression may further offer predictive value for exemestane monotherapy.",0,0,0,0
23017529,"Perioperative outcomes and oncologic efficacy from a pilot prospective randomized clinical trial of open versus robotic assisted radical cystectomy.PURPOSE: Robotic assisted laparoscopic radical cystectomy for bladder cancer has been reported with potential for improvement in perioperative morbidity compared to the open approach.However, most studies are retrospective with significant selection bias.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A pilot prospective randomized trial evaluating perioperative outcomes and oncologic efficacy of open vs robotic assisted laparoscopic radical cystectomy for consecutive patients was performed from July 2009 to June 2011.RESULTS: To date 47 patients have been randomized with data available on 40 patients for analysis.Each group was similar with regard to age, gender, race, body mass index and comorbidities, as well as previous surgeries, operative time, postoperative complications and final pathological stage.We observed no significant differences between oncologic outcomes of positive margins (5% each, p = 0.50) or number of lymph nodes removed for open radical cystectomy (23, IQR 15-28) vs robotic assisted laparoscopic radical cystectomy (11, IQR 8.75-21.5) groups (p = 0.135).The robotic assisted laparoscopic radical cystectomy group (400 ml, IQR 300-762.5) was noted to have decreased estimated blood loss compared to the open radical cystectomy group (800 ml, IQR 400-1,100) and trended toward a decreased rate of excessive length of stay (greater than 5 days) (65% vs 90%, p = 0.11) compared to the open radical cystectomy group.The robotic group also trended toward fewer transfusions (40% vs 50%, p = 0.26).CONCLUSIONS: Our study validates the concept of randomizing patients with bladder cancer undergoing radical cystectomy to an open or robotic approach.Our results suggest no significant differences in surrogates of oncologic efficacy.Robotic assisted laparoscopic radical cystectomy demonstrates potential benefits of decreased estimated blood loss and decreased hospital stay compared to open radical cystectomy.Our results need to be validated in a larger multicenter prospective randomized clinical trial.",1,1,0,0

The IOP at T13 in group S was approximately 5.7 mm Hg higher than in group E. The IOP at T13 was approximately 10.6 mm Hg higher than in T1 in group S, but only approximately 4.4 mm Hg higher than in group E.

23222000,"Obesity-related hormones and endometrial cancer among postmenopausal women: a nested case-control study within the B~FIT cohort.Endometrial cancer risk is strongly influenced by obesity, but the mechanisms of action remain unclear.Leptin and adiponectin, secreted from adipose tissue, reportedly play a role in such carcinogenic processes as cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and insulin regulation.In this case-control study, nested within the Breast and Bone Follow-up of the Fracture Intervention Trial (n=15,595), we assessed pre-diagnostic serum leptin, total adiponectin, and high-molecular-weight (HMW) adiponectin in relation to endometrial cancer among postmenopausal women.During the 10-year follow-up, 62 incident endometrial cases were identified and matched to 124 controls on age, geographical site, time of fasting blood draw at baseline (1992-1993), and trial participation status.Adipokines and C-peptide were measured by ELISA.Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated via conditional logistic regression, with exposures categorized in tertiles (T).Multivariable models considered C-peptide, BMI (kg/m(2)), and estradiol (E2) as potential confounders.Endometrial cancer risk was significantly associated with higher leptin levels, adjusted for E2 and C-peptide (OR(T3 vs T1)=2.96; 95% CI, 1.21-7.25; P trend <0.01).After further adjustment for BMI, the estimates were attenuated and the positive trend was no longer statistically significant (OR(T3 vs T1)=2.11; 95% CI, 0.69-6.44; P trend=0.18).No significant associations were observed with adiponectin or HMW adiponectin and endometrial cancer.Our findings with leptin suggest that the leptin-BMI axis might increase endometrial cancer risk through mechanisms other than estrogen-driven proliferation.Continued exploration of these pathways in larger prospective studies may help elucidate mechanisms underlying observed obesity-endometrial cancer associations.",0,0,0,0
30523756,"Randomized Phase II Trial of Cisplatin and Etoposide in Combination With Veliparib or Placebo for Extensive-Stage Small-Cell Lung Cancer: ECOG-ACRIN 2511 Study.PURPOSE: Veliparib, a poly (ADP ribose) polymerase inhibitor, potentiated standard chemotherapy against small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) in preclinical studies.We evaluated the combination of veliparib with cisplatin and etoposide (CE; CE+V) doublet in untreated, extensive-stage SCLC (ES-SCLC).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with ES-SCLC, stratified by sex and serum lactate dehydrogenase levels, were randomly assigned to receive four 3-week cycles of CE (75 mg/m(2) intravenously on day 1 and 100 mg/m(2) on days 1 through 3) along with veliparib (100 mg orally twice per day on days 1 through 7) or placebo (CE+P).The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS).Using an overall one-sided 0.10-level log-rank test, the study had 88% power to demonstrate a 37.5% reduction in the PFS hazard rate.RESULTS: A total of 128 eligible patients received treatment on protocol.The median age was 66 years, 52% of patients were men, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status was 0 for 29% of patients and 1 for 71%.The respective median PFS for the CE+V arm versus the CE+P arm was 6.1 versus 5.5 months (unstratified hazard ratio [HR], 0.75 [one-sided P = .06]; stratified HR, 0.63 [one-sided P = .01]), favoring CE+V. The median overall survival was 10.3 versus 8.9 months (stratified HR, 0.83; 80% CI, 0.64 to 1.07; one-sided P = .17) for the CE+V and CE+P arms, respectively.The overall response rate was 71.9% versus 65.6% (two-sided P = .57) for CE+V and CE+P, respectively.There was a significant treatment-by-strata interaction in PFS: Male patients with high lactate dehydrogenase levels derived significant benefit (PFS HR, 0.34; 80% CI, 0.22 to 0.51) but there was no evidence of benefit among patients in other strata (PFS HR, 0.81; 80% CI, 0.60 to 1.09).The following grade >/= 3 hematology toxicities were more frequent in the CE+V arm than the CE+P arm: CD4 lymphopenia (8% v 0%; P = .06) and neutropenia (49% v 32%; P = .08), but treatment delivery was comparable.CONCLUSION: The addition of veliparib to frontline chemotherapy showed signal of efficacy in patients with ES-SCLC and the study met its prespecified end point.",1,1,1,0
21464158,"A cytokine and angiogenic factor (CAF) analysis in plasma for selection of sorafenib therapy in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.BACKGROUND: We investigated cytokines and angiogenic factors (CAFs) in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) treated in a randomized phase II clinical trial of sorafenib versus sorafenib+ interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) that yielded no differences in progression-free survival (PFS).We aimed to link the CAF profile to PFS and select candidate predictive and prognostic markers for further study.METHODS: The concentrations of 52 plasma CAFs were measured pretreatment (n = 69), day 28, and day 56 using multiplex bead arrays and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.We investigated the association between baseline levels of CAFs with PFS and posttreatment changes.RESULTS: Unsupervised CAF clustering analysis revealed two distinct mRCC patient groups with elevated proangiogenic or proinflammatory mediators.A six-marker baseline CAF signature [osteopontin, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), carbonic anhydrase 9, collagen IV, VEGF receptor-2, and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand] correlated with PFS benefit (hazard ratio 0.20 versus 2.25, signature negative versus positive, respectively; P = 0.0002).While changes in angiogenic factors were frequently attenuated by the sorafenib+ IFN combination, most key immunomodulatory mediators increased.CONCLUSIONS: Using CAF profiling, we identified two mRCC patient groups, a candidate plasma signature for predicting PFS benefit, and distinct marker changes occurring with each treatment.This platform may provide valuable insights into renal cell carcinoma biology and the molecular consequences of targeted therapies.",0,0,0,0

When Gleason score >7 was excluded, 177 men were left for case matching.At Massachusetts General Hospital, 203 similar patients were treated by a single brachytherapist from 1997 to 2002.Minimum follow-up was 3 years.Case matching, based on T stage, Gleason score, prostate-specific antigen, and age resulted in 141 matches (282 patients).Median follow-up was 8.6 and 7.4 years for EBRT and brachytherapy, respectively.The primary endpoint was biochemical failure (BF).RESULTS: Using the Phoenix definition, the 8-year BF rates were 7.7% and 16.1% for EBRT and brachytherapy, respectively (p = 0.42).A stratified analysis was performed by risk group.In the EBRT group, 113 and 28 patients were low and intermediate risk, respectively.In the brachytherapy group, 118 and 23 were.When stratified by risk group, the BF rates were similar by either technique.CONCLUSIONS: High-dose EBRT and brachytherapy result in similar BF rates for men with localized prostate cancer.Comparative quality-of-life and cost-effectiveness studies are warranted.",0,0,0,0
21553314,"Compression garments versus compression bandaging in decongestive lymphatic therapy for breast cancer-related lymphedema: a randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Lymphedema as a result of curative surgery for breast cancer can lead to long-term morbidity.Decongestive lymphatic therapy (DLT) is recognized as an optimal management strategy for patients with moderate symptomatologies, but there is little data in regard to the most effective means of providing compression therapy within a DLT protocol.We conducted a randomized trial of two forms of compression therapy within the initial treatment phase of a DLT protocol for breast cancer-related lymphedema.METHODS: Subjects were required to have mild-moderate lymphedema (10-40% volume difference) acquired as a result of curative breast cancer surgery and were randomized to compression bandaging or garments within the initial treatment phase of a DLT protocol.Primary endpoint was change in affected limb volume assessed via volumetry, and secondary endpoints were symptom control and upper extremity function assessed via visual analogue scales and the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire, respectively.Endpoints were assessed at day 10 of treatment and at 3 months and compared to baseline.RESULTS: Twenty-one subjects were available for analysis.The group receiving bandaging experienced greater median volume reductions at 10 days (70 vs. 5 mL; p = 0.387) and at 3 months (97.5 vs. 50 mL; p = 0.182).The bandaging group also experienced a greater increase in median DASH scores at 10 days (+20.9 vs. +5; p = 0.143) and at 3 months (+18.4 vs. +3.3; p = 0.065).CONCLUSION: Within the initial treatment phase of a DLT protocol for acquired, breast cancer-related lymphedema, compression bandaging may lead to greater volume reduction but worse upper extremity functional status (higher DASH scores) as compared to compression garments.",0,0,0,0
21660669,"Light treatment prevents fatigue in women undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer.PURPOSE: Fatigue is one of the most disturbing complaints of cancer patients and is often the reason for discontinuing treatment.This randomized controlled study tested the hypothesis that increased morning bright light, compared to dim light, would result in less fatigue in women with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy.METHODS: Thirty-nine women newly diagnosed with stage I-III breast cancer were randomized to either bright white light (BWL) or dim red light (DRL) treatment and were instructed to use the light box for 30 min every morning throughout the first four cycles of chemotherapy.The Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory was administered prior to the start of chemotherapy (baseline), during the chemotherapy treatment week of cycle 1 (C1TW), the last week (recovery week) of cycle 1 (C1RW), the chemotherapy treatment week of cycle 4 (C4TW), and the last week (recovery week) of cycle 4 (C4RW).RESULTS: The DRL group reported increased fatigue at C1TW (p = 0.003) and C4TW (p < 0.001) compared to baseline, while there was no significant change from baseline in the BWL group.A secondary analysis showed that the increases in fatigue levels in the DRL group were not mediated through nor associated with changes in sleep or in circadian rhythms as measured with wrist actigraphy.CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that morning bright light treatment may prevent overall fatigue from worsening during chemotherapy.Although our hypothesis that overall fatigue would improve with bright light treatment was not supported, the lack of deterioration in total fatigue scores suggests that bright morning light may be a useful intervention during chemotherapy for breast cancer.",0,0,0,0

22065199,"Temozolomide plus radiotherapy for glioblastoma in a Canadian province: efficacy versus effectiveness and the impact of O6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase promoter methylation.BACKGROUND: Radiotherapy with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide has been the standard of care for newly diagnosed glioblastoma in adults since the pivotal trial by Roger Stupp and colleagues.The effectiveness of this regimen has not been evaluated in Canada.Additionally, the impact of O6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation on patient survival has not been confirmed.Hence, survival outcomes and MGMT predictive value were compared for the patients in Alberta versus the Stupp trial population.METHODS: Retrospective chart review of 215 adult glioblastoma patients who started radiotherapy and temozolomide between January 2007 and December 2010 at the Cross Cancer Institute (Edmonton, Alberta) or the Tom Baker Cancer Centre (Calgary, Alberta).RESULTS: In the Alberta population, median overall survival was 14.3 months (vs. 14.6 months in trial, p = NS) and median progression-free survival was 5.8 months (vs. 6.9 months in trial, p = NS).However, unlike the trial, the Alberta MGMT subgroup analysis for overall survival was not statistically significant, despite a hazard ratio of 0.65 in favor of the methylated group.More Alberta patients received corticosteroids (p < 0.0001) and fewer underwent complete resection (p = 0.0001) or a postprogression second surgery (p = 0.01) than the Stupp population, but characteristics were otherwise similar.CONCLUSION: Current practice in Alberta enables patients to achieve overall and progression-free survival similar to the clinical trial.Further follow-up is required to confirm the predictive value of the MGMT assay.Until that is clarified or better treatments are developed, it is reasonable to continue offering this treatment regimen to patients regardless of MGMT methylation status.",0,0,0,0
22071311,"Cognitive performance after postoperative pituitary radiotherapy: a dosimetric study of the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex.OBJECTIVE: The hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC) are important for memory and executive functioning and are known to be sensitive to radiotherapy (RT).Radiation dosimetry relates radiation exposure to specific brain areas.The effects of various pituitary RT techniques were studied by relating detailed dosimetry of the hippocampus and PFC to cognitive performance.METHODS: In this cross-sectional design, 75 non-functioning pituitary macroadenoma (NFA) patients (61+/-10 years) participated and were divided into irradiated (RT+, n=30) and non-irradiated (RT-, n=45) groups.The RT+ group (who all received 25 fractions of 1.8 Gy; total dose: 45 Gy) consisted of three RT technique groups: three-field technique, n=10; four-field technique, n=15; and five-field technique, n=5.Memory and executive functioning were assessed by standardized neuropsychological tests.A reconstruction of the dose distributions for the three RT techniques was made.The RT doses on 30, 50, and 70% of the volume of the left and right hippocampus and PFC were calculated.RESULTS: Cognitive test performance was not different between the four groups, despite differences in radiation doses applied to the hippocampi and PFC.Age at RT, time since RT, and the use of thyroid hormone varied significantly between the groups; however, they were not related to cognitive performance.CONCLUSION: This study showed that there were no significant differences on cognitive performance between the three-, four-, and five-field RT groups and the non-irradiated patient group.A dose-response relationship could not be established, even with a radiation dose that was higher on most of the volume of the hippocampus and PFC in case of a four-field RT technique compared with the three- and five-field RT techniques.",0,0,0,0
22075171,"Overall efficacy of HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine against grade 3 or greater cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: 4-year end-of-study analysis of the randomised, double-blind PATRICIA trial.BACKGROUND: Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or greater (CIN2+) is the surrogate endpoint used in licensure trials of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines.Vaccine efficacy against CIN3+, the immediate precursor to invasive cervical cancer, is more difficult to measure because of its lower incidence, but provides the most stringent evidence of potential cancer prevention.We report vaccine efficacy against CIN3+ and adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) in the end-of-study analysis of PATRICIA (PApilloma TRIal against Cancer In young Adults).METHODS: Healthy women aged 15-25 years with no more than six lifetime sexual partners were included in PATRICIA, irrespective of their baseline HPV DNA status, HPV-16 or HPV-18 serostatus, or cytology.Women were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive an HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine or a control hepatitis A vaccine via an internet-based central randomisation system using a minimisation algorithm to account for age ranges and study sites.The patients and study investigators were masked to allocated vaccine.The primary endpoint of PATRICIA has been reported previously.In the present end-of-study analysis, we focus on CIN3+ and AIS in the populations of most clinical interest, the total vaccinated cohort (TVC) and the TVC-naive.The TVC comprised all women who received at least one vaccine dose, approximating catch-up populations and including sexually active women (vaccine n=9319; control=9325).The TVC-naive comprised women with no evidence of oncogenic HPV infection at baseline, approximating early adolescent HPV exposure (vaccine n=5824; control=5820).This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00122681.FINDINGS: Vaccine efficacy against CIN3+ associated with HPV-16/18 was 100% (95% CI 85.5-100) in the TVC-naive and 45.7% (22.9-62.2) in the TVC.Vaccine efficacy against all CIN3+ (irrespective of HPV type in the lesion and including lesions with no HPV DNA detected) was 93.2% (78.9-98.7) in the TVC-naive and 45.6% (28.8-58.7) in the TVC.In the TVC-naive, vaccine efficacy against all CIN3+ was higher than 90% in all age groups.In the TVC, vaccine efficacy against all CIN3+ and CIN3+ associated with HPV-16/18 was highest in the 15-17 year age group and progressively decreased in the 18-20 year and 21-25 year age groups.Vaccine efficacy against all AIS was 100% (31.0-100) and 76.9% (16.0-95.8) in the TVC-naive and TVC, respectively.Serious adverse events occurred in 835 (9.0%) and 829 (8.9%) women in the vaccine and control groups, respectively; only ten events (0.1%) and five events (0.1%), respectively, were considered to be related to vaccination.INTERPRETATION: PATRICIA end-of-study results show excellent vaccine efficacy against CIN3+ and AIS irrespective of HPV DNA in the lesion.Population-based vaccination that incorporates the HPV-16/18 vaccine and high coverage of early adolescents might have the potential to substantially reduce the incidence of cervical cancer.FUNDING: GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals.",0,0,0,0
22086774,"[Stem cell-induced liver regeneration].BACKGROUND: The liver has an excellent regenerative capacity after resection.However, below a critical level of future liver remnant volume (FLRV), partial hepatectomy is accompanied by a significant increase of postoperative liver failure.There is accumulating evidence for the contribution of bone marrow stem cells (BMSC) to participate in liver regeneration.Here we report our experience with portal vein embolisation (PVE) and CD133+ BMSC administration to the liver, compared with PVE alone, to augment hepatic regeneration in patients with critically low FLRV or impaired liver function.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eleven patients underwent PVE of liver segments I and IV-VIII to stimulate hepatic regeneration prior to extended right hepatectomy.In these 11 patients with a FLRV below 25% and/or limited quality of hepatic parenchyma, PVE alone did not promise adequate proliferation.These patients underwent additional BMSC administration to segments II and III.Two radiologists blinded to patients' identity and each other's results measured liver and tumour volumes with helical computed tomography.Absolute, relative and daily FLRV gains were compared with a group of patients that underwent PVE alone.RESULTS: The increase of the mean absolute FLRV after PVE with BMSC application from 239.3 mL+/-103.5 (standard deviation) to 417.1 mL+/-150.4 was significantly higher than that from 286.3 mL+/-77.1 to 395.9 mL+/-94.1 after PVE alone (p<0.05).Also the relative gain of FLRV in this group (77.3%+/-38.2%) was significantly higher than that after PVE alone (39.1%+/-20.4%) (P=0.039).In addition, the daily hepatic growth rate after PVE and BMSC application (9.5+/-4.3 mL/d) was significantly superior to that after PVE alone (4.1+/-1.9 mL/d) (p=0.03).Time to surgery was 27 days+/-11 in this group and 45 days+/-21 after PVE alone (p=0.02).Short- and long-term survival were not negatively influenced by the shorter waiting period.CONCLUSION: In patients with malignant liver lesions, the combination of PVE with CD133+ BMSC administration substantially increased hepatic regeneration compared with PVE alone.This procedure bears the potential to allow the safe resection of patients with a curative intention that would otherwise carry the risk post-operative liver failure.",0,0,0,0

22101228,"The Family Health Promotion Project (FHPP): design and baseline data from a randomized trial to increase colonoscopy screening in high risk families.Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a significant cause of mortality and morbidity in the United States, much of which could be prevented through adequate screening.Consensus guidelines recommend that high-risk groups initiate screening earlier with colonoscopy and more frequently than average risk persons.However, a large proportion of high risk individuals do not receive regular colonoscopic screening.The Family Health Promotion Project (FHPP) is a randomized-controlled trial to test the effectiveness of a telephone-based counseling intervention to increase adherence to risk-appropriate colonoscopy screening in high risk individuals.Unaffected members of CRC families from two national cancer family registries were enrolled (n=632) and randomized to receive either a single session telephone counseling intervention using Motivational Interviewing techniques or a minimal mail-out intervention.The primary endpoint, rate of colonoscopy screening, was assessed at 6, 12 and 24 months post-enrollment.In this paper, we describe the research design and telephone counseling intervention of the FHPP trial, and report baseline data obtained from the two high risk cohorts recruited into this trial.Results obtained at baseline confirm the need for interventions to promote colonoscopy screening among these high risk individuals, as well as highlighting several key opportunities for intervention, including increasing knowledge about risk-appropriate screening guidelines, and providing both tailored risk information and barriers counseling.",0,0,0,0
22104618,"Does health-related quality of life improve for advanced pancreatic cancer patients who respond to gemcitabine? Analysis of a randomized phase III trial of the cancer and leukemia group B (CALGB 80303).CONTEXT: Gemcitabine for advanced pancreatic cancer (APC) is palliative and the prognosis is poor, making health-related quality of life (HRQOL) particularly important.OBJECTIVES: We evaluated HRQOL with the EuroQol (EQ-5D) in patients with APC participating in Cancer and Leukemia Group B 80303, a multicenter, double-blind, randomized trial comparing overall survival (OS) between two treatment arms: gemcitabine with bevacizumab or gemcitabine with placebo.METHODS: A consecutive subsample of patients was invited to complete the EQ-5D surveys.Because neither clinical nor HRQOL outcomes differed based on the study arm, analyses were pooled.Changes in mean scores from baseline to eight weeks and the prognostic value of the EQ-5D were evaluated.RESULTS: Mean index scores remained stable (0.78 at baseline [n=267], 0.79 at eight weeks [n=186], P=0.34, Wilcoxon signed rank test), attributable to a modest deterioration of physical function domain scores coincident with small improvements in pain and anxiety/depression scores.A small decline in visual analogue scale scores was observed (70.7 vs. 68.2, P=0.026).HRQOL changes within chemotherapy response strata revealed stable index scores but a trend of worsened physical function among patients with disease progression compared with those with stable or improved disease.Visual analogue scale scores trended downward over time irrespective of chemotherapy response status, with a statistically meaningful deterioration in patients who progressed (68.9 vs. 64.4, P=0.029).Baseline scores from both EQ-5D scales were significant predictors of OS in Cox proportional hazard models.CONCLUSION: Response to gemcitabine treatment in APC is not associated with appreciable improvement of global HRQOL.Small improvements in pain and mood are observed despite progressive functional decline.Those who respond to gemcitabine may experience a slight slowing of functional deterioration.",0,0,0,0
22115704,"Comparison of pemetrexed plus cisplatin with other first-line doublets in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC): a combined analysis of three phase 3 trials.INTRODUCTION: In a first-line study of advanced NSCLC, pemetrexed-cisplatin was more effective among patients with adenocarcinoma and large-cell carcinoma compared with gemcitabine-cisplatin (median survival of 11.8 versus 10.4 months, P=.005), while survival with pemetrexed-cisplatin was shorter than with gemcitabine-cisplatin in patients with squamous cell carcinoma.The comparability of pemetrexed-cisplatin to other commonly used regimens within histology subgroups needs to be explored.METHODS: This retrospective analysis combined the patient-level data from three phase 3 randomized controlled trials that compared the efficacy of different third generation platinum- and non-platinum based doublets.Unadjusted median survival times and Cox covariate-adjusted treatment hazard ratio (HR) estimates were calculated.Overall results and subgroups by histological type were reported.RESULTS: This combined analysis consisted of 3467 patients.In the overall analysis, adjusted HRs favored pemetrexed (HR <1.0) to each of the other 5 regimens, though none of these HRs were statistically significant.Among patients with non-squamous histology, pemetrexed-cisplatin produced favorable HRs to each of the other regimens, achieving statistical significance when compared with vinorelbine-cisplatin (HR=0.67; 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 0.50, 0.91) and gemcitabine-cisplatin (HR=0.85; 95% CI: 0.75, 0.97).Among patients with squamous histology, 4 of the 5 comparison regimens produced favorable HRs (HR >1.0) when compared with pemetrexed-cisplatin, with only the comparison with gemcitabine-cisplatin achieving statistical significance (HR=1.23; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.51).CONCLUSION: In the absence of randomized clinical trial data comparing pemetrexed-cisplatin to commonly used doublets in advanced NSCLC other than gemcitabine-cisplatin, this combined analysis of multiple trials provides estimates for such comparisons.",0,0,0,0

Part 2 assessed efficacy and safety of siltuximab plus M/P versus M/P alone.The primary end-point was progression-free survival (PFS).Progression was defined as progressive disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST), or >/= 3 new skeletal lesions with clinical deterioration or without deterioration confirmed by repeated bone scan.Rising prostate-specific antigen was not considered progression.RESULTS: Siltuximab plus M/P was well tolerated in Part 1 (n=9).In Part 2, 48 and 49 patients received siltuximab plus M/P or M/P alone, respectively.Enrolment was prematurely terminated by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee since an apparent imbalance in patient baseline characteristics (favoring the M/P only arm) made it unlikely that the study could achieve its primary efficacy end-point.Median PFS was 97 days with siltuximab combination and 228 days with M/P alone (hazard ratio, 1.72; P=0.043).Use of a novel non-validated PFS definition may have contributed to this result.Abnormal laboratory assessments were more frequent with the combination.Infection and febrile neutropenia rates were similar between groups.Greater C-reactive protein suppression was achieved during siltuximab combination treatment compared with M/P alone (P=0.0003).CONCLUSION: While siltuximab plus M/P appeared well tolerated, improvement in outcomes was not demonstrated.",0,0,0,0
22130166,"Ipilimumab increases activated T cells and enhances humoral immunity in patients with advanced melanoma.Ipilimumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody, which blocks cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4, has demonstrated an improvement in overall survival in 2 phase III trials of patients with advanced melanoma.To gain an understanding of its mechanism of action, the effects of ipilimumab on T-cell populations and on humoral immune responses were studied in patients with advanced melanoma from 2 phase II trials.Antibody levels against 5 tumor antigens were assessed at baseline and up to 12 weeks after ipilimumab treatment.Serologic reactivity to the cancer-testis antigen NY-ESO-1 increased by at least 5-fold at week 12 of treatment in 10% to 13% of patients.Increased antibody levels were also observed to the tumor antigens Melan-A, MAGE-A4, SSX2, and p53.Immunocompetence was evaluated with tetanus boosters administered before ipilimumab and pneumococcal and influenza vaccines given 5 days after ipilimumab treatment.At week 7, most patients who received ipilimumab and vaccine showed greater humoral responses relative to baseline titers.For peripheral T-cell populations, statistically significant increases in the percent of activated (HLA-DR) CD4 and CD8 T cells with concomitant decreases in naive CD4 and CD8 T cells were observed after ipilimumab treatment.These changes were evident by week 4 of treatment.Increases were also observed in central memory, effector memory, and activated ICOS CD4 T cells, but not in ICOS CD8 T cells or in FoxP3 CD4 regulatory T cells.These results suggest that ipilimumab can enhance immune responses mediated by different T-cell populations, and humoral immunity, in melanoma patients.",0,0,0,0

22146893,"An immune-active tumor microenvironment favors clinical response to ipilimumab.PURPOSE: Ipilimumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody specific to CTLA-4, has been shown to improve overall survival in metastatic melanoma patients.As a consequence of CTLA-4 blockade, ipilimumab treatment is associated with proliferation and activation of peripheral T cells.To better understand various tumor-associated components that may influence the clinical outcome of ipilimumab treatment, gene expression profiles of tumors from patients treated with ipilimumab were characterized.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Gene expression profiling was performed on tumor biopsies collected from 45 melanoma patients before and 3 weeks after the start of treatment in a phase II clinical trial.RESULTS: Analysis of pre-treatment tumors indicated that patients with high baseline expression levels of immune-related genes were more likely to respond favorably to ipilimumab.Furthermore, ipilimumab appeared to induce two major changes in tumors from patients who exhibited clinical activity: genes involved in immune response showed increased expression, whereas expression of genes for melanoma-specific antigens and genes involved in cell proliferation decreased.These changes were associated with the total lymphocyte infiltrate in tumors, and there was a suggestion of association with prolonged overall survival in these patients.Many IFN-gamma-inducible genes and Th1-associated markers showed increased expression after ipilimumab treatment, suggesting an accumulation of this particular type of T cell at the tumor sites, which might play an important role in mediating the antitumor activity of ipilimumab.CONCLUSIONS: These results support the proposed mechanism of action of ipilimumab, suggesting that cell-mediated immune responses play an important role in the antitumor activity of ipilimumab.",0,0,0,0

22473163,"Multicenter randomized phase II clinical trial comparing neoadjuvant oxaliplatin, capecitabine, and preoperative radiotherapy with or without cetuximab followed by total mesorectal excision in patients with high-risk rectal cancer (EXPERT-C).PURPOSE: To evaluate the addition of cetuximab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy before chemoradiotherapy in high-risk rectal cancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with operable magnetic resonance imaging-defined high-risk rectal cancer received four cycles of capecitabine/oxaliplatin (CAPOX) followed by capecitabine chemoradiotherapy, surgery, and adjuvant CAPOX (four cycles) or the same regimen plus weekly cetuximab (CAPOX+C).The primary end point was complete response (CR; pathologic CR or, in patients not undergoing surgery, radiologic CR) in patients with KRAS/BRAF wild-type tumors.Secondary end points were radiologic response (RR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety in the wild-type and overall populations and a molecular biomarker analysis.RESULTS: One hundred sixty-five eligible patients were randomly assigned.Ninety (60%) of 149 assessable tumors were KRAS or BRAF wild type (CAPOX, n = 44; CAPOX+C, n = 46), and in these patients, the addition of cetuximab did not improve the primary end point of CR (9% v 11%, respectively; P = 1.0; odds ratio, 1.22) or PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.65; P = .363).Cetuximab significantly improved RR (CAPOX v CAPOX+C: after chemotherapy, 51% v 71%, respectively; P = .038; after chemoradiation, 75% v 93%, respectively; P = .028) and OS (HR, 0.27; P = .034).Skin toxicity and diarrhea were more frequent in the CAPOX+C arm.CONCLUSION: Cetuximab led to a significant increase in RR and OS in patients with KRAS/BRAF wild-type rectal cancer, but the primary end point of improved CR was not met.",1,1,1,1
22474202,"Effect of oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and leucovorin with or without cetuximab on survival among patients with resected stage III colon cancer: a randomized trial.CONTEXT: Leucovorin, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) is the standard adjuvant therapy for resected stage III colon cancer.Adding cetuximab to FOLFOX benefits patients with metastatic wild-type KRAS but not mutated KRAS colon cancer.OBJECTIVE: To assess the potential benefit of cetuximab added to the modified sixth version of the FOLFOX regimen (mFOLFOX6) in patients with resected stage III wild-type KRAS colon cancer.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A randomized trial of 2686 patients aged 18 years or older at multiple institutions across North America enrolled following resection and informed consent between February 10, 2004, and November 25, 2009.The primary randomized comparison was 12 biweekly cycles of mFOLFOX6 with and without cetuximab.KRAS mutation status was centrally determined.The trial was halted after a planned interim analysis of 48% of predicted events (246/515) occurring in 1863 (of 2070 planned) patients with tumors having wild-type KRAS.A total of 717 patients with mutated KRAS and 106 with indeterminate KRAS were accrued.The 2070 patients with wild-type KRAS provided 90% power to detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.33 (2-sided alpha = .05), with planned interim efficacy analyses after 25%, 50%, and 75% of expected relapses.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Disease-free survival in patients with wild-type KRAS mutations.Secondary end points included overall survival and toxicity.RESULTS: Median (range) follow-up was 28 (0-68) months.The trial demonstrated no benefit when adding cetuximab.Three-year disease-free survival for mFOLFOX6 alone was 74.6% vs 71.5% with the addition of cetuximab (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.98-1.49; P = .08) in patients with wild-type KRAS, and 67.1% vs 65.0% (HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.86-1.46; P = .38) in patients with mutated KRAS, with no significant benefit in any subgroups assessed.Among all patients, grade 3 or higher adverse events (72.5% vs 52.3%; odds ratio [OR], 2.4; 95% CI, 2.1-2.8; P < .001) and failure to complete 12 cycles (33% vs 23%; OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.4-1.9; P < .001) were significantly higher with cetuximab.Increased toxicity and greater detrimental differences in all outcomes were observed in patients aged 70 years or older.CONCLUSION: Among patients with stage III resected colon cancer, the use of cetuximab with adjuvant mFOLFOX6 compared with mFOLFOX6 alone did not result in improved disease-free survival.TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00079274.",1,1,1,1
22488038,"Prediction of overall survival through circadian rest-activity monitoring during chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer.The clinical relevance of circadian rhythm modifications in patients on chemotherapy is unknown.Even so, circadian parameter I<O before chemotherapy independently predicted overall survival.This study investigates the relevance of I<O measured during chemotherapy for survival and symptoms.The circadian rest-activity pattern was monitored for 3 days using a wristwatch actigraph while 77 patients were receiving a chemotherapy course within an international randomized Phase III trial.Treatment consisted of first-line chronomodulated or conventional delivery of 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin and oxaliplatin for metastatic colorectal cancer.I<O was computed as the percentage of minutes of activity counts in bed which were below the median of activity out of bed.Circadian disruption was defined by I<O equal to or less than 97.5%.Circadian disruption occurred in 39 patients (51%) on chemotherapy.It was associated with a significantly shorter overall survival, independently of other prognostic factors (multivariate Hazard Ratio: 2.12; p = 0.004).The median survival of patients with a robust circadian rhythm was 22.3 months as compared to 14.7 months in those with circadian disruption during chemotherapy.No toxicity was significantly associated with circadian disruption, but the incidence of grade >/= 2 fatigue and of body weight loss >/= 5% was two and threefold higher, respectively, in patients with disrupted circadian rhythm on chemotherapy.Chemotherapy disrupted circadian activity rhythm in nearly 50% of the patients.Circadian disruption on chemotherapy predicted for shorter overall survival.The prevention of chemotherapy-induced circadian disruption might reduce toxicity and improve efficacy in cancer patients.",0,0,0,0
22488460,"Efficient identification and referral of low-income women at high risk for hereditary breast cancer: a practice-based approach.BACKGROUND: Identification of low-income women with the rare but serious risk of hereditary cancer and their referral to appropriate services presents an important public health challenge.We report the results of formative research to reach thousands of women for efficient identification of those at high risk and expedient access to free genetic services.External validity is maximized by emphasizing intervention fit with the two end-user organizations who must connect to make this possible.This study phase informed the design of a subsequent randomized controlled trial.METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled pilot study (n = 38) to compare two intervention models for feasibility and impact.The main outcome was receipt of genetic counseling during a two-month intervention period.Model 1 was based on the usual outcall protocol of an academic hospital genetic risk program, and Model 2 drew on the screening and referral procedures of a statewide toll-free phone line through which large numbers of high-risk women can be identified.In Model 1, the risk program proactively calls patients to schedule genetic counseling; for Model 2, women are notified of their eligibility for counseling and make the call themselves.We also developed and pretested a family history screener for administration by phone to identify women appropriate for genetic counseling.RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in receipt of genetic counseling between women randomized to Model 1 (3/18) compared with Model 2 (3/20) during the intervention period.However, when unresponsive women in Model 2 were called after 2 months, 7 more obtained counseling; 4 women from Model 1 were also counseled after the intervention.Thus, the intervention model that closely aligned with the risk program's outcall to high-risk women was found to be feasible and brought more low-income women to free genetic counseling.Our screener was easy to administer by phone and appeared to identify high-risk callers effectively.The model and screener are now in use in the main trial to test the effectiveness of this screening and referral intervention.A validation analysis of the screener is also underway.CONCLUSION: Identification of intervention strategies and tools, and their systematic comparison for impact and efficiency in the context where they will ultimately be usedare critical elements of practice-based research.",0,0,0,0
22488488,"The impact of PLCO control arm contamination on perceived PSA screening efficacy.PURPOSE: To quantify the extent to which a clinically significant prostate cancer mortality reduction due to screening could have been masked by control arm screening (contamination) in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) trial.METHODS: We used three independently developed models of prostate cancer natural history to conduct a virtual PLCO trial.Simulated participants underwent pre-trial screening based on population patterns.The intervention arm followed observed compliance during the trial then resumed population screening.A contaminated control arm followed observed contamination during the trial then resumed population screening, while an uncontaminated control arm discontinued screening upon entry.We assumed a clinically significant screening benefit, applied population treatments and survival patterns, and calculated mortality rate ratios relative to the contaminated and uncontaminated control arms.RESULTS: The virtual trial reproduced observed incidence, including stage and grade distributions, and control arm mortality after 10 years of complete follow-up.Under the assumed screening benefit, the three models found that contamination increased the mortality rate ratio from 0.68-0.77 to 0.86-0.91, increased the chance of excess mortality in the intervention arm from 0-4 % to 15-28 %, and decreased the power of the trial to detect a mortality difference from 40-70 % to 9-25 %.CONCLUSIONS: Our computer simulation models indicate that contamination substantially limited the ability of the PLCO to identify a clinically significant screening benefit.While the trial shows annual screening does not reduce mortality relative to population screening, contamination prevents concluding whether screening reduces mortality relative to no screening.",0,0,0,0
22493375,"Intra-arterial infusion of irinotecan-loaded drug-eluting beads (DEBIRI) versus intravenous therapy (FOLFIRI) for hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer: final results of a phase III study.BACKGROUND: Metastases to the liver receive most of their blood supply from the arterial route, therefore for patients with hepatic metastases from large bowel cancer, hepatic arterial infusion adopting drug-eluting beads preloaded with irinotecan (DEBIRI) may offer a chance of cure.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a multi-institutional study, 74 patients were randomly assigned to receive DEBIRI (36) versus systemic irinotecan, fluorouracil and leucovorin (FOLFIRI, 38).The primary end-point was survival; secondary end points were response, recurrence, toxicity, quality of life, cost and influence of molecular markers.RESULTS: At 50 months, overall survival was significantly longer for patients treated with DEBIRI than for those treated with FOLFIRI (p=0.031, log-rank).Median survival was 22 (95% Confidence Interval CI=21-23) months, for DEBIRI and 15 (95% CI=12-18) months for FOLFIRI.Progression-free survival was 7 (95% CI=3-11) months in the DEBIRI group compared to 4 (95% CI=3-5) months in the FOLFIRI group and the difference between groups was statistically significant (p=0.006, log-rank).Extrahepatic progression had occurred in all patients by the end of the study, at a median time of 13 (95% CI=10-16) months in the DEBIRI group compared to 9 (95% CI 5-13) months in the FOLFIRI group.A statistically significant difference between groups was not observed (p=0.064, log-rank).The median time for duration of improvement to quality of life was 8 (95% CI=3-13) months in the DEBIRI group and 3 (95% CI=2-4) months in the FOLFIRI group.The difference in duration of improvement was statistically significant (p=0.00002, log-rank).CONCLUSION: This study showed a statistically significant difference between DEBIRI and FOLFIRI for overall survival (7 months), progression-free survival (3 months) and quality of life (5 months).In addition, a clinically significant improvement in time to extrahepatic progression (4 months) was observed for DEBIRI, a reversal of the expectation for a regional treatment.This suggests a benefit of DEBIRI treatment over standard chemotherapy and serves to establish the expected difference between these two treatment options for planning future large randomized studies.",1,1,1,0

(600 mg/m(2) day 1-28 of a 56-day cycle) for a maximum of 12 cycles (i.v.) or 12 months (p.o.).Indecisive patients were randomized.Toxicity was evaluated according to the NCI-CTC version 2.0.RESULTS: Twenty-five of 51 recruited patients completed therapy at the time of the planned interim analysis (median age, 75 years; range, 70-82).Median ECOG was 1, and median number of prior chemotherapy regimens was 2.A median number of 4 cycles (range, 1-12) were administered per patient.Anemia was the most common hematological toxicity (88 % of patients).Most frequent non-hematological toxicities were nausea (76 %), constipation (68 %), and fatigue (64 %).CONCLUSION: Treatment was generally well tolerated despite the fact that most patients suffered from multiple comorbidities and were heavily pretreated.There were no unexpected hematological or non-hematological toxicities.Based on this safety analysis, the next step of study recruitment was continued.",0,0,0,0
22526165,"Randomized study on early detection of lung cancer with MSCT in Germany: study design and results of the first screening round.PURPOSE: Low-dose multislice-CT (MSCT) detects many early-stage lung cancers with good prognosis, but whether it decreases lung cancer mortality and at which costs is yet insufficiently explored.Scope of the present study is to examine within a common European effort whether MSCT screening is capable to reduce the lung cancer mortality by at least 20 % and at which amount of undesired side effects this could be achieved.METHODS: Overall 4,052 heavy smoking men and women were recruited by a population-based approach and randomized into a screening arm with five annual MSCT screens and an initial quit-smoking counseling, and a control arm with initial quit-smoking counseling and five annual questionnaire inquiries.RESULTS: In the first screening round, 2,029 participants received a MSCT providing 1,488 negative and 540 suspicious screens with early recalls (early recall rate 26.6 %) leading to 31 biopsies (biopsy rate 1.5 %) and 22 confirmed lung cancers (detection rate 1.1 %).Among the lung cancers, 15 were adenocarcinomas, 3 squamous cell carcinomas, one small-cell lung cancer, and 3 others, whereby 18 were in clinical stage I, one in stage II, and 3 in stage III.One interval cancer occurred.CONCLUSIONS: The indicated performance indicators fit into the range observed in comparable trials.The study continues finalizing the second screening round and for the first participants even the last screening round.The unresolved issue of the precise amount of side effects and the high early recall rate precludes currently the recommendation of MSCT as screening tool for lung cancer.",0,0,0,0
22540955,"The impact of routine open nonsuction drainage on fluid accumulation after thyroid surgery: a prospective randomised clinical trial.BACKGROUND: Thyroid drains following thyroid surgery are routinely used despite minimal supportive evidence.Our aim in this study is to determine the impact of routine open drainage of the thyroid bed postoperatively on ultrasound-determined fluid accumulation at 24 hours.METHODS: We conducted a prospective randomised clinical trial on patients undergoing thyroid surgery.Patients were randomly assigned to a drain group (n = 49) or a no-drain group (n = 44) immediately prior to wound closure.Patients underwent a neck ultrasound on day 1 and day 2 postoperatively.After surgery, we evaluated visual analogue scale pain scores, postoperative analgesic requirements, self-reported scar satisfaction at 6 weeks and complications.RESULTS: There was significantly less mean fluid accumulated in the drain group on both day 1, 16.4 versus 25.1 ml (P-value = 0.005), and day 2, 18.4 versus 25.7 ml (P-value = 0.026), following surgery.We found no significant differences between the groups with regard to length of stay, scar satisfaction, visual analogue scale pain score and analgesic requirements.There were four versus one wound infections in the drain versus no-drain groups.This finding was not statistically significant (P = 0.154).No life-threatening bleeds occurred in either group.CONCLUSIONS: Fluid accumulation after thyroid surgery was significantly lessened by drainage.However, this study did not show any clinical benefit associated with this finding in the nonemergent setting.Drains themselves showed a trend indicating that they may augment infection rates.The results of this study suggest that the frequency of acute life-threatening bleeds remains extremely low following abandoning drains.We advocate abandoning routine use of thyroid drains.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN94715414.",0,0,0,0
22546317,"Evaluating the Ozioma cancer news service: a community randomized trial in 24 U.S. cities.OBJECTIVE: This community randomized trial evaluated effects of the Ozioma News Service on the amount and quality of cancer coverage in Black weekly newspapers in 24 U.S. cities.METHOD: We created and operated Ozioma, the first cancer information news service specifically for Black newspapers.Over 21 months, Ozioma developed community- and race-specific cancer news releases for each of 12 Black weekly newspapers in intervention communities.Cancer coverage in these papers was tracked before and during the intervention and compared to 12 Black newspapers in control communities.RESULTS: From 2004 to 2007, we coded 9257 health and cancer stories from 3178 newspaper issues.Intervention newspapers published approximately 4 times the expected number of cancer stories compared to control newspapers (p(12,21 mo)<.01), and also saw an increase in graphics (p(12,21 mo)<.01), local relevance (p(12 mo)=.01), and personal mobilization (p(12 mo)<.10).However, this increased coverage supplanted other health topics and had smaller graphics (NS), had less community mobilization (p(21 mo)=.01), and is less likely to be from a local source (NS).CONCLUSION: Providing news releases with localized and race-specific features to minority-serving media outlets can increase the quantity of cancer coverage.Results are mixed for the journalistic and public health quality of this increased cancer coverage in Black newspapers.",0,0,0,0
22548907,"Improved surgical safety after laparoscopic compared to open surgery for apparent early stage endometrial cancer: results from a randomised controlled trial.AIM: To compare Total Laparoscopic Hysterectomy (TLH) and Total Abdominal Hysterectomy (TAH) with regard to surgical safety.METHODS: Between October 2005 and June 2010, 760 patients with apparent early stage endometrial cancer were enroled in a multicentre, randomised clinical trial (LACE) comparing outcomes following TLH or TAH.The main study end points for this analysis were surgical adverse events (AE), hospital length of stay, conversion from laparoscopy to laparotomy, including 753 patients who completed at least 6 weeks of follow-up.Postoperative AEs were graded according to Common Toxicity Criteria (V3), and those immediately life-threatening, requiring inpatient hospitalisation or prolonged hospitalisation, or resulting in persistent or significant disability/incapacity were regarded as serious AEs.RESULTS: The incidence of intra-operative AEs was comparable in either group.The incidence of post-operative AE CTC grade 3+ (18.6% in TAH, 12.9% in TLH, p 0.03) and serious AE (14.3% in TAH, 8.2% in TLH, p 0.007) was significantly higher in the TAH group compared to the TLH group.Mean operating time was 132 and 107 min, and median length of hospital stay was 2 and 5 days in the TLH and TAH group, respectively (p<0.0001).The decline of haemoglobin from baseline to day 1 postoperatively was 2g/L less in the TLH group (p 0.006).CONCLUSIONS: Compared to TAH, TLH is associated with a significantly decreased risk of major surgical AEs.A laparoscopic surgical approach to early stage endometrial cancer is safe.",0,0,0,0
22552048,"Efficacy of docetaxel-based chemotherapy following ketoconazole in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: implications for prior therapy in clinical trials.OBJECTIVES: Abiraterone acetate (AA) is a CYP17 inhibitor of androgen synthesis approved for use following docetaxel for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC); evaluation in the pre-docetaxel setting is ongoing.Given that the reported efficacy of AA is lower following docetaxel vs. pre-docetaxel, the potential exists for cross resistance given docetaxel's partly androgen receptor targeting activity.The efficacy of docetaxel following ketoconazole (KC), a weaker and nonspecific inhibitor of CYP17, may provide some insights into this potential interaction.We retrospectively evaluated the efficacy of every 3-week docetaxel with prednisone (DP) in mCRPC previously exposed to KC compared to KC-naive patients.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A randomized phase II trial of men with mCRPC treated with DP + AT-101 (bcl-2 inhibitor) vs. DP plus placebo was analyzed.Both arms were combined for analysis as no significant differences were seen.Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective response (ORR), pain, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rates were estimated with and without prior KC.Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate the effect of covariates on OS.RESULTS: Of 220 evaluable men, 40 (18.2%) received prior KC.The median OS with DP-based therapy of KC-naive patients (18.3 months, 95% CI: 15.0, 24.5) and post-KC patients (17.0 months, 95% CI: 9.9, 20.4) was not statistically different (P = 0.20).After controlling for prognostic classifications, analyses demonstrated consistent trends for worsening of OS after KC, with (hazard ratios (HRs) 1.33-1.46.Similar unfavorable trends were observed for ORR, PSA declines, and PFS.CONCLUSIONS: In this hypothesis-generating analysis, patients treated with docetaxel-based chemotherapy following prior KC had numerically and consistently worse outcomes than patients not exposed to prior KC.Although the estimated differences did not attain statistical significance, evaluation of outcomes with docetaxel in particular, and all classes of novel and emerging agents following AA, is of clinical importance, given its more potent androgen synthesis inhibition compared with KC.Drug development should take into account the potential impact of previous therapy.",0,0,0,0

22795327,"Selected polymorphisms of GSTP1 and TERT were associated with glioma risk in Han Chinese.BACKGROUND: Current evidence suggests that a majority of the inherited risks play a major role in glioma susceptibility, and glioma is due to the co-inheritance of multiple low-risk variants.These variants can be identified through association studies including such as genome-wide association studies (GWAS), which has led the glioma epidemiology researchers to focus on identifying potential disease-causing factors.METHODS: We evaluated and validated 10 tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (tSNPs) in seven genes associated with glioma susceptibility in a Han Chinese population, including 301 glioma cases and 302 controls, using a multiplexed single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) MassEXTEND assay.We ascertained the genotypic frequencies for each tSNP in control subjects were within Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) using an exact test, and then compared the genotype and allele frequencies of glioma patients and control subjects using the chi2 test.We then applied three genetic models (dominant, recessive, and additive) using PLINK software to assess the association of each tSNP with glioma risk.RESULTS: We identified two tSNPs to be associated with glioma susceptibility (rs1695, GSTP1, P = 0.019; rs2853676, TERT, P = 0.039), which we confirmed using dominant and additive model analyses.The genotype &ldquo;GA&rdquo; for rs1695 was recognized to be a protective genotype for glioma (OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.47-0.96; P = 0.027), while the genotype &ldquo;AG&rdquo; for rs2853676 was shown to be a risk genotype for glioma (OR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.05-2.15; P = 0.025).CONCLUSION: Our results, and those from previous studies, suggest potential genetic contributes for GSTP1 and TERT in glioma development.",0,0,0,0
22795435,"American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z4099/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 1021: a randomized study of sublobar resection compared with stereotactic body radiotherapy for high-risk stage I non-small cell lung cancer.During the past decade, tremendous interest has arisen in the use of nonoperative therapies for patients with non-small cell lung cancer.Of these therapies, stereotactic body radiotherapy has become established as an effective modality for treating peripheral cancer in medically inoperable patients.Toxicity is low, and the treatment is effective, with excellent local control rates.Several investigators have suggested that stereotactic body radiotherapy could be effective for high-risk operable patients (usually treated with sublobar resection) and even perhaps for standard-risk operable patients (usually treated with lobectomy); however, this is less accepted.A direct comparison of stereotactic body radiotherapy and sublobar resection is difficult for a number of reasons.These include different definitions of recurrence, different populations of patients in these studies (with those undergoing stereotactic body radiotherapy tending to be the medically inoperable group), and different methods of classifying morbidity in the surgical and radiation oncology studies.Imaging follow-up has also not been standardized among the studies.Thus, a randomized study is necessary and timely.Investigators from the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group and the Radiation Therapy and Oncology Group have collaborated to develop a phase III randomized study comparing stereotactic body radiotherapy and sublobar resection (with or without brachytherapy) for high-risk operable patients with non-small cell lung cancer.This study (American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z4099/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 1021) has recently opened for accrual.It is hoped that this will help to better define the role of these therapies for patients with non-small cell lung cancer.",0,0,0,0
22798186,"A dual-institution randomized controlled trial of remnant closure after distal pancreatectomy: does the addition of a falciform patch and fibrin glue improve outcomes?OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to assess the efficacy of two pancreatic remnant closure techniques following distal pancreatectomy: (1) stapled or sutured closure versus (2) stapled or sutured closure plus falciform patch and fibrin glue reinforcement in the setting of a prospective randomized trial, with the primary endpoint being pancreatic fistula.Pancreatic stump leak following left-sided pancreatic resection (distal pancreatectomy) remains common.Despite multiple and varied techniques for closure, the reported leak rate varies up to 30 %.A retrospective analysis by Iannitti et al. (J Am Coll Surg 203(6):857-864, 2006) detected a decreased leak rate in patients receiving a traditional closure buttressed with an autologous falciform ligament patch and fibrin glue.METHODS: Between April 2008 and October 2011, all willing patients scheduled to undergo distal pancreatectomy at the authors' institutions were consented and enrolled at the preoperative office visit.Patients were intraoperatively stratified as having hard or soft glands and randomized to one of two groups: (1) closure utilizing stapling or suturing (SS) versus (2) stapled or sutured plus falciform ligament patch and fibrin glue (FF).The trial design and power analysis (alpha = 0.05, beta = 0.2, power 80 %, chi-square test) hypothesized that the FF intervention would reduce the primary endpoint (pancreatic fistula) from 30 % to 15 % and targeted an accrual goal of 190 patients.Secondary endpoints included length of postoperative hospital stay, 30-day mortality, hospital readmission, and ISGPF fistula grade (A, B, and C).RESULTS: The trial accrued 109 patients, 55 in the SS group and 54 in the FF group.Enrollment was closed prior to the target accrual, following an interim analysis and futility calculation.Due to insufficient enrollment, patients stratified as having a hard gland were excluded (n = 8) from analysis, leaving 101 patients in the soft stratum.The overall pancreatic leak rate was 19.8 % (20 patients) for patients with soft glands.Patients randomized to the FF group had a leak rate of 20 %, as compared with 19.6 % in the SS group (p = 1.000).Fistula grades in both groups were identical: 1A, 8B, and 1C in the FF group as compared to 1A, 8B, and 1C in the SS group.Complication rates were comparable between the two groups.The median length of postoperative hospital stay was 5 days in both groups.There was a trend towards a higher 30-day readmission rate in the FF group (28 % vs. 17.6 %, p = 0.243).CONCLUSION: The addition of a falciform ligament patch and fibrin glue to standard stapled or sutured remnant closure did not reduce the rate or severity of pancreatic fistula in patients undergoing distal pancreatectomy (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00889213).",0,0,0,0

22840231,"Influence of perioperative oxygen fraction on pulmonary function after abdominal surgery: a randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: A high perioperative inspiratory oxygen fraction (FiO2) may reduce the frequency of surgical site infection.Perioperative atelectasis is caused by absorption, compression and reduced function of surfactant.It is well accepted, that ventilation with 100% oxygen for only a few minutes is associated with significant formation of atelectasis.However, it is still not clear if a longer period of 80% oxygen results in more atelectasis compared to a low FiO2.Our aim was to assess if a high FiO2 is associated with impaired oxygenation and decreased pulmonary functional residual capacity (FRC).METHODS: Thirty-five patients scheduled for laparotomy for ovarian cancer were randomized to receive either 30% oxygen (n = 15) or 80% oxygen (n = 20) during and for 2 h after surgery.The oxygenation index (PaO2/FiO2) was measured every 30 min during anesthesia and 90 min after extubation.FRC was measured the day before surgery and 2 h after extubation by a rebreathing method using the inert gas SF6.RESULTS: Five min after intubation, the median PaO2/FiO2 was 69 kPa [53-71] in the 30%-group vs. 60 kPa [47-69] in the 80%-group (P = 0.25).At the end of anesthesia, the PaO2/FiO2 was 58 kPa [40-70] vs. 57 kPa [46-67] in the 30%- and 80%-group, respectively (P = 0.10).The median FRC was 1993 mL [1610-2240] vs. 1875 mL [1545-2048] at baseline and 1615 mL [1375-2318] vs. 1633 mL [1343-1948] postoperatively in the 30%- and 80%-group, respectively (P = 0.70).CONCLUSION: We found no significant difference in oxygenation index or functional residual capacity between patients given 80% and 30% oxygen for a period of approximately 5 hours.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00637936.",0,0,0,0

22892060,"Hormone replacement therapy after breast cancer: 10 year follow up of the Stockholm randomised trial.BACKGROUND: The management of hormonal deficiency symptoms in breast cancer survivors is an unsolved problem.While hormone replacement therapy (HRT) may increase the risk of breast cancer in healthy women, its effects on recurrence is unclear.Observational studies have suggested decreased recurrence rates from HRT.The few clinical trials in this field have all been closed preterm.METHODS: The Stockholm trial was started in 1997 and designed to minimise the dose of progestogen in the HRT arm.Disease-free women with a history of breast cancer were randomised to HRT (n=188) or no HRT (n=190).The trial was stopped in 2003 when another Swedish study (HABITS, the Hormonal Replacement After Breast Cancer - Is it Safe?) reported increased recurrence.However the Stockholm material showed no excess risk after 4 years of follow-up.A long term follow-up has now been performed.FINDINGS: After 10.8 years of follow-up, there was no difference in new breast cancer events: 60 in the HRT group versus 48 among controls (hazard ratio (HR)=1.3; 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.9-1.9).Among women on HRT, 11 had local recurrence and 12 distant metastases versus 15 and 12 for the controls.There were 14 contra-lateral breast cancers in the HRT group and four in the control group (HR=3.6; 95% CI=1.2-10.9; p=0.013).No differences in mortality or new primary malignancies were found.INTERPRETATION: The number of new events did not differ significantly between groups, in contrast to previous reports.The increased recurrence in HABITS has been attributed to higher progestogen exposure.As both trials were prematurely closed, data do not allow firm conclusions.Both studies found no increased mortality from breast cancer or other causes from HRT.Current guidelines typically consider HRT contraindicated in breast cancer survivors.Findings suggest that, in some women symptom relief may outweigh the potential risks of HRT.",0,0,0,0
22897908,"Peripheral blood mammaglobin gene expression for diagnosis and prediction of metastasis in breast cancer patients.AIM: To evaluate the value of peripheral blood mammaglobin (MG) gene expression for diagnosis and prediction of metastasis in breast cancer patients.METHODS: MG expression was detected by nested reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction in the peripheral blood of 46 females (32 breast cancer, 12 benign breast lesions, 2 no breast abnormalities).In total 28 breast cancer patients were followed up through a period of 34 months for the development of metastasis.RESULTS: MG expression was detected in 16/32 (50%) breast cancer patients but not in patients with benign lesions or healthy participants.Five patients had metastasis at diagnosis.During the 34 months of follow up, five more MG-positive patients showed metastatic lesions and none of the MG negative patients who were followed up developed metastasis.CONCLUSION: The study suggests blood MG expression is a specific molecular marker for detection of occult mammary carcinoma cells of patients with operable breast cancer.It might be of value as a predictor of subsequent metastasis.Large-scale studies and longer follow-up periods are needed.",0,0,0,0

22918392,"Face-to-face vs telephone pre-colonoscopy consultation in colorectal cancer screening; a randomised trial.BACKGROUND: A pre-colonoscopy consultation in colorectal cancer (CRC) screening is necessary to assess a screenee's general health status and to explain benefits and risks of screening.The first option allows for personal attention, whereas a telephone consultation does not require travelling.We hypothesised that a telephone consultation would lead to higher response and participation in CRC screening compared with a face-to-face consultation.METHODS: A total of 6600 persons (50-75 years) were 1:1 randomised for primary colonoscopy screening with a pre-colonoscopy consultation either face-to-face or by telephone.In both arms, we counted the number of invitees who attended a pre-colonoscopy consultation (response) and the number of those who subsequently attended colonoscopy (participation), relative to the number invited for screening.A questionnaire regarding satisfaction with the consultation and expected burden of the colonoscopy (scored on five-point rating scales) was sent to invitees.Besides, a questionnaire to assess the perceived burden of colonoscopy was sent to participants, 14 days after the procedure.RESULTS: In all, 3302 invitees were allocated to the telephone group and 3298 to the face-to-face group, of which 794 (24%) attended a telephone consultation and 822 (25%) a face-to-face consultation (P=0.41).Subsequently, 674 (20%) participants in the telephone group and 752 (23%) in the face-to-face group attended colonoscopy (P=0.018).Invitees and responders in the telephone group expected the bowel preparation to be more painful than those in the face-to-face group while perceived burden scores for the full screening procedure were comparable.More subjects in the face-to-face group than in the telephone group were satisfied by the consultation in general: (99.8% vs 98.5%, P=0.014).CONCLUSION: Using a telephone rather than a face-to-face consultation in a population-based CRC colonoscopy screening programme leads to similar response rates but significantly lower colonoscopy participation.",0,0,0,0
22918524,"Advanced cognitive training for breast cancer survivors: a randomized controlled trial.The purpose of this study was to evaluate the preliminary efficacy and satisfaction/acceptability of training in memory or speed of processing versus wait-list control for improving cognitive function in breast cancer survivors.82 breast cancer survivors completed a three-group randomized, controlled trial.Primary outcomes were objective neuropsychological tests of memory and speed of processing.Secondary outcomes were perceived cognitive functioning, symptom distress (mood disturbance, anxiety, and fatigue), quality of life, and intervention satisfaction/acceptability.Data were collected at baseline, post-intervention, and 2-month follow-up.Using repeated-measures mixed-linear ANCOVA models, each intervention was compared to wait-list control while adjusting for age, education, and baseline measures.The effect sizes for differences in means and the reliable improvement percentage were reported.The results show that domain-specific effects were seen for both interventions: memory training improved memory performance at 2-month follow-up (p = 0.036, d = 0.59); speed of processing training improved processing speed post-intervention (p = 0.040, d = 0.55) and 2-month follow-up (p = 0.016; d = 0.67).Transfer effects to non-trained domains were seen for speed of processing training with improved memory post-intervention (p = 0.007, d = 0.75) and 2-month follow-up (p = 0.004, d = 0.82).Both interventions were associated with improvements in perceived cognitive functioning, symptom distress, and quality of life.Ratings of satisfaction/acceptability were high for both interventions.It was concluded that while both interventions appeared promising, speed of processing training resulted in immediate and durable improvements in objective measures of processing speed and verbal memory.Speed of processing training may have broader benefits in this clinical population.",0,0,0,0

22978687,"In thyroidectomized patients with thyroid cancer, a serum thyrotropin of 30 muU/mL after thyroxine withdrawal is not always adequate for detecting an elevated stimulated serum thyroglobulin.BACKGROUND: The thyrotropin (TSH) level or duration of thyroid hormone withdrawal (THW) required to detect stimulated thyroglobulin (Tg) in differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) monitoring is unknown.The objective of this study was to evaluate the TSH cutoff of >30 muU/mL as a means to detect stimulated Tg >/=2 ng/mL after THW (THW-Tg>/=2), and sensitivity of the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) questionnaire for detecting hypothyroid symptoms.METHODS: This was a prospective longitudinal cohort study done at a tertiary academic medical center.Forty-seven patients with DTC undergoing their first Tg stimulation or after previously abnormal Tg stimulation had weekly measurements of TSH and Tg during the 4 weeks THW, and repeated questionnaire assessments.RESULTS: TSH did not reach a plateau in any patient, and in those whose Tg did not remain undetectable, Tg continued to rise.Seventy-five percent of patients had an undetectable Tg <0.2 ng/mL at baseline (95% were <0.5 mg/mL) with 16% remaining undetectable throughout THW.The majority of patients (72.7% and 97.8%) achieved TSH >30 muU/mL by 3 and 4 weeks THW, respectively.Of the 15 patients with maximum stimulated THW-Tg>/=2, 38% were detected before the minimal TSH >30 muU/mL cutoff.At 2 weeks THW, 3 had a TSH>30 muU/mL, and none of them had Tg >/=2 ng/mL. At 3 weeks THW, 11 had a TSH >30 muU/mL, and 64% of them had Tg >/=2 ng/mL. Only 60% were detected at 3-week THW regardless of their TSH level.Eighty-six percent were detected by TSH 60-<80 muU/mL. Conversely, all patients whose serum Tg was <0.2 ng/mL when their serum TSH was >20 muU/mL did not achieve a THW-Tg>/=2.CONCLUSION: The minimal TSH cutoff of >30 muU/mL was inadequate to detect many patients with final stimulated THW-Tg>/=2 during complete THW.TSH >80-100 muU/mL was a better cutoff, achieved in only 53% after 4-week THW.Conversely, we propose a preliminary THW-stopping rule for ending THW early in selected patients.In patients with a Tg <0.2 ng/mL when TSH >20 muU/mL, all had a final stimulated Tg </=2 ng/mL, potentially saving qualifying patients 40% of THW duration compared to 4-week THW.FACIT-F correlated with TSH, but was not sensitive to detect mild hypothyroidism.",0,0,0,0

23008288,"Association between circulating tumor cells and prognosis in patients with stage III melanoma with sentinel lymph node metastasis in a phase III international multicenter trial.PURPOSE: The outcomes of patients with melanoma who have sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastases can be highly variable, which has precluded establishment of consensus regarding treatment of the group.The detection of high-risk patients from this clinical setting may be helpful for determination of both prognosis and management.We report the utility of multimarker reverse-transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) detection of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in patients with melanoma diagnosed with SLN metastases in a phase III, international, multicenter clinical trial.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Blood specimens were collected from patients with melanoma (n = 331) who were clinically disease-free after complete lymphadenectomy (CLND) before entering onto a randomized adjuvant melanoma vaccine plus bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) versus BCG placebo trial from 30 melanoma centers (United States and international).Blood was assessed using a verified multimarker RT-qPCR assay (MART-1, MAGE-A3, and GalNAc-T) of melanoma-associated proteins.Cox regression analyses were used to evaluate the prognostic significance of CTC status for disease recurrence and melanoma-specific survival (MSS).RESULTS: Individual CTC biomarker detection ranged from 13.4% to 17.5%.There was no association of CTC status (zero to one positive biomarkers v two or more positive biomarkers) with known clinical or pathologic prognostic variables.However, two or more positive biomarkers was significantly associated with worse distant metastasis disease-free survival (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.13, P = .009) and reduced recurrence-free survival (HR = 1.70, P = .046) and MSS (HR = 1.88, P = .043) in a multivariable analysis.CONCLUSION: CTC biomarker status is a prognostic factor for recurrence-free survival, distant metastasis disease-free survival, and MSS after CLND in patients with SLN metastasis.This multimarker RT-qPCR analysis may therefore be useful in discriminating patients who may benefit from aggressive adjuvant therapy or stratifying patients for adjuvant clinical trials.",0,0,0,0

23045542,"Patient navigation for breast and colorectal cancer treatment: a randomized trial.BACKGROUND: There is limited high-quality evidence about the impact of patient navigation (PN) on outcomes for patients with diagnosed cancer.METHODS: We pooled data from two sites from the national Patient Navigation Research Program.Patients (n = 438) with newly diagnosed breast (n = 353) or colorectal cancer (n = 85) were randomized to PN or usual care.Trained lay navigators met with patients randomized to PN to help them assess treatment barriers and identify resources to overcome barriers.We used intent-to-treat analysis to assess time to completion of primary treatment, psychologic distress (impact of events scale), and satisfaction (patient satisfaction with cancer-related care) within 3 months after initiation of cancer treatment.RESULTS: The sample was predominantly middle-aged (mean age = 57) and female (90%); 44% were race-ethnic minorities (44%), 46% reported lower education levels, 18% were uninsured, and 9% reported a non-English primary language.The randomized groups were comparable in baseline characteristics.Primary analysis showed no statistically significant group differences in time to completion of primary cancer treatment, satisfaction with cancer-related care, or psychologic distress.Subgroup analysis showed that socially disadvantaged patients (i.e., uninsured, low English proficiency, and non-English primary language) who received PN reported higher satisfaction than those receiving usual care (all P < 0.05).Navigated patients living alone reported greater distress than those receiving usual care.CONCLUSIONS: Although the primary analysis showed no overall benefit, the subgroup analysis suggests that PN may improve satisfaction with care for certain disadvantaged individuals.IMPACT: PN for cancer patients may not necessarily reduce treatment time nor distress.",0,0,0,0
23053638,"A randomized phase II trial of platinum salts in basal-like breast cancer patients in the neoadjuvant setting. Results from the GEICAM/2006-03, multicenter study.Chemotherapy remains as the only systemic treatment option available for basal-like breast cancer (BC) patients.Preclinical models and several phase II studies suggested that platinum salts are active drugs in this BC subtype though there is no randomized study supporting this hypothesis.This study investigates if the addition of carboplatin to a combination of an alkylating agent together with anthracyclines and taxanes is able to increase the efficacy in the neoadjuvant treatment context.Patients with operable breast cancer and immunophenotypically defined basal-like disease (ER-/PR-/HER2- and cytokeratin 5/6+ or EGFR+) were recruited.Patients were randomized to receive EC (epirubicin 90 mg/m(2) plus cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2) for 4 cycles) followed either by D (docetaxel 100 mg/m(2) x 4 cycles; EC-D) or DCb (docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) plus carboplatin AUC 6 x 4 cycles; EC-DCb).The primary end point was pathological complete response (pCR) in the breast following the Miller and Payne criteria.Ninety-four patients were randomized (46 EC-D, 48 EC-DCb).pCR rate in the breast was seen in 16 patients (35 %) with EC-D and 14 patients (30 %) with EC-DCb (P value = 0.61).pCR in the breast and axilla was seen in 30 % of patients in both arms.The overall clinical response rate was 70 % (95 % CI 56-83) in the EC-D arm and 77 % (95 % CI 65-87) in the EC-DCb arm.Grade 3/4 toxicity was similar in both arms.The addition of carboplatin to conventional chemotherapy with EC-D in basal-like breast cancer patients did not improve the efficacy probably because they had already received an alkylating agent.These findings should be taken into consideration when developing new agents for this disease.",1,1,1,0

23117476,"Frequent alterations of MCPH1 and ATM are associated with primary breast carcinoma: clinical and prognostic implications.BACKGROUND: MCPH1 is a proximal regulator of DNA damage response pathway that is involved in recruitment of phosphorylated ATM to double-stranded DNA breaks.METHODS: To understand the importance of MCPH1 and ATM in deregulation of DNA damage response pathway in breast carcinoma, we studied m-RNA expression and genetic/epigenetic alterations of these genes in primary breast carcinoma samples.RESULTS: Our study revealed reduced expression (mRNA/protein) and high alterations (deletion/methylation) (96 %, 121 of 126) of MCPH1 and ATM.Mutation was, however, rare in inactivation of MCPH1.In immunohistochemical analysis, reduced protein expression of MCPH1, ATM and p-ATM were concordant with their molecular alterations (P = 0.03-0.01).Alterations of MCPH1 and deletion of ATM were significantly high in estrogen/progesterone receptor-negative than estrogen/progesterone receptor-positive breast carcinoma samples compared to early or late age of onset tumors, indicating differences in pathogenesis of the molecular subtypes (P = 0.004-0.01).These genes also showed differential association with tumor stage, grade and lymph node status in different subtypes of breast carcinoma (P = 0.00001-0.01).Their coalterations showed significant association with tumor progression and prognosis (P = 0.003-0.05).Interestingly, patients with alterations of these genes or MCPH1 alone had poor outcome after treatment with DNA-interacting drugs and/or radiation (P = 0.01-0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Inactivation of MCPH1-ATM-associated DNA damage response pathway might have an important role in the development of breast carcinoma with diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic implications.",0,0,0,0
23127215,"Associations of soluble fiber, whole fruits/vegetables, and juice with plasma Beta-carotene concentrations in a free-living population of breast cancer survivors.OBJECTIVE: Soluble fiber and the physical state of fruits/vegetables affect plasma ss-carotene concentrations; however, most of this research was conducted in laboratory-based settings.These analyses investigated the relationship between soluble fiber and juiced versus whole fruits/vegetables to plasma ss-carotene concentrations in a free-living population.METHOD: This cross-sectional analysis used 12-month follow-up data from the Women's Healthy Eating & Living Study (1995-2006), a study to improve diet in breast cancer survivors in the Western United States.The dietary nutrients considered in this analysis included intake of soluble fiber (g), ss-carotene from fruit/vegetable juice (mg), and ss-carotene from whole fruits/vegetables (mg).A linear regression model was used to assess the relationship of the variables to plasma ss-carotene concentrations.RESULTS: Out of 3,088 women enrolled in the Women's Healthy Eating & Living Study, 2,397 women had complete data (mean age = 54).The final model accounted for approximately 49% of the explained variance in plasma ss-carotene concentrations.Fruit/vegetable juice had the largest positive relation to plasma ss-carotene concentrations (standardized parameter estimate = 0.23, p < 0.01), followed by whole fruits/vegetables (standardized parameter estimate = 0.09, p < 0.01).CONCLUSION: Soluble fiber may inhibit ss-carotene absorption; therefore, consumption of juice may increase plasma ss-carotene concentrations more than whole fruits/vegetables in free-living populations.",0,0,0,0
23129742,"Randomized phase III trial of induction chemotherapy with docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil followed by surgery versus up-front surgery in locally advanced resectable oral squamous cell carcinoma.PURPOSE: To evaluate induction chemotherapy with docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil (TPF) followed by surgery and postoperative radiotherapy versus up-front surgery and postoperative radiotherapy in patients with locally advanced resectable oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective open-label phase III trial was conducted.Eligibility criteria included untreated stage III or IVA locally advanced resectable OSCC.Patients received two cycles of TPF induction chemotherapy (docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) on day 1, cisplatin 75 mg/m(2) on day 1, and fluorouracil 750 mg/m(2) on days 1 to 5) followed by radical surgery and postoperative radiotherapy (54 to 66 Gy) versus up-front radical surgery and postoperative radiotherapy.The primary end point was overall survival (OS).Secondary end points included local control and safety.RESULTS: Of the 256 patients enrolled onto this trial, 222 completed the full treatment protocol.There were no unexpected toxicities, and induction chemotherapy did not increase perioperative morbidity.The clinical response rate to induction chemotherapy was 80.6%.After a median follow-up of 30 months, there was no significant difference in OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.977; 95% CI, 0.634 to 1.507; P = .918) or disease-free survival (HR, 0.974; 95% CI, 0.654 to 1.45; P = .897) between patients treated with and without TPF induction.Patients in the induction chemotherapy arm with a clinical response or favorable pathologic response (</= 10% viable tumor cells) had superior OS and locoregional and distant control.CONCLUSION: Our study failed to demonstrate that TPF induction chemotherapy improves survival compared with up-front surgery in patients with resectable stage III or IVA OSCC.",0,0,0,0
23136318,"Association of speculum lubrication with pain and Papanicolaou test accuracy.PURPOSE: To determine the effects of lubrication of the vaginal speculum before insertion during a Papanicolaou test on perceived pain and quality of the cytology specimen.METHODS: Four hundred eligible women participating in cervical cancer screening and an early detection program were randomized with respect to lubricant gel use before speculum insertion.Perceived pain during speculum insertion and cytology results were assessed in study groups.RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 45.7 years (range, 23-77 years).Pain score of the NO GEL group was significantly higher than that of the GEL group (2.3 and 1.6, respectively; P < .05).For premenopausal women, lubricant gel use significantly reduced the pain scores of the participants (P < .05).Cytological interpretations of the Papanicolaou test specimens were comparable among all groups.CONCLUSIONS: During the collection of Papanicolaou test specimens, lubrication of the vaginal speculum with a small amount of K-Y Jelly (a water-soluble lubricant gel) decreases the pain associated with insertion of the vaginal speculum among postmenopausal women without obscuring the cytological interpretation of conventional or liquid-based cytology.In women of reproductive age, lubrication of the speculum with K-Y Jelly does not cause a meaningful effect with respect to perceived pain.",0,0,0,0
23143762,"Ewing sarcoma of the hand or foot.PURPOSE: Ewing Sarcoma (ES) of the hand or foot is a rare clinical condition.Due to the critical site, it is of major importance to choose an optimal procedure for local control in terms of outcome and function.Local therapeutic options for these patients range from: surgery (OP), surgery followed by radiotherapy (OP & RT), or radiotherapy (RT) alone.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from 80 patients with ES of the hand or foot were analyzed.All patients received chemotherapy according to the protocols of the Cooperative Ewing Sarcoma Study Group (CESS) from 1991 to 2009 (EICESS-92 and EURO-E.W.I.N.G.99).Local therapy consisted of: OP in 39%, OP & RT in 44%, and RT in 12%.In 5% of the patients no local therapy (noL) was performed.Primary endpoint of our study was the event-free-survival (EFS).RESULTS: The 3-year overall EFS was 62% (95%CI 0.50-0.72).Patients with localized disease had a significantly better outcome with an EFS of 77% (95%CI 0.63-0.86), compared to patients with primary disseminated disease with an EFS of 30% (95%CI 0.14-0.49; p<0.001).In comparing local treatment modalities, no significant difference was observed.The 3-year EFS for OP was 61% (95% CI 0.40-0.76), for OP & RT 66% (95%CI 0.47-0.79) and for RT only 70% (95%CI 0.32-0.89) (p=0.253).Patients who did not receive local treatment had an unfavourable prognosis (3-year EFS=0.25; 95%CI 0.01-0.67; p=0.024).A multivariate analysis which included local treatment modality and known prognosticators, showed that primary dissemination was the only significant prognostic factor.Ewing sarcoma of the hand or foot is associated with a favourable outcome.CONCLUSION: Our data analysed a limited group of patients and thus did not provide a clear indication for a preferred local treatment modality.",0,0,0,0
23146280,"The prognostic and predictive value of mRNA expression of vascular endothelial growth factor family members in breast cancer: a study in primary tumors of high-risk early breast cancer patients participating in a randomized Hellenic Cooperative Oncology Group trial.INTRODUCTION: The main prognostic variables in early breast cancer are tumor size, histological grade, estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor (ER/PgR) status, number of positive nodes and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status.The present study evaluated the prognostic and/or predictive value of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family members in high-risk early breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant chemo-hormonotherapy.METHODS: RNA was isolated from 308 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded primary tumor samples from breast cancer patients enrolled in the HE10/97 trial, evaluating adjuvant dose-dense sequential chemotherapy with epirubicin followed by cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil (CMF) with or without paclitaxel (E-T-CMF versus E-CMF).A fully automated method based on magnetic beads was applied for RNA extraction, followed by one-step quantitative RT-PCR for mRNA analysis of VEGF-A, -B, -C and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) 1, 2, 3.RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 8 years, 109 patients (35%) developed a relapse and 80 patients (26%) died.In high VEGF-C and VEGFR1 mRNA expressing tumors, ER/PgR-negative tumors (Fisher's exact test, P = 0.001 and P = 0.021, respectively) and HER2-positive tumors (P <0.001 and P = 0.028, respectively) were more frequent than in low VEGF-C and VEGFR1 expressing tumors, respectively.From the VEGF family members evaluated, high VEGFR1 mRNA expression (above the 75th percentile) emerged as a significant negative prognostic factor for overall survival (OS; hazard ratio (HR) = 1.60, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01 to 2.55, Wald's P = 0.047) and disease-free survival (DFS; HR = 1.67, 95% CI: 1.13 to 2.48, P = 0.010), when adjusting for treatment group.High VEGF-C mRNA expression was predictive for benefit from adjuvant treatment with paclitaxel (E-T-CMF arm) for OS (test for interaction, Wald's P = 0.038), while in multivariate analysis the interaction of VEGF-C with taxane treatment was significant for both OS (Wald's P = 0.019) and DFS (P = 0.041) and continuous VEGF-B mRNA expression values for OS (P = 0.019).CONCLUSIONS: The present study reports, for the first time, that VEGF-C mRNA overexpression, as assessed by qRT-PCR, has a strong predictive value in high-risk early breast cancer patients undergoing adjuvant paclitaxel-containing treatment.Further studies are warranted to validate the prognostic and/or predictive value of VEGF-B, VEGF-C and VEGFR1 in patients treated with adjuvant therapies and to reveal which members of the VEGF family could possibly be useful markers in identifying patients who will benefit most from anti-VEGF strategies.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR) ACTRN12611000506998.",0,0,0,0
23158059,"Chromosome damage and cell proliferation rates in in vitro irradiated whole blood as markers of late radiation toxicity after radiation therapy to the prostate.PURPOSE: In vitro irradiated blood samples from prostate cancer patients showing late normal tissue damage were examined for lymphocyte response by measuring chromosomal aberrations and proliferation rate.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients were selected from a randomized trial evaluating the optimal timing of dose-escalated radiation and short-course androgen deprivation therapy.Of 438 patients, 3% experienced grade 3 late radiation proctitis and were considered to be radiosensitive.Blood samples were taken from 10 of these patients along with 20 matched samples from patients with grade 0 proctitis.The samples were irradiated at 6 Gy and, along with control samples, were analyzed for dicentric chromosomes and excess fragments per cell.Cells in first and second metaphase were also enumerated to determine the lymphocyte proliferation rate.RESULTS: At 6 Gy, there were statistically significant differences between the radiosensitive and control cohorts for 3 endpoints: the mean number of dicentric chromosomes per cell (3.26 +/- 0.31, 2.91 +/- 0.32; P=.0258), the mean number of excess fragments per cell (2.27 +/- 0.23, 1.43 +/- 0.37; P<.0001), and the proportion of cells in second metaphase (0.27 +/- 0.10, 0.46 +/- 0.09; P=.0007).CONCLUSIONS: These results may be a valuable indicator for identifying radiosensitive patients and for tailoring radiation therapy.",0,0,0,0

23233657,"High cereblon expression is associated with better survival in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma treated with thalidomide maintenance.Recently, cereblon (CRBN) expression was found to be essential for the activity of thalidomide and lenalidomide.In the present study, we investigated whether the clinical efficacy of thalidomide in multiple myeloma is associated with CRBN expression in myeloma cells.Patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma were included in the HOVON-65/GMMG-HD4 trial, in which postintensification treatment in 1 arm consisted of daily thalidomide (50 mg) for 2 years.Gene-expression profiling, determined at the start of the trial, was available for 96 patients who started thalidomide maintenance.In this patient set, increase of CRBN gene expression was significantly associated with longerprogression-free survival (P = .005).In contrast, no association between CRBN expression and survival was observed in the arm with bortezomib maintenance.We conclude that CRBN expression may be associated with the clinical efficacy of thalidomide.This trial has been registered at the Nederlands Trial Register (www.trialregister.nl) as NTR213; at the European Union Drug Regulating Authorities Clinical Trials (EudraCT) as 2004-000944-26; and at the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) as 64455289.",0,0,0,0
23234763,"Adjuvant lapatinib for women with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer: a randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Worldwide, many patients with HER2-positive early stage breast cancer do not receive trastuzumab-the standard adjuvant treatment.We investigated the efficacy and safety of adjuvant lapatinib for patients with trastuzumab-naive HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer, started at any time after diagnosis.METHODS: This study was a placebo-controlled, multicentre, randomised phase 3 trial.Women outpatients from 405 [corrected] centres in 33 countries [corrected] with HER2-positive early-breast cancer who had previously received adjuvant chemotherapy but not trastuzumab were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive daily lapatinib (1500 mg) or daily placebo for 12 months.Randomisation was done with a computer-generated sequence, stratified by time since diagnosis, lymph node involvement at diagnosis, and tumour hormone-receptor status.Investigators, site staff, and patients were masked to treatment assignment.The primary endpoint was disease-free survival in the intention-to-treat population.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00374322.FINDINGS: Between August, 2006, and May, 2008, 3161 women were enrolled and 3147 were assigned to lapatinib (n=1571) or placebo (n=1576).After a median follow-up of 47.4 months (range 0.4-60.0) in the lapatinib group and 48.3 (0.7-61.3) in the placebo group, 210 (13%) disease-free survival events had occurred in the lapatinib group versus 264 (17%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.83, 95% CI 0.70-1.00; p=0.053).Central review of HER2 status showed that only 2490 (79%) of the randomised women were HER2-positive.157 (13%) of 1230 confirmed HER2-positive patients in the lapatinib group and in 208 (17%) of 1260 in the placebo group had a disease-free survival event (HR 0.82, 95% 0.67-1.00; p=0.04).Serious adverse events occurred in 99 (6%) of 1573 patients taking lapatinib and 77 (5%) of 1574 patients taking placebo, with higher incidences of grade 3-4 diarrhoea (97 [6%] vs nine [<1%]), rash (72 [5%] vs three [<1%]), and hepatobiliary disorders (36 [2%] vs one [<1%]).INTERPRETATION: Our data show that there was no significant difference in disease-free survival between groups when analysed in the intention-to-treat population.However, exploratory analyses restricted to patients who had HER2-positive disease confirmed by central fluorescence in-situ hybridisation review suggested marginal benefit with lapatinib in terms of disease-free survival.Thus lapatinib might be an option for women with HER2-positive breast cancer who do not or cannot receive adjuvant trastuzumab.FUNDING: GlaxoSmithKline.",1,1,1,1
23252601,"Acceptability and adherence in a chemoprevention trial among women at increased risk for breast cancer attending the Modena Familial Breast and Ovarian Cancer Center (Italy).Chemoprevention for women at risk for breast cancer has been shown to be effective, but in actual practice, women's uptake of chemoprevention has been poor.We explored factors that influence acceptability, adherence, and dropout in the International Breast (Prevention) Intervention Study during our first 3 years of activity at the Modena Familial Breast and Ovarian Cancer Center.We evaluated socio-demographic characteristics, health status, adherence, and side effect intensity.Semi-structured interviews analyzed reasons for accepting/refusing/stopping the trial.A total of 471 postmenopausal women were invited to participate, of which 319 declined to participate (68%), 137 accepted to participate (29%), and 15 participants did not make a final decision (3%).Breast cancer-related worries and trust in our preventive and surveillance programs were the most frequent reasons for accepting.Side effect-related worry was the most frequent reason for refusing.General practitioners' and family members' opinions played an important role in the decision-making process.Adherence significantly decreased after a 12-month follow-up, but it remained unchanged after 24- and 36-month follow-ups.Mild/moderate side effects reported by women did not change after 12 months of treatment.Forty percent of women withdrew from the study due to complaints of side effects.We concluded that chemoprevention trials are difficult medical experiments and that the process of deciding about whether or not to participate is based mainly on beliefs and values.This study has important clinical implications.During counselling with prospective participants, it is important to emphasize the potential benefits and to promote an informed choice.How participants make decisions, their belief systems, and their perception of risk are all factors that should be investigated in future research.",0,0,0,0
23252716,"Thiopurine methyltransferase genotype-phenotype discordance and thiopurine active metabolite formation in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.AIMS: In children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) bone marrow activity can influence red blood cell (RBC) kinetics, the surrogate tissue for thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) measurements.The aim of this study was to investigate TPMT phenotype-genotype concordance in ALL, and the influence of TPMT on thiopurine metabolite formation.METHODS: We measured TPMT (activity, as units ml(-1) packed RBCs and genotype) at diagnosis (n = 1150) and TPMT and thioguanine nucleotide (TGN) and methylmercaptopurine nucleotide (MeMPN) metabolites (pmol/8 x 10(8) RBCs) during chemotherapy (n = 1131) in children randomized to thioguanine or mercaptopurine on the United Kingdom trial ALL97.RESULTS: Median TPMT activity at diagnosis (8.5 units) was significantly lower than during chemotherapy (13.8 units, median difference 5.1 units, 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.8, 5.4, P < 0.0001).At diagnosis genotype-phenotype was discordant.During chemotherapy the overall concordance was 92%, but this fell to 55% in the intermediate activity cohort (45% had wild-type genotypes).For both thiopurines TGN concentrations differed by TPMT status.For mercaptopurine, median TGNs were higher in TPMT heterozygous genotype (754 pmol) than wild-type (360 pmol) patients (median difference 406 pmol, 95% CI 332, 478, P < 0.0001), whilst median MeMPNs, products of the TPMT reaction, were higher in wild-type (10 650 pmol) than heterozygous patients (3868 pmol) (P < 0.0001).In TPMT intermediate activity patients with a wild-type genotype, TGN (median 366 pmol) and MeMPN (median 8590 pmol) concentrations were similar to those in wild-type, high activity patients.CONCLUSIONS: In childhood ALL, TPMT activity should not be used to predict heterozygosity particularly in blood samples obtained at disease diagnosis.Genotype is a better predictor of TGN accumulation during chemotherapy.",0,0,0,0
23261355,"Risk of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia during follow-up in HPV-positive women according to baseline p16-INK4A results: a prospective analysis of a nested substudy of the NTCC randomised controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Immunostaining for p16-INK4A (henceforth p16) is a sensitive and specific method for detection of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) in women infected with human papillomavirus (HPV), but longitudinal data have not been obtained.We investigated the relation between p16 status and risk of CIN during 3 years of follow-up.METHODS: Women aged 25-60 years were enrolled between June 10, 2003, and Dec 31, 2004, in a multicentre randomised trial comparing HPV testing with cytology.HPV-positive women were referred for colposcopy and, in seven of nine centres, were tested for p16 overexpression by immunostaining.If no CIN was detected, these women were followed up at yearly intervals until clearance of HPV infection.The primary endpoint was histologically confirmed CIN of grade 2 or worse (CIN of grade 2 [CIN2], CIN of grade 3 [CIN3], or invasive cervical cancer) at recruitment or during follow-up.We calculated the absolute and relative risks by p16 status at recruitment.We also calculated the longitudinal sensitivity of p16 testing.Additionally, we assessed the relative sensitivity of an alternative strategy (referral to colposcopy and follow-up of only HPV-positive, p16-positive women) versus conventional cytology in two age groups.Percentages were weighted by the inverse of the tested fraction.The trial in which this study is nested is registered, number ISRCTN81678807.FINDINGS: Of 1042 HPV-positive women who were tested for p16 with no CIN detected during the first round of screening, 944 (91%) had further HPV tests.793 (84%) of these 944 were followed up until detection of CIN2 or worse, HPV infection clearance, or for at least 3 years.CIN2 or worse was detected during follow-up in more p16-positive women (31 of 365, 8.8% [95% CI 5.8-11.8]) than in p16-negative women (17 of 579, 3.7% [1.9-5.4]; relative risk [RR] 2.61 [95% CI 1.49-4.59]).RR was higher in women aged 35-60 years at recruitment (3.37 [1.39-8.15]) than in those aged 25-34 years (2.15 [1.00-4.61]), but age was not a significant modifier.CIN3 or worse was detected during follow-up in more p16-positive women (16 of 365, 4.4% [2.3-6.6]) than in p16-negative women (six of 579, 1.3% [0.2-2.3]; RR 3.90 [95% CI 1.57-9.68]).Longitudinal sensitivity of p16 testing for detection of CIN3 or worse during follow-up at all ages was 77.8% (95% CI 63.9-91.6).The relative sensitivity of the alternative strategy compared with conventional cytology was 2.08 (1.13-3.56) in women aged 35-60 years and 2.86 (1.28-5.36) in those aged 25-34 years.HPV-positive, p16-negative women aged 35-60 years had a higher cumulative risk of CIN3 or worse during recruitment or follow-up (2.0%, 95% CI 0.3-3.7) than did HPV-negative women (0.01%, 0-0.04) or those who were cytologically normal (0.04%, 0.02-0.09) at recruitment.INTERPRETATION: p16 overexpression is a marker for CIN2 or worse or for development of CIN2 or worse within 3 years in HPV-positive women, especially those aged 35-60 years.HPV-positive, p16-positive women need immediate colposcopy and, if the assessment is negative, annual follow-up.Immediate colposcopy can be avoided in HPV-positive, p16-negative women, who can be safely managed with repeat screening after 2-3 year intervals.FUNDING: European Union; Italian Ministry of Health; Regional Health Administrations of Piemonte, Tuscany, Veneto and Emilia Romagna; and Public Health Agency of Lazio Region.",0,0,0,0

23335153,"Reducing the psychological distress of family caregivers of home-based palliative care patients: short-term effects from a randomised controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Palliative care is expected to incorporate comprehensive support for family caregivers given that many caregivers suffer psychological morbidity.However, systematically implemented evidence-based psychological support initiatives are lacking.AIM: The objective of this study was to prepare caregivers for the role of supporting a patient with advanced cancer receiving home-based palliative care by offering a one-to-one psycho-educational intervention.We hypothesised that primary family caregivers who participated in the intervention would report decreased psychological distress (primary outcome), fewer unmet needs and increased levels of perceived preparedness, competence and positive emotions.METHODS: A three-arm randomised controlled trial was conducted comparing two versions of the intervention (one face-to-face visit versus two visits) plus standard care to a control group (standard care) across four sites in Australia.RESULTS: A total of 298 participants were recruited; 148 were in the Control condition, 57 in Intervention 1 (one visit) and 93 in Intervention 2 (two visits).Relative to participants in the control group; the psychological well-being of participants in the intervention condition was improved by a small amount but non-significantly.No significant reduction in unmet needs or improvements in positive aspects of caregiving amongst the intervention group were identified.However, the intervention demonstrated significant improvements in participants' levels of preparedness and competence for Intervention 2.CONCLUSION/IMPLICATIONS: This research adds to accumulating body of evidence demonstrating that relatively short psycho-educational interventions can enable family caregivers to feel more prepared and competent in the role of supporting a dying relative.Further investigation is required to determine the longer term outcomes of such interventions.",0,0,0,0
23340351,"A double-blind randomized trial of wound and intercostal space infiltration with ropivacaine during breast cancer surgery: effects on chronic postoperative pain.BACKGROUND: The efficacy of local anesthetic wound infiltration for the treatment of acute and chronic postoperative pain is controversial and there are no detailed studies.The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of ropivacaine wound infiltration on chronic pain after breast surgery.METHODS: In this prospective, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study, 236 patients scheduled for breast cancer surgery were randomized (1:1) to receive ropivacaine or placebo infiltration of the wound, the second and third intercostal spaces and the humeral insertion of major pectoralis.Acute pain, analgesic consumption, nausea and vomiting were assessed every 30 min for 2 h in the postanesthesia care unit and every 6 h for 48 h. Chronic pain was evaluated 3 months, 6 months, and 1 yr after surgery by the brief pain inventory, hospital anxiety and depression, and neuropathic pain questionnaires.RESULTS: Ropivacaine wound infiltration significantly decreased immediate postoperative pain for the first 90 min, but did not decrease chronic pain at 3 months (primary endpoint), or at 6 and 12 months postoperatively.At 3 months, the incidence of chronic pain was 33% and 27% (P = 0.37) in the ropivacaine and placebo groups, respectively.During follow-up, brief pain inventory, neuropathic pain, and anxiety increased over time in both groups (P < 0.001) while depression remained stable.No complications occurred.CONCLUSION: This multicenter, prospective study shows that ropivacaine wound infiltration after breast cancer surgery decreased immediate postoperative pain but did not decrease chronic pain at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively.",0,0,0,0
23341531,"Randomized phase III multi-institutional study of TNFerade biologic with fluorouracil and radiotherapy for locally advanced pancreatic cancer: final results.PURPOSE: TNFerade biologic is a novel means of delivering tumor necrosis factor alpha to tumor cells by gene transfer.We herein report final results of the largest randomized phase III trial performed to date among patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) and the first to test gene transfer against this malignancy.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In all, 304 patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to standard of care plus TNFerade (SOC + TNFerade) versus standard of care alone (SOC).SOC consisted of 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions with concurrent fluorouracil (200 mg/m(2) per day continuous infusion).TNFerade was injected intratumorally before the first fraction of radiotherapy each week at a dose of 4 x 10(11) particle units by using either a percutaneous transabdominal or an endoscopic ultrasound approach.Four weeks after chemoradiotherapy, patients began gemcitabine (1,000 mg/m(2) intravenously) with or without erlotinib (100 to 150 mg per day orally) until progression or toxicity.RESULTS: The analysis included 187 patients randomly assigned to SOC + TNFerade and 90 to SOC by using a modified intention-to-treat approach.Median follow-up was 9.1 months (range, 0.1 to 50.5 months).Median survival was 10.0 months for patients in both the SOC + TNFerade and SOC arms (hazard ratio [HR], 0.90; 95% CI, 0.66 to 1.22; P = .26).Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 6.8 months for SOC + TNFerade versus 7.0 months for SOC (HR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.69 to 1.32; P = .51).Among patients treated on the SOC + TNFerade arm, multivariate analysis showed that TNFerade injection by an endoscopic ultrasound-guided transgastric/transduodenal approach rather than a percutaneous transabdominal approach was a risk factor for inferior PFS (HR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.06 to 4.06; P = .032).The patients in the SOC + TNFerade arm experienced more grade 1 to 2 fever and chills than those in the SOC arm (P < .001) but both arms had similar rates of grade 3 to 4 toxicities (all P > .05).CONCLUSION: SOC + TNFerade is safe but not effective for prolonging survival in patients with LAPC.",0,0,0,0
23348836,"Predictors of squamous cell carcinoma in high-risk patients in the VATTC trial.Invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the skin is one of the most common cancers in the United States, with no proven means for prevention other than systemic retinoids, which have significant toxicity, and sunscreen.We sought to determine the risk factors for invasive SCC on the face or ears in a high-risk population comprising 1,131 veterans in the Veterans Affairs Topical Tretinoin Chemoprevention (VATTC) Trial.Participants were required to have been diagnosed with at least two keratinocyte carcinomas (KCs) in the 5 years prior to enrollment.The median duration of follow-up was 3.7 years.Twenty-three percent of the participants developed a new invasive SCC, and the cumulative risk of invasive SCC was 30% at 5 years.The following factors independently predicted for new invasive SCCs: number of invasive SCCs and number of in situ SCCs in the 5 years prior to enrollment, actinic keratoses count at enrollment, a history of ever use of topical 5-fluorouracil, and total occupational time spent outdoors.In contrast, the use of angiotensin-convering enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers during the study and a history of warts anywhere on the body were found to protect against new invasive SCCs.These independent predictors remained the same for all SCCs (invasive and in situ combined).The number of basal cell carcinomas in the 5 years prior to enrollment, sunburns, sun sensitivity, and recreational sun exposure were not associated with new SCCs.These findings identify key risk factors for additional SCCs in patients with multiple prior KCs, and suggest that a history of warts may be associated with reduced SCC risk.",0,0,0,0

23442174,"Monitoring laparoscopic radiofrequency renal lesions in real time using contrast-enhanced ultrasonography: an open-label, randomized, comparative pilot trial.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has been considered as an important therapy for small renal lesions.The main limitation of RFA, however, is the lack of pathologic confirmation of complete tumor eradication.A single center, open label, randomized pilot study was designed to evaluate whether contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) with Sonovue, performed in real time could allow us to determine the end point during laparoscopic radiofrequency ablation (LRFA) and the clinical outcome of this method.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ninety-six patients undergoing LRFA were randomly assigned to CEUS or a control group; finally, 38 and 40 patients with a pathologic diagnosis of renal-cell carcinoma completed a 3-month follow-up.CEUS was conducted in real time during the procedure to determine the end point in the CEUS group.The primary outcome was the incomplete ablation rate according to a radiographic image at 3 months after the procedure.The secondary outcome included the local tumor control rate and disease-free survival rate.RESULTS: There were no differences in the incomplete ablation rate and disease-free survival rate between the two groups.Within a median 16-month follow-up period, three incomplete ablations and two local recurrences according to a radiographic image were found in the control group.Meanwhile, there was no incomplete ablation or recurrence but one lung metastasis in the CEUS group.The local tumor control rate was 87.5% (35/40) in the control group vs 100% (38/38) (P=0.073) in the CEUS group.CONCLUSION: In patients undergoing LRFA, there were no differences in the incomplete ablation rate and local tumor control rate between the CEUS group and the control group in our study despite a nonsignificant trend in favor of CEUS.CEUS may have the potential to provide more effective renal tumor ablation.These novel data support the need for a larger study of CEUS during LRFA surgery.",0,0,0,0
23449351,"Prognostic and predictive value of VEGF, sVEGFR-2 and CEA in mCRC studies comparing cediranib, bevacizumab and chemotherapy.BACKGROUND: The prognostic/predictive value of potential vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signalling biomarkers was evaluated retrospectively using samples from two randomized Phase III studies (HORIZON II and III) investigating cediranib in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).METHODS: Baseline levels of VEGF, soluble VEGF receptor-2 (sVEGFR-2) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) were measured in plasma/serum samples collected from patients participating in HORIZON II (n=860; FOLFOX/XELOX plus cediranib 20 mg (n=502) or placebo (n=358)) and HORIZON III (n=1422; mFOLFOX6 plus cediranib 20 mg (n=709) or bevacizumab (n=713)).Median biomarker baseline levels determined cutoff values for the patient subgroups.RESULTS: Baseline data were available for 88-97% of patients/study (>2000 patients).In both the studies, high baseline VEGF and CEA were associated with worse outcomes for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) independent of treatment (HORIZON II OS: VEGF, hazard ratio (HR)=1.35 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.12-1.63); CEA, HR=1.63 (1.36-1.96); HORIZON III OS: VEGF, HR=1.32 (1.12-1.54); CEA, HR=1.50 (1.29-1.76)).sVEGFR-2 was not prognostic for PFS/OS.Baseline VEGF and CEA were not predictive for PFS/OS outcome to cediranib treatment; low sVEGFR-2 was associated with a trend towards improved cediranib effect in HORIZON II.CONCLUSION: Baseline VEGF and CEA levels were treatment-independent prognostic biomarkers for PFS and OS in both the studies.",0,0,0,0

23467957,"Use of irradiate animal pericardium membrane for prevention of Frey's syndrome after parotidectomy.BACKGROUND: Frey syndrome is a common complication that appears few months after parotid surgery with flushing and sweating of the parotid-temporal area during mastication.It presumably originates from an aberrant nervous regeneration in which the parasympathetic fibers of the parotid gland would combine themselves with the sympathetic fibers of the sweat glands and with the cutaneous vessels.AIM: In the present study we analyze the effectiveness of a collagenous membrane derived from animal pericardium (APM) to prevent Frey's syndrome after parotidectomy.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied a total of 40 patients with benign tumors of the parotid gland, including 30 patients with pleomorphic adenoma, 7 patients with Warthin tumor and 3 with basal cells adenoma.The patients were divided into 2 groups: group 1 (experimental n=20) executed superficial parotidectomy with replacement of bovine pericardial matrix (BPM); group 2 (control n=20) underwent superficial parotidectomy followed by reposition of superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS) flap.All patients were questioned over their subjective symptom and tested with Minor's test after 12 months from the intervention and introduced in a follow-up of 3 years.RESULTS: Subjectively Frey syndrome was referred in 5% of patients in group 1 and in 10% in group 2, while 0 cases were observed in group 1 after the starch-iodine test, 2 cases in group 2 (10%).CONCLUSIONS: Considering the present results, although this study needs further implementation, we can affirm that BPM is a valid option in preventing Frey's syndrome whereas SMAS flap is not available.",0,0,0,0
23479454,"Prostate cancer mortality in the Finnish randomized screening trial.BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer (PC) screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) has been shown to decrease PC mortality by the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC).We evaluated mortality results in the Finnish Prostate Cancer Screening Trial, the largest component of ERSPC.The primary endpoint was PC-specific mortality.METHODS: A total of 80 144 men were identified from the population registry and randomized to either a screening arm (SA) or a control arm (CA).Men in the SA were invited to serum PSA determination up to three times with a 4-year interval between each scan and referred to biopsy if the PSA concentration was greater than or equal to 4.0 ng/mL or 3.0 to 3.99 ng/mL with a free/total PSA ratio less than or equal to 16%.Men in the CA received usual care.The analysis covers follow-up to 12 years from randomization for all men.Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated for incidence and mortality using Cox proportional hazard model.All statistical tests were two-sided.RESULTS: PC incidence was 8.8 per 1000 person-years in the SA and 6.6 in the CA (HR = 1.34, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.27 to 1.40).The incidence of advanced PC was lower in the SA vs CA arm (1.2 vs 1.6, respectively; HR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.64 to 0.82; P < .001).For PC mortality, no statistically significant difference was observed between the SA and CA (HR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.69 to 1.04) (with intention-to-screen analysis).To avoid one PC death, we needed to invite 1199 men to screening and to detect 25 PCs.We observed no difference in all-cause mortality between trial arms.CONCLUSIONS: At 12 years, a relatively conservative screening protocol produced a small, non-statistically significant PC-specific mortality reduction in the Finnish trial, at the cost of moderate overdiagnosis.",0,0,0,0

PgR and Ki67 expression were significantly reduced with all treatments (means were -34% to -45%, and -75% to -85%, respectively; all P = 0.0001), with no differences between groups.CONCLUSIONS: In this short-term study, all treatments reduced ER expression, although F and F + A showed greater reductions than A. No significant differences were detected between the treatment groups in terms of PgR and Ki67 expression.No additional reduction in tumor biomarkers with combination treatment was observed, suggesting that F + A is unlikely to have further clinical benefit over F alone.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00259090.",1,1,1,1
23498096,"Promoting colorectal cancer screening discussion: a randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Provider recommendation is a predictor of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening.PURPOSE: To compare the effects of two clinic-based interventions on patient-provider discussions about CRC screening.DESIGN: Two-group RCT with data collected at baseline and 1 week post-intervention.SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: African-American patients that were non-adherent to CRC screening recommendations (n=693) with a primary care visit between 2008 and 2010 in one of 11 urban primary care clinics.INTERVENTION: Participants received either a computer-delivered tailored CRC screening intervention or a nontailored informational brochure about CRC screening immediately prior to their primary care visit.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Between-group differences in odds of having had a CRC screening discussion about a colon test, with and without adjusting for demographic, clinic, health literacy, health belief, and social support variables, were examined as predictors of a CRC screening discussion using logistic regression.Intervention effects on CRC screening test order by PCPs were examined using logistic regression.Analyses were conducted in 2011 and 2012.RESULTS: Compared to the brochure group, greater proportions of those in the computer-delivered tailored intervention group reported having had a discussion with their provider about CRC screening (63% vs 48%, OR=1.81, p<0.001).Predictors of a discussion about CRC screening included computer group participation, younger age, reason for visit, being unmarried, colonoscopy self-efficacy, and family member/friend recommendation (all p-values <0.05).CONCLUSIONS: The computer-delivered tailored intervention was more effective than a nontailored brochure at stimulating patient-provider discussions about CRC screening.Those who received the computer-delivered intervention also were more likely to have a CRC screening test (fecal occult blood test or colonoscopy) ordered by their PCP.TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov NCT00672828.",0,0,0,0

The SI also met with a nurse/nutritionist to receive a treatment summary, surveillance, and lifestyle recommendations.Both groups completed questionnaires on the impact of cancer (IOC), patient satisfaction (FACIT-TS-PS), and assessment of survivor concerns (ASC) at baseline, 3 and 6 months.Within and between group t tests and linear regression analyses were performed.Among 126 women (60 CG, 66 SI), mean age was 54 years, 48 % were Hispanic, and the groups were well-balanced by baseline characteristics.No significant differences between the CG and SI on the FACIT-TS-PS or IOC at 3 and 6 months were seen.The ASC health worry subscale was lower (less worry) in the SI compared to CG (p = 0.02).At all time-points, Hispanic women had higher (worse) health worry (p = 0.0008), social-life interference (p = 0.009), and meaning of cancer scales (p = 0.0004), and more trust in medical professionals (p = 0.03) compared to non-Hispanic women.While the SI did not lead to significant improvements in most patient-reported outcomes, it was associated with decreased health worry.Future interventions should determine the most efficient and effective method for delivering survivorship care plans.",0,0,0,0
23547084,"Associations between cigarette smoking status and colon cancer prognosis among participants in North Central Cancer Treatment Group Phase III Trial N0147.PURPOSE: By using data from North Central Cancer Treatment Group Phase III Trial N0147, a randomized adjuvant trial of patients with stage III colon cancer, we assessed the relationship between smoking and cancer outcomes, disease-free survival (DFS), and time to recurrence (TTR), accounting for heterogeneity by patient and tumor characteristics.PATIENTS AND METHODS Before random assignment to infusional fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) or FOLFOX plus cetuximab, 1,968 participants completed a questionnaire on smoking history and other risk factors.Cox models assessed the association between smoking history and the primary trial outcome of DFS (ie, time to recurrence or death), as well as TTR, adjusting for other clinical and patient factors.The median follow-up was 3.5 years among patients who did not experience events.RESULTS: Compared with never-smokers, ever smokers experienced significantly shorter DFS (3-year DFS proportion: 70% v 74%; hazard ratio [HR], 1.21; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.42).This association persisted after multivariate adjustment (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.49).There was significant interaction in this association by BRAF mutation status (P = .03): smoking was associated with shorter DFS in patients with BRAF wild-type (HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.11 to 1.66) but not BRAF mutated (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.50 to 1.29) colon cancer.Smoking was more strongly associated with poorer DFS in those with KRAS mutated versus KRAS wild-type colon cancer (HR, 1.50 [95% CI, 1.12 to 2.00] v HR, 1.09 [95% CI, 0.85 to 1.39]), although interaction by KRAS mutation status was not statistically significant (P = .07).Associations were comparable in analyses of TTR.CONCLUSION: Overall, smoking was significantly associated with shorter DFS and TTR in patients with colon cancer.These adverse relationships were most evident in patients with BRAF wild-type or KRAS mutated colon cancer.",0,0,0,0
23559149,"FOLFOX4 plus cetuximab administered weekly or every second week in the first-line treatment of patients with KRAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer: a randomized phase II CECOG study.BACKGROUND: This randomized phase II study investigated first-line chemotherapy plus cetuximab administered every second week in KRAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients received FOLFOX4 plus either standard weekly cetuximab (arm 1) or cetuximab (500 mg/m(2)) every second week (arm 2), until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.Primary end point was the objective response rate (ORR).Progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), disease control rate (DCR) and safety were also investigated.The study was not powered to establish non-inferiority, but aimed at the estimation of treatment differences.RESULTS: Of 152 randomized eligible patients, 75 were treated in arm 1 and 77 in arm 2; ORRs [53% versus 62%, odds ratio 1.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74-2.66], PFS [median 9.5 versus 9.2 months, hazard ratio (HR) 0.92, 95% CI 0.63-1.34], OS (median 25.8 versus 23.0 months, HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.56-1.30) and DCR (87%) were comparable.HRs adjusted for baseline factors were 1.01 and 0.99 for PFS and OS, respectively.Frequencies of grade 3/4 adverse events in arms 1 versus 2 were similar: most common were neutropenia (28% versus 34%) and rash (15% versus 17%).CONCLUSIONS: Activity and safety of FOLFOX4 plus either cetuximab administered weekly or every second week were similar.",1,1,1,1
23562353,"Influence of DNA copy number and mRNA levels on the expression of breast cancer related proteins.For a panel of cancer related proteins, the aim was to shed light on which molecular level the expression of each protein was mainly regulated in breast tumors, and to investigate whether differences in regulation were reflected in different molecular subtypes.DNA, mRNA and protein lysates from 251 breast tumor specimens were analyzed using appropriate microarray technologies.Data from all three levels were available for 52 proteins selected for their known involvement in cancer, primarily through the PI3K/Akt pathway.For every protein, in cis Spearman rank correlations between the three molecular levels were calculated across all samples and within each intrinsic gene expression subtype, enabling 63 comparisons altogether due to multiple gene probes matching to single proteins.Subtype-specific relationships between the three molecular levels were studied by calculating the variance of subtype-specific correlation and differences between overall and average subtype-specific correlation.The findings were validated in an external dataset comprising 703 breast tumor specimens.The proteins were sorted into four groups based on the calculated rank correlation values between the three molecular levels.Group A consisted of eight proteins with significant correlation between DNA copy number levels and mRNA expression, and between mRNA expression and protein expression (Bonferroni adjusted p < 0.05).Group B consisted of 14 proteins with significant correlation between mRNA expression and protein expression.Group C consisted of 15 proteins with significant correlation between copy number levels and mRNA expression.For the remaining 25 proteins (group D), no significant correlations was observed.Stratification of tumors according to intrinsic subtype enabled identification of positive correlations between copy number levels, mRNA and protein expression that were undetectable when considering the entire sample set.Protein pairings that either demonstrated high variance in correlation values between subtypes, or between subtypes and the total dataset were studied in particular.The protein expression of cleaved caspase 7 was most highly expressed, and correlated highest to CASP7 gene expression within the basal-like subtype, accompanied by the lowest amounts of hsa-miR-29c.Luminal A-like subtype demonstrated highest amounts of hsa-miR-29c (a miRNA with a putative target sequence in CASP7 mRNA), low expression of cleaved caspase 7 and low correlation to CASP7 gene expression.Such pattern might be an indication of hsa-miR-29c miRNA functioning as a repressor of translation of CASP7 within the luminal-A subtype.Across the entire cohort no correlation was found between CCNB1 copy number and gene expression.However, within most gene intrinsic subtypes, mRNA and protein expression of cyclin B1 was found positively correlated to copy number data, suggesting that copy number can affect the overall expression of this protein.Aberrations of cyclin B1 copy number also identified patients with reduced overall survival within each subtype.Based on correlation between the three molecular levels, genes and their products could be sorted into four groups for which the expression was likely to be regulated at different molecular levels.Further stratification suggested subtype-specific regulation that was not evident across the entire sample set.",0,0,0,0
23588130,"Increasing human papillomavirus vaccine acceptability by tailoring messages to young adult women's perceived barriers.BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination is a safe and effective primary prevention strategy for cervical cancer.Despite the need for effective HPV vaccination interventions, relatively few have been tested.Moreover, existing interventions have tended to use a one-size-fits-all educational approach.We investigated whether tailoring intervention materials to young adult women's perceived barriers to HPV vaccination-a known psychosocial predictor of vaccine uptake-would increase women's intentions to receive the HPV vaccine.METHODS: Young adult women (N = 94; aged 18-26 years) who had not been vaccinated against HPV were randomly assigned to read either a nontailored message about HPV vaccination or a message that was individually tailored to participants' perceived barriers to HPV vaccine uptake (e.g., safety concerns, cost, and not sexually active).Participants' intentions to receive the HPV vaccine in the next year were assessed before and after delivery of the intervention and served as the primary outcome variable.RESULTS: The most commonly selected barrier and primary reason for not getting vaccinated was concern about vaccine adverse effects (endorsed by 55%).Knowledge about HPV vaccination increased after exposure to the intervention but did not differ by experimental condition.Although HPV vaccination intentions increased from pretest to posttest in both conditions, participants in the tailored condition reported greater increases in intentions than did participants in the nontailored condition (F1,90 = 4.02, P = 0.048, partial eta = 0.043).CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that tailoring intervention materials to women's individual barriers is a potentially promising strategy for increasing HPV vaccination among young adult women.",0,0,0,0

An exploratory analysis of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer 55971 randomised trial.BACKGROUND: To investigate whether biomarkers consisting of baseline characteristics of advanced stage ovarian cancer patients can help in identifying subgroups of patients who would benefit more from primary surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy.METHODS: We used data of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 55971 trial in which 670 patients were randomly assigned to primary surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy.The primary outcome was overall survival.Ten baseline clinical and pathological characteristics were selected as potential biomarkers.Using Subpopulation Treatment Effect Pattern Plots (STEPP), biomarkers with a statistically significant qualitative additive interaction with treatment were considered as potentially informative for treatment selection.We also combined selected biomarkers to form a multimarker treatment selection rule.FINDINGS: The size of the largest metastatic tumour and clinical stage were significantly associated with the magnitude of the benefit from treatment, in terms of five-year survival (p for interaction: 0.008 and 0.016, respectively).Stage IIIC patients with metastatic tumours 45 mm benefited more from primary surgery while stage IV patients with metastatic tumours >45 mm benefited more from neoadjuvant chemotherapy.In stage IIIC patients with larger metastatic tumours and in stage IV patients with less extensive metastatic tumours both treatments were equally effective.We estimated that by selecting treatments for patients based on largest metastatic tumour and clinical stage, the potential five-year survival rate in the population of treated patients would be 27.3% (95% confidence interval (CI) 21.9-33.0), 7.8% higher than if all were treated with primary surgery, and 5.6% higher if all were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.INTERPRETATION: Although survival was comparable after primary surgery and neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the overall group of patients with ovarian cancer in the EORTC 55971 trial, we found in this exploratory analysis that patients with stage IIIC and less extensive metastatic tumours had higher survival with primary surgery, while patients with stage IV disease and large metastatic tumours had higher survival with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.For patients who did not meet these criteria, both treatment options led to comparable survival rates.",0,0,0,0
23863050,"Alpha emitter radium-223 and survival in metastatic prostate cancer.BACKGROUND: Radium-223 dichloride (radium-223), an alpha emitter, selectively targets bone metastases with alpha particles.We assessed the efficacy and safety of radium-223 as compared with placebo, in addition to the best standard of care, in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer and bone metastases.METHODS: In our phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we randomly assigned 921 patients who had received, were not eligible to receive, or declined docetaxel, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive six injections of radium-223 (at a dose of 50 kBq per kilogram of body weight intravenously) or matching placebo; one injection was administered every 4 weeks.In addition, all patients received the best standard of care.The primary end point was overall survival.The main secondary efficacy end points included time to the first symptomatic skeletal event and various biochemical end points.A prespecified interim analysis, conducted when 314 deaths had occurred, assessed the effect of radium-223 versus placebo on survival.An updated analysis, when 528 deaths had occurred, was performed before crossover from placebo to radium-223.RESULTS: At the interim analysis, which involved 809 patients, radium-223, as compared with placebo, significantly improved overall survival (median, 14.0 months vs. 11.2 months; hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.55 to 0.88; two-sided P=0.002).The updated analysis involving 921 patients confirmed the radium-223 survival benefit (median, 14.9 months vs. 11.3 months; hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.83; P<0.001).Assessments of all main secondary efficacy end points also showed a benefit of radium-233 as compared with placebo.Radium-223 was associated with low myelosuppression rates and fewer adverse events.CONCLUSIONS: In this study, which was terminated for efficacy at the prespecified interim analysis, radium-223 improved overall survival.(Funded by Algeta and Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals; ALSYMPCA ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00699751.).",0,0,0,0

23899063,"Pathologic response and long-term follow-up in breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy: a comparison between classifications and their practical application.CONTEXT: Breast cancer is increasingly treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy to improve surgical resectability and evaluate tumor response, which is assessed histopathologically.Several histopathologic classification systems have been previously described for assessment of treatment response.OBJECTIVES: To test performance in a side-by-side comparison of several histopathologic classification systems after neoadjuvant chemotherapy with clinical outcome.DESIGN: Sixty-two patients were enrolled in a randomized trial receiving sequential neoadjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin and paclitaxel.Histologic sections from the patients' tumors sampled before (core biopsy) and after treatment (excision or mastectomy) were reviewed.Histologic response was assessed following National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project protocol B18, Miller-Payne grading, Sataloff tumor and nodes, Residual Cancer Burden (RCB), and Residual Disease in Breast and Nodes (RDBN).Pathologic classification results were correlated with survival using Kaplan-Meier and Cox hazards regression with a median follow-up of 93 months.RESULTS: RDBN was associated with distant disease-free survival by univariate and multivariate analysis (P = .01 and .004, respectively), as were lymph node metastases (P = .02 and .01, respectively).Five patients (8%) had complete pathologic response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and none of them relapsed during the study period.Survival was shorter among patients with higher Residual Cancer Burden scores, but the associations were not significant.Miller-Payne grading and Sataloff tumor scores were not correlated with survival.CONCLUSIONS: Evaluation of breast specimens after neoadjuvant chemotherapy by the composite index RDBN correlates with long-term outcome.The residual disease in breast and nodes system is suitable for routinely processed pathology cases.This study confirms the importance of lymph node status after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and favorable outcome in patients with pathologic complete response.",0,0,0,0
23916017,"Perceptions of two therapeutic approaches for palliative care patients experiencing death anxiety.OBJECTIVE: Evidenced-based psychotherapies are not well researched for palliative care patients experiencing unrelenting anxiety about dying, even less research is focused on young adult palliative care patients with death anxiety.The aim of this study is to provide preliminary data regarding potential clients' perceptions of using evidenced based treatments with dying populations who are experiencing death anxiety.METHODS: 104 college students were used as potential clients and randomly assigned to watch either a short video of a cognitive therapy (CT) session or of an acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) session focused on treating a young adult diagnosed with an acute lymphoid leukemia expressing death anxiety.After watching the video, potential clients rated the session impact of the therapy approach using the Session Evaluation Questionnaire.RESULTS: No differences in ratings of session impact were found between potential clients who viewed the CT session and the ACT session.In regards to potential clients' views of session impact variables, their view of session smoothness was positively related to their post-session positivity, but inversely related to their view of session depth.Additionally, a positive correlation was found between potential clients' views of the therapist and session depth.SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: This preliminary study suggests that palliative care patients expressing death anxiety may benefit from either ACT or CT for death anxiety, however, future research is needed to explore the usefulness of each approach.Findings of this study support the theory that ACT and CT are viewed to have a similar session impact in the palliative care population.",0,0,0,0

24081946,"Randomized multicenter phase II trial comparing two schedules of etirinotecan pegol (NKTR-102) in women with recurrent platinum-resistant/refractory epithelial ovarian cancer.PURPOSE: Etirinotecan pegol (NKTR-102) is a unique, long-acting topoisomerase-I inhibitor with prolonged systemic exposure to SN38 (7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin), the active metabolite of irinotecan.This randomized phase II trial investigated two dosing schedules of etirinotecan pegol in patients with platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian carcinoma.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 71 eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive etirinotecan pegol 145 mg/m(2) every 14 or 21 days until progression or unacceptable adverse events (AEs).The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR) by RECIST (version 1.0).Secondary end points included response by Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup criteria, duration of ORR, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).RESULTS: The overall confirmed ORR was 20% (95% CI, 10% to 30%): 20% for once every 14 days, and 19% for once every 21 days.Median response duration was 4.1 months for once every 14 days and 4.0 months for once every 21 days.Median PFS for every 14 and every 21 days was 4.1 and 5.3 months, respectively, and median OS was 10.0 and 11.7 months, respectively.Etirinotecan pegol was well tolerated, with the most common grade 3 to 4 AEs being dehydration (24%) and diarrhea (23%).Diarrhea, dehydration, nausea, and neutropenia were less frequent with the schedule of once every 21 days than with that of once every 14 days.CONCLUSION: Both schedules of etirinotecan pegol showed activity in patients with heavily pretreated ovarian cancer, with encouraging ORR and PFS rates.The schedule of once every 21 days was better tolerated and had slightly longer PFS and OS rates.The treatment schedule of etirinotecan pegol 145 mg/m(2) once every 21 days was selected for the expanded phase II study and is preferred for future phase III studies.These findings provide support to directly compare etirinotecan pegol versus one of the approved drugs (eg, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or topotecan) in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.",1,1,1,0
24105720,"Treatment trade-offs in myeloma: A survey of consecutive patients about contemporary maintenance strategies.BACKGROUND: Two randomized trials have demonstrated improved progression-free survival (PFS) with lenalidomide maintenance after autologous transplantation for multiple myeloma (MM).Overall survival (OS) results are conflicting, and quality-of-life (QOL) data are lacking.The authors conducted a systematic survey of patients with MM regarding what constitutes a meaningful benefit that would make burdens of maintenance treatments (toxicity and cost) acceptable.METHODS: A self-administered survey was mailed to 1159 consecutive, living patients who were evaluated at Mayo Clinic.The survey provided background information on the standard of care for MM and data on maintenance.Patients were asked to estimate the magnitude of OS benefit that would be acceptable for various degrees of toxicity and cost.RESULTS: Of 1159 surveys sent, 886 patients (83.2%) responded, and 736 patients returned a completed survey (66% raw response rate).The most worrisome potential toxicity was identified as peripheral neuropathy by 27% of patients, cytopenias by 24%, deep vein thrombosis by 20%, fatigue by 15%, nausea by 8%, and diarrhea/constipation by 7%.If treatment was free, had no toxicity, and the OS benefit was </=1 year, then 49% of patients indicated that they would choose maintenance; with moderate toxicity, this proportion decreased to 42%.Adding a treatment cost of $25 per month decreased the proportion that would choose maintenance to 39% of patients.CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicated that willingness to receive maintenance treatment declined when actual benefits were provided in concrete numeric terms compared with a general statement of PFS benefit.The authors also observed that the magnitude of benefit required to consider maintenance was affected by cost and toxicity.",0,0,0,0

24129868,"Effect of a web-based curriculum on primary care practice: basic skin cancer triage trial.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Primary care physicians (PCPs) are uniquely positioned to detect melanoma.Effective educational interventions targeted at PCPs may improve early melanoma detection.A previous in-person Basic Skin Cancer Triage (BSCT) 2-hour course demonstrated significant short-term improvement in provider practices, attitudes, ability, confidence, and knowledge.We conducted a randomized trial to test the efficacy of the BSCT course implemented as a web-based learning program, compared to a similar (control) web-based course on weight assessment.METHODS: We recruited a sample of 57 PCPs and 3,341 of their patients from four geographically diverse centers.Skin cancer control activities by PCPs were assessed by physician survey and by chart review and patient telephone interview about their recent visit to their PCP at baseline and at 1--2 months and 12 months after course completion.RESULTS: Some effect of intervention on skin cancer parameters was self-reported by physicians; this was not confirmed by patient survey or chart-extracted data.Rates of skin cancer control practices by PCPs were low across both groups before and after intervention.The positive changes in physician-reported behaviors (total body skin examination [TBSE]), intentions (discuss skin cancer detection), confidence (performing TBSE), office practices, and knowledge (58% skin versus 49% control) were neither matched by differences in practice reported by their patients, nor persisted in a longer term follow-up, hence may be attributable to physician recall bias due to the experience of the course or desire to please study investigators and were less dramatic as compared to our previously reported in-person BSCT intervention.Thus this approach by itself appears unlikely to result in improved PCP handling of skin cancer issues.CONCLUSIONS: Given previous success with our in-person course, the features required to make WBL a more effective tool for medical education must be further explored.",0,0,0,0

24162448,"A randomized controlled trial of diet and physical activity in BRCA mutation carriers.High serum levels of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) are associated with an increased risk of sporadic breast cancer (BC).Furthermore, insulin and markers of insulin resistance, such as abdominal obesity, high blood glucose, high serum testosterone and metabolic syndrome, may affect both BC incidence and prognosis.We hypothesized that all these factors might be relevant also for hereditary BC, due to a deleterious mutation of BRCA genes.Epidemiological observation suggested that weight, energy intake (usually associated with higher bio-availability of growth factors) and physical activity may be relevant in BRCA mutation carriers.Mechanistic studies hypothesized a functional interaction between BRCA genes and the IGF-I system.We have provided some evidence that high serum levels of IGF-I are associated with a significantly increased penetrance.We are recruiting a larger cohort of BRCA mutation carriers in order to test potential modulators of penetrance and prognosis.Within this cohort, we have planned a randomized controlled trial to test whether moderate calorie and protein restriction, together with physical activity, decrease IGF-I. Eligible study subjects are women with or without BC, aged 18-70, with a proven deleterious BRCA mutation, and without metastases.All the women will receive recommendations for the dietary prevention of cancer.The women will be then randomized into an active life-style intervention group and into a control group that will receive only the baseline recommendations.We expect to significantly reduce IGF-I in the intervention group.This trial and the subsequent cohort follow-up might open up primary prevention options for genetic BC.",0,0,0,0

24213602,"Estrogen metabolism and breast cancer risk among postmenopausal women: a case-cohort study within B~FIT.Although elevated circulating estrogens are associated with increased postmenopausal breast cancer risk, less is known regarding the role of estrogen metabolism in breast carcinogenesis.We conducted a case-cohort study within the Breast and Bone Follow-up to the Fracture Intervention Trial to assess serum estrogens and estrogen metabolites (EMs) in 407 incident breast cancer cases diagnosed during follow-up and a subcohort of 496 women.In 1992-93, women completed a baseline questionnaire and provided blood samples.Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusted for geography and trial participation status, were estimated using Cox proportional hazard regression.Serum concentrations of EMs were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.EMs (quintiles, Q) were analyzed individually, as metabolic pathways (C-2, -4 or -16) and as ratios.Elevated circulating estradiol was associated with increased breast cancer risk (HRQ5vsQ1 = 1.86; 95% CI: 1.19-2.90; P trend = 0.04).An elevated ratio of the 2-hydroxylation pathway (HRQ5vsQ1 = 0.69; 95% CI: 0.46-1.05; P trend = 0.01) and 4-hydroxylation pathway (HRQ5vsQ1 = 0.61; 95% CI: 0.40-0.93; P trend = 0.004) to parent estrogens (estradiol and estrone) was inversely associated with risk.A higher ratio of the 2/16-hydroxylation pathways was associated with reduced risk (HRQ5vsQ1 = 0.60; 95% CI: 0.40-0.90; P trend = 0.002).Increased 2- or 4-hydroxylation of parent estrogens may lower risk of postmenopausal breast cancer.Analyses of metabolic pathways may help elucidate the role of estrogen metabolism in breast carcinogenesis.",0,0,0,0
24214881,"Vitamin D-binding protein, circulating vitamin D and risk of renal cell carcinoma.Cell culture experiments suggest that vitamin D may inhibit renal carcinogenesis, but human studies of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], the accepted measure of vitamin D status, and kidney cancer have been null.Limited research has examined the role of circulating vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) in the association between 25(OH)D and disease risk, and it is unclear whether free 25(OH)D in circulation is a better measure of effective exposure, or if DBP may independently impact outcomes.We conducted a nested case-control analysis within the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention (ATBC) Study to examine whether circulating DBP concentration was prospectively associated with risk of renal cell carcinoma, and whether it modified the association with 25(OH)D. Renal cell carcinoma cases (n = 262) were matched 1:1 to controls on age (+/-1 year) and date of blood collection (+/- 30 days).We estimated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of renal cell carcinoma risk by quartiles of 25(OH)D, DBP and the molar ratio of 25(OH)D:DBP, a proxy for free circulating 25(OH)D. Men with higher DBP concentrations were at significantly decreased risk of kidney cancer (Q4 vs. Q1: OR = 0.17, 95% CI = 0.08-0.33; p-trend < 0.0001), a finding unchanged by adjustment for 25(OH)D.

24296288,"Development of a new biochemical test to diagnose and monitor neuroblastoma in Vietnam: homovanillic and vanillylmandelic acid by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to develop an accurate robust testing method to simultaneously measure urine levels of HVA and VMA using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS) and to establish age-specific reference intervals of HVA and VMA in random urines for Vietnamese children.DESIGN AND METHODS: The assay for urinary HVA and VMA was developed based on a classical urinary organic acid profiling method.Briefly, this incorporated 3-phenyl butyric acid as the internal standard and liquid-liquid extraction with ethyl acetate followed by derivatization with BSTFA.The Agilent 7890A GC and 5975C Mass Selective Detector in single ion monitoring mode was used for analysis.Reference intervals were developed from random urine samples collected from 634 disease free Vietnamese children and compared to 50 known neuroblastoma patient samples.Results were reported relative to creatinine concentration.Age related 95% reference intervals for urinary HVA and VMA were estimated from sample quantiles.The analytes (expressed as analyte/creatinine ratios) diagnostic values were determined by calculating the related sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratios.RESULTS: HVA and VMA were linear to at least 193 and 221mumol/L, respectively.The limit of quantitation for both analytes was 0.9mumol/L. Using the bi-level control (n=15), the within-batch coefficients of variations (CVs) were less than 3% for both analytes across the assay range.The between-batch CVs (n=20 over three months), were 3.6% at 11mumol/L and 2.1% at 88mumol/L for HVA, 6.6% at 18.2mumol/L and 2.6% at 90.6mumol/L for VMA.Vietnamese age related reference intervals were established for urinary HVA and VMA per creatinine.HVA for children <6months (n=91) was 5.3-37.0mumol/mmol; 6months to <1year (n=141) was 2.7-27.7mumol/mmol; 1 to 5years (n=139) was 3.4-17.9mumol/mmol; 6 to 10years (n=136) was 2.7-8.8mumol/mmol; and 11 to 15years (n=127) was 1.1-9.4mumol/mmol.VMA for children <6months was 1.8-12.2mumol/mmol; 6months to <1year was 1.5-9.3mumol/mmol; 1 to 5years was 1.9-7.8mumol/mmol; 6 to 10years was 1.6-5.1mumol/mmol; and 11 to 15years was <0.9-6.3mumol/mmol.CONCLUSIONS: A robust testing method for simultaneous quantitation of urinary HVA and VMA by GCMS was developed.This method is accurate, precise and fit for its clinical purpose and suitable for developing countries.Age-related reference intervals of urinary HVA and VMA were established for Vietnamese children and the intervals declined progressively with increasing age for each analyte.",0,0,0,0

24330570,"Effects of recreational soccer in men with prostate cancer undergoing androgen deprivation therapy: study protocol for the 'FC Prostate' randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is a cornerstone in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer.Adverse musculoskeletal and cardiovascular effects of ADT are widely reported and investigations into the potential of exercise to ameliorate the effects of treatment are warranted.The 'Football Club (FC) Prostate' study is a randomized trial comparing the effects of soccer training with standard treatment approaches on body composition, cardiovascular function, physical function parameters, glucose tolerance, bone health, and patient-reported outcomes in men undergoing ADT for prostate cancer.METHODS/DESIGN: Using a single-center randomized controlled design, 80 men with histologically confirmed locally advanced or disseminated prostate cancer undergoing ADT for 6 months or more at The Copenhagen University Hospital will be enrolled on this trial.After baseline assessments eligible participants will be randomly assigned to a soccer training group or a control group receiving usual care.The soccer intervention will consist of 12 weeks of training 2-3 times/week for 45-60 min after which the assessment protocol will be repeated.Soccer training will then continue bi-weekly for an additional 20 weeks at the end of which all measures will be repeated to allow for additional analyses of long-term effects.The primary endpoint is changes in lean body mass from baseline to 12 weeks assessed by dual X-ray absorptiometry scan.Secondary endpoints include changes of cardiovascular, metabolic, and physical function parameters, as well as markers of bone metabolism and patient-reported outcomes.DISCUSSION: The FC Prostate trial will assess the safety and efficacy of a novel soccer-training approach to cancer rehabilitation on a number of clinically important health outcomes in men with advanced prostate cancer during ADT.The results may pave the way for innovative, community-based interventions in the approach to treating prostate cancer.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01711892.",0,0,0,0
24332238,"Docetaxel versus active symptom control for refractory oesophagogastric adenocarcinoma (COUGAR-02): an open-label, phase 3 randomised controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Second-line chemotherapy for patients with oesophagogastric adenocarcinoma refractory to platinum and fluoropyrimidines has not shown benefits in health-related quality of life (HRQoL).We assessed whether the addition of docetaxel to active symptom control alone can improve survival and HRQoL for patients.METHODS: For this open-labelled, multicentre trial, we recruited patients aged 18 years or older from 30 UK centres.Patients were eligible if they had an advanced, histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus, oesophagogastric junction, or stomach that had progressed on or within 6 months of treatment with a platinum-fluoropyrimidine combination.Patients could have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2.We randomly assigned patients using a central, computerised minimisation procedure to receive docetaxel plus active symptom control, or active symptom control alone (1:1; stratified by disease status, disease site, duration of response to previous chemotherapy, and performance status).Docetaxel was given at a dose of 75 mg/m(2) by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks for up to six cycles.The primary endpoint was overall survival, analysed by intention to treat.This is the report of the planned final analysis.This study is an International Standardised Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN13366390.FINDINGS: Between April 21, 2008, and April 26, 2012, we recruited 168 patients, allocating 84 to each treatment group.After a median follow-up of 12 months [IQR 10-21]) and 161 (96%) deaths (80 in the docetaxel group, 81 in the active symptom control group), median overall survival in the docetaxel group was 5.2 months (95% CI 4.1-5.9) versus 3.6 months (3.3-4.4) in the active symptom control group (hazard ratio 0.67, 95% CI 0.49-0.92; p=0.01).Docetaxel was associated with higher incidence of grade 3-4 neutropenia (12 [15%] patients vs no patients), infection (15 [19%] patients vs two [3%] patients), and febrile neutropenia (six [7%] patients vs no patients).Patients receiving docetaxel reported less pain (p=0.0008) and less nausea and vomiting (p=0.02) and constipation (p=0.02).Global HRQoL was similar between the groups (p=0.53).Disease specific HRQoL measures also showed benefits for docetaxel in reducing dysphagia (p=0.02) and abdominal pain (p=0.01).INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that docetaxel can be recommended as an appropriate second-line treatment for patients with oesophagogastric adenocarcinoma that is refractory to treatment with platinum and fluoropyrimidine.FUNDING: Cancer Research UK.",0,0,0,0
24332516,"Surgical excision versus imiquimod 5% cream for nodular and superficial basal-cell carcinoma (SINS): a multicentre, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Basal-cell carcinoma is the most common form of skin cancer and its incidence is increasing worldwide.We aimed to assess the effectiveness of imiquimod cream versus surgical excision in patients with low-risk basal-cell carcinoma.METHODS: We did a multicentre, parallel-group, pragmatic, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial at 12 centres in the UK, in which patients were recruited between June 19, 2003, and Feb 22, 2007, with 3 year follow-up from June 26, 2006, to May 26, 2010.Participants of any age were eligible if they had histologically confirmed primary nodular or superficial basal-cell carcinoma at low-risk sites.We excluded patients with morphoeic or recurrent basal-cell carcinoma and those with Gorlin syndrome.Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) via computer-generated blocked randomisation, stratified by centre and tumour type, to receive either imiquimod 5% cream once daily for 6 weeks (superficial) or 12 weeks (nodular), or surgical excision with a 4 mm margin.The randomisation sequence was concealed from study investigators.Because of the nature of the interventions, masking of participants was not possible and masking of outcome assessors was only partly possible.The trial statistician was masked to allocation until all analyses had been done.The primary outcome was the proportion of participants with clinical success, defined as absence of initial treatment failure or signs of recurrence at 3 years from start of treatment.We used a prespecified non-inferiority margin of a relative risk (RR) of 0.87.Analysis was by a modified intention-to-treat population and per protocol.This study is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial (ISRCTN48755084), and with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00066872.FINDINGS: 501 participants were randomly assigned to the imiquimod group (n=254) or the surgical excision group (n=247).At year 3, 401 (80%) patients were included in the modified intention-to-treat group.At 3 years, 178 (84%) of 213 participants in the imiquimod group were treated successfully compared with 185 (98%) of 188 participants in the surgery group (RR 0.84, 98% CI 0.78-0.91; p<0.0001).No clear difference was noted between groups in patient-assessed cosmetic outcomes.The most common adverse events were itching (211 patients in the imiquimod group vs 129 in the surgery group) and weeping (160 vs 81).We recorded serious adverse events in 99 (40%) of 249 participants in the imiquimod group and 97 (42%) of 229 in the surgery group had serious adverse events, but none were regarded as related to treatment.12 (5%) participants in the imiquimod group withdrew because of adverse events compared with four (2%) in the surgery group.INTERPRETATION: Imiquimod was inferior to surgery according to our predefined non-inferiority criterion.Although excisional surgery remains the best treatment for low-risk basal-cell carcinoma, imiquimod cream might still be a useful treatment option for small low-risk superficial or nodular basal-cell carcinoma dependent on factors such as patient preference, size and site of the lesion, and whether the patient has more than one lesion.FUNDING: Cancer Research UK.",0,0,0,0
24332581,"Comparison of mammographic findings after intraoperative radiotherapy or external beam whole breast radiotherapy.BACKGROUND: The TARGIT (TARGeted Intraoperative Radiotherapy) trial was designed to compare local recurrence and complication rates in breast cancer patients, prospectively randomised to either EBRT (external beam whole breast radiotherapy) or a single dose of IORT (intraoperative radiotherapy).The aim of our study was to compare follow-up mammographic findings, ultrasound and biopsy rates in each group.METHODS: Follow-up imaging and breast biopsies of women from one centre participating in the TARGIT-A trial were independently reviewed by two radiologists blinded to the radiotherapy treatment received.RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 141 patients (EBRT n = 80/IORT n = 61).There was no significant difference in the patient or disease characteristics of the two groups.The number of follow-up mammograms and length of follow-up was similar (EBRT/IORT n = 2.0/2.4; 4.3yr/5.1yr; p = 0.386 chi(2) test).There were no significant differences in mammographic scar or calcification appearances of the post-operative site.Generalised increase in breast density and skin thickening were more common in the EBRT compared to the IORT group (p = 0.002; p = 0.030, chi(2) test respectively).A trend towards additional ultrasound at follow-up was observed in the IORT group (15 of 61 [24.6%] versus 11 of 80 [13.8%]), however this was not statistically significant (p = 0.100 chi(2) test).No disease recurrence was demonstrated on any of the breast biopsies taken.Only one biopsy was reported as fat necrosis in the IORT group.CONCLUSIONS: Mammographic changes were more common following EBRT, although more additional follow-up ultrasounds were performed in the IORT group.IORT is not detrimental to subsequent radiological follow up.",0,0,0,0
24338990,"Risk factors for clinician-reported symptom clusters in patients with advanced head and neck cancer in a phase 3 randomized clinical trial: RTOG 0129.BACKGROUND: Chemoradiotherapy has become the standard of care for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma; however, those patients often experience multiple treatment-related symptoms or symptom clusters.Two symptom clusters have been identified for this population.Little is known about the risk factors of these symptom clusters.METHODS: Subjects comprised 684 patients who were treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy in a phase 3 randomized clinical trial.This trial compared standard fractionation radiotherapy to accelerated fractionation radiotherapy.Symptom clusters were evaluated at the end of the first and the second cycle of chemotherapy, and 3 months after the start of radiotherapy.Mixed-effect modeling was used to observe risk factors for symptom clusters.RESULTS: Race and education were independent predictors for the head and neck cluster, whereas sex and history of tobacco use were independent predictors for the gastrointestinal cluster.Primary cancer site was only significant for the head and neck cluster when other factors were not controlled: patients with oropharyngeal cancer had more severe symptoms in the head and neck clusters than did patients with laryngeal cancer.In addition, patients receiving accelerated fractionation radiotherapy experienced more symptoms of radiomucositis, pain, and nausea at 3 months after the start of radiotherapy than those receiving standard fractionation radiotherapy.CONCLUSIONS: Demographic characteristics were more predictive to symptom clusters, whereas clinical characteristics, such as cancer site and treatment arms, were more significant for individual symptoms.Knowing the risk factors will enhance the capability of clinicians to evaluate patients' risk of severe symptom clusters and to personalize management strategies.",0,0,0,0

24447190,"Trait and state disgust: an experimental investigation of disgust and avoidance in colorectal cancer decision scenarios.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether trait and experimentally manipulated state disgust independently and/or interactively predict immediate and anticipated avoidance in decision scenarios related to colorectal cancer (CRC).METHOD: Eighty participants, aged 18 to 66 years, completed questionnaires assessing trait disgust prior to a laboratory session.Participants were gender block randomized to disgust or control conditions before completing tasks assessing immediate avoidance of a CRC disgust elicitor (stoma bag) and anticipated avoidance in hypothetical CRC scenarios.RESULTS: Manipulation checks confirmed the elicitation of disgust in the experimental condition.Persons in the experimental condition were more likely to exhibit immediate avoidance behaviors in response to a commonly used bowel disease device (stoma bag), and trait disgust predicted time to touch the device.Trait disgust also moderated the influence of state disgust on anticipated avoidance, namely delay in help seeking for bowel symptoms and predicted rating disgusting side effects as more deterring to adherence.CONCLUSIONS: The current report suggests the importance of examining disgust in CRC contexts and provides the first empirical demonstration that state and trait aspects of disgust may interactively operate to deter certain types of decisions.It thus furthers understanding of emotions and avoidance in a health context that has had surprisingly little focus to date.",0,0,0,0

24560287,"A comparison of two methods for estimating DCE-MRI parameters via individual and cohort based AIFs in prostate cancer: a step towards practical implementation.Multi-parametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging, and specifically Dynamic Contrast Enhanced (DCE) MRI, play increasingly important roles in detection and staging of prostate cancer (PCa).One of the actively investigated approaches to DCE MRI analysis involves pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling to extract quantitative parameters that may be related to microvascular properties of the tissue.It is well-known that the prescribed arterial blood plasma concentration (or Arterial Input Function, AIF) input can have significant effects on the parameters estimated by PK modeling.The purpose of our study was to investigate such effects in DCE MRI data acquired in a typical clinical PCa setting.First, we investigated how the choice of a semi-automated or fully automated image-based individualized AIF (iAIF) estimation method affects the PK parameter values; and second, we examined the use of method-specific averaged AIF (cohort-based, or cAIF) as a means to attenuate the differences between the two AIF estimation methods.Two methods for automated image-based estimation of individualized (patient-specific) AIFs, one of which was previously validated for brain and the other for breast MRI, were compared.cAIFs were constructed by averaging the iAIF curves over the individual patients for each of the two methods.Pharmacokinetic analysis using the Generalized kinetic model and each of the four AIF choices (iAIF and cAIF for each of the two image-based AIF estimation approaches) was applied to derive the volume transfer rate (K(trans)) and extravascular extracellular volume fraction (ve) in the areas of prostate tumor.Differences between the parameters obtained using iAIF and cAIF for a given method (intra-method comparison) as well as inter-method differences were quantified.The study utilized DCE MRI data collected in 17 patients with histologically confirmed PCa.Comparison at the level of the tumor region of interest (ROI) showed that the two automated methods resulted in significantly different (p<0.05) mean estimates of ve, but not of K(trans).Comparing cAIF, different estimates for both ve, and K(trans) were obtained.Intra-method comparison between the iAIF- and cAIF-driven analyses showed the lack of effect on ve, while K(trans) values were significantly different for one of the methods.Our results indicate that the choice of the algorithm used for automated image-based AIF determination can lead to significant differences in the values of the estimated PK parameters.K(trans)estimates are more sensitive to the choice between cAIF/iAIF as compared to ve, leading to potentially significant differences depending on the AIF method.These observations may have practical consequences in evaluating the PK analysis results obtained in a multi-site setting.",0,0,0,0

24571588,"Systematic analysis of 18F-FDG PET and metabolism, proliferation and hypoxia markers for classification of head and neck tumors.BACKGROUND: Quantification of molecular cell processes is important for prognostication and treatment individualization of head and neck cancer (HNC).However, individual tumor comparison can show discord in upregulation similarities when analyzing multiple biological mechanisms.Elaborate tumor characterization, integrating multiple pathways reflecting intrinsic and microenvironmental properties, may be beneficial to group most uniform tumors for treatment modification schemes.The goal of this study was to systematically analyze if immunohistochemical (IHC) assessment of molecular markers, involved in treatment resistance, and 18F-FDG PET parameters could accurately distinguish separate HNC tumors.METHODS: Several imaging parameters and texture features for 18F-FDG small-animal PET and immunohistochemical markers related to metabolism, hypoxia, proliferation and tumor blood perfusion were assessed within groups of BALB/c nu/nu mice xenografted with 14 human HNC models.Classification methods were used to predict tumor line based on sets of parameters.RESULTS: We found that 18F-FDG PET could not differentiate between the tumor lines.On the contrary, combined IHC parameters could accurately allocate individual tumors to the correct model.From 9 analyzed IHC parameters, a cluster of 6 random parameters already classified 70.3% correctly.Combining all PET/IHC characteristics resulted in the highest tumor line classification accuracy (81.0%; cross validation 82.0%), which was just 2.2% higher (p = 5.2x10-32) than the performance of the IHC parameter/feature based model.CONCLUSIONS: With a select set of IHC markers representing cellular processes of metabolism, proliferation, hypoxia and perfusion, one can reliably distinguish between HNC tumor lines.Addition of 18F-FDG PET improves classification accuracy of IHC to a significant yet minor degree.These results may form a basis for development of tumor characterization models for treatment allocation purposes.",0,0,0,0
24573743,"A phase II open-label randomized multicenter trial of TSU-68 in combination with S-1 and oxaliplatin versus S-1 in combination with oxaliplatin in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide.The combination of oxaliplatin-based treatments (oxaliplatin plus infusional 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin [FOLFOX] or oxaliplatin plus capecitabine [CapeOX]) and bevacizumab is a standard chemotherapy regimen for metastatic CRC (mCRC).However, several clinical studies that tested S-1 plus oxaliplatin (SOX) indicate that SOX is also a treatment option for mCRC.TSU-68 is an oral compound that inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptor and platelet-derived growth factor receptor.The recommended dose of TSU-68 + SOX was previously determined in a phase I study of mCRC patients.The goal of this trial was to evaluate the efficacy of TSU-68 in combination with SOX.METHODS: This open-label multicenter randomized phase II trial was performed in Korea.Treatment-naive mCRC patients with a performance status of 0 or 1 were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either TSU-68 + SOX or SOX alone.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS).RESULTS: A total of 105 patients (TSU-68 + SOX, 52 patients; SOX alone, 53 patients) were randomized.The median PFS was 7.0 months in the TSU-68 + SOX group (hazard ratio [HR], 1.057) and 7.2 months in the SOX group (p = 0.8401).The most frequent grade 3 and 4 adverse events were thrombocytopenia (9.6 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 26.4 % [SOX]), neutropenia (13.5 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 15.1 % [SOX]), and anemia (3.8 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 13.2 % [SOX]).We observed a difference between the 2 groups for all grades of anemia (15.4 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 32.1 % [SOX]), diarrhea (30.8 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 47.2 % [SOX]), vomiting (50.0 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 26.4 % [SOX]), and chromaturia (23.1 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 0.0 % [SOX]).Analysis using a Cox proportional hazard model showed that baseline interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels were associated with a survival benefit of TSU-68 (p = 0.012).CONCLUSION: TSU-68 + SOX had a favorable safety profile.However, TSU-68 did not have a synergistic effect on the efficacy of SOX.The baseline serum IL-6 level could be a prognostic factor for TSU-68 efficacy.",1,1,1,0

Ethnic minority participants (n=34, 66%) were significantly more likely than non-Hispanic European Americans (n=30, 42%) to view AH as food, or both as food and medicine (p=0.034).Ethnic differences persisted in the final regression model (OR 2.7; 95% CI 1.3 to 5.7, p=0.010).No significant differences were detected between patients and caregivers, or across gender, age, caregivers' relationship to the patients, group assignment, disease severity or cancer type.CONCLUSIONS: AH was perceived as food/nutrition by many cancer patients and caregivers in the study, particularly among ethnic minorities.This perception may lead to greater distress if fluids are discontinued or withheld.Asking patients/caregivers about their AH perceptions may enhance patient/provider communication and culturally appropriate end-of-life care.",0,0,0,0
24654220,"Lack of association between genetic variability and multiple pain-related outcomes in a large cohort of patients with advanced cancer: the European Pharmacogenetic Opioid Study (EPOS).OBJECTIVE: This study examined whether the choice of pain-related outcome to represent opioid efficacy influenced findings in a genetic association study.Data from the European Pharmacogenetic Opioid Study, which used opioid dose as the outcome, were analysed in respect of six alternative outcomes: average pain intensity, pain right now, worst pain intensity, pain at its least, pain relief and pain interference.DESIGN: Cancer pain patients using an opioid for moderate or severe pain were included.The pain outcomes were obtained using the Brief Pain Inventory.Genetic variation was analysed for 112 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 25 candidate genes relevant for opioid efficacy.The patients were randomly divided into a development and a validation sample and linear regression was used to compare the equality of means in the six outcomes.The influence of non-genetic factors was controlled for, the regression analyses were stratified by country, and the results were corrected for multiple testing.RESULTS: 2201 cancer pain patients were included.Their mean age was 62.4 years and mean average pain was 3.5.None of the examined SNPs exceeded p values corrected for multiple testing for any of the outcomes.CONCLUSIONS: None of the outcomes were associated with variation in the selected SNPs, as previously shown for opioid dose.Thus, we observed that findings related to associations between genetic variability and opioid efficacy were consistent for several alternative outcomes.",0,0,0,0

24852569,"In Barrett's esophagus patients and Barrett's cell lines, ursodeoxycholic acid increases antioxidant expression and prevents DNA damage by bile acids.Hydrophobic bile acids like deoxycholic acid (DCA), which cause oxidative DNA damage and activate NF-kappaB in Barrett's metaplasia, might contribute to carcinogenesis in Barrett's esophagus.We have explored mechanisms whereby ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA, a hydrophilic bile acid) protects against DCA-induced injury in vivo in patients and in vitro using nonneoplastic, telomerase-immortalized Barrett's cell lines.We took biopsies of Barrett's esophagus from 21 patients before and after esophageal perfusion with DCA (250 muM) at baseline and after 8 wk of oral UDCA treatment.DNA damage was assessed by phospho-H2AX expression, neutral CometAssay, and phospho-H2AX nuclear foci formation.Quantitative PCR was performed for antioxidants including catalase and GPX1.Nrf2, catalase, and GPX1 were knocked down with siRNAs.Reporter assays were performed using a plasmid construct containing antioxidant responsive element.In patients, baseline esophageal perfusion with DCA significantly increased phospho-H2AX and phospho-p65 in Barrett's metaplasia.Oral UDCA increased GPX1 and catalase levels in Barrett's metaplasia and prevented DCA perfusion from inducing DNA damage and NF-kappaB activation.In cells, DCA-induced DNA damage and NF-kappaB activation was prevented by 24-h pretreatment with UDCA, but not by mixing UDCA with DCA.UDCA activated Nrf2 signaling to increase GPX1 and catalase expression, and protective effects of UDCA pretreatment were blocked by siRNA knockdown of these antioxidants.UDCA increases expression of antioxidants that prevent toxic bile acids from causing DNA damage and NF-kappaB activation in Barrett's metaplasia.Elucidation of this molecular pathway for UDCA protection provides rationale for clinical trials on UDCA for chemoprevention in Barrett's esophagus.",0,0,0,0

25012645,"The effect of resistance training during radiotherapy on spinal bone metastases in cancer patients - a randomized trial.PURPOSE: To compare the effects of resistance training versus passive physical therapy on bone density in the metastatic bone during radiation therapy (RT) as combined treatment in patients with spinal bone metastases.Secondly, to quantify pathological fractures after combined treatment.MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this randomized trial, 60 patients were allocated from September 2011 until March 2013 into one of the two groups: resistance training (group A) or passive physical therapy (group B) with thirty patients in each group during RT.Bone density in metastatic and non-metastatic vertebral bone was assessed at baseline, 3 and 6 months after RT.RESULTS: Bone density in all metastases increased significantly by 28.3% (IQR 11.4-139.0) and 80.3% (IQR 32.6-250.6) after 3 and 6 months in group A (both p < 0.01).The bone density in group A was significantly increased compared to control group after 3 and 6months (both p < 0.01, median 59.7; IQR 21.1-98.3 and median 62.9; IQR -9.7 to 161.7).The bone density data in group B showed no significant increase over the course of time (p = 0.289, median 5.5, IQR 0.0-62.2 and p = 0.057, median 52.1, IQR 0.0-162.7).23.3% of the patients in group A and 30.0% of the patients in group B had pathological fractures, no fracture was assigned to intervention, and no difference between groups after 3 and 6 months was observed (p = 0.592 and p = 0.604).CONCLUSIONS: Our trial demonstrated that resistance training concomitant to RT can improve bone density in spinal bone metastases.This combined treatment is effective, practicable, and without side effects for patients.Importantly, the pathological fracture rate in the intervention group was not increased.The results offer a rationale for future large controlled investigations to confirm these findings.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical trial identifier NCT01409720.",0,0,0,0
25014687,"Lanreotide in metastatic enteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.BACKGROUND: Somatostatin analogues are commonly used to treat symptoms associated with hormone hypersecretion in neuroendocrine tumors; however, data on their antitumor effects are limited.METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational study of the somatostatin analogue lanreotide in patients with advanced, well-differentiated or moderately differentiated, nonfunctioning, somatostatin receptor-positive neuroendocrine tumors of grade 1 or 2 (a tumor proliferation index [on staining for the Ki-67 antigen] of <10%) and documented disease-progression status.The tumors originated in the pancreas, midgut, or hindgut or were of unknown origin.Patients were randomly assigned to receive an extended-release aqueous-gel formulation of lanreotide (Autogel [known in the United States as Depot], Ipsen) at a dose of 120 mg (101 patients) or placebo (103 patients) once every 28 days for 96 weeks.The primary end point was progression-free survival, defined as the time to disease progression (according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.0) or death.Secondary end points included overall survival, quality of life (assessed with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer questionnaires QLQ-C30 and QLQ-GI.NET21), and safety.RESULTS: Most patients (96%) had no tumor progression in the 3 to 6 months before randomization, and 33% had hepatic tumor volumes greater than 25%.Lanreotide, as compared with placebo, was associated with significantly prolonged progression-free survival (median not reached vs. median of 18.0 months, P<0.001 by the stratified log-rank test; hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.47; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.30 to 0.73).The estimated rates of progression-free survival at 24 months were 65.1% (95% CI, 54.0 to 74.1) in the lanreotide group and 33.0% (95% CI, 23.0 to 43.3) in the placebo group.The therapeutic effect in predefined subgroups was generally consistent with that in the overall population, with the exception of small subgroups in which confidence intervals were wide.There were no significant between-group differences in quality of life or overall survival.The most common treatment-related adverse event was diarrhea (in 26% of the patients in the lanreotide group and 9% of those in the placebo group).CONCLUSIONS: Lanreotide was associated with significantly prolonged progression-free survival among patients with metastatic enteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors of grade 1 or 2 (Ki-67 <10%).(Funded by Ipsen; CLARINET ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00353496; EudraCT 2005-004904-35.).",0,0,0,0
25015203,"Long-term results of a randomized trial in locally advanced rectal cancer: no benefit from adding a brachytherapy boost.PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE(S): Mature data on tumor control and survival are presented from a randomized trial of the addition of a brachytherapy boost to long-course neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy (CRT) for locally advanced rectal cancer.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between March 2005 and November 2008, 248 patients with T3-4N0-2M0 rectal cancer were prospectively randomized to either long-course preoperative CRT (50.4 Gy in 28 fractions, per oral tegafur-uracil and L-leucovorin) alone or the same CRT schedule plus a brachytherapy boost (10 Gy in 2 fractions).The primary trial endpoint was pathologic complete response (pCR) at the time of surgery; secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and freedom from locoregional failure.RESULTS: Results for the primary endpoint have previously been reported.This analysis presents survival data for the 224 patients in the Danish part of the trial.In all, 221 patients (111 control arm, 110 brachytherapy boost arm) had data available for analysis, with a median follow-up time of 5.4 years.Despite a significant increase in tumor response at the time of surgery, no differences in 5-year OS (70.6% vs 63.6%, hazard ratio [HR] = 1.24, P=.34) and PFS (63.9% vs 52.0%, HR=1.22, P=.32) were observed.Freedom from locoregional failure at 5 years were 93.9% and 85.7% (HR=2.60, P=.06) in the standard and in the brachytherapy arms, respectively.There was no difference in the prevalence of stoma.Explorative analysis based on stratification for tumor regression grade and resection margin status indicated the presence of response migration.CONCLUSIONS: Despite increased pathologic tumor regression at the time of surgery, we observed no benefit on late outcome.Improved tumor regression does not necessarily lead to a relevant clinical benefit when the neoadjuvant treatment is followed by high-quality surgery.",0,0,0,0
25015740,"A cohort analysis to identify eligible patients for intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) of early breast cancer.BACKGROUND: Since the results from the randomized TARGIT A trial were published, intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) is used more often.IORT can be provided as accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) or as a boost.The definition of suitable patients for IORT as APBI differs between different national societies (e.g. ESTRO and ASTRO) and different inclusion criteria of trials and so does the eligibility of patients.This analysis identifies eligible patients for IORT according to available consensus statements and inclusion criteria of the ongoing TARGIT trials.METHODS: Between 01/03 - 12/09, 1505 breast cancer cases were treated at the breast cancer center at the University Medical Center Mannheim.Complete data sets for age, stage (T, N, and M), histology and hormone receptor status were available in 1108 cases.Parameters to identify eligible patients are as follows: ESTRO: >50 years, invasive ductal carcinoma/other favorable histology (IDC), T1-2 (</=3 cm), N0, any hormone receptor status, M0; ASTRO: >/=60 years, IDC, T1, N0, positive estrogen hormone receptor status, M0; TARGIT E ""elderly"", risk adapted radiotherapy with IORT followed by external beam radiotherapy in case of risk factors in final histopathology, phase II: >/=70 years, IDC, T1, N0, any hormone receptor status, M0; TARGIT C ""consolidation"", risk adapted radiotherapy, phase IV: >/=50 years, IDC, T1, N0, positive hormone receptor status, M0; TARGIT BQR ""boost quality registry"": every age, every histology, T1-2 (max.3.5 cm), any hormone receptor status, N0/+, M0/+.RESULTS: Out of the 1108 cases, 379 cases (34.2%) were suitable for IORT as APBI regarding the ESTRO and 175 (15.8%) regarding the ASTRO consensus statements.82 (7.4%) patients were eligible for the TARGIT E trial, 258 (23.3%) for the TARGIT C trial and 671 (60.6%) for the TARGIT BQR registry.According to the consensus statements of ASTRO (45.1%) and ESTRO (41.4%) about half of the eligible patients were treated with IORT as APBI.From the eligible patients fulfilling the criteria for IORT boost (35%) about one third was eventually treated.CONCLUSIONS: Patient selection for IORT should be restrictive.For IORT as APBI the TARGIT trials are even more restrictive including patients than the ESTRO and ASTRO consensus statements.",0,0,0,0
25018037,"Impact of baseline corticosteroids on survival and steroid androgens in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: exploratory analysis from COU-AA-301.BACKGROUND: Corticosteroids have been used to mitigate mineralocorticoid-related effects and restore sensitivity to abiraterone acetate.Corticosteroids may also mediate glucocorticoid receptor or mutated androgen receptor activation and adversely influence outcome.OBJECTIVE: This post hoc exploratory analysis investigated whether baseline corticosteroids were an independent prognostic factor and its level of contribution in the presence of other prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) in study COU-AA-301.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: COU-AA-301 was a randomised study of abiraterone plus prednisone versus prednisone in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients after docetaxel.INTERVENTION: Patients were randomised 2:1 to abiraterone 1000 mg plus prednisone 5mg by mouth twice daily versus prednisone.OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Association of OS with baseline corticosteroids was determined by univariate and multivariate Cox models.RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: At study entry, 33% of patients received corticosteroids, had worse disease characteristics (p<0.05 except liver metastases), and were more likely to have testosterone levels below the median (odds ratio:2.92; chi-square p<0.0001).Associations between prostate-specific antigen response as well as circulating tumour cell decline and higher baseline androgen levels were demonstrated.Patients taking baseline corticosteroids had inferior OS in univariate analysis (hazard ratio: 1.48; p<0.0001); however, in multivariate stepwise selection modelling, baseline corticosteroids did not add substantially to the model.This analysis is limited as a retrospective analysis and restricted to patients after docetaxel.CONCLUSIONS: In the COU-AA-301 study, baseline corticosteroids were associated with adverse prognostic features, inferior OS, and lower baseline androgen levels but did not add substantial information to the final prognostic model.Thus in these data from study COU-AA-301, concurrent baseline corticosteroids did not have an independent impact on OS.PATIENT SUMMARY: Baseline corticosteroids did not adversely affect abiraterone clinical benefit in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.Their use was associated with patients having worse disease characteristics.",1,1,1,0

25361980,"Translational studies within the TAMRAD randomized GINECO trial: evidence for mTORC1 activation marker as a predictive factor for everolimus efficacy in advanced breast cancer.BACKGROUND: Everolimus is an agent frequently associated with specific toxicities.Predictive markers of efficacy are needed to help define which patients could benefit from it.The goal of this exploratory study was to identify potential predictive biomarkers in the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1) activation pathway using primary tumor samples collected during the phase II tamoxifen plus everolimus (TAMRAD) trial.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Tumor tissues were collected retrospectively from the TAMRAD trial.Immunohistochemistry was carried out using specific antibodies directed toward proteins that result in mTORC1 activation [canonical phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt)/mTOR or alternative pathways].DNA was extracted from the tumor tissue; mutation screening in the PIK3CA gene (exons 9 and 20) and the KRAS gene (exons 2 and 3) was first carried out using Sanger direct sequencing, and then completed by next-generation sequencing for PIK3CA.An exploratory analysis of everolimus efficacy in terms of a time-to-progression (TTP) increase was carried out in each biomarker subgroup (high versus low expression referring to the median percentage of marked cells).RESULTS: A total of 55 primary tumor samples from the TAMRAD trial-25 from the tamoxifen-alone group and 30 from the tamoxifen/everolimus group-were evaluated for biomarkers.The subgroups most likely to have an improvement in TTP with tamoxifen/everolimus therapy, compared with tamoxifen alone, were patients with high p4EBP1, low 4EBP1, low liver kinase B1, low pAkt, and low PI3K.Among the 45 samples screened for mutation status, nine samples (20%; 95% CI 9.6-34.6) had a PIK3CA mutation.KRAS mutation was observed in one patient.CONCLUSIONS: A positive correlation between late effectors of mTORC1 activation, a positive correlation between Akt-independent mTORC1 activation, and an inverse correlation between canonical PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and everolimus efficacy were observed in this exploratory analysis.However, these correlations need to be validated in larger studies before applying the findings to routine clinical practice.",0,0,0,0
25361981,"Molecular subtype and tumor characteristics of breast cancer metastases as assessed by gene expression significantly influence patient post-relapse survival.BACKGROUND: We and others have recently shown that tumor characteristics are altered throughout tumor progression.These findings emphasize the need for re-examination of tumor characteristics at relapse and have led to recommendations from ESMO and the Swedish Breast Cancer group.Here, we aim to determine whether tumor characteristics and molecular subtypes in breast cancer metastases confer clinically relevant prognostic information for patients.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The translational aspect of the Swedish multicenter randomized trial called TEX included 111 patients with at least one biopsy from a morphologically confirmed locoregional or distant breast cancer metastasis diagnosed from December 2002 until June 2007.All patients had detailed clinical information, complete follow-up, and metastasis gene expression information (Affymetrix array GPL10379).We assessed the previously published gene expression modules describing biological processes [proliferation, apoptosis, human epidermal receptor 2 (HER2) and estrogen (ER) signaling, tumor invasion, immune response, and angiogenesis] and pathways (Ras, MAPK, PTEN, AKT-MTOR, PI3KCA, IGF1, Src, Myc, E2F3, and beta-catenin) and the intrinsic subtypes (PAM50).Furthermore, by contrasting genes expressed in the metastases in relation to survival, we derived a poor metastasis survival signature.RESULTS: A significant reduction in post-relapse breast cancer-specific survival was associated with low-ER receptor signaling and apoptosis gene module scores, and high AKT-MTOR, Ras, and beta-catenin module scores.Similarly, intrinsic subtyping of the metastases provided statistically significant post-relapse survival information with the worst survival outcome in the basal-like [hazard ratio (HR) 3.7; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3-10.9] and HER2-enriched (HR 4.4; 95% CI 1.5-12.8) subtypes compared with the luminal A subtype.Overall, 25% of the metastases were basal-like, 32% HER2-enriched, 10% luminal A, 28% luminal B, and 5% normal-like.CONCLUSIONS: We show that tumor characteristics and molecular subtypes of breast cancer metastases significantly influence post-relapse patient survival, emphasizing that molecular investigations at relapse provide prognostic and clinically relevant information.CLINICALTRIALS.GOV: This is the translational part of the Swedish multicenter and randomized trial TEX, clinicaltrials.gov identifier nct01433614 (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct01433614).",0,0,0,0

25525672,"Comparing effects in regular practice of e-communication and Web-based self-management support among breast cancer patients: preliminary results from a randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: While Web-based interventions have been shown to assist a wide range of patients successfully in managing their illness, few studies have examined the relative contribution of different Web-based components to improve outcomes.Further efficacy trials are needed to test the effects of Web support when offered as a part of routine care.OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to compare in regular care the effects of (1) an Internet-based patient provider communication service (IPPC), (2) WebChoice, a Web-based illness management system for breast cancer patients (IPPC included), and (3) usual care on symptom distress, anxiety, depression, (primary outcomes), and self-efficacy (secondary outcome).This study reports preliminary findings from 6 months' follow-up data in a 12-month trial.METHODS: We recruited 167 patients recently diagnosed with breast cancer and undergoing treatment from three Norwegian hospitals.The nurse-administered IPPC allowed patients to send secure e-messages to and receive e-messages from health care personnel at the hospital where they were treated.In addition to the IPPC, WebChoice contains components for symptom monitoring, tailored information and self-management support, a diary, and communication with other patients.A total of 20 care providers (11 nurses, 6 physicians, and 3 social workers) were trained to answer questions from patients.Outcomes were measured with questionnaires at study entry and at study months 2, 4, and 6.Linear mixed models for repeated measures were fitted to compare effects on outcomes over time.RESULTS: Patients were randomly assigned to the WebChoice group (n=64), the IPPC group (n=45), or the usual care group (n=58).Response rates to questionnaires were 73.7% (123/167) at 2 months, 65.9 (110/167) at 4 months, and 62.3% (104/167) at 6 months.Attrition was similar in all study groups.Among those with access to WebChoice, 64% (41/64) logged on more than once and 39% (25/64) sent e-messages to care providers.In the IPPC group, 40% (18/45) sent e-messages.Linear mixed models analyses revealed that the WebChoice group reported significantly lower symptom distress (mean difference 0.16, 95% CI 0.06-0.25, P=.001), anxiety (mean difference 0.79, 95% CI 0.09-1.49, P=.03), and depression (mean difference 0.79, 95% CI 0.09-1.49, P=.03) compared with the usual care group.The IPPC group reported significant lower depression scores compared with the usual care group (mean difference 0.69, 95% CI 0.05-1.32, P=.03), but no differences were observed for symptom distress or anxiety.No significant differences in self-efficacy were found among the study groups.CONCLUSIONS: In spite of practice variations and moderate use of the interventions, our results suggest that offering Web support as part of regular care can be a powerful tool to help patients manage their illness.Our finding that a nurse-administered IPPC alone can significantly reduce depression is particularly promising.However, the multicomponent intervention WebChoice had additional positive effects.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov:NCT00971009; http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00971009 (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/6USKezP0Y).",0,0,0,0
25533223,"Quantification of coronary artery calcium in nongated CT to predict cardiovascular events in male lung cancer screening participants: results of the NELSON study.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the incremental prognostic value of the number and maximum volume of coronary artery calcifications over modified Agatston score strata, age, pack-years, and smoking status for predicting cardiovascular events.METHODS: A total of 3559 male current and former smokers received a CT examination for lung cancer screening.Smoking characteristics, patient demographics, and physician-diagnosed cardiovascular events were collected.Images were acquired without electrocardiography gating on 16-slice CT scanners.The association between the presence of both fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events and the predictors was quantified using Cox proportional hazard analysis.RESULTS: Median follow-up period was 2.9 years.Incident cardiovascular events occurred in 186 participants.Adjusted hazard ratios for modified Agatston score strata of 1 to 10, 11 to 100, 101 to 400, and >400 were 3.39 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20-9.59), 6.52 (95% CI, 2.73-15.60), 6.58 (95% CI, 2.75-15.78), and 12.58 (95% CI, 5.42-29.16), respectively.Moreover, comparing the models with and without modified Agatston score strata to the model with age, pack-years, and smoking status yielded a significantly better net reclassification improvement (NRI; 27.3%; P < .0001).Adding the number of calcifications to the model with age, pack-years, smoking status, and modified Agatston score strata resulted in a slightly better NRI (1.68%; P = .0490) with a hazard ratio of 1.13 (95% CI, 1.05-1.21) per 10 calcifications.The incremental prognostic information contained in the volume of the largest calcification was not statistically significant (NRI, 0.14%; P = .3458).CONCLUSION: Cardiovascular event rate increased with higher numbers of calcified lesions.The number but not maximum volume of calcifications has independent, although minimal, prognostic value over age, pack-years, smoking status, and modified Agatston score strata in our population.",0,0,0,0

25547902,"Intercalated Dosing Schedule of Erlotinib and Docetaxel as a Therapeutic Strategy to Avoid Antagonism and Optimize Its Benefits in Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer. A Randomized Phase II Clinical Trial.INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to assess whether an intercalated dosing schedule of erlotinib and docetaxel could avoid possible negative interactions and optimize the benefit obtained as second-line therapy in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A phase II randomized clinical trial was designed for advanced NSCLC patients in whom previous chemotherapy treatment had failed.The experimental arm with 33 patients consisted of erlotinib 150 mg/d orally, intermittent administration on days 2 to 16 every 21 days, combined with docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) every 21 days; the control arm with 35 patients consisted of erlotinib 150 mg/d orally, administered continuously.The study's primary end point was the proportion of patients who remained progression-free at 6 months in the 2 arms.RESULTS: The proportion of patients who remained progression-free at 6 months was of 5 patients (15%) in the intercalated arm and 3 patients (9%) in the erlotinib monotherapy arm respectively.Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 3.0 versus 2.1 months (hazard ratio [HR], 0.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.39-1.06; P = .086).Median overall survival (OS) was 7.5 and 5.2 months (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.41-1.19; P = .19).Disease control rates were 51.7% and 36.4%, respectively.No new safety signals were observed.CONCLUSION: Erlotinib and docetaxel with intermittent administration of erlotinib improved PFS, OS, and disease control rates compared with erlotinib alone.All of our results indicated that an intercalated dosing schedule of erlotinib and docetaxel could be more efficient than erlotinib treatment alone.Therefore, further studies should be developed in a larger number of patients.This study has shown the absence of antagonism between docetaxel and erlotinib when given in an intercalated fashion.",0,0,0,0
25556611,"Improved patient functioning after treatment of breakthrough cancer pain: an open-label study of fentanyl buccal tablet in patients with cancer pain.PURPOSE: This open-label study evaluated the effects of fentanyl buccal tablet (FBT) on functioning and mood in cancer patients with breakthrough cancer pain (BTcP).METHODS: Opioid-tolerant patients in seven European countries with up to four BTcP episodes/day received FBT doses (100-800 mug) identified during open-label titration to treat up to eight BTcP episodes during an open-label treatment period.In countries where FBT was not commercially available, patients could enter an open-label continuation phase.Functionality and satisfaction assessments included change from baseline to the end of the treatment period in the modified Brief Pain Inventory (BPI-7S) seven-item interference subscale, patient's global assessment of satisfaction and ease of use, and Patient's Global Impression of Change (PGIC).Safety was also assessed.RESULTS: Of 330 randomized patients, 218 completed the treatment period and 88 entered the continuation phase.Median background pain intensity was 4.0 (mild) throughout the study.After the treatment period, mean (SD) global modified BPI-7S score improved from 39.7 (15.9) at baseline to 31.6 (16.8) for a mean change of -8.6 (95% confidence interval CI -10.5, -6.7; P < 0.0001), and 74.5% of patients reported improvement in overall status (PGIC) compared with 25.5% who reported no change or worsening (P < 0.001).Treatment-related adverse events (>/=2 patients) during the continuation phase were application site erythema (6.9%), application site swelling (4.6%), and vertigo (4.6%).CONCLUSIONS: FBT may improve patient functioning, mood, and overall satisfaction in the management of BTcP.

25557266,"Intermittent Chemotherapy as a Platform for Testing Novel Agents in Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Department of Defense Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Consortium Randomized Phase II Trial of Intermittent Docetaxel With Prednisone With or Without Maintenance GM-CSF.BACKGROUND: Immunotherapy with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), an agent that previously demonstrated antitumor activity, was evaluated within an intermittent chemotherapy framework of docetaxel with prednisone (D+P) in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).PATIENTS AND METHODS: mCRPC patients with >/= 50% prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline after 6 cycles of D+P were randomized to either GM-CSF or observation (Obs).At disease progression (PD), D+P was reinitiated for 6 cycles followed by the same ""off chemotherapy"" regimen in patients eligible for chemotherapy interruption.The sequence was repeated until PD during chemotherapy, lack of PSA response to chemotherapy, or unacceptable toxicity.The primary end point was time to chemotherapy resistance (TTCR).RESULTS: Of 125 patients enrolled, 52 (42%) experienced >/= 50% PSA decline on induction D+P and were randomized to GM-CSF (n = 27) or Obs (n = 25).The median time to PD was 3.3 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.4-3.5) and 1.5 months (95% CI, 1.5-2.4) during the initial course of GM-CSF and Obs, respectively.Twelve of 26 (46%) patients responded to a second course of D+P. Eleven randomized patients (21%) experienced PD during chemotherapy, precluding accurate assessment of TTCR.The remaining 41 randomized patients discontinued study for lack of PSA response to chemotherapy (n = 8), patient choice to not restart chemotherapy with PSA PD (n = 13), toxicity (n = 7), or study withdrawal (n = 13).CONCLUSION: Conducting a prospective study in mCRPC with maintenance immunotherapy within the framework of intermittent chemotherapy was feasible.The use of PSA instead of radiographic end points limited the number of evaluable patients.This study provides important insight into designing contemporary intermittent chemotherapy trials with maintenance immunotherapy in patients with advanced prostate cancer.",0,0,0,0

25581207,"Colorectal adenomas and diabetes: implications for disease prevention.AIM: This study assessed the baseline type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) risk status among overweight patients with screen-detected colorectal adenomas and explored the implications of the findings for preventative practice.METHOD: Participants aged between 50 and 74 years (73% of whom were men) were recruited from four Scottish health boards and assessed for diabetes risk.Participants were categorized as at 'high' diabetes risk if glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) was between 6.0 and 6.4% or fasting plasma glucose (FPG) was between 5.5 and 6.9 mmol/l and as potentially undiagnosed T2DM when HbA1c >/= 6.5% or FPG >/= 7 mmol/l.Secondary outcome measures included anthropometric measurements, blood pressure and the plasma lipid profile.The tests were repeated at 12 months and diabetes risk categories were reassessed following intervention procedures.RESULTS: Forty-seven (14.3%) of the 329 participants had a preexisting diagnosis of T2DM.Of the remainder with complete biochemistry results (n = 250), 19 (7.6%) were classified as having potentially undiagnosed T2DM and 125 (50.0%) as being at high risk of developing diabetes.More than a quarter of participants in all categories had raised waist circumference, hypertension and plasma lipids, indicative of raised cardiovascular risk.At 12 months' follow-up, the diabetes risk category diminished in 20% of the intervention group vs 11% in the controls [OR 2.26 (95% CI 1.03-4.96)].CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that a diagnosis of adenoma in overweight patients provides a health service opportunity for diabetes assessment, prevention and management in a high-risk population at a potentially teachable moment.",0,0,0,0
25582141,"Prognostic factors of survival in a randomized phase III trial (MPACT) of weekly nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine versus gemcitabine alone in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.BACKGROUND: nab-Paclitaxel in combination with gemcitabine has emerged as a new treatment option for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer (MPC), based on superiority over gemcitabine demonstrated in the phase III MPACT trial.Previously, Karnofsky performance status (KPS) score and the presence of liver metastases were shown to be predictive of survival with nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine treatment.This analysis sought to further explore the relationship between clinical characteristics and survival in the MPACT trial and to identify potential predictors of overall survival and progression-free survival in patients with MPC.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cox regression models adjusted for stratification factors and a stepwise multivariate analysis of prespecified baseline prognostic factors were performed.RESULTS: Treatment effect was significantly associated with survival, with a similar magnitude of reduction in risk of death compared with the previously reported primary analysis.Treatment effect consistently favored nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine across the majority of the prespecified factors.In addition to KPS score and presence of liver metastases, age and number of metastatic sites were independent prognostic factors of overall and progression-free survival.Baseline carbohydrate antigen 19-9 was not found to be an independent prognostic factor of survival in this analysis.CONCLUSION: The results of this analysis confirm broad utility of nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine for the treatment of MPC.In addition, these findings suggest that KPS score, presence of liver metastases, age, and number of metastatic sites are important predictors of survival that may be useful when making treatment decisions and designing future clinical trials.",0,0,0,0
25596266,"The genotype of MLH1 identifies a subgroup of follicular lymphoma patients who do not benefit from doxorubicin: FIL-FOLL study.Though most follicular lymphoma biomarkers rely on tumor features, the host genetic background may also be relevant for outcome.Here we aimed at verifying the contribution of candidate polymorphisms of FCgamma receptor, DNA repair and detoxification genes to prognostic stratification of follicular lymphoma treated with immunochemotherapy.The study was based on 428 patients enrolled in the FOLL05 prospective trial that compared three standard-of-care regimens (rituximab-cyclophosphamide-vincristine-prednisone versus rituximab-cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-vincristine-prednisone versus rituximab-fludarabine-mitoxantrone) for the first line therapy of advanced follicular lymphoma.Polymorphisms were genotyped on peripheral blood DNA samples.The primary endpoint was time to treatment failure.Polymorphisms of FCGR2A and FCGR3A, which have been suggested to influence the activity of rituximab as a single agent, did not affect time to treatment failure in the pooled analysis of the three FOLL05 treatment arms that combined rituximab with chemotherapy (P=0.742, P=0.252, respectively).These results were consistent even when the analysis was conducted by intention to treat, indicating that different chemotherapy regimens and loads did not interact differentially with the FCGR2A and FCGR3A genotypes.The genotype of MLH1, which regulates the genotoxic effect of doxorubicin, significantly affected time to treatment failure in patients in the rituximab-cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-vincristine-prednisone arm (P=0.001; q<0.1), but not in arms in which patients did not receive doxorubicin (i.e., the rituximab-cyclophosphamide-vincristine-prednisone and rituximab-fludarabine-mitoxantrone arms).The impact of MLH1 on time to treatment failure was independent after adjusting for the Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index and other potential confounding variables by multivariate analysis.These data indicate that MLH1 genotype is a predictor of failure to benefit from rituximab-cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-vincristine-prednisone treatment in advanced follicular lymphoma and confirm that FCGR2A and FCGR3A polymorphisms have no impact when follicular lymphoma is treated with rituximab plus chemotherapy (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT00774826).",0,0,0,0
25604851,"Randomized multicenter phase III study of a modified docetaxel and cisplatin plus fluorouracil regimen compared with cisplatin and fluorouracil as first-line therapy for advanced or locally recurrent gastric cancer.BACKGROUND: The V325 study showed that docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil (DCF) prolonged overall survival (OS) of patients with advanced gastric cancer, but with a high incidence of dose-limiting toxicities.We investigated the efficacy and safety of a modified DCF (mDCF) regimen for Chinese patients with advanced gastric cancer.METHODS: Untreated advanced gastric cancer patients randomly received docetaxel and cisplatin at 60 mg/m(2) (day 1) followed by fluorouracil at 600 mg/m(2)/day (days 1-5; mDCF regimen) or cisplatin at 75 mg/m(2) (day 1) followed by fluorouracil at 600 mg/m(2)/day (days 1-5; CF) every 3 weeks.The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS).The secondary end points were OS, overall response rate (ORR), time-to-treatment failure (TTF), and safety.RESULTS: In total, 243 patients were randomized to treatment (mDCF regimen 121; CF 122).Compared with CF, the mDCF regimen significantly improved PFS and OS: the median PFS was 7.2 and 4.9 months, respectively [hazard ratio (HR) 0.58, log-rank P = 0.0008], and the median OS was 10.2 and 8.5 months, respectively (HR = 0.71, P = 0.0319).Additionally, the mDCF regimen improved the parameters used as secondary objectives: the ORR was 48.7% with the mDCF regimen versus 33.9% with CF (P = 0.0244); the median TTF was 3.4 months with the mDCF regimen and 2.4 months with CF (HR = 0.67, P = 0.0027).Grade 3 and grade 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 77.3 % of patients who received the mDCF regimen versus 46.1% of patients who received CF (P < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: The mDCF regimen, compared with CF, significantly prolonged PFS and OS and enhanced ORR of Chinese patients with advanced gastric cancer.The mDCF regimen achieved efficacy comparable to that of DCF but with fewer toxicities, which is appropriate for the Chinese population.",1,1,1,0

25683204,"Prostate cancer screening using risk stratification based on a multi-state model of genetic variants.BACKGROUND: Risk-stratified screening for prostate cancer (PCa) with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing incorporating genetic variants has received some attention but has been scarcely investigated.We developed a model to stratify the Finnish population by different risk profiles related to genetic variants to optimize the screening policy.METHODS: Data from the Finnish randomized controlled trial on screening for PCa with PSA testing were used to estimate a six-state Markov model of disease progression.Blood samples from Finnish men were used to assess the risk of PCa related to three genetic variants (rs4242382, rs138213197, and rs200331695).A risk score-based approach combined with a series of computer simulation models was applied to optimize individual screening policies.RESULTS: The 10-year risk of having progressive prostate cancer detected ranged from 43% in the top 5% risk group to approximately 11% in the bottom half of the population.Using the median group, with screening every four years beginning at 55 years-old, as the reference group, the recommended age beginning screening was approximately 47 years-old for the top 5% risk group and 55 years-old for those in the lower 60% risk group.The recommended interscreening interval has been shortened for individuals in the high risk group.The increased availability of genomic information allows the proposed multistate model to be more discriminating with respect to risk stratification and the suggested screening policy, particularly for the lowest risk groups-. -- CONCLUSIONS: A multi-state genetic variant-based model was developed for further application to population risk stratification to optimize the interscreening interval and the age at which to begin screening for PSA.A small sub-group of the population is likely to benefit from more intensive screening with early start and short interval, while half of the population is unlikely to benefit from such protocol (compared with four-year interval after age 55 years).",0,0,0,0
25688512,"Rationale and protocol of the MetNET-1 trial, a prospective, single center, phase II study to evaluate the activity and safety of everolimus in combination with octreotide LAR and metformin in patients with advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.Abnormal PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway signalling and autocrine activation of the mTOR pathway, mediated through insulin-like growth factor-1, have been implicated in the proliferation of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (pNET) cells.Everolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, has shown antitumor benefit in pNETs alone and in combination with octreotide LAR in RADIANT-1 and RADIANT-3 studies.Although everolimus-based phase II/III trials have improved progression-free survival for pNET, its use has not impacted on prolonging overall survival.Metformin has recently shown some anti-cancer activity in both in vitro and in vivo studies by its indirect properties to decrease insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels and by its antitumour effect to promote AMPK activation and consequently inhibition to TSC1-2/mTOR complex.In light of even more retrospective evidence of metformin's anticancer activity, a prospective evaluation is required to either confirm or discard these preliminary findings.With the aim to evaluate the antiproliferative effect of metformin in combination with everolimus and octreotide LAR in pancreatic well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor patients, a single arm, prospective, single center phase II study was designed (MetNET-1 trial, NCT 02294006).Forty-three patients are expected to be evaluated.The study is ongoing, and recruitment is estimated to be completed in August 2016.The results will be anticipated in 2017.",0,0,0,0

25795410,"Nivolumab versus chemotherapy in patients with advanced melanoma who progressed after anti-CTLA-4 treatment (CheckMate 037): a randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Nivolumab, a fully human IgG4 PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor antibody, can result in durable responses in patients with melanoma who have progressed after ipilimumab and BRAF inhibitors.We assessed the efficacy and safety of nivolumab compared with investigator's choice of chemotherapy (ICC) as a second-line or later-line treatment in patients with advanced melanoma.METHODS: In this randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 3 trial, we recruited patients at 90 sites in 14 countries.Eligible patients were 18 years or older, had unresectable or metastatic melanoma, and progressed after ipilimumab, or ipilimumab and a BRAF inhibitor if they were BRAF(V 600) mutation-positive.Participating investigators randomly assigned (with an interactive voice response system) patients 2:1 to receive an intravenous infusion of nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks or ICC (dacarbazine 1000 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks or paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2) combined with carboplatin area under the curve 6 every 3 weeks) until progression or unacceptable toxic effects.We stratified randomisation by BRAF mutation status, tumour expression of PD-L1, and previous best overall response to ipilimumab.We used permuted blocks (block size of six) within each stratum.Primary endpoints were the proportion of patients who had an objective response and overall survival.Treatment was given open-label, but those doing tumour assessments were masked to treatment assignment.We assessed objective responses per-protocol after 120 patients had been treated with nivolumab and had a minimum follow-up of 24 weeks, and safety in all patients who had had at least one dose of treatment.The trial is closed and this is the first interim analysis, reporting the objective response primary endpoint.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01721746.FINDINGS: Between Dec 21, 2012, and Jan 10, 2014, we screened 631 patients, randomly allocating 272 patients to nivolumab and 133 to ICC.Confirmed objective responses were reported in 38 (31.7%, 95% CI 23.5-40.8) of the first 120 patients in the nivolumab group versus five (10.6%, 3.5-23.1) of 47 patients in the ICC group.Grade 3-4 adverse events related to nivolumab included increased lipase (three [1%] of 268 patients), increased alanine aminotransferase, anaemia, and fatigue (two [1%] each); for ICC, these included neutropenia (14 [14%] of 102), thrombocytopenia (six [6%]), and anaemia (five [5%]).We noted grade 3-4 drug-related serious adverse events in 12 (5%) nivolumab-treated patients and nine (9%) patients in the ICC group.No treatment-related deaths occurred.INTERPRETATION: Nivolumab led to a greater proportion of patients achieving an objective response and fewer toxic effects than with alternative available chemotherapy regimens for patients with advanced melanoma that has progressed after ipilimumab or ipilimumab and a BRAF inhibitor.Nivolumab represents a new treatment option with clinically meaningful durable objective responses in a population of high unmet need.FUNDING: Bristol-Myers Squibb.",1,1,1,1
25800242,"Development and validation of a clinical score for predicting risk of adenoma at screening colonoscopy.BACKGROUND: Currently, no clinical tools use demographic and risk factor information to predict the risk of finding an adenoma in individuals undergoing colon cancer screening.Such a tool would be valuable for identifying those who would most benefit from screening colonoscopy.METHODS: We used baseline data from men and women who underwent screening colonoscopy from the randomized, multicenter National Colonoscopy Study (NCS) to develop and validate an adenoma risk model.The study, conducted at three sites in the United States (Minneapolis, MN; Seattle, WA; and Shreveport, LA) asked all participants to complete baseline questionnaires on clinical risk factors and family history.Model parameters estimated from logistic regression yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROCC) used to assess prediction.RESULTS: Five hundred forty-one subjects were included in the development model, and 1,334 in the validation of the risk score.Variables in the prediction of adenoma risk for colonoscopy screening were age (likelihood ratio test for overall contribution to model, P < 0.001), male sex (P < 0.001), body mass index (P < 0.001), family history of at least one first-degree relative with colorectal cancer (P = 0.036), and smoking history (P < 0.001).The adjusted AUROCC of 0.67 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.61-0.74] for the derivation cohort was not statistically significantly different from that in the validation cohort.The adjusted AUROCC for the entire cohort was 0.64 (95% CI, 0.60-0.67).CONCLUSION: We developed and validated a simple well-calibrated risk score.IMPACT: This tool may be useful for estimating risk of adenomas in screening eligible men and women.",0,0,0,0
25808375,"Immunoprofiling for prognostic assessment of colon cancer: a novel complement to ultrastaging.BACKGROUND: Although AJCC/TNM staging remains the gold standard for prognostic assessment of colon cancer, stage-specific outcomes vary.We therefore prospectively evaluated the prognostic role of immunoprofiling.METHODS: Our cohort included 35 patients from an ongoing prospective trial of ultrastaging for colon cancer.Specimens were analyzed for T cell markers (CD3, CD4, CD8, and FoxP3).The number of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes was analyzed at the tumor's margin and center and correlated with AJCC/TNM stage, clinicopathologic variables, and disease-free survival.RESULTS: There was a significant inverse association between number of CD3(+) cells in the tumor center and tumor stage (P = 0.05).The tumor center/margin ratio of CD3(+) cells also showed an inverse but non-significant relationship with nodal involvement (P = 0.07).Body mass index was inversely associated with numbers of CD3(+)(P = 0.04) and CD8(+)(P = 0.02) cells.Longer disease-free survival was correlated with higher CD8+ counts (P = 0.07), lower CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratios (P = 0.008), and higher CD8(+)/FoxP3(+) ratios (P = 0.02).CONCLUSIONS: This is the first prospective validation of immunoprofiling in patients whose colon cancer is staged with strict surgical and pathology quality measures.The apparent correlation between immunophenotypic response and clinical outcome warrants evaluation in a larger prospective trial.",0,0,0,0
25813447,"A Phase II Study of Pazopanib in Patients with Localized Renal Cell Carcinoma to Optimize Preservation of Renal Parenchyma.PURPOSE: Preservation of renal function is prioritized during surgical management of localized renal cell carcinoma.VEGF targeted agents can downsize tumors in metastatic renal cell carcinoma and may do the same in localized renal cell carcinoma, allowing for optimal preservation of renal parenchyma associated with partial nephrectomy.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Localized clear cell renal cell carcinoma patients meeting 1 or both of the following criteria were enrolled in a prospective phase II trial, including radical or partial nephrectomy likely to yield a glomerular filtration rate of less than 30 ml/minute/1.73 m(2), or partial nephrectomy high risk due to high complexity (R.E.N.A.L. 10 to 12) or tumor adjacent to hilar vessels.Pazopanib (800 mg once daily) was administered for 8 to 16 weeks with repeat imaging at completion of therapy, followed by surgery.RESULTS: A total of 25 patients enrolled with a median tumor size of 7.3 cm and a median R.E.N.A.L. score of 11.Of index lesions 80% were high complexity and 56% of patients had a solitary kidney.Patients received a median of 8 weeks of pazopanib.The median interval from treatment start to surgery was 10.6 weeks.R.E.N.A.L. score decreased in 71% of tumors and 92% of patients experienced a reduction in tumor volume.Six of 13 patients for whom partial nephrectomy was not possible at baseline were able to undergo partial nephrectomy after treatment.The mean parenchymal volume that could be saved with surgery increased from an estimated 107 to 173 cc (p = 0.0015).In 5 patients a urine leak developed, which was managed conservatively, and 7 received a transfusion, of whom 1 required embolization.CONCLUSIONS: Neoadjuvant pazopanib resulted in downsizing localized renal cell carcinoma, allowing for improved preservation of renal parenchyma and enabling partial nephrectomy in a select subset of patients who would otherwise require radical nephrectomy.",0,0,0,0
25823791,"Randomized Trial of Studer Pouch versus T-Pouch Orthotopic Ileal Neobladder in Patients with Bladder Cancer.PURPOSE: The need to prevent reflux in the construction of an orthotopic ileal neobladder is controversial.We designed the USC-STAR trial to determine whether the T-pouch neobladder that included an antireflux mechanism was superior to the Studer pouch in patients with bladder cancer undergoing radical cystectomy.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This single center, randomized, controlled trial recruited patients with clinically nonmetastatic bladder cancer scheduled to undergo radical cystectomy with neobladder.Eligible patients were randomly assigned to undergo T-pouch or Studer ileal orthotopic neobladder.Treatment assignment was not masked.The primary end point was change in renal function from baseline to 3 years.The CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) equation was used to calculate the estimated glomerular filtration rate.RESULTS: Between February 2002 and November 2009, 237 patients were randomly assigned to T-pouch ileal orthotopic neobladder and 247 to Studer ileal orthotopic neobladder.Baseline characteristics did not differ between the groups.Between baseline and 3 years the estimated glomerular filtration rate decreased by 6.4 ml/minute/1.73 m(2) in the Studer group and 6.6 ml/minute/1.73 m(2) in the T-pouch group (p=0.35).Multivariable analysis showed that type of ileal orthotopic neobladder was not independently associated with 3-year renal function (p=0.63).However, baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate, age and urinary tract obstruction were independently associated with 3-year decline in renal function.Cumulative risk of urinary tract infection and overall late complications were not different between the groups, but the T-pouch was associated with an increased risk of secondary diversion related surgeries.CONCLUSIONS: T-pouch ileal orthotopic neobladder with an antireflux mechanism did not prevent a moderate reduction in renal function observed at 3 years compared to the Studer pouch, but did result in an increase in diversion related secondary surgical procedures.",0,0,0,0
25824556,"Effect of magnesium on functional outcome and paraclinical parameters of patients undergoing supratentorial craniotomy for brain tumors: a randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Several studies have demonstrated that magnesium (Mg) plays an important role in the prevention and treatment of central nervous system (CNS) insults.In this study, we tested the effect of intravenous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) on the outcome of patients with brain tumors who underwent craniotomy.The outcome was defined clinically as the Barthel index score and paraclinically as blood levels of NSE (neuron-specific enloase) and S100Beta protein.METHODS: Sixty patients were randomly divided into two groups of 30 patients: the treatment and control groups.In the treatment group, 5 g of MgSO4 in normal saline was infused in 6 h 2 days before surgery, and the same dosage was repeated the day before and during surgery.The control group received placebo.Serum S100Beta and NSE concentrations were measured at baseline before administration of magnesium, before surgery, and on the 2nd postoperative day.The Barthel index score was evaluated and registered before surgery, 3, and 6 months after the operation.RESULTS: The study results showed a significant change in S100Beta protein levels before and after surgery (p < 0.05), but we could not find similar results for NSE protein and the Barthel index score.There was a correlation between NSE protein and the Barthel index.CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study revealed that administration of intravenous MgSO4 before and during surgery is safe and effective in reducing S100B protein levels in patients undergoing supratentorial craniotomy for brain tumors.Further studies to elucidate the pathophysiology of brain injuries and role of magnesium are warranted.",0,0,0,0

25873295,"An Exploratory Study of the Effects of Mind-Body Interventions Targeting Sleep on Salivary Oxytocin Levels in Cancer Survivors.Cancer survivors experience high levels of distress, associated with a host of negative psychological states, including anxiety, depression, and fear of recurrence, which often lead to sleep problems and reduction in quality of life (QOL) and well-being.As a neuropeptide hormone associated with affiliation, calmness, and well-being, oxytocin may be a useful biological measure of changes in health outcomes in cancer survivors.In this exploratory study, which comprised a subset of participants from a larger study, we evaluated (a) the feasibility and reliability of salivary oxytocin (sOT) levels in cancer survivors and (b) the effects of 2 sleep-focused mind-body interventions, mind-body bridging (MBB) and mindfulness meditation (MM), compared with a sleep hygiene education (SHE) control, on changes in sOT levels in 30 cancer survivors with self-reported sleep disturbance.Interventions were conducted in 3 sessions, once per week for 3 weeks.Saliva samples were collected at baseline, postintervention (~1 week after the last session), and at the 2-month follow-up.In this cancer survivor group, we found that intra-individual sOT levels were fairly stable across the 3 time points, of about 3 months' duration, and mean baseline sOT levels did not differ between females and males and were not correlated with age.Correlations between baseline sOT and self-report measures were weak; however, several of these relationships were in the predicted direction, in which sOT levels were negatively associated with sleep problems and depression and positively associated with cancer-related QOL and well-being.Regarding intervention effects on sOT, baseline-subtracted sOT levels were significantly larger at postintervention in the MBB group as compared with those in SHE.In this sample of cancer survivors assessed for sOT, at postintervention, greater reductions in sleep problems were noted for MBB and MM compared with that of SHE, and increases in mindfulness and self-compassion were observed in the MBB group compared with those in SHE.The findings in this exploratory study suggest that sOT may be a reliable biological measure over time that may provide insight into the effects of mind-body interventions on health outcomes in cancer survivors.",0,0,0,0
25881805,"The Impact of Husbands' Prostate Cancer Diagnosis and Participation in a Behavioral Lifestyle Intervention on Spouses' Lives and Relationships With Their Partners.BACKGROUND: A prostate cancer diagnosis affects the patient and his spouse.Partners of cancer patients are often the first to respond to the demands related to their husband's illness and thus are likely to be the most supportive individuals available to the patients.It is therefore important to examine how spouses react and handle their husband's prostate cancer diagnosis.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore how the prostate cancer diagnosis and the participation in their partners' behavioral lifestyle intervention program influenced the spouses' life, their relationship with their partner, and how they handle the situation.METHODS: Interviews were recorded with 8 spouses of potential low-risk prostate cancer patients on active surveillance as part of a clinical self-management lifestyle trial.RESULTS: We identified 3 phases that the spouses went through: feeling insecure about their situation, coping strategies to deal with these insecurities, and feeling reassured.CONCLUSIONS: The framework of a clinical trial should include mobilizing spousal empowerment so that they can take on an active and meaningful role in relation to their husband's disease.The observations here substantiate that the framework of active surveillance in combination with a lifestyle intervention in 1 specific prostate cancer clinical trial can mobilize spousal empowerment.IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Creating well-designed clinical patient programs that actively involve the spouse appears to promote empowerment (meaning, self-efficacy, positive impact, and self-determination) in spouses.Spousal participation in clinical patient programs can give spouses relief from anxieties while recognizing them as a vital support for their husband.",0,0,0,0

25887253,"3D vs 2D laparoscopic radical prostatectomy in organ-confined prostate cancer: comparison of operative data and pentafecta rates: a single cohort study.BACKGROUND: Currently, men are younger at the time of diagnosis of prostate cancer and more interested in less invasive surgical approaches (traditional laparoscopy, 3D-laparoscopy, robotics).Outcomes of continence, erectile function, cancer cure, positive surgical margins and complication are well collected in the pentafecta rate.However, no comparative studies between 4th generation 3D-HD vision system laparoscopy and standard bi-dimensional laparoscopy have been reported.This study aimed to compare the operative, perioperative data and pentafecta rates between 2D and 3D laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP) and to identify the actual role of 3D LRP in urology.METHODS: From October 2012 to July 2013, 86 patients with clinically localized prostate cancer [PCa: age </= 70 years, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) </= 10 ng/ml, biopsy Gleason score </= 7] underwent laparoscopic extraperitoneal radical prostatectomy (LERP) and were followed for approximately 14 months (range 12-25).Patients were selected for inclusion via hospital record data, and divided into two groups.Their patient records were then analyzed.Patients were randomized into two groups: the former 2D-LERP (43 pts) operated with the use of 2D-HD camera; the latter 3D-LERP (43 pts) operated with the use of a 3D-HD 4th generation view system.The operative and perioperative data and the pentafecta rates between 2D-LERP and 3D-LERP were compared.RESULTS: The overall pentafecta rates at 3 months were 47.4% and 49.6% in the 2D- and 3D-LERP group respectively.The pentafecta rate at 12 months was 62.7% and 67% for each group respectively.4th generation 3D-HD vision system provides advantages over standard bi-dimensional view with regard to intraoperative steps.Our data suggest a trend of improvement in intraoperative blood loss and postoperative recovery of continence with the respect of the oncological safety.CONCLUSIONS: Use of the 3D technology by a single surgeon significantly enhances the possibility of achieving better intraoperative results and pentafecta in all patients undergoing LERP.Potency was the most difficult outcome to reach after surgery, and it was the main factor leading to pentafecta failure.Nevertheless, further studies are necessary to better comprehend the role of 3D-LERP in modern urology.",0,0,0,0
25891302,"The effect, moderators, and mediators of resistance and aerobic exercise on health-related quality of life in older long-term survivors of prostate cancer.BACKGROUND: The current study examined effects, moderators (for whom), and mediators (working mechanisms) of 12 months of exercise on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in older long-term survivors of prostate cancer.METHODS: In total, 100 men aged 71.7 years (standard deviation, 6.4 years) were randomly assigned to 6 months of supervised aerobic and resistance exercise followed by 6 months of a home-based exercise maintenance program (EX group) or printed education material regarding physical activity for 12 months (PA group).Assessments took place at baseline and after 6 and 12 months.Generalized estimating equations were used to study the effects of EX versus PA on HRQoL at 6 and 12 months, adjusting for baseline HRQoL. The authors examined potential sociodemographic and clinical moderators by adding interaction terms, and potential physical and psychological mediators using the product-of-coefficients test.RESULTS: At 6 months, significant beneficial effects were found for global QoL, physical function, and social function in the EX group compared with the PA group.For physical function, beneficial effects were sustained at 12 months.Moderation analyses demonstrated larger effects of EX versus PA for patients who were married, started exercising sooner after their diagnosis, and previously used bisphosphonates.Changes in lower body functional performance significantly mediated the effect of EX on global QoL, physical function, and social function.No mediating effects on HRQoL were found for aerobic fitness, physical activity, fatigue, distress, or falls self-efficacy.CONCLUSIONS: Aerobic and resistance exercise appears to have beneficial effects on HRQoL among older, long-term survivors of prostate cancer.Effects were moderated by marital status, time since diagnosis, and use of bisphosphonates, and were mediated by lower body functional performance.",0,0,0,0

A randomized, controlled trial.OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate new regret scales and examine whether a decision aid affects different aspects of regret in the treatment choice for prostate cancer.METHODS: This was a multicentre trial (three sites) with imbalanced randomization (1 : 2).From 2008 to 2011, patients with localized prostate cancer were randomized 1 : 2 to usual care (N = 77) or usual care plus a decision aid presenting risks and benefits of different treatments (N = 163).The treatments were surgery and (external or interstitial) radiotherapy.Regret was assessed before, and 6 and 12 months after treatment, using the Decisional regret scale by Brehaut et al. (Medical Decision Making, 23, 2003, 281), and three new scales focusing on process, option and outcome regret.The relation between decision aid and regret was analysed by anova.RESULTS: The concurrent validity of the new regret scales was confirmed by correlations between regret and anxiety, depression, decision evaluation scales and health-related quality of life.With a decision aid, patient participation was increased (P = 0.002), but regret was not.If anything, in patients with serious morbidity the decision aid resulted in a trend to less option regret and less Brehaut regret (P = 0.075 and P = 0.061, with effect sizes of 0.35 and 0.38, respectively).Exploratory analyses suggest that high-risk patients benefitted most from the decision aid.CONCLUSION: The new regret scales may be of value in distinguishing separate aspects of regret.In general, regret was not affected by the decision aid.In patients with serious morbidity, a trend to lower option regret with a decision aid was observed.",0,0,0,0

25975523,"Analysis of incomplete excisions of basal-cell carcinomas after breadloaf microscopy compared with 3D-microscopy: a prospective randomized and blinded study.Basal-cell carcinomas may show irregular, asymmetric subclinical growth.This study analyzed the efficacy of 'breadloaf' microscopy (serial sectioning) and three-dimensional (3D) microscopy in detecting positive tumor margins.Two hundred eighty-three (283) tumors (51.2%) were put into the breadloaf microscopy group; 270 tumors (48.8%) into the 3D microscopy group.The position of any detected tumor outgrowths was identified in clock face fashion.The time required for cutting and embedding the specimens and the examination of the microscopic slides was measured.Patient/tumor characteristics and surgical margins did not differ significantly.Tumor outgrowths at the excision margin were found in 62 of 283 cases (21.9%) in the breadloaf microscopy group and in 115 of 270 cases (42.6%) in the 3D microscopy group, constituting a highly significant difference (p < 0.001).This difference held true with incomplete excision of fibrosing (infiltrative/sclerosing/morpheaform) tumors [32.9% in the breadloaf microscopy group and 57.5% in the 3D microscopy group (p = 0.003)] and also with solid (nodular) tumors [16.1 and 34.2%, respectively (p < 0.001)].The mean overall examination time required showed no important difference.In summary, for detection of tumor outgrowths, 3D microscopy has almost twice the sensitivity of breadloaf microscopy, particularly in the situation of aggressive/infiltrative carcinomas.",0,0,0,0
25990554,"The impact of DNA input amount and DNA source on the performance of whole-exome sequencing in cancer epidemiology.BACKGROUND: Whole-exome sequencing (WES) has recently emerged as an appealing approach to systematically study coding variants.However, the requirement for a large amount of high-quality DNA poses a barrier that may limit its application in large cancer epidemiologic studies.We evaluated the performance of WES with low input amount and saliva DNA as an alternative source material.METHODS: Five breast cancer patients were randomly selected from the Pathways Study.From each patient, four samples, including 3 mug, 1 mug, and 0.2 mug blood DNA and 1 mug saliva DNA, were aliquoted for library preparation using the Agilent SureSelect Kit and sequencing using Illumina HiSeq2500.Quality metrics of sequencing and variant calling, as well as concordance of variant calls from the whole exome and 21 known breast cancer genes, were assessed by input amount and DNA source.RESULTS: There was little difference by input amount or DNA source on the quality of sequencing and variant calling.The concordance rate was about 98% for single-nucleotide variant calls and 83% to 86% for short insertion/deletion calls.For the 21 known breast cancer genes, WES based on low input amount and saliva DNA identified the same set variants in samples from a same patient.CONCLUSIONS: Low DNA input amount, as well as saliva DNA, can be used to generate WES data of satisfactory quality.IMPACT: Our findings support the expansion of WES applications in cancer epidemiologic studies where only low DNA amount or saliva samples are available.",0,0,0,0

26063890,"Effect of Primary Letrozole Treatment on Tumor Expression of mTOR and HIF-1alpha and Relation to Clinical Response.INTRODUCTION: Recently the combination of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor everolimus and the aromatase inhibitor exemestane has been shown to double the progression-free survival rate in advanced breast cancer.However, the effect of the interrelated pathways of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) and mTOR signaling, both of which are associated with a more aggressive breast cancer phenotype and endocrine resistance, on response in the neoadjuvant setting is unknown.We, therefore, have investigated the influence of these pathways with the aim of better defining those patients most likely to benefit from an endocrine-based therapy associated with/without mTOR inhibitors.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 107 women with T2-4 N0-1 and estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer were randomly assigned to 6 months of primary letrozole (2.5 mg/daily) (LET) or LET plus oral ""metronomic"" cyclophosphamide (50mg/daily) (LET-CYC).Phospo-mTOR and HIF-1alpha were evaluated in tumor specimens collected before and after treatment using a tissue microarray format.RESULTS: LET-based therapy induced a downregulation of phospho-mTOR and HIF-1alpha expression (P = .0001 and P < .004, respectively).The reduction of HIF-1alpha expression observed was positively correlated with phospho-mTOR reduction (P < .03); however, no treatment interaction between the two proteins was detected.HIF-1alpha expression was significantly modulated by the treatment (P < .004) with a reduction both in the LET arm (45%, n = 36/80) (P = .05) and LET-CYC arm (55%, n = 44/80) (P = .04).HIF-1alpha reduction showed a relationship with clinical response confined in LET arm only (P < .03).CONCLUSIONS: In this neoadjuvant population, LET was able to modulate the phospho-mTOR and HIF-1alpha pathways and may define a subpopulation of nonresponders who may be most likely to benefit from mTOR inhibitors.",0,0,0,0
26070652,"Comparison of conventional L-thyroxine withdrawal and moderate hypothyroidism in preparation for whole-body 131-I scan and thyroglobulin testing.PURPOSE: After thyroidectomy for thyroid cancer, patients often withdraw L-T4 for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes, showing signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism.A slighter hypothyroidism (reducing L-T4 to one-half) has been proposed to limit these inconveniences.We evaluated half-dose L-T4 protocol, in comparison to conventional L-T4 withdrawal, in terms of effectiveness and improvement of clinical and biochemical disorders.METHODS: We randomized 55 thyroid cancer patients into two groups: 29 patients underwent 5 weeks of half-dose of previous L-T4 treatment (HD group); 26 patients replaced L-T4 with L-T3 for 3 weeks followed by 2 weeks of withdrawal (TW group).Clinical features (Zulewsky clinical score) and biochemical parameters (lipids, liver, and muscle enzymes) were evaluated in all patients at baseline and after 5 weeks.RESULTS: Total cholesterol, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase increased at 5 weeks in both groups, but significantly more in TW, but no difference was found by clinical score.Patients who achieved the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) target value (25 microU/ml) were 92.3% in TW group and 48.3% in HD group (p < 0.001).In the HD group, only basal TSH statistically correlated with the achievement of the TSH target.Receiver operating characteristic curves indicated that a basal TSH >/=0.52 muU/ml is required to reach an adequate TSH level.CONCLUSIONS: Half-dose L-T4 protocol, compared to conventional L-T4 withdrawal, is associated with less biochemical disorders but no significant clinical advantage.Therefore, the half-dose protocol reaches an adequate TSH target in 48.3% of patients and is not effective unless basal serum TSH is >/=0.52 muU/ml.",0,0,0,0

26095389,"Variations in survival and perioperative complications between hospitals based on data from two phase III clinical trials for oesophageal cancer.BACKGROUND: Variations in institutional practice may contribute to different outcomes of cancer treatment.The impact of interinstitutional heterogeneity on outcomes between hospitals after oesophagectomy has not been examined previously using data from surgical clinical trials.METHODS: The data from two phase III trials for oesophageal cancer were used.Japan Clinical Oncology Group (JCOG) 9204 involved oesophagectomy (92-OP) versus oesophagectomy plus postoperative chemotherapy (92-POST), with accrual from 1992 to 1997.JCOG9907 involved postoperative chemotherapy (99-POST) versus preoperative chemotherapy (99-PRE), with accrual from 2000 to 2006.Hospitals contributing fewer than three patients were excluded.The influence of time and preoperative chemotherapy on interinstitutional heterogeneity related to postoperative complications and 5-year overall survival were evaluated by comparisons within and between these trial groups.Heterogeneity was estimated by a mixed-effects model after adjusting for age, sex, performance status, location of the primary tumour and clinical stage.RESULTS: Twelve hospitals in 92-OP (114 patients), 13 in 92-POST (114), 19 in 99-POST (158) and 18 in 99-PRE (154) were eligible.There was considerable heterogeneity in predicted postoperative complications in both groups in JCOG9204 (median 31.3 (range 15.0-68.2) per cent), and in 99-PRE (35.2 (22.6-46.6) per cent) but not in 99-POST (27.7 (27.7-27.7) per cent) from JCOG9907.A similar pattern was seen for predicted overall survival (92-POST: 66.4 (range 64.1-68.9) per cent; 99-PRE: 55.9 (54.0-59.7) per cent; 99-POST: 44.4 (44.4-44.4) per cent).CONCLUSION: Interinstitutional heterogeneity regarding complications and survival after oesophagectomy is a problem that merits wider consideration.",0,0,0,0
26110667,"MR Imaging as an Additional Screening Modality for the Detection of Breast Cancer in Women Aged 50-75 Years with Extremely Dense Breasts: The DENSE Trial Study Design.Women with extremely dense breasts have an increased risk of breast cancer and lower mammographic tumor detectability.Nevertheless, in most countries, these women are currently screened with mammography only.Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has the potential to improve breast cancer detection at an early stage because of its higher sensitivity.However, MR imaging is more expensive and is expected to be accompanied by an increase in the number of false-positive results and, possibly, an increase in overdiagnosis.To study the additional value of MR imaging, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design is needed in which one group undergoes mammography and the other group undergoes mammography and MR imaging.With this design, it is possible to determine the proportion of interval cancers within each study arm.For this to be an effective screening strategy, the additional cancers detected at MR imaging screening must be accompanied by a subsequent reduction in interval cancers.The Dense Tissue and Early Breast Neoplasm Screening, or DENSE, trial is a multicenter RCT performed in the Dutch biennial population-based screening program (subject age range, 50-75 years).The study was approved by the Dutch Minister of Health, Welfare and Sport.In this study, mammographic density is measured by using a fully automated volumetric method.Participants with extremely dense breasts (American College of Radiology breast density category 4) and a negative result at mammography (Breast Imaging Recording and Data System category 1 or 2) are randomly assigned to undergo additional MR imaging (n = 7237) or to be treated according to current practice (n = 28 948).Participants provide written informed consent before the MR imaging examination, which consists of dynamic breast MR imaging with gadolinium-based contrast medium and is intended to be performed for three consecutive screening rounds.The primary outcome is the difference in the proportions of interval cancers between the study arms.Secondary outcomes are the number of MR imaging screening-detected cancers, proportions of false-positive results, diagnostic yield of MR imaging, tumor characteristics, quality of life, and cost effectiveness.",0,0,0,0

26188849,"Prevention of central venous catheter-associated bloodstream infections in paediatric oncology patients using 70% ethanol locks: A randomised controlled multi-centre trial.BACKGROUND: The prevention of central venous catheter (CVC) associated bloodstream infections (CABSIs) in paediatric oncology patients is essential.Ethanol locks can eliminate pathogens colonising CVCs and microbial resistance is rare.Aim of this study was to determine whether two hour 70% ethanol locks can reduce CABSI in paediatric oncology patients.METHODS: We conducted a randomised, double blind, multi-centre trial in paediatric oncology patients (1-18 years) with newly inserted CVCs.Patients were randomly assigned to receive two hour ethanol locks (1.5 or 3 ml 70%) or heparin locks (1.5 or 3 ml 100 IU/ml), whenever it was needed to use the CVC, maximum frequency once weekly.Primary outcomes were time to CABSI or death due to CABSI.RESULTS: We recruited 307 patients (ethanol, n=153; heparin, n=154).In the ethanol group, 16/153 (10%) patients developed a CABSI versus 29/154 (19%) in the heparin group.The incidence of CABSI was 0.77/1000 and 1.46/1000 catheter days respectively (p=0.039).The number-needed-to-treat was 13.No patients died of CABSI.In particular, Gram-positive CABSIs were reduced (ethanol, n=8; heparin, n=21; p=0.012).Fewer CVCs were removed because of CABSI in the ethanol group (p=0.077).The ethanol lock patients experienced significantly more transient symptoms compared to the heparin lock patients (maximum grade 2) (nausea, p=0.030; taste alteration, p<0.001; dizziness, p=0.001; blushing, p<0.001), no suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSAR) occurred.CONCLUSIONS: This is the first randomised controlled trial to show that ethanol locks can prevent CABSI in paediatric oncology patients, in particular CABSI caused by Gram-positive bacteria.Implementation of ethanol locks in clinical practice should be considered.",0,0,0,0
26198205,"Computed tomographic colonography compared with colonoscopy or barium enema for diagnosis of colorectal cancer in older symptomatic patients: two multicentre randomised trials with economic evaluation (the SIGGAR trials).BACKGROUND: Computed tomographic colonography (CTC) is a relatively new diagnostic test that may be superior to existing alternatives to investigate the large bowel.OBJECTIVES: To compare the diagnostic efficacy, acceptability, safety and cost-effectiveness of CTC with barium enema (BE) or colonoscopy.DESIGN: Parallel randomised trials: BE compared with CTC and colonoscopy compared with CTC (randomisation 2 : 1, respectively).SETTING: A total of 21 NHS hospitals.PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged >/= 55 years with symptoms suggestive of colorectal cancer (CRC).INTERVENTIONS: CTC, BE and colonoscopy.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: For the trial of CTC compared with BE, the primary outcome was the detection rate of CRC and large polyps (>/= 10 mm), with the proportion of patients referred for additional colonic investigation as a secondary outcome.For the trial of CTC compared with colonoscopy, the primary outcome was the proportion of patients referred for additional colonic investigation, with the detection rate of CRC and large polyps as a secondary outcome.Secondary outcomes for both trials were miss rates for cancer (via registry data), all-cause mortality, serious adverse events, patient acceptability, extracolonic pathology and cost-effectiveness.RESULTS: A total of 8484 patients were registered and 5384 were randomised and analysed (BE trial: 2527 BE, 1277 CTC; colonoscopy trial: 1047 colonoscopy, 533 CTC).Detection rates in the BE trial were 7.3% (93/1277) for CTC, compared with 5.6% (141/2527) for BE (p = 0.0390).The difference was due to better detection of large polyps by CTC (3.6% vs. 2.2%; p = 0.0098), with no significant difference for cancer (3.7% vs. 3.4%; p = 0.66).Significantly more patients having CTC underwent additional investigation (23.5% vs. 18.3%; p = 0.0003).At the 3-year follow-up, the miss rate for CRC was 6.7% for CTC (three missed cancers) and 14.1% for BE (12 missed cancers).Significantly more patients randomised to CTC than to colonoscopy underwent additional investigation (30% vs. 8.2%; p < 0.0001).There was no significant difference in detection rates for cancer or large polyps (10.7% for CTC vs. 11.4% for colonoscopy; p = 0.69), with no difference when cancers (p = 0.94) and large polyps (p = 0.53) were analysed separately.At the 3-year follow-up, the miss rate for cancer was nil for colonoscopy and 3.4% for CTC (one missed cancer).Adverse events were uncommon for all procedures.In 1042 of 1748 (59.6%) CTC examinations, at least one extracolonic finding was reported, and this proportion increased with age (p < 0.0001).A total of 149 patients (8.5%) were subsequently investigated, and extracolonic neoplasia was diagnosed in 79 patients (4.5%) and malignancy in 29 (1.7%).In the short term, CTC was significantly more acceptable to patients than BE or colonoscopy.Total costs for CTC and colonoscopy were finely balanced, but CTC was associated with higher health-care costs than BE.The cost per large polyp or cancer detected was pound4235 (95% confidence interval pound395 to pound9656).CONCLUSIONS: CTC is superior to BE for detection of cancers and large polyps in symptomatic patients.CTC and colonoscopy detect a similar proportion of large polyps and cancers and their costs are also similar.CTC precipitates significantly more additional investigations than either BE or colonoscopy, and evidence-based referral criteria are needed.Further work is recommended to clarify the extent to which patients initially referred for colonoscopy or BE undergo subsequent abdominopelvic imaging, for example by computed tomography, which will have a significant impact on health economic estimates.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN95152621.",0,0,0,0

26200278,"Cabazitaxel Versus Topotecan in Patients with Small-Cell Lung Cancer with Progressive Disease During or After First-Line Platinum-Based Chemotherapy.INTRODUCTION: Patients with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) typically respond well to initial chemotherapy.However, relapse invariably occurs, and topotecan, the only approved second-line treatment option, has limited efficacy.Taxanes have activity in SCLC, and cabazitaxel is a second-generation taxane with potential for enhanced activity in chemorefractory malignancies.METHODS: Patients with SCLC who relapsed after initial platinum-based chemotherapy were randomly assigned to receive cabazitaxel 25 mg/m every 21 days or topotecan 1.5 mg/m on days 1-5 every 21 days.Two patient subgroups, defined by chemosensitive and chemo-resistant/refractory disease, were assessed in combination and separately.RESULTS: The safety profile of cabazitaxel and topotecan was consistent with previous studies, and despite considerable toxicity in both arms, no new safety concerns were identified.Patients receiving cabazitaxel had inferior progression-free survival compared with topotecan (1.4 versus 3.0 months, respectively; two-sided p < 0.0001; hazard ratio = 2.17, 95% confidence interval = 1.563-3.010), and results were similar in both the chemosensitive and chemorefractory subgroups.No complete responses were observed in either arm, and no partial responses were observed in the cabazitaxel group.The partial response rate in the topotecan arm was 10%.Median overall survival was 5.2 months in the cabazitaxel arm and 6.8 months in the topotecan arm (two-sided p = 0.0125; hazard ratio = 1.57, 95% confidence interval = 1.10-2.25).CONCLUSION: Cabazitaxel, a next-generation taxane, had inferior efficacy when compared with standard-dose topotecan in the treatment of relapsed SCLC.Topotecan remains a suboptimal therapy, and continued efforts to develop improved second-line treatments are warranted.",0,0,0,0
26202595,"Randomized phase II study evaluating veliparib (ABT-888) with temozolomide in patients with metastatic melanoma.BACKGROUND: Veliparib (ABT-888) is a potent, orally bioavailable, small-molecule inhibitor of the DNA repair enzymes poly ADP-ribose polymerase-1 and -2.Veliparib enhances the efficacy of temozolomide (TMZ) and other cytotoxic agents in preclinical tumor models.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this multicenter, double-blind trial, adults with unresectable stage III or IV metastatic melanoma were randomized 1:1:1 to TMZ plus veliparib 20 or 40 mg, or placebo twice daily.Efficacy end points included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and objective response rate (ORR).RESULTS: Patients (N = 346) were randomized between February 2009 and January 2010.Median [95% confidence interval (CI)] PFS was 3.7 (3.0-5.5), 3.6 (1.9-4.1), and 2 (1.9-3.7) months in the 20-mg, 40-mg, and placebo arms, respectively.Median (95% CI) OS was 10.8 (9.0-13.1), 13.6 (11.4-15.9), and 12.9 (9.8-14.3) months, respectively; ORR was 10.3%, 8.7%, and 7.0%.Exploratory analyses showed patients with low ERCC1 expression had longer PFS when TMZ was combined with veliparib.Toxicities were as expected for TMZ.The frequencies of thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and leukopenia were significantly increased in the veliparib groups.Grade 3 or 4 adverse events, mainly hematologic toxicities, were seen in 55%, 63%, and 41% of patients in the 20-mg, 40-mg, and placebo arms, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Median PFS with 20 and 40 mg veliparib almost doubled numerically compared with placebo, but the improvements did not reach statistical significance.OS was not increased with veliparib.Toxicities were similar to TMZ monotherapy, but with increased frequency.",1,1,1,0
26209642,"Value of KRAS as prognostic or predictive marker in NSCLC: results from the TAILOR trial.BACKGROUND: The prognostic and predictive role of KRAS mutations in advanced nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is still unclear.TAILOR prospectively assessed the prognostic and predictive value of KRAS mutations in NSCLC patients treated with erlotinib or docetaxel in second line.PATIENTS AND METHODS: NSCLC patients from 52 Italian hospitals were genotyped for KRAS and EGFR mutational status in two independent laboratories.Wild-type EGFR patients (N = 218) received first-line platinum-based chemotherapy and were randomly allocated at progression to erlotinib or docetaxel.Overall survival (OS) according to KRAS mutational status was the primary end point.RESULTS: KRAS mutations were present in 23% of TAILOR randomized cases.The presence of a KRAS mutation did not adversely affect progression-free (PFS) or overall (OS) survival [hazard ratio (HR) PFS = 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71-1.41, P = 0.977; OS = 1.24, 95% CI 0.87-1.77, P = 0.233], nor influenced treatment outcome (test for interaction: OS P = 0.965; PFS P = 0.417).Patients randomized to docetaxel treatment experienced longer survival independently from the KRAS mutational status of their tumors (HR: mutated KRAS 0.81, 95% CI 0.45-1.47; wild-type KRAS 0.79, 95% CI 0.57-1.10).CONCLUSION: In TAILOR, KRAS was neither prognostic nor predictive of benefit for either docetaxel or erlotinib.Docetaxel remains superior independently from KRAS status for second-line treatment in EGFR wild-type advanced NSCLC patients.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT00637910.",0,0,0,0
26214630,"Important prognostic factors for the long-term survival in non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with combination of chemotherapy and conformal radiotherapy.PURPOSE: Combined modality therapy is standard of care for patients with unresectable locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), however, insufficient data exist regarding prognostic factors in this disease setting.METHODS: To evaluate the treatment results and prognostic variables, 85 NSCLC patients treated from October 2005 to April 2008 were randomly assigned to one of the two treatment arms.In the first arm (sequential arm), 45 patients received sequential chemotherapy with 4 cycles of carboplatin and etoposide followed by conformal 3-dimensional (3D) radiotherapy (RT).In the second arm (concurrent arm), 40 patients received concomitant chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide and conformal RT, followed by two cycles of consolidation chemotherapy with carboplatin and etoposide.RESULTS: The median survival was 13 months for the patients in the sequential arm and 19 months for those in the concurrent treatment arm (p=0.0039).The disease-free survival (DFS) was 9 months in the sequential arm and 16 months in the concurrent treatment arm (p=0.0023).The following prognostic factors significantly influenced the survival of the patients treated with combination of RT and chemotherapy: age (p<0.05), performance status (PS) (p<0.001), weight loss (p<0.001), tumor size (p<0.05), nodal involvement (p<0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Given the higher toxicity in the second arm, this should be reserved for younger patients (<70 years), having good PS and minimal weight loss.We highly recommend precise stage and prognostic factors definitions in such patients so that they receive the most beneficial treatment.",0,0,0,0
26243048,"Targeted percutaneous microwave ablation at the pulmonary lesion combined with mediastinal radiotherapy with or without concurrent chemotherapy in locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer evaluation in a randomized comparison study.Concurrent chemoradiotherapy is the standard treatment for patients with locally advanced lung cancer.The most common dose-limiting adverse effect of thoracic radiotherapy (RT) is radiation pneumonia (RP).A randomized comparison study was designed to investigate targeted percutaneous microwave ablation at pulmonary lesion combined with mediastinal RT with or without chemotherapy (ablation group) in comparison with RT (target volume includes pulmonary tumor and mediastinal node) with or without chemotherapy (RT group) for the treatment of locally advanced non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs).From 2009 to 2012, patients with stage IIIA or IIIB NSCLCs who refused to undergo surgery or were not suitable for surgery were enrolled.Patients were randomly assigned to the RT group (n = 47) or ablation group (n = 51).Primary outcomes were the incidence of RP and curative effectiveness (complete response, partial response, and stable disease); secondary outcome was the 2-year overall survival (OS).Fifteen patients (31.9%) in the RT and two (3.9%) in the ablation group experienced RP (P < 0.001).The ratio of effective cases was 85.1 versus 80.4% for mediastinal lymph node (P = 0.843) and 83.0 versus 100% for pulmonary tumors (P = 0.503), respectively, for the RT and ablation groups.Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated 2-year OS rate of NSCLC patients in ablation group was higher than RT group, but no statistical difference (log-rank test, P = 0.297).Percutaneous microwave ablation followed by RT for inoperable stage III NSCLCs may result in a lower rate of RP and better local control than radical RT treatments.",0,0,0,0
26250474,"Prospective study of DNA methylation at LINE-1 and Alu in peripheral blood and the risk of prostate cancer.BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that global blood DNA methylation levels may be associated with the risk of various cancers, but no studies have evaluated this relationship for prostate cancer.METHODS: We used pyrosequencing to quantify DNA methylation levels at the long interspersed nuclear element 1 (LINE-1) and Alu repetitive elements in pre-diagnostic blood samples from 694 prostate cancer cases and 703 controls from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial.We evaluated prostate cancer risk associated with the mean methylation level for each element using logistic regression, adjusting for potential confounders.RESULTS: We did not observe a significant association with prostate cancer for LINE-1 [odds ratio (OR) for the highest compared to the lowest quartile = 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.73-1.39, Ptrend = 0.99] or Alu (OR = 0.94, 95% CI: 0.68-1.29, Ptrend = 0.69) methylation levels overall.However, for Alu, we observed that higher DNA methylation levels were associated with a significant increased risk for those diagnosed 4 or more years after blood draw (OR = 2.26, 95% CI: 1.27-4.00, Ptrend = 4.4 x 10(-3) ).In contrast, there was no association for those diagnosed 2 (OR = 1.13, 95% CI: 0.67-1.90, Ptrend = 0.64) or 3 years after draw (OR = 1.22, 95% CI: 0.71-2.07, Ptrend = 0.32), and a decreased risk for those diagnosed less than 2 years after draw (OR = 0.40, 95% CI: 0.25-0.65, Ptrend = 3.8 x 10(-5) ; Pheterogeneity = 5.3 x 10(-6) ).CONCLUSIONS: Although LINE-1 DNA methylation levels were not associated with prostate cancer, we observed an association for Alu that varied by time from blood draw to diagnosis.Our study suggests that elevated Alu blood DNA methylation levels several years before diagnosis may be associated with an increased prostate cancer risk.",0,0,0,0

26325671,"Validation of International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grading for prostatic adenocarcinoma in thin core biopsies using TROG 03.04 'RADAR' trial clinical data.In 2014 a consensus conference convened by the International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) adopted amendments to the criteria for Gleason grading and scoring (GS) for prostatic adenocarcinoma.The meeting defined a modified grading system based on 5 grading categories (grade 1, GS 3+3; grade 2, GS 3+4; grade 3, GS 4+3; grade 4, GS 8; grade 5, GS 9-10).In this study we have evaluated the prognostic significance of ISUP grading in 496 patients enrolled in the TROG 03.04 RADAR Trial.There were 19 grade 1, 118 grade 2, 193 grade 3, 88 grade 4 and 79 grade 5 tumours in the series, with follow-up for a minimum of 6.5 years.On follow-up 76 patients experienced distant progression of disease, 171 prostate specific antigen (PSA) progression and 39 prostate cancer deaths.In contrast to the 2005 modified Gleason system (MGS), the hazards of the distant and PSA progression endpoints, relative to grade 2, were significantly greater for grades 3, 4 and 5 of the 2014 ISUP grading scheme.Comparison of predictive ability utilising Harrell's concordance index, showed 2014 ISUP grading to significantly out-perform 2005 MGS grading for each of the three clinical endpoints.",0,0,0,0
26364885,"The influence of gastric filling instructions on dose delivery in patients with oesophageal cancer: A prospective study.PURPOSE: To evaluate whether adaptive radiotherapy for unaccounted stomach changes in patients with adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) is necessary and whether dose differences could be prevented by giving patients food and fluid instructions before treatment simulation and radiotherapy.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty patients were randomly assigned into two groups: patients with and without instructions about restricting food and fluid intake prior to radiotherapy simulation and treatment.Redelineation and offline recalculation of dose distributions based on cone-beam computed tomography (n=100) were performed.Dose-volume parameters were analysed for the clinical target volume extending into the stomach.RESULTS: Four patients who did not receive instructions had a geometric miss (0.7-12 cm(3)) in only one fraction.With instructions, 3 out of 10 patients had a geometric miss (0.1-1.9 cm(3)) in one (n=2) or two (n=1) fractions.The V95% was reduced by more than 5% for one patient, but this underdosage was in an in-air region without further clinical importance.CONCLUSIONS: Giving patients food and fluid instructions for the treatment of GEJ cancer offers no clinical benefit.Using a planning target volume margin of 1cm implies that there is no need for adaptive radiotherapy for GEJ tumours.",0,0,0,0
26371143,"Efficacy and Safety of Trabectedin or Dacarbazine for Metastatic Liposarcoma or Leiomyosarcoma After Failure of Conventional Chemotherapy: Results of a Phase III Randomized Multicenter Clinical Trial.PURPOSE: This multicenter study, to our knowledge, is the first phase III trial to compare trabectedin versus dacarbazine in patients with advanced liposarcoma or leiomyosarcoma after prior therapy with an anthracycline and at least one additional systemic regimen.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive trabectedin or dacarbazine intravenously every 3 weeks.The primary end point was overall survival (OS), secondary end points were disease control-progression-free survival (PFS), time to progression, objective response rate, and duration of response-as well as safety and patient-reported symptom scoring.RESULTS: A total of 518 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to either trabectedin (n = 345) or dacarbazine (n = 173).In the final analysis of PFS, trabectedin administration resulted in a 45% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death compared with dacarbazine (median PFS for trabectedin v dacarbazine, 4.2 v 1.5 months; hazard ratio, 0.55; P < .001); benefits were observed across all preplanned subgroup analyses.The interim analysis of OS (64% censored) demonstrated a 13% reduction in risk of death in the trabectedin arm compared with dacarbazine (median OS for trabectedin v dacarbazine, 12.4 v 12.9 months; hazard ratio, 0.87; P = .37).The safety profiles were consistent with the well-characterized toxicities of both agents, and the most common grade 3 to 4 adverse effects were myelosuppression and transient elevation of transaminases in the trabectedin arm.CONCLUSION: Trabectedin demonstrates superior disease control versus conventional dacarbazine in patients who have advanced liposarcoma and leiomyosarcoma after they experience failure of prior chemotherapy.Because disease control in advanced sarcomas is a clinically relevant end point, this study supports the activity of trabectedin for patients with these malignancies.",0,0,0,0

26438237,"The effects of short-term fasting on tolerance to (neo) adjuvant chemotherapy in HER2-negative breast cancer patients: a randomized pilot study.BACKGROUND: Preclinical evidence shows that short-term fasting (STF) protects healthy cells against side effects of chemotherapy and makes cancer cells more vulnerable to it.This pilot study examines the feasibility of STF and its effects on tolerance of chemotherapy in a homogeneous patient group with early breast cancer (BC).METHODS: Eligible patients had HER2-negative, stage II/III BC.Women receiving (neo)-adjuvant TAC (docetaxel/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide) were randomized to fast 24 h before and after commencing chemotherapy, or to eat according to the guidelines for healthy nutrition.Toxicity in the two groups was compared.Chemotherapy-induced DNA damage in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was quantified by the level of gamma-H2AX analyzed by flow cytometry.RESULTS: Thirteen patients were included of whom seven were randomized to the STF arm.STF was well tolerated.Mean erythrocyte- and thrombocyte counts 7 days post-chemotherapy were significantly higher (P = 0.007, 95 % CI 0.106-0.638 and P = 0.00007, 95 % CI 38.7-104, respectively) in the STF group compared to the non-STF group.Non-hematological toxicity did not differ between the groups.Levels of gamma-H2AX were significantly increased 30 min post-chemotherapy in CD45 + CD3- cells in non-STF, but not in STF patients.CONCLUSIONS: STF during chemotherapy was well tolerated and reduced hematological toxicity of TAC in HER2-negative BC patients.Moreover, STF may reduce a transient increase in, and/or induce a faster recovery of DNA damage in PBMCs after chemotherapy.Larger studies, investigating a longer fasting period, are required to generate more insight into the possible benefits of STF during chemotherapy.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01304251 , March 2011.",1,1,1,0
26442791,"Shared Medical Decision Making in Lung Cancer Screening: Experienced versus Descriptive Risk Formats.BACKGROUND: Annual lung cancer screening using low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) scans is associated with a survival benefit, but it is also associated with potential harm.Unlike descriptive probability formats, experienced tasks have been shown to decrease perceptions of rare events.The objective of this study was to compare descriptive versus experienced probability formats on patients' knowledge, beliefs, endorsement of screening for heavy smokers, and preference (choice predisposition) to undergo screening.METHODS: A total of 276 patients attending an outpatient pulmonary practice were randomized to learn about screening using 1 of 3 formats: numbers only, numbers + icon arrays, numbers + a set of slides illustrating LDCT scans of 250 people in random order that displayed the number of normal scans, false-positive lung nodules, cancers found leading to a life saved, and cancers found leading to death despite treatment.RESULTS: Knowledge differed between the 3 formats (P= 0.001), with participants randomized to the numbers + icon array format having the highest knowledge score.Beliefs were more favorable among participants randomized to the numbers + experienced format compared with the numbers + icon array format (difference between means [95% confidence interval]= 1.6 [0.4-2.8]).Differences in participants' endorsement of screening (P= 0.4) and choice predisposition (P= 0.6) across probability format mirrored those of beliefs but were not statistically significant.DISCUSSION: Contrary to what we expected, the experienced format increased propensity toward screening compared with the numbers + icon array format, as indicated by more favorable beliefs and nonsignificant trends toward stronger choice predisposition and endorsement.Experienced risk formats may not be a practical approach to improve risk communication for patients deciding whether or not to undergo annual lung cancer screening.",0,0,0,0

26474517,"Cediranib combined with carboplatin and paclitaxel in patients with metastatic or recurrent cervical cancer (CIRCCa): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial.BACKGROUND: Patients treated with standard chemotherapy for metastatic or relapsed cervical cancer respond poorly to conventional chemotherapy (response achieved in 20-30% of patients) with an overall survival of less than 1 year.High tumour angiogenesis and high concentrations of intratumoural VEGF are adverse prognostic features.Cediranib is a potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor of VEGFR1, 2, and 3.In this trial, we aimed to assess the effect of the addition of cediranib to carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy in patients with metastatic or recurrent cervical cancer.METHODS: In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial, which was done in 17 UK cancer treatment centres, patients aged 18 years or older initially diagnosed with metastatic carcinoma or who subsequently developed metastatic disease or local pelvic recurrence after radical treatment that was not amenable to exenterative surgery were recruited.Eligible patients received carboplatin AUC of 5 plus paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2) by infusion every 3 weeks for a maximum of six cycles and were randomised centrally (1:1) through a minimisation approach to receive cediranib 20 mg or placebo orally once daily until disease progression.The stratification factors were disease site, disease-free survival after primary therapy or primary stage IVb disease, number of lines of previous treatment, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, and investigational site.All patients, investigators, and trial personnel were masked to study drug allocation.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival.Efficacy analysis was by intention to treat, and the safety analysis included all patients who received at least one dose of study drug.This trial is registered with the ISCRTN registry, number ISRCTN23516549, and has been completed.FINDINGS: Between Aug 19, 2010, and July 27, 2012, 69 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to cediranib (n=34) or placebo (n=35).After a median follow-up of 24.2 months (IQR 21.9-29.5), progression-free survival was longer in the cediranib group (median 8.1 months [80% CI 7.4-8.8]) than in the placebo group (6.7 months [6.2-7.2]), with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.58 (80% CI 0.40-0.85; one-sided p=0.032).Grade 3 or worse adverse events that occurred in the concurrent chemotherapy and trial drug period in more than 10% of patients were diarrhoea (five [16%] of 32 patients in the cediranib group vs one [3%] of 35 patients in the placebo group), fatigue (four [13%] vs two [6%]), leucopenia (five [16%] vs three [9%]), neutropenia (10 [31%] vs four [11%]), and febrile neutropenia (five [16%] vs none).The incidence of grade 2-3 hypertension was higher in the cediranib group than in the control group (11 [34%] vs four [11%]).Serious adverse events occurred in 18 patients in the placebo group and 19 patients in the cediranib group.INTERPRETATION: Cediranib has significant efficacy when added to carboplatin and paclitaxel in the treatment of metastatic or recurrent cervical cancer.This finding was accompanied by an increase in toxic effects (mainly diarrhoea, hypertension, and febrile neutropenia).FUNDING: Cancer Research UK and AstraZeneca.",0,0,0,0
26475066,"Optimizing Radiation Therapy Quality Assurance in Clinical Trials: A TROG 08.03 RAVES Substudy.PURPOSE: To explore site- and clinician-level factors associated with protocol violations requiring real-time-review (RTR) resubmission in a multicenter clinical trial to help tailor future quality assurance (QA) protocols.METHODS AND MATERIALS: RAVES (Radiation Therapy-Adjuvant vs Early Salvage) (Trans-Tasman Radiation Oncology Group 08.03) is a randomized trial comparing adjuvant with early salvage radiation therapy in men with positive surgical margins or pT3 disease after prostatectomy.Quality assurance in RAVES required each clinician and site to submit a credentialing dummy run (DR) and for each patient's radiation therapy plan to undergo external RTR before treatment.Prospectively defined major violations from trial protocol required remedy and resubmission.Site and clinician factors associated with RTR resubmission were examined using hierarchical modeling.RESULTS: Data were collected from 171 consecutive patients, treated by 46 clinicians at 32 hospitals.There were 47 RTR resubmissions (27%) due to 65 major violations.The relative rate of resubmission decreased by 29% per year as the study progressed (odds ratio OR.0.71, P=.02).The majority of resubmissions were due to contouring violations (39 of 65) and dosimetric violations (22 of 65).For each additional patient accrued, significant decreases in RTR resubmission were seen at both clinician level (OR 0.75, P=.02) and site level (OR 0.72, P=.01).The rate of resubmission due to dosimetric violations was only 1.6% after the first 5 patients.Use of IMRT was associated with lower rates of resubmission compared with 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (OR 0.38, P=.05).CONCLUSION: Several low- and high-risk factors that may assist with tailoring future clinical trial QA were identified.Because the real-time resubmission rate was largely independent of the credentialing exercise, some form of RTR QA is recommended.The greatest benefit from QA was derived early in trial activation and clinician experience.",0,0,0,0
26487588,"Early initiation of chemotherapy following complete resection of advanced ovarian cancer associated with improved survival: NRG Oncology/Gynecologic Oncology Group study.BACKGROUND: To determine whether time from surgery to initiation of chemotherapy impacts survival in advanced ovarian carcinoma.PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a post-trial ad hoc analysis of Gynecologic Oncology Group protocol 218, a phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to study the antiangiogenesis agent, bevacizumab, in primary and maintenance therapy for patients with newly diagnosed advanced ovarian carcinoma.Maximum attempt at debulking was an eligibility criterion.Stage III patients, not stage IV, were required to have gross macroscopic or palpable residual disease following surgery.The survival impact of time from surgery to initiation of chemotherapy was studied using Cox regression models and stratified by treatment arm, residual disease and other clinical and pathologic factors.RESULTS: One thousand seven hundred eighteen assessable patients were randomized (stage III (n = 1237); stage IV (n = 477), including those with complete resection (stage IV only, n = 81), low-volume residual (</=1 cm, n = 701), and suboptimal (>1 cm, n = 932).On multivariate analysis, time to chemotherapy initiation was predictive of overall survival (P < 0.001), with the complete resection group (i.e. stage IV) encountering an increased risk of death when time to initiation of chemotherapy exceeded 25 days (95% confidence interval 16.6-49.9 days).CONCLUSION: Survival for women with advanced ovarian cancer may be adversely affected when initiation of chemotherapy occurs >25 days following surgery.Our analysis applies to stage IV only as women with stage III who underwent complete resection were not eligible for this trial.These results, however, are consistent with Gompertzian first-order kinetics where patients with microscopic residual are most vulnerable.CLINICAL TRIALS IDENTIFIER: NCT00262847.",0,0,0,0
26502987,"School-based brief psycho-educational intervention to raise adolescent cancer awareness and address barriers to medical help-seeking about cancer: a cluster randomised controlled trial.OBJECTIVES: Raising cancer awareness and addressing barriers to help-seeking may improve early diagnosis.The aim was to assess whether a psycho-educational intervention increased adolescents' cancer awareness and addressed help-seeking barriers.METHODS: This was a cluster randomised controlled trial involving 2173 adolescents in 20 schools.The intervention was a 50-min presentation delivered by a member of Teenage Cancer Trust's (UK charity) education team.Schools were stratified by deprivation and roll size and randomly allocated to intervention/control conditions within these strata.Outcome measures were the number of cancer warning signs and cancer risk factors recognised, help-seeking barriers endorsed and cancer communication.Communication self-efficacy and intervention fidelity were also assessed.RESULTS: Regression models showed significant differences in the number of cancer warning signs and risk factors recognised between intervention and control groups.In intervention schools, the greatest increases in recognition of cancer warning signs at 6-month follow-up were for unexplained weight loss (from 44.2% to 62.0%) and change in the appearance of a mole (from 46.3% to 70.7%), up by 17.8% and 24.4%, respectively.Greatest increases in recognition of cancer risk factors were for getting sunburnt more than once as a child (from 41.0% to 57.6%) and being overweight (from 42.7% to 55.5%), up by 16.6% and 12.8%, respectively.Regression models showed that adolescents in intervention schools were 2.7 times more likely to discuss cancer at 2-week follow-up compared with the control group.No differences in endorsement of barriers to help-seeking were observed.CONCLUSIONS: School-based brief psycho-educational interventions are easy to deliver, require little resource and improve cancer awareness.(c) 2015 The Authors.Psycho-Oncology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",0,0,0,0

26581577,"Proposal of supervised data analysis strategy of plasma miRNAs from hybridisation array data with an application to assess hemolysis-related deregulation.BACKGROUND: Plasma miRNAs have the potential as cancer biomarkers but no consolidated guidelines for data mining in this field are available.The purpose of the study was to apply a supervised data analysis strategy in a context where prior knowledge is available, i.e., that of hemolysis-related miRNAs deregulation, so as to compare our results with existing evidence.RESULTS: We developed a structured strategy with innovative applications of existing bioinformatics methods for supervised analyses including: 1) the combination of two statistical (t- and Anderson-Darling) test results to detect miRNAs with significant fold change or general distributional differences in class comparison, which could reveal hidden differential biological processes worth to be considered for building predictive tools; 2) a bootstrap selection procedure together with machine learning techniques in class prediction to guarantee the transferability of results and explore the interconnections among the selected miRNAs, which is important for highlighting their inherent biological dependences.The strategy was applied to develop a classifier for discriminating between hemolyzed and not hemolyzed plasma samples, defined according to a recently published hemolysis score.We identified five miRNAs with increased expression in hemolyzed plasma samples (miR-486-5p, miR-92a, miR-451, miR-16, miR-22).CONCLUSIONS: We identified four miRNAs previously reported in the literature as hemolysis related together with a new one (miR-22).which needs further investigations.Our findings confirm the validity of the proposed strategy and, in parallel, the hemolysis score capability to be used as pre-analytic hemolysis detector.R codes for implementing the approaches are provided.",0,0,0,0
26585118,"Aspirin Reduces Plasma Concentrations of the Oncometabolite 2-Hydroxyglutarate: Results of a Randomized, Double-Blind, Crossover Trial.BACKGROUND: Aspirin use is an effective strategy for the chemoprevention of colorectal cancer, even at low doses.However, in order to implement aspirin interventions, risk-benefit balances and biologic mechanisms need to be better defined; to further this aim, we used a metabolomics approach.METHODS: We metabolically profiled 40 healthy, nonsmoking men and women ages 20 to 45 years enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, crossover trial of 325 mg aspirin/day over a period of 60 days.Gas and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry were used to comprehensively profile participants' plasma samples after aspirin and placebo interventions.RESULTS: A total of 363 metabolites, covering most human biochemical pathways, were measured.Compared with placebo-treated participants, plasma concentrations of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (R+S) decreased after aspirin treatment in both men and women (P = 0.005).This signal proved robust during 20-fold random splitting of the data using 80% of the samples in each split.We subsequently performed functional follow-up studies using targeted, enantiospecific detection in human colorectal cancer cell lines and observed an aspirin-induced reduction of (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate.We further showed that salicylate, the primary aspirin metabolite, inhibits the hydroxyacid-oxoacid transhydrogenase mediated production of (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate, thereby providing mechanistic evidence for the clinically observed effects of aspirin on total-2-hydroxyglutarate.CONCLUSIONS: Using a metabolomics approach with functional follow-up, we propose that a decrease in the oncometabolite (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate may identify an additional mechanism for aspirin or its metabolites in cancer prevention.IMPACT: Reduction of the oncometabolite (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate identifies a novel, non-COX-inhibition-mediated mechanism of aspirin.",0,0,0,0

26714164,"Influence of tumour burden on trastuzumab pharmacokinetics in HER2 positive non-metastatic breast cancer.AIMS: Trastuzumab, an antibody binding to epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), has been approved to treat HER2-positive breast cancer in different settings.This study aimed at evaluating the influence of tumour size on trastuzumab pharmacokinetics (PK) in non-metastatic breast cancer patients treated with short term pre-operative trastuzumab.METHODS: Trastuzumab PK data were obtained from a multicentre, randomized and comparative study.This antibody was administered pre-operatively to patients with localized HER2-positive breast cancer as a single 4 mg kg(-1) loading dose followed by 5 weekly 2 mg kg(-1) doses.Trastuzumab concentrations were measured repeatedly using an ELISA technique.Tumour size was evaluated at baseline using breast echography.Trastuzumab pharmacokinetics were studied using a population approach and a two compartment model.The influence of tumour burden on trastuzumab pharmacokinetics was quantified as a covariate.RESULTS: A total of 784 trastuzumab concentrations were available from the 79 eligible patients.Estimated parameters (interindiviual standard deviation) were central volume of distribution =2.1 l (23%), peripheral volume of distribution =1.3 l (38%), intercompartment clearance =0.36 l day(-1) , with an elimination half-life of 11.8 days.Typical clearance was 0.22 l day(-1) (19%) and its value was increased with tumour size.In patients with the highest tumour size, trastuzumab clearance was 50% [18%-92%] higher than in patients with the lowest tumour size.CONCLUSIONS: In non-metastatic breast cancer patients, trastuzumab clearance increases with tumour size.The elimination half-life of trastuzumab was shorter in the present population of patients than in metastatic breast cancer patients previously studied.",0,0,0,0
26714372,"EFFECTS OF COMPRESSION ON LYMPHEDEMA DURING RESISTANCE EXERCISE IN WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER-RELATED LYMPHEDEMA: A RANDOMIZED, CROSS-OVER TRIAL.The use of compression garments during exercise is recommended for women with breast cancer-related lymphedema, but the evidence behind this clinical recommendation is unclear.The aim of this randomized, cross-over trial was to compare the acute effects of wearing versus not wearing compression during a single bout of moderate-load resistance exercise on lymphedema status and its associated symptoms in women with breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL).Twenty-five women with clinically diagnosed, stable unilateral breast cancer-related lymphedema completed two resistance exercise sessions, one with compression and one without, in a randomized order separated by a minimum 6 day wash-out period.The resistance exercise session consisted of six upper-body exercises, with each exercise performed for three sets at a moderate-load (10-12 repetition maximum).Primary outcome was lymphedema, assessed using bioimpedance spectroscopy (L-Dex score).Secondary outcomes were lymphedema as assessed by arm circumferences (percent inter-limb difference and sum-of-circumferences), and symptom severity for pain, heaviness and tightness, measured using visual analogue scales.Measurements were taken pre-, immediately post- and 24 hours post-exercise.There was no difference in lymphedema status (i.e., L-Dex scores) pre- and post-exercise sessions or between the compression and non-compression condition [Mean (SD) for compression pre-, immediately post- and 24 hours post-exercise: 17.7 (21.5), 12.7 (16.2) and 14.1 (16.7), respectively; no compression: 15.3 (18.3), 15.3 (17.8), and 13.4 (16.1), respectively].Circumference values and symptom severity were stable across time and treatment condition.An acute bout of moderate-load, upper-body resistance exercise performed in the absence of compression does not exacerbate lymphedema in women with BCRL.",0,0,0,0
26724840,"Role of Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Prostate Cancer Screening: A Pilot Study Within the Goteborg Randomised Screening Trial.BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and targeted biopsies (TB) have shown potential to more accurately detect significant prostate cancer compared with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and systematic biopsies (SB).OBJECTIVE: To compare sequential screening (PSA+MRI) with conventional PSA screening.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Of 384 attendees in the 10th screening round of the Goteborg randomised screening trial, 124 men, median age 69.5 yr, had a PSA of >/= 1.8 ng/ml and underwent a prebiopsy MRI.Men with suspicious lesions on MRI and/or PSA >/= 3.0ng/ml were referred for biopsy.SB was performed blinded to MRI results and TB was performed in men with tumour-suspicious findings on MRI.Three screening strategies were compared (PSA >/= 3.0+SB; PSA >/= 3.0+MRI+TB and PSA >/= 1.8+MRI+TB).OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Cancer detection rates, sensitivity, and specificity were calculated per screening strategy and compared using McNemar's test.RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: In total, 28 cases of prostate cancer were detected, of which 20 were diagnosed in biopsy-naive men.Both PSA >/= 3.0+MRI and PSA >/= 1.8+MRI significantly increased specificity compared with PSA >/= 3.0+SB (0.92 and 0.79 vs 0.52; p<0.002 for both), while sensitivity was significantly higher for PSA >/= 1.8+MRI compared with PSA >/= 3.0+MRI (0.73 vs 0.46, p=0.008).The detection rate of significant cancer was higher with PSA >/= 1.8+MRI compared with PSA >/= 3.0+SB (5.9% vs 4.0%), while the detection rate of insignificant cancer was lowered by PSA >/= 3.0+MRI (0.3% vs 1.2%).The primary limitation of this study is the small sample of men.CONCLUSION: A screening strategy with a lowered PSA cut-off followed by TB in MRI-positive men seems to increase the detection of significant cancers while improving specificity.If replicated, these results may contribute to a paradigm shift in future screening.PATIENT SUMMARY: Major concerns in prostate-specific antigen screening are overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis.We evaluated whether prostate magnetic resonance imaging could improve the balance of benefits to harm in prostate cancer screening screening, and we found a promising potential of using magnetic resonance imaging in addition to prostate-specific antigen.",0,0,0,0
26740194,"Effect of intranasal steroids on rhinosinusitis after radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma: clinical study.OBJECTIVE: Post-irradiation rhinosinusitis is one of the most common untoward side effects in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma.This study aimed to evaluate the effect of fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray on post-irradiation rhinosinusitis.METHODS: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients who had undergone radiotherapy and subsequently developed chronic rhinosinusitis were randomised to receive either fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray 200 microg plus nasal irrigation or a single nasal irrigation, for six months.A questionnaire, nasal endoscopy and computed tomography were used to evaluate rhinosinusitis severity, at the beginning of treatment, and at three and six months after treatment.RESULTS: The group who received fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray combined with irrigation had fewer nasal complaints (overall symptoms, blocked nose and headache were reduced), a better quality of life and less severe endoscopic findings than those who only received nasal irrigation at three and six months after treatment.CONCLUSION: Nasal steroids are a safe and effective therapy for patients with post-irradiation rhinosinusitis.",0,0,0,0
26761561,"Physical exercise for functional capacity, blood immune function, fatigue, and quality of life in high-risk prostate cancer patients during radiotherapy: a prospective, randomized clinical study.BACKGROUND: During radiotherapy (RT), prostate cancer (PCa) patients may report cancer related fatigue (CRF), which impairs functional capacity, psychological status, and quality of life (QoL).RT can induce cytokine responses that could play a role in mediating radiation toxicity by increasing inflammation.While it is known that physical exercise plays an important anti-inflammatory role in healthy adults, its specific anti-inflammatory effects in PCa patients with CRF have not yet been determined.AIM: Previous studies have shown that physical exercise in cancer patients undergoing RT improves cardiac fitness, muscle strength, and QoL, however it is still unknown how physical exercise affects inflammation and its specific consequences in PCa patients.Therefore, the purpose of this trial was to examine the effect of supervised physical exercise on inflammatory blood markers, as well as the relationship of these parameters with functional capacity, fatigue, and QoL in high-risk PCa patients undergoing RT.DESIGN: This was a prospective, two-arm randomized controlled clinical trial.SETTING: The study was performed in our outpatients center.POPULATION: Fifty-four high-risk PCa men were randomly allocated to two groups prior to undergoing RT.METHODS: Twenty-seven patients performed supervised, moderate-intensity physical exercise (exercise group; EG) and the other 27 formed a control group that carried out normal daily physical activity (usual group; UG).The following parameters were assessed before and after RT: functional capacity, changes in blood count variables and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL]-1beta, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha), fatigue, and QoL (using FACT-F score and EORTC questionnaires).RESULTS: No significant differences existed between the study groups at baseline assessment.After RT, there was a significant improvement in functional capacity (P<0.05) and a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokine levels (P>0.05) and fatigue (P<0.05) in the EG compared to the UG.Fatigue level was significantly higher in the UG (F[2.126]; P<0.05) after RT than before.Physical exercise had no effect on the correlation between inflammatory blood markers and functional capacity and fatigue scores provided by study participants.CONCLUSIONS: Regular, moderate-intensity physical exercise improves functional capacity, decreases the production of inflammatory markers and fatigue, and has a positive influence on QoL in high-risk PCa patients during RT.CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: This is one of the first studies to examine the effects of supervised exercise training on pro-inflammatory cytokine levels during RT in PCa patients by measuring functional capacity, fatigue, and QoL.",0,0,0,0

26803435,"Body mass index and age are additional prognostic factors in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors.PURPOSE: Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are the preferred treatment drugs for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC).The aim of this study was to analyze prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) in patients with mRCC treated with TKIs.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical data on 155 patients enrolled in 5 clinical trials conducted at our hospital from 2006 to 2014 were reviewed retrospectively.All patients received first-line TKI therapy (sunitinib, sorafenib, pazopanib, or famitinib).Survival rates were determined by the Kaplan-Meier method.RESULTS: Median OS (mOS) was 36.2 months.A total of 4 of the 5 adverse prognostic factors identified by the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) were found to be independent predictors of shorter survival, anemia, hypercalcemia, lactate dehydrogenase>1.5xupper limit of normal, and diagnosis to treatment time<1 year.In addition, we found that age</=45 years (P = 0.002), low or high body mass index ([BMI]<19 or>30kg/m(2)) (P = 0.003), and presence of>/=3 metastatic sites (P = 0.000) were also independent adverse prognostic factors.According to the MSKCC model, the mOS time in the favorable-risk, intermediate-risk, and poor-risk groups were 46.6, 30.4 and 16.7 months, respectively (P = 0.005).When we integrated age and BMI into the MSKCC model to set up a 7-factor prognostic model, we found the mOS time for these 3 groups was 71.1, 41.6 and 15.3 months, respectively (P = 0.000).CONCLUSION: Age and BMI are additional independent prognostic factors for patients with mRCC receiving vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-targeted TKI treatment, and the MSKCC prognostic model is also applicable to them.A 7-factor prognostic model might help to identify patients with the best prognosis.Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.",0,0,0,0
26822397,"Gastrectomy plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone for advanced gastric cancer with a single non-curable factor (REGATTA): a phase 3, randomised controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy is the standard of care for incurable advanced gastric cancer.Whether the addition of gastrectomy to chemotherapy improves survival for patients with advanced gastric cancer with a single non-curable factor remains controversial.We aimed to investigate the superiority of gastrectomy followed by chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone with respect to overall survival in these patients.METHODS: We did an open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial at 44 centres or hospitals in Japan, South Korea, and Singapore.Patients aged 20-75 years with advanced gastric cancer with a single non-curable factor confined to either the liver (H1), peritoneum (P1), or para-aortic lymph nodes (16a1/b2) were randomly assigned (1:1) in each country to chemotherapy alone or gastrectomy followed by chemotherapy by a minimisation method with biased-coin assignment to balance the groups according to institution, clinical nodal status, and non-curable factor.Patients, treating physicians, and individuals who assessed outcomes and analysed data were not masked to treatment assignment.Chemotherapy consisted of oral S-1 80 mg/m(2) per day on days 1-21 and cisplatin 60 mg/m(2) on day 8 of every 5-week cycle.Gastrectomy was restricted to D1 lymphadenectomy without any resection of metastatic lesions.The primary endpoint was overall survival, analysed by intention to treat.This study is registered with UMIN-CTR, number UMIN000001012.FINDINGS: Between Feb 4, 2008, and Sept 17, 2013, 175 patients were randomly assigned to chemotherapy alone (86 patients) or gastrectomy followed by chemotherapy (89 patients).After the first interim analysis on Sept 14, 2013, the predictive probability of overall survival being significantly higher in the gastrectomy plus chemotherapy group than in the chemotherapy alone group at the final analysis was only 13.2%, so the study was closed on the basis of futility.Overall survival at 2 years for all randomly assigned patients was 31.7% (95% CI 21.7-42.2) for patients assigned to chemotherapy alone compared with 25.1% (16.2-34.9) for those assigned to gastrectomy plus chemotherapy.Median overall survival was 16.6 months (95% CI 13.7-19.8) for patients assigned to chemotherapy alone and 14.3 months (11.8-16.3) for those assigned to gastrectomy plus chemotherapy (hazard ratio 1.09, 95% CI 0.78-1.52; one-sided p=0.70).The incidence of the following grade 3 or 4 chemotherapy-associated adverse events was higher in patients assigned to gastrectomy plus chemotherapy than in those assigned to chemotherapy alone: leucopenia (14 patients [18%] vs two [3%]), anorexia (22 [29%] vs nine [12%]), nausea (11 [15%] vs four [5%]), and hyponatraemia (seven [9%] vs four [5%]).One treatment-related death occurred in a patient assigned to chemotherapy alone (sudden cardiopulmonary arrest of unknown cause during the second cycle of chemotherapy) and one occurred in a patient assigned to chemotherapy plus gastrectomy (rapid growth of peritoneal metastasis after discharge 12 days after surgery).INTERPRETATION: Since gastrectomy followed by chemotherapy did not show any survival benefit compared with chemotherapy alone in advanced gastric cancer with a single non-curable factor, gastrectomy cannot be justified for treatment of patients with these tumours.FUNDING: The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan and the Korean Gastric Cancer Association.",0,0,0,0

Lessons Learned From a Proposed Randomized Trial of Watch-and-Wait Treatment of Rectal Cancer.BACKGROUND: Chemoradiotherapy has the potential to downsize and downstage tumors before surgery, decrease locoregional recurrence, and induce a complete sterilization of tumor cells for middle and low locally advanced rectal cancer.A watch-and-wait tactic has been proposed for patients with clinical complete response.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to verify our ability to identify complete clinical response in patients with rectal cancer based on clinical and radiologic criteria.DESIGN: This was a prospective study.SETTINGS: The study was conducted at a single institution, in the setting of a watch-and-wait randomized trial.PATIENTS: Consecutive patients with stage T3 to T4N0M0 or T(any)N+M0 cancer located within 10 cm from anal verge or T2N0 within 7 cm from anal verge were included in the study.Patients were staged and restaged 8 weeks after completion of chemoradiation (5-fluorouracil, 5040 cGy) by digital examination, colonoscopy, pelvic MRI, and thorax and abdominal CT scans.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical and radiologic judgments of tumor response were compared with pathologic response of patients treated by total mesorectal excision or clinical follow-up of patients selected for nonoperative treatment.RESULTS: A total of 118 patients were treated.Six patients were considered clinic complete responders (2 randomly assigned for surgery (1 ypT0N0 and 1 ypT2N0) and 4 patients randomly assigned for observation (3 sustained clinic complete response and 1 had tumor regrowth)).The 112 clinic incomplete responders underwent total mesorectal excision, and 18 revealed pathologic complete response.These 18 patients were not considered complete responders at restaging because they presented at least 1 of the following conditions: mucosal ulceration and/or deformity and/or substenosis of rectal lumen at digital rectal examination and colonoscopy (n = 16), ymrT1 to T4 (n = 16), ymrN+ (n = 2), involvement of circumferential resection margin on MRI (n = 3), extramural vascular invasion on MRI (n = 4), MRI tumor response grade 2 to 4 (n = 15), and pelvic side wall lymph node involvement on MRI (n = 1).Sensitivity for identification of ypT0N0 or sustained clinic complete response was 18.2%.LIMITATIONS: This study has a short follow-up and small sample size.Radiologists who reviewed the restaging examination were not blinded to the pretreatment stage.Only 1 radiologist read the images of each patient.CONCLUSIONS: Evaluation of clinic complete response according to current adopted criteria has low sensitivity because pathologic complete response more frequently presented as clinic incomplete response (see Video, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/DCR/A221).",0,0,0,0
26960500,"Efficacy of second-line erlotinib in patients postprogression of first-line chemotherapy in head and neck cancers.BACKGROUND: Oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor (gefitinib and erlotinib) have been used in the palliative treatment of head and neck cancers with limited success.In this report, we aim to quantify the symptomatic benefit, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) when erlotinib is given as second-line treatment in Head and neck cancers.METHODS: This was a post-hoc retrospective analysis of a randomized study comparing metronomic chemotherapy with cisplatin.A patient who progressed on chemotherapy and had a PS0-2 were offered second-line chemotherapy.Patients who had received erlotinib (150 mg PO OD) as second line treatment were selected for this analysis.Erlotinib was discontinued in case of either progression of disease or if the patient had intolerable side effects.Patient were monitored 1-week after the start of erlotinib and subsequently at monthly intervals.The toxicity was recorded in accordance with CTCAE version 4.02 (NCI,USA) and the response were graded in accordance with RECIST version 1.1.All of these patients were followed-up till death.RESULTS: Twenty-three patients were identified.The median age of these patients at the start of the second line was 47 years (interquartile range 40.5-51.75 years).The primary site of distribution was oral cavity primary in 17 patients (77.3%) and nonoral cavity primary in 05 (22.7%) patients.The immediate last chemotherapy regimen received was cisplatin in 9 patients (40.9%) and metronomic chemotherapy in 13 patients (59.1%).Symptomatic benefits post second-line erlotinib was seen in 18 patients (81.8%).The most common adverse events (any grade) seen were anemia in 20 patients (90.9%), rash in 10 patients (45.5%) and diarrhea in 7 patients (31.8%).The best radiological response documented were a partial response in 04 patients (19.2%).The median estimated PFS and OS were 110 days (95% confidence interval [CI]: 61-175 days) and 156 days (95% CI: 126-185 days) respectively.CONCLUSION: Erlotinib single agent has promising activity in the second line and needs to be explored in future studies.",0,0,0,0
26964032,"Long-term impact of preeclampsia on maternal endometrial cancer risk.BACKGROUND: Endometrial cancer is mainly dependent on oestrogen exposure.Preeclampsia has shown to reduce oestrogen levels hence preeclampsia may affect later endometrial cancer risk.METHODS: We conducted a case-control study of 523 Danish women with endometrial cancer and 52 299controls during 1978-2010.The association between preeclampsia and later endometrial cancer was evaluated overall and according to preeclampsia onset and type of endometrial cancer in conditional logistic regression models.RESULTS: We observed no overall association between preeclampsia and endometrial cancer risk (OR=1.11 (95% CI 0.68-1.81)).This was true for all endometrial cancer subtypes.In an analysis of preeclampsia onset, however, we report a markedly increased risk of endometrial cancer following early-onset preeclampsia (OR=2.64 (95% CI 1.29-5.38)).CONCLUSIONS: Although we report no obvious association between preeclampsia and endometrial cancer, studying the subset of early-onset preeclampsia may prove fruitful in further understanding the aetiology of endometrial cancer.",0,0,0,0
26971190,"Comparison of prostate cancer detection at 3-T MRI with and without an endorectal coil: A prospective, paired-patient study.OBJECTIVES: To compare the sensitivity of 2 different non-endorectal coil strategies vs. endorectal coil (ERC) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for detection of prostate cancer (PCa).METHODS: In this prospective, single-center, paired-patient, paired-reader study, 49 men with a clinical indication for MRI underwent non-ERC (phased-array coil only) T2-weighted imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging followed by the same sequences using both ERC and phased-array coils (ERC Protocol).Patients were randomized into 1 of 2 arms: standard non-ERC protocol and augmented non-ERC protocol.Lesions with Likert score>/=3 were defined as suspicious for cancer.Radical prostatectomy specimen or combined systematic plus targeted biopsies served as the standard of reference.Cancers were stratified into risk groups according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines.Generalized estimating equations with Bonferroni correction were used for comparisons.The level of reader confidence was inferred by the Likert scores assigned to index lesions.RESULTS: The ERC protocol provided sensitivity (78%) superior to MRI without ERC for PCa detection, both with a standard (43%) (P<0.0001) or augmented (60%) (P<0.01) protocol.The ERC MRI missed less-intermediate or high-risk index lesions (4%) than standard non-ERC (42%) (P = 0.02) and augmented non-ERC MRI (25%), although the latter did not reach significance (P = 0.09).The ERC improved radiologist confidence for the detection of PCa (average Likert score = 4.2+/-1.4) compared to standard (2.3+/-2.3) and augmented (2.9+/-2.1) non-ERC (P = 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: The use of combined ERC and pelvic phased-array coil for T2-weighted imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging provides superior sensitivity for the detection of PCa compared to an examination performed without the ERC.",0,0,0,0
26982446,"Adult Cancer Patient Recruitment and Enrollment into Cell Phone Text Message Trials.INTRODUCTION: Text messaging (TMs) on cell phones is emerging as an effective means of delivering behavioral interventions.However, little is known about TM use in adult cancer patients.The present study aimed to extend knowledge on acceptability of a TM intervention in adult cancer patients; examine factors of those screened and enrolled; and compare recruitment at a large national specialty pharmacy versus community-based cancer clinics.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Screening, enrollment, and baseline data collected in two randomized controlled trials examining the efficacy of TMs on medication adherence or symptom severity in adults prescribed oral anticancer agents were linked.Chi-square, Fisher's exact, t-tests, and generalized linear modeling were used to examine sociodemographics, cancer type and stage, depressive symptoms, self-efficacy, social support, and symptoms.RESULTS: The cancer clinics screened 293 patients, 43% were eligible, and 56% consented.The specialty pharmacy screened 169 patients, 72% were eligible, and 74% consented.Mean age was 58 years and did not differ by recruitment setting.Later stage disease (p = 0.01) and higher number of symptoms (p < 0.01), and symptom severity (p = 0.02) and interference (p = 0.01) were observed among patients recruited at the specialty pharmacy.No group differences were found for depression, physical function, cognition, self-efficacy, or social support.DISCUSSION: Adult cancer patients were likely to participate in a TM intervention trial.Recruiting through the specialty pharmacy reached a population with higher cell phone ownership and TM usage; with greater interest in a TM intervention compared to the cancer clinics.",0,0,0,0

27041692,"Blood graft cellular composition and posttransplant outcomes in myeloma patients mobilized with or without low-dose cyclophosphamide: a randomized comparison.BACKGROUND: Autologous stem cell transplantation is a standard treatment in multiple myeloma (MM).Blood grafts are usually collected after mobilization with granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) alone or in a combination with cyclophosphamide (CY).There is limited knowledge of the possible effects of different mobilization regimens on blood graft characteristics and posttransplant outcomes.STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Thirty-eight patients with MM were included in this study.The patients were randomly assigned at registration to mobilization with either low-dose CY plus G-CSF (Arm A) or G-CSF alone (Arm B) and received three cycles of lenalidomide, bortetzomib, and dexamethasone induction.Flow cytometry analysis of lymphocyte subsets in the blood grafts after cryopreservation was performed.Hematologic and immune recovery were evaluated up to 12 months posttransplant.RESULTS: The blood grafts in Arm A contained significantly more CD34+ cells but in Arm B there was a greater proportion of CD34+CD38- cells and higher numbers of T and B lymphocytes as well as natural killer (NK) cells.The engraftment was comparable but lymphocyte count at 15 days posttransplant was higher in Arm B (0.8 x 10(9) /L vs. 0.5 x 10(9) /L, p = 0.033).At 3 and 6 months posttransplant the total number of NK cells was also higher in G-CSF-mobilized patients.There was no difference in progression-free survival between the study arms.CONCLUSION: CY plus G-GSF yields more CD34+ cells but seems to diminish lymphocyte and NK cell counts in the grafts and hampers immune recovery after transplantation.Thus G-CSF alone might be a preferred mobilization method due to more rapid immune recovery posttransplant.",0,0,0,0
27044367,"Evaluating a computer aid for assessing stomach symptoms (ECASS): study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.BACKGROUND: For most cancers, only a minority of patients have symptoms meeting the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidance for urgent referral.For gastro-oesophageal cancers, the 'alarm' symptoms of dysphagia and weight loss are reported by only 32 and 8 % of patients, respectively, and their presence correlates with advanced-stage disease.Electronic clinical decision-support tools that integrate with clinical computer systems have been developed for general practice, although uncertainty remains concerning their effectiveness.The objectives of this trial are to optimise the intervention and establish the acceptability of both the intervention and randomisation, confirm the suitability and selection of outcome measures, finalise the design for the phase III definitive trial, and obtain preliminary estimates of the intervention effect.METHODS/DESIGN: This is a two-arm, multi-centre, cluster-randomised, controlled phase II trial design, which will extend over a 16-month period, across 60 general practices within the North East and North Cumbria and the Eastern Local Clinical Research Network areas.Practices will be randomised to receive either the intervention (the electronic clinical decision-support tool) or to act as a control (usual care).From these practices, we will recruit 3000 adults who meet the trial eligibility criteria and present to their GP with symptoms suggestive of gastro-oesophageal cancer.The main measures are the process data, which include the practitioner outcomes, service outcomes, diagnostic intervals, health economic outcomes, and patient outcomes.One-on-one interviews in a sub-sample of 30 patient-GP dyads will be undertaken to understand the impact of the use or non-use of the electronic clinical decision-support tool in the consultation.A further 10-15 GPs will be interviewed to identify and gain an understanding of the facilitators and constraints influencing implementation of the electronic clinical decision-support tool in practice.DISCUSSION: We aim to generate new knowledge on the process measures regarding the use of electronic clinical decision-support tools in primary care in general and to inform a subsequent definitive phase III trial.Preliminary data on the impact of the support tool on resource utilisation and health care costs will also be collected.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN Registry, ISRCTN12595588 .",0,0,0,0
27045264,"Effects of Tadalafil Once-Daily or On-Demand vs Placebo on Return to Baseline Erectile Function After Bilateral Nerve-Sparing Radical Prostatectomy--Results from a Randomized Controlled Trial (REACTT).INTRODUCTION AND AIM: The multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled REACTT trial suggested that treatment with tadalafil once daily (OaD) started early after bilateral nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy (nsRP) for prostate cancer may contribute to erectile function (EF)-recovery, which was predefined as achieving an International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF)-EF score >/=22.Here, we report descriptive post-hoc analyses, using the more strict definition for EF-recovery of returning back to the pre-surgery IIEF-EF-level (""back-to-baseline analysis"").METHODS: REACTT included 422 men <68 years with adenocarcinoma of the prostate and preoperative IIEF-EF >/=22 who underwent nsRP at 50 centers from 9 European countries and Canada.Patients were randomized post-nsRP 1:1:1 to 9-month double-blind treatment (DBT) with tadalafil 5 mg OaD (n = 139), tadalafil 20 mg on-demand (pro-re-nata, PRN; n = 142), or placebo (n = 141), followed by 6-week drug-free washout (DFW) and 3-month open-label tadalafil OaD treatment (OLT).MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportion of patients returning to their preoperative IIEF-EF category (22-25 or >/=26) at the end of DBT, DFW, and OLT.RESULTS: Overall, 92.4% of patients had pre-surgery (baseline) IIEF-EF scores >/=26 (tadalafil OaD 94.2%, PRN 91.6%, placebo 91.5%), 7.4% had IIEF-EF 22-25.At the end of DBT, 22.3% of patients on tadalafil OaD had achieved ""back-to-baseline"" IIEF-EF, compared with 11.3% on tadalafil PRN and 7.8% on placebo.Of all 58 patients ""back-to-baseline"" at the end of DBT, only 1 PRN-group patient had started from a baseline IIEF-EF <26.The treatment-group difference at the end of DBT was not maintained after DFW.After 3 months of OLT with tadalafil OaD, the proportion of patients with ""back-to-baseline"" IIEF-EF had almost doubled in all 3 groups.CONCLUSION: Changing the definition for EF-recovery from IIEF-EF >/=22 to the more strict definition of ""returning back-to-baseline IIEF-EF"" had no major impact.Tadalafil OaD started early after nsRP improved drug-assisted EF, but had no effect on unassisted EF following treatment cessation after 9 months.",0,0,0,0

Women with 25(OH)D concentrations >/=40ng/ml had a 67% lower risk of cancer than women with concentrations <20 ng/ml (HR = 0.33, 95% CI = 0.12-0.90).CONCLUSIONS: 25(OH)D concentrations >/=40 ng/ml were associated with substantial reduction in risk of all invasive cancers combined.",0,0,0,0
27050431,"Memantine before Mastectomy Prevents Post-Surgery Pain: A Randomized, Blinded Clinical Trial in Surgical Patients.BACKGROUND: Neuropathic pain following surgical treatment for breast cancer with or without chemotherapy is a clinical burden and patients frequently report cognitive, emotional and quality of life impairment.A preclinical study recently showed that memantine administered before surgery may prevent neuropathic pain development and cognitive dysfunction.With a translational approach, a clinical trial has been carried out to evaluate whether memantine administered before and after mastectomy could prevent the development of neuropathic pain, the impairment of cognition and quality of life.METHOD: A randomized, pilot clinical trial included 40 women undergoing mastectomy in the Oncology Department, University Hospital, Clermont-Ferrand, France.Memantine (5 to 20 mg/day; n = 20) or placebo (n = 20) was administered for four weeks starting two weeks before surgery.The primary endpoint was pain intensity measured on a (0-10) numerical rating scale at three months post-mastectomy.RESULTS: Data analyses were performed using mixed models and the tests were two-sided, with a type I error set at alpha = 0.05.Compared with placebo, patients receiving memantine showed at three months a significant difference in post-mastectomy pain intensity, less rescue analgesia and a better emotional state.An improvement of pain symptoms induced by cancer chemotherapy was also reported.CONCLUSIONS: This study shows for the first time the beneficial effect of memantine to prevent post-mastectomy pain development and to diminish chemotherapy-induced pain symptoms.The lesser analgesic consumption and better well-being of patients for at least six months after treatment suggests that memantine could be an interesting therapeutic option to diminish the burden of breast cancer therapy.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01536314.",0,0,0,0
27061082,"Randomized phase III trial of amrubicin/cisplatin versus etoposide/cisplatin as first-line treatment for extensive small-cell lung cancer.BACKGROUND: Extensive-disease small-cell lung cancer (ED-SCLC) is characterized by rapid progression and relapse, despite high initial response rates to chemotherapy.The primary objective of this trial was to demonstrate the non-inferiority of amrubicin and cisplatin (AP) combination therapy compared with the standard first-line regimen of etoposide and cisplatin (EP) for previously untreated ED-SCLC in a Chinese population.When non-inferiority was verified, the objective was switched from non-inferiority to superiority.METHODS: From June 2008 to July 2010, 300 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio to AP and EP groups.AP-treated patients received cisplatin (60 mg/m(2), day 1) and amrubicin (40 mg/m(2), days 1-3) once every 21 days.EP-treated patients received cisplatin (80 mg/m(2), day 1) and etoposide (100 mg/m(2), days 1-3) once every 21 days.Treatment was continued for four to six cycles, except in cases of progressive disease or toxicity, and patient refusal.RESULTS: Median overall survival (OS) for AP vs. EP treatment was 11.8 vs. 10.3 months (p = 0.08), respectively, demonstrating non-inferiority of AP to EP (AP group: 95% confidence interval for hazard ratio 0.63-1.03 months).Median progression-free survival and overall response rates for AP vs. EP groups were 6.8 vs. 5.7 months (p = 0.35) and 69.8% vs. 57.3%, respectively.Drug-related adverse events in both groups were similar, with neutropenia being the most frequent (AP 54.4%; EP 44.0%).Leukopenia, pyrexia, and fatigue were more prevalent in the AP group, but all were clinically reversible and manageable.CONCLUSIONS: AP therapy demonstrated non-inferiority to EP therapy, prolonging OS for 1.5 months, but this difference was not statistically significant; thus we propose AP as a promising treatment option for ED-SCLC in China.TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was registered on 10 April 2008 (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00660504).",1,1,1,0
27067306,"Correlates of Sun Protection and Sunburn in Children of Melanoma Survivors.INTRODUCTION: Sunburns during childhood increase melanoma risk.Children of melanoma survivors are at higher risk, but little is known about their sunburn and sun protection.One study showed that almost half of melanoma survivors' children experienced sunburn in the past year.This study evaluated sunburn and sun protection in melanoma survivors' children, and relevant survivor characteristics from Social Cognitive Theory and the Health Belief Model.METHODS: Melanoma survivors (N=340) were recruited from a comprehensive cancer center.Survivors completed a baseline questionnaire administered by telephone to report on the behavior of their children (N=340) as part of an RCT of a sun protection intervention.Data were collected in 2008 and analyzed in 2015.RESULTS: In the prior 6 months, 28% of children experienced sunburn. ""Always"" or ""frequent"" sun protection varied by behavior: sunscreen, 69%; lip balm, 15%; wide-brimmed hats, 9%; sleeved shirts, 28%; pants, 48%; sunglasses, 10%; shade, 33%; and limiting time outdoors, 45%.Survivors' sunburn and sun protection were positively associated with these outcomes in children.Correlates of sunburn also included older child age and higher risk perceptions.Correlates of sun protection behaviors included younger child age; stronger intentions, higher self-efficacy, and more positive outcome expectations about sun protection; and greater number of melanomas in survivors.CONCLUSIONS: Melanoma survivors may have a heightened awareness of the importance of their children's sun protection, but their children are not routinely protected.Correlates of children's sunburn and sun protection suggest subgroups of survivors to target with interventions to improve sun protection.",0,0,0,0
27075674,"Repeated measures analyses of dermatitis symptom evolution in breast cancer patients receiving radiotherapy in a phase 3 randomized trial of mometasone furoate vs placebo (N06C4 [alliance]).PURPOSE: Radiotherapy-related dermatological toxicities over time have not been well quantified.We examined during and immediately following radiation therapy skin toxicities over time in a randomized study of mometasone furoate vs placebo during breast radiotherapy.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients with breast cancer undergoing radiotherapy to the breast or chest wall were randomized.Symptoms related to skin toxicity were addressed weekly using provider-reported Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v3.0) and 4 patient-reported outcomes (PRO) surveys.We applied repeated measures and risk analysis methodologies.RESULTS: One hundred seventy-six patients were enrolled.By CTCAE, significant differences favoring mometasone were detected over time in all toxicities except skin striae, atrophy, and infection.Statistically significant differences between arms at baseline but not over time occurred for all Linear Analog Self-Assessment.Statistically significant differences occurred for all symptoms in the temporal profile of symptoms as measured by PRO surveys (all P < .001).CONCLUSIONS: The use of longitudinal methods enhanced the ability of PRO tools to detect differences between study arms.Our results strengthened the conclusions of the original report that mometasone reduced acute skin toxicities.PRO surveys can accurately assess patients' experiences of symptom type and intensity over time and should be included in future clinical trials.For radiotherapy-related dermatological toxicity, we hypothesized that clinically significant differences over time, if any, can be found by repeated measures.We examined the acute skin toxicities in a randomized study of mometasone vs placebo during breast radiotherapy.For secondary end points, we showed that longitudinal methods enhanced the detection of differences between study arms and strengthened the conclusions from the original report.Frequent patient-reported outcome surveys over time should be included in future clinical trials.",0,0,0,0
27081036,"Cardiotoxicity as indicated by LVEF and troponin T sensitivity following two anthracycline-based regimens in lymphoma: Results from a randomized prospective clinical trial.Anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity influences treatment selection and may negatively affect clinical outcomes in lymphoma patients.While epirubicin induced cardiotoxicity less often than the same dose of doxorubicin in breast cancer, higher doses of epirubicin are required in lymphoma regimens for equivalent efficacy.Whether a higher dosage of epirubicin also induces cardiotoxicity less often than doxorubicin in lymphoma remains unknown.We therefore administered 6-8 cycles of cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisone (CEpOP) +/- rituximab (R) with either epirubicin (CEpOP) or doxorubicin (CHOP) to patients (N=398) with untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or follicular lymphoma grade 3 (FLG3).Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and high-sensitivity serum cardiac troponin T (HsTnT) were assessed at baseline and after 4 cycles of treatment.Epirubicin (70 mg/m2/dose) was equivalent to doxorubicin (50 mg/m2/dose) in terms of 3-year progression-free survival.The risk of decreased LVEF was similar between the two regimens.CEpOP+/-R induced HsTnT elevation less often than CHOP+/-R. We conclude that CEpOP+/-R is a more acceptable regimen with short-term efficacy similar to CHOP+/-R in lymphoma patients.Longer follow-up is needed to monitor the risk of cardiac dysfunction and determine whether differences in the induction of elevated HsTnT between epirubicin and doxorubicin justify changes in clinical practice.",0,0,0,0

27100427,"The Effects of Dinner-to-Bed Time and Post-Dinner Walk on Gastric Cancer Across Different Age Groups: A Multicenter Case-Control Study in Southeast China.Gastric cancer (GC) remains a major killer throughout the world.Despite the dramatic decrease in GC over the last century, its etiology has not yet been well characterized.This study investigated the possible independent and combined effects of the dinner-to-bed time and post-dinner walk on the risk for GC across different age groups.A population-based, case-control study was conducted in southeast China, including 452 patients with GC and 465 age-, race-, and gender-matched controls.A self-designed questionnaire was used to collect information on demographic characteristics, dinner-to-bed time, post-dinner walk, and other behavioral factors.Conditional logistic regression models were used to estimate the effects of the dinner-to-bed time and post-dinner walk as well as their joint effect on the risk for GC across different age groups.Individuals with dinner-to-bed time <3 hours were more prone to have GC (P < 0.001), and the shorter the dinner-to-bed time was, the higher was the risk for GC (Ptrend < 0.001).Post-dinner nonwalk was associated with a 2.9-fold increased risk for GC compared with post-dinner walk (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.942, 95% confidence intervals [95% CIs] = 2.072-4.179).The interaction effect of dinner-to-bed time and post-dinner walk on GC risk was detected (AOR = 1.862, 95% CIs = 1.584-3.885, synergy index [SI] = 2.654, 95% CIs = 2.27-3.912).Participants with dinner-to-bed time <3 hours who did not walk after dinner were 7.4 times likely to suffer from GC (AOR = 7.401, 95% CIs = 4.523-13.16) than those with dinner-to-bed time >/=4 hours who took such walk.The risk of GC due to dinner-to-bed time <3 hours, post-dinner nonwalk and their interaction was positively correlated with age.The strongest risk was observed among people >/=70 years old, but the effects were not significant for people </=55 years old.Dinner-to-bed time <3 hours and post-dinner nonwalk are independent risk factors for GC; the synergistic interaction between the 2 factors was positively related to age, which might significantly increase the risk for GC among people >55 years old.",0,0,0,0
27112319,"Protocol of a randomized controlled trial of the fear of recurrence therapy (FORT) intervention for women with breast or gynecological cancer.BACKGROUND: Clinically significant levels of fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) affect up to 49% of cancer survivors and are more prevalent among women.FCR is associated with psychological distress, lower quality of life, and increased use of medical resources.Despite its prevalence, FCR is poorly addressed in clinical care.To address this problem, we first developed, and pilot tested a 6-week, 2 h, Cognitive-existential group intervention therapy that targeted FCR in survivors of breast or gynecological cancer.Following the positive outcome of the pilot, we are now testing this approach in a randomized clinical trial (RCT).Goal and hypotheses: This multicenter, prospective RCT aims to test the efficacy of the intervention.The study hypotheses are that, compared to a control group, cancer survivors participating in the intervention (1) will have less FCR, (2) will show more favorable outcomes on the following measures: cancer-specific distress, quality of life, illness uncertainty, intolerance of uncertainty, perceived risk of cancer recurrence, and coping skills.We further postulate that the between-group differences will persist three and 6 months post-intervention.METHODS: Sixteen groups of seven to nine women are being allocated to the intervention or the control group.The control group receives a 6-week, 2 h, structurally equivalent support group.We are recruiting 144 cancer survivors from four hospital sites in three Canadian cities.The sample size was based on the moderate pre/post-test changes found in our pilot study and adjusted to the drop-out rates.MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome, FCR, is measured by the Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory.Secondary outcomes measured include cancer-specific distress, perceived risk of cancer recurrence, illness uncertainty, intolerance of uncertainty, coping, and quality of life.We use reliable and recognized valid scales.Participants are to complete the questionnaire package at four times: before the first group session (baseline), immediately after the sixth session, and 3 and 6 months post-intervention.ANALYSIS: In the descriptive analysis, comparison of group equivalent baseline variables, identification of confounding/intermediate variables and univariate analysis are planned.Each participant's trajectory is calculated using Generalized Estimating Equation models to determine the time and group effects, after considering the correlation structures of the groups.An intent-to-treat analysis approach may be adopted.DISCUSSION: Our Fear of Recurrence Therapy (FORT) intervention has direct implications for clinical service development to improve the quality of life for patients with breast (BC) and gynecological cancer (GC).Based on our pilot data, we are confident that the FORT intervention can guide the development of effective psychosocial cancer survivorship interventions to reduce FCR and improve psychological functioning among women with BC or GC.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Dr. Christine Maheu registered the trial with ISRCTN registry (Registration number: ISRCTN83539618, date assigned 03/09/2014).",0,0,0,0
27114605,"Response to Cetuximab With or Without Irinotecan in Patients With Refractory Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Harboring the KRAS G13D Mutation: Australasian Gastro-Intestinal Trials Group ICECREAM Study.PURPOSE: RAS mutations predict lack of response to epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody therapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), but preclinical studies and retrospective clinical data suggest that patients with tumors harboring the exon 2 KRAS G13D mutation may benefit from cetuximab.We aimed to assess cetuximab monotherapy and cetuximab plus irinotecan in patients with molecularly selected (G13D mutation) chemotherapy-refractory mCRC in a randomized phase II trial of this rare molecular subtype.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with chemotherapy-refractory KRAS G13D mutation-positive mCRC who had progressed within 6 months of irinotecan therapy were randomly assigned to cetuximab 400 mg/m(2) loading dose and then 250 mg/m(2) once per week with or without irinotecan 180 mg/m(2) once every 2 weeks.The primary end point was 6-month progression-free survival; secondary end points were response rate, overall survival, quality of life, and toxicity.RESULTS: Fifty-one of 53 patients recruited over 2 years were eligible.The 6-month progression-free survival rate was 10% (95% CI, 2% to 26%) for cetuximab versus 23% (95% CI, 9% to 40%) for cetuximab plus irinotecan with a hazard ratio of 0.74 (95% CI, 0.42 to 1.32).Response and stable disease rates were 0% and 58% for monotherapy versus 9% and 70% for combination treatment, respectively.Overall survival and quality of life were similar; toxicities were higher with combination therapy.CONCLUSION: In patients with G13D-mutated chemotherapy-refractory mCRC, there was no statistically significant improvement in disease control at 6 months with either cetuximab monotherapy or cetuximab plus irinotecan.No responses were seen with single-agent cetuximab.The responses observed with the combination of cetuximab and irinotecan may reflect true drug synergy or persistent irinotecan sensitivity.The ICECREAM (Irinotecan Cetuximab Evaluation and Cetuximab Response Evaluation Among Patients with a G13D Mutation) study demonstrates the need to prospectively evaluate hypotheses that were previously supported by retrospective analyses and exemplifies the value of international collaboration in trials of rare molecular subtypes.",1,1,1,1
27118453,"Minimal residual disease monitoring and immune profiling in multiple myeloma in elderly patients.The value of minimal residual disease (MRD) in multiple myeloma (MM) has been more frequently investigated in transplant-eligible patients than in elderly patients.Because an optimal balance between treatment efficacy and toxicity is of utmost importance in patients with elderly MM, sensitive MRD monitoring might be particularly valuable in this patient population.Here, we used second-generation 8-color multiparameter-flow cytometry (MFC) to monitor MRD in 162 transplant-ineligible MM patients enrolled in the PETHEMA/GEM2010MAS65 study.The transition from first- to second-generation MFC resulted in increased sensitivity and allowed us to identify 3 patient groups according to MRD levels: MRD negative (<10(-5); n = 54, 34%), MRD positive (between <10(-4) and >/=10(-5); n = 20, 12%), and MRD positive (>/=10(-4); n = 88, 54%).MRD status was an independent prognostic factor for time to progression (TTP) (hazard ratio [HR], 2.7; P = .007) and overall survival (OS) (HR, 3.1; P = .04), with significant benefit for MRD-negative patients (median TTP not reached, 70% OS at 3 years), and similar poorer outcomes for cases with MRD levels between <10(-4) and >/=10(-5) vs >/=10(-4) (both with a median TTP of 15 months; 63% and 55% OS at 3 years, respectively).Furthermore, MRD negativity significantly improved TTP of patients >75 years (HR, 4.8; P < .001), as well as those with high-risk cytogenetics (HR, 12.6; P = .01).Using second-generation MFC, immune profiling concomitant to MRD monitoring also contributed to identify patients with poor, intermediate, and favorable outcomes (25%, 61%, and 100% OS at 3 years, respectively; P = .01), the later patients being characterized by an increased compartment of mature B cells.Our results show that similarly to transplant candidates, MRD monitoring is one of the most relevant prognostic factors in elderly MM patients, irrespectively of age or cytogenetic risk.This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT01237249.",0,0,0,0
27124410,"Exploratory Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Response-Guided Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy for Hormone Positive Breast Cancer Patients.PURPOSE: Guiding response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (guided-NACT) allows for an adaptative treatment approach likely to improve breast cancer survival.In this study, our primary aim is to explore the expected cost-effectiveness of guided-NACT using as a case study the first randomized controlled trial that demonstrated effectiveness (GeparTrio trial).MATERIALS AND METHODS: As effectiveness was shown in hormone-receptor positive (HR+) early breast cancers (EBC), our decision model compared the health-economic outcomes of treating a cohort of such women with guided-NACT to conventional-NACT using clinical input data from the GeparTrio trial.The expected cost-effectiveness and the uncertainty around this estimate were estimated via probabilistic cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA), from a Dutch societal perspective over a 5-year time-horizon.RESULTS: Our exploratory CEA predicted that guided-NACT as proposed by the GeparTrio, costs additional euro110, but results in 0.014 QALYs gained per patient.This scenario of guided-NACT was considered cost-effective at any willingness to pay per additional QALY.At the prevailing Dutch willingness to pay threshold (euro80.000/QALY) cost-effectiveness was expected with 78% certainty.CONCLUSION: This exploratory CEA indicated that guided-NACT (as proposed by the GeparTrio trial) is likely cost-effective in treating HR+ EBC women.While prospective validation of the GeparTrio findings is advisable from a clinical perspective, early CEAs can be used to prioritize further research from a broader health economic perspective, by identifying which parameters contribute most to current decision uncertainty.Furthermore, their use can be extended to explore the expected cost-effectiveness of alternative guided-NACT scenarios that combine the use of promising imaging techniques together with personalized treatments.",0,0,0,0
27129176,"Thalidomide enhanced the efficacy of CHOP chemotherapy in the treatment of diffuse large B cell lymphoma: A phase II study.Cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone plus rituximab (R-CHOP) is the standard treatment for patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL).However, rituximab cannot be popularly applied in a considerable number of patients with DLBCL because of economic reasons.To develop a new regimen to improve the outcome of these patients is extremely important.In our study, sixty five patients with DLBCL were randomly assigned to thalidomide plus CHOP group (n=32) or to CHOP alone group (n=33).Objective response rates (ORR) and complete remission rates (CRR) were 96.7% and 80.6% in T-CHOP group versus 78.9 % and 57.8 % in CHOP group, respectively (P <0.05).At a median follow-up of 96 months, median PFS for T-CHOP group was still not reached yet, and in CHOP group it was 22.9 months (95% CI [0-50.4]).(P=0.163).Median overall survival (OS) for T-CHOP group was also not reached, and the estimated median OS for CHOP group was 83.5 months, the difference of OS between the two groups is not significant (p=0.263). But, in patients with Bcl-2 positive and Bcl-6 negative, the median PFS in T-CHOP group was longer than that in CHOP group (111.0 vs 8.5 months (P=0.017).In addition, thalidomide did not significantly increase the grade 3/4 toxicity of CHOP.We concluded that the addition of thalidomide to the CHOP regimen significantly improved the CRR and showed a trend of improving clinical outcome in patients with DLBCL, especially for patients with Bcl-2 positive and Bcl-6 negative B-cell phenotype, without increased toxicity.",1,1,1,0
27130929,"Comparing Breast Cancer Multiparameter Tests in the OPTIMA Prelim Trial: No Test Is More Equal Than the Others.BACKGROUND: Previous reports identifying discordance between multiparameter tests at the individual patient level have been largely attributed to methodological shortcomings of multiple in silico studies.Comparisons between tests, when performed using actual diagnostic assays, have been predicted to demonstrate high degrees of concordance.OPTIMA prelim compared predicted risk stratification and subtype classification of different multiparameter tests performed directly on the same population.METHODS: Three hundred thirteen women with early breast cancer were randomized to standard (chemotherapy and endocrine therapy) or test-directed (chemotherapy if Oncotype DX recurrence score >25) treatment.Risk stratification was also determined with Prosigna (PAM50), MammaPrint, MammaTyper, NexCourse Breast (IHC4-AQUA), and conventional IHC4 (IHC4).Subtype classification was provided by Blueprint, MammaTyper, and Prosigna.RESULTS: Oncotype DX predicted a higher proportion of tumors as low risk (82.1%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 77.8% to 86.4%) than were predicted low/intermediate risk using Prosigna (65.5%, 95% CI = 60.1% to 70.9%), IHC4 (72.0%, 95% CI = 66.5% to 77.5%), MammaPrint (61.4%, 95% CI = 55.9% to 66.9%), or NexCourse Breast (61.6%, 95% CI = 55.8% to 67.4%).Strikingly, the five tests showed only modest agreement when dichotomizing results between high vs low/intermediate risk.Only 119 (39.4%) tumors were classified uniformly as either low/intermediate risk or high risk, and 183 (60.6%) were assigned to different risk categories by different tests, although 94 (31.1%) showed agreement between four of five tests.All three subtype tests assigned 59.5% to 62.4% of tumors to luminal A subtype, but only 121 (40.1%) were classified as luminal A by all three tests and only 58 (19.2%) were uniformly assigned as nonluminal A. Discordant subtyping was observed in 123 (40.7%) tumors.CONCLUSIONS: Existing evidence on the comparative prognostic information provided by different tests suggests that current multiparameter tests provide broadly equivalent risk information for the population of women with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancers.However, for the individual patient, tests may provide differing risk categorization and subtype information.",0,0,0,0
27132696,"Chemoimmunotherapy with methotrexate, cytarabine, thiotepa, and rituximab (MATRix regimen) in patients with primary CNS lymphoma: results of the first randomisation of the International Extranodal Lymphoma Study Group-32 (IELSG32) phase 2 trial.BACKGROUND: Standard treatment for patients with primary CNS lymphoma remains to be defined.Active therapies are often associated with increased risk of haematological or neurological toxicity.In this trial, we addressed the tolerability and efficacy of adding rituximab with or without thiotepa to methotrexate-cytarabine combination therapy (the MATRix regimen), followed by a second randomisation comparing consolidation with whole-brain radiotherapy or autologous stem cell transplantation in patients with primary CNS lymphoma.We report the results of the first randomisation in this Article.METHODS: For the international randomised phase 2 International Extranodal Lymphoma Study Group-32 (IELSG32) trial, HIV-negative patients (aged 18-70 years) with newly diagnosed primary CNS lymphoma and measurable disease were enrolled from 53 cancer centres in five European countries (Denmark, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, and the UK) and randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive four courses of methotrexate 3.5 g/m(2) on day 1 plus cytarabine 2 g/m(2) twice daily on days 2 and 3 (group A); or the same combination plus two doses of rituximab 375 mg/m(2) on days -5 and 0 (group B); or the same methotrexate-cytarabine-rituximab combination plus thiotepa 30 mg/m(2) on day 4 (group C), with the three groups repeating treatment every 3 weeks.Patients with responsive or stable disease after the first stage were then randomly allocated between whole-brain radiotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation.A permuted blocks randomised design (block size four) was used for both randomisations, and a computer-generated randomisation list was used within each stratum to preserve allocation concealment.Randomisation was stratified by IELSG risk score (low vs intermediate vs high).No masking after assignment to intervention was used.The primary endpoint of the first randomisation was the complete remission rate, analysed by modified intention to treat.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01011920.FINDINGS: Between Feb 19, 2010, and Aug 27, 2014, 227 eligible patients were recruited.219 of these 227 enrolled patients were assessable.At median follow-up of 30 months (IQR 22-38), patients treated with rituximab and thiotepa had a complete remission rate of 49% (95% CI 38-60), compared with 23% (14-31) of those treated with methotrexate-cytarabine alone (hazard ratio 0.46, 95% CI 0.28-0.74) and 30% (21-42) of those treated with methotrexate-cytarabine plus rituximab (0.61, 0.40-0.94).Grade 4 haematological toxicity was more frequent in patients treated with methotrexate-cytarabine plus rituximab and thiotepa, but infective complications were similar in the three groups.The most common grade 3-4 adverse events in all three groups were neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anaemia, and febrile neutropenia or infections.13 (6%) patients died of toxicity.INTERPRETATION: With the limitations of a randomised phase 2 study design, the IELSG32 trial provides a high level of evidence supporting the use of MATRix combination as the new standard chemoimmunotherapy for patients aged up to 70 years with newly diagnosed primary CNS lymphoma and as the control group for future randomised trials.FUNDING: Associazione Italiana del Farmaco, Cancer Research UK, Oncosuisse, and Swiss National Foundation.",0,0,0,0

27209164,"BEVERLY: Rationale and Design of a Randomized Open-Label Phase III Trial Comparing Bevacizumab Plus Erlotinib Versus Erlotinib Alone as First-Line Treatment of Patients With EGFR-Mutated Advanced Nonsquamous Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.BACKGROUND: About 20% of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases harbor somatic mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene.In these patients, the standard first-line treatments are the EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as gefitinib, erlotinib, or afatinib.Most of these patients develop resistance and relapse within about 1 year of initiation of an EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor.Consequently, it is important to develop new combination strategies to delay this resistance.Preclinical data have showed that EGFR and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) share a common downstream pathway, suggesting the important role of VEGF in the resistance to EGFR blockade.The combination of erlotinib and bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF agent, showed very interesting clinical results.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The bevacizumab plus erlotinib study (BEVERLY) is a randomized, open-label, phase III trial investigating first-line erlotinib plus bevacizumab versus erlotinib in patients with advanced NSCLC harboring activating EGFR mutations.The co-primary endpoints are investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) and blinded, independent centrally reviewed PFS.The secondary endpoints include overall survival, quality of life, objective response rate, and safety.A total of 200 patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive oral erlotinib (150 mg daily) plus bevacizumab (15 mg/kg, intravenously, on day 1 of every 21-day cycle) or erlotinib alone, until objective disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or the patient's or physician's motivated decision to stop the treatment.CONCLUSION: If the primary endpoint of PFS is met, the erlotinib plus bevacizumab combination will be confirmed as the best first-line treatment for patients with advanced NSCLC harboring activating EGFR mutations.",1,1,0,0
27220897,"Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography May Improve the Diagnostic Accuracy of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Localized Prostate Cancer.PURPOSE: Positron emission tomography using ligands targeting prostate specific membrane antigen has recently been introduced.Positron emission tomography imaging with (68)Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC has been shown to detect metastatic prostate cancer lesions at a high rate.In this study we compare multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and prostate specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography of the prostate with whole mount ex vivo prostate histopathology to determine the true sensitivity and specificity of these imaging modalities for detecting and locating tumor foci within the prostate.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a prospective clinical trial setting 20 patients with localized prostate cancer and a planned radical prostatectomy were recruited.All patients underwent multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography before surgery, and whole mount histopathology slides were directly compared to the images.European Society of Urogenital Radiology guidelines for reporting magnetic resonance imaging were used as a template for regional units of analysis.The uropathologist and radiologists were blinded to individual components of the study, and the final correlation was performed by visual and deformable registration analysis.RESULTS: A total of 50 clinically significant lesions were identified from the whole mount histopathological analysis.Based on regional analysis the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging were 44%, 94%, 81% and 76%, respectively.With prostate specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 49%, 95%, 85% and 88%, respectively.Prostate specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography yielded a higher specificity and positive predictive value.CONCLUSIONS: A significant proportion of cancers are potentially missed and underestimated by both imaging modalities.Prostate specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography may be used in addition to multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging to help improve local staging in those patients undergoing retropubic radical prostatectomy.",0,0,0,0
27228002,"Serum anti-Mullerian hormone levels after ovarian drilling for the second-line treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome: a pilot-randomized study comparing laparoscopy and transvaginal hydrolaparoscopy.Aim of the study was to asses and compare serum anti-Mullerian harmone (AMH) levels after laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD) and transvaginal hydrolaparoscopy (THL) ovarian drilling in clomifene citrate (CC)-resistant polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients; secondary outcome was to evaluate postoperative pain to estimate the acceptability of procedures.A total of 246 patients with CC-resistant PCOS were randomized into two groups: 123 underwent LOD and 123 underwent THL ovarian drilling.AMH serum levels were evaluated before and after the procedure; moreover, women were asked to rate pain on a visual analog scale (VAS) from 0 (no pain, perfectly acceptable) to 10 (unbearable pain, completely unacceptable).In both groups, postoperative serum AMH levels were significantly reduced compared to preoperative levels (6.06 +/- 1.18 and 5.84 +/- 1.16 versus 5.00 +/- 1.29 and 4.83 +/- 1.10; p < 0.0001).Comparing postoperative serum AMH levels, no statistically significant difference was observed between the two surgical technique.After the procedure, mean pain VAS score was significantly higher for women who underwent LOD ovarian drilling in comparison to THL (3.26 +/- 1.1 versus 1.11 +/- 0.5; p < 0.0001).In conclusion, THL ovarian drilling is comparable to the LOD in terms of reduction in AMH, but it is preferred by patients in terms of acceptability.These results could support to use of THL ovarian drilling in the treatment of patients with CC- resistant PCOS.",0,0,0,0
27228369,"Baseline AMH Level Associated With Ovulation Following Ovulation Induction in Women With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome.CONTEXT: Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) reduces aromatase activity and sensitivity of follicles to FSH stimulation.Therefore, elevated serum AMH may indicate a higher threshold for response to ovulation induction in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).OBJECTIVE: This study sought to determine the association between AMH levels and ovulatory response to treatment among the women enrolled into the Pregnancy in PCOS II (PPCOS II) trial.DESIGN AND SETTING: This was a secondary analysis of data from a randomized clinical trial in academic health centers throughout the United States Participants: A total of 748 women age 18-40 years, with PCOS and measured AMH levels at baseline, were included in this study.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Couples were followed for up to five treatment cycles to determine ovulation (midluteal serum progesterone > 5 ng/mL) and the dose required to achieve ovulation.RESULTS: A lower mean AMH and AMH per follicle was observed among women who ovulated compared with women who never achieved ovulation during the study (geometric mean AMH, 5.54 vs 7.35 ng/mL; P = .0001; geometric mean AMH per follicle, 0.14 vs 0.18; P = .01) after adjustment for age, body mass index, T, and insulin level.As AMH levels increased, the dose of ovulation induction medication needed to achieve ovulation also increased.No associations were observed between antral follicle count and ovulation.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that high serum AMH is associated with a reduced response to ovulation induction among women with PCOS.Women with higher AMH levels may require higher doses of medication to achieve ovulation.",0,0,0,0

27283862,"Occurrence and lung cancer probability of new solid nodules at incidence screening with low-dose CT: analysis of data from the randomised, controlled NELSON trial.BACKGROUND: US guidelines now recommend lung cancer screening with low-dose CT for high-risk individuals.Reports of new nodules after baseline screening have been scarce and are inconsistent because of differences in definitions used.We aimed to identify the occurrence of new solid nodules and their probability of being lung cancer at incidence screening rounds in the Dutch-Belgian Randomized Lung Cancer Screening Trial (NELSON).METHODS: In the ongoing, multicentre, randomised controlled NELSON trial, between Dec 23, 2003, and July 6, 2006, 15 822 participants who had smoked at least 15 cigarettes a day for more than 25 years or ten cigarettes a day for more than 30 years and were current smokers, or had quit smoking less than 10 years ago, were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive either screening with low-dose CT (n=7915) or no screening (n=7907).From Jan 28, 2004, to Dec 18, 2006, 7557 individuals underwent baseline screening with low-dose CT; 7295 participants underwent second and third screening rounds.We included all participants with solid non-calcified nodules, registered by the NELSON radiologists as new or smaller than 15 mm(3) (study detection limit) at previous screens.Nodule volume was generated semiautomatically by software.We calculated the maximum volume doubling time for nodules with an estimated percentage volume change of 25% or more, representing the minimum growth rate for the time since the previous scan.Lung cancer diagnosis was based on histology, and benignity was based on histology or stable size for at least 2 years.The NELSON trial is registered at trialregister.nl, number ISRCTN63545820.FINDINGS: We analysed data for participants with at least one solid non-calcified nodule at the second or third screening round.In the two incidence screening rounds, the NELSON radiologists registered 1222 new solid nodules in 787 (11%) participants.A new solid nodule was lung cancer in 49 (6%) participants with new solid nodules and, in total, 50 lung cancers were found, representing 4% of all new solid nodules.34 (68%) lung cancers were diagnosed at stage I. Nodule volume had a high discriminatory power (area under the receiver operating curve 0.795 [95% CI 0.728-0.862]; p<0.0001).Nodules smaller than 27 mm(3) had a low probability of lung cancer (two [0.5%] of 417 nodules; lung cancer probability 0.5% [95% CI 0.0-1.9]), nodules with a volume of 27 mm(3) up to 206 mm(3) had an intermediate probability (17 [3.1%] of 542 nodules; lung cancer probability 3.1% [1.9-5.0]), and nodules of 206 mm(3) or greater had a high probability (29 [16.9%] of 172 nodules; lung cancer probability 16.9% [12.0-23.2]).A volume cutoff value of 27 mm(3) or greater had more than 95% sensitivity for lung cancer.INTERPRETATION: Our study shows that new solid nodules are detected at each screening round in 5-7% of individuals who undergo screening for lung cancer with low-dose CT.These new nodules have a high probability of malignancy even at a small size.These findings should be considered in future screening guidelines, and new solid nodules should be followed up more aggressively than nodules detected at baseline screening.FUNDING: Zorgonderzoek Nederland Medische Wetenschappen and Koningin Wilhelmina Fonds Kankerbestrijding.",0,0,0,0

27325147,"Adrenal vein sampling versus CT scan to determine treatment in primary aldosteronism: an outcome-based randomised diagnostic trial.BACKGROUND: The distinction between unilateral aldosterone-producing adenoma or bilateral adrenal hyperplasia as causes of primary aldosteronism is usually made by adrenal CT or by adrenal vein sampling (AVS).Whether CT or AVS represents the best test for diagnosis remains unknown.We aimed to compare the outcome of CT-based management with AVS-based management for patients with primary aldosteronism.METHODS: In a randomised controlled trial, we randomly assigned patients with aldosteronism to undergo either adrenal CT or AVS to determine the presence of aldosterone-producing adenoma (with subsequent treatment consisting of adrenalectomy) or bilateral adrenal hyperplasia (subsequent treatment with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists).The primary endpoint was the intensity of drug treatment for obtaining target blood pressure after 1 year of follow-up, in the intention-to-diagnose population.Intensity of drug treatment was expressed as daily defined doses.Key secondary endpoints included biochemical outcome in patients who received adrenalectomy, health-related quality of life, cost-effectiveness, and adverse events.This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01096654.FINDINGS: We recruited 200 patients between July 6, 2010, and May 30, 2013.Of the 184 patients that completed follow-up, 92 received CT-based treatment (46 adrenalectomy and 46 mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist) and 92 received AVS-based treatment (46 adrenalectomy and 46 mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist).We found no differences in the intensity of antihypertensive medication required to control blood pressure between patients with CT-based treatment and those with AVS-based treatment (median daily defined doses 3.0 [IQR 1.0-5.0] vs 3.0 [1.1-5.9], p=0.52; median number of drugs 2 [IQR 1-3] vs 2 [1-3], p=0.87).Target blood pressure was reached in 39 (42%) patients and 41 (45%) patients, respectively (p=0.82).On secondary endpoints we found no differences in health-related quality of life (median RAND-36 physical scores 52.7 [IQR 43.9-56.8] vs 53.2 [44.0-56.8], p=0.83; RAND-36 mental scores 49.8 [43.1-54.6] vs 52.7 [44.9-55.5], p=0.17) for CT-based and AVS-based treatment.Biochemically, 37 (80%) of patients with CT-based adrenalectomy and 41 (89%) of those with AVS-based adrenalectomy had resolved hyperaldosteronism (p=0.25).A non-significant mean difference of 0.05 (95% CI -0.04 to 0.13) in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) was found to the advantage of the AVS group, associated with a significant increase in mean health-care costs of euro2285 per patient (95% CI 1323-3248).At a willingness-to-pay value of euro30 000 per QALY, the probability that AVS compared with CT constitutes an efficient use of health-care resources in the diagnostic work-up of patients with primary aldosteronism is less than 0.2.There was no difference in adverse events between groups (159 events of which nine were serious vs 187 events of which 12 were serious) for CT-based and AVS-based treatment.INTERPRETATION: Treatment of primary aldosteronism based on CT or AVS did not show significant differences in intensity of antihypertensive medication or clinical benefits for patients after 1 year of follow-up.This finding challenges the current recommendation to perform AVS in all patients with primary aldosteronism.FUNDING: Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development-Medical Sciences, Institute of Cardiology, Warsaw.",0,0,0,0
27332902,"Adapted Treatment Guided by Interim PET-CT Scan in Advanced Hodgkin's Lymphoma.BACKGROUND: We tested interim positron-emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) as a measure of early response to chemotherapy in order to guide treatment for patients with advanced Hodgkin's lymphoma.METHODS: Patients with newly diagnosed advanced classic Hodgkin's lymphoma underwent a baseline PET-CT scan, received two cycles of ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine) chemotherapy, and then underwent an interim PET-CT scan.Images were centrally reviewed with the use of a 5-point scale for PET findings.Patients with negative PET findings after two cycles were randomly assigned to continue ABVD (ABVD group) or omit bleomycin (AVD group) in cycles 3 through 6.Those with positive PET findings after two cycles received BEACOPP (bleomycin, etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone).Radiotherapy was not recommended for patients with negative findings on interim scans.The primary outcome was the difference in the 3-year progression-free survival rate between randomized groups, a noninferiority comparison to exclude a difference of 5 or more percentage points.RESULTS: A total of 1214 patients were registered; 937 of the 1119 patients (83.7%) who underwent an interim PET-CT scan according to protocol had negative findings.With a median follow-up of 41 months, the 3-year progression-free survival rate and overall survival rate in the ABVD group were 85.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 82.1 to 88.6) and 97.2% (95% CI, 95.1 to 98.4), respectively; the corresponding rates in the AVD group were 84.4% (95% CI, 80.7 to 87.5) and 97.6% (95% CI, 95.6 to 98.7).The absolute difference in the 3-year progression-free survival rate (ABVD minus AVD) was 1.6 percentage points (95% CI, -3.2 to 5.3).Respiratory adverse events were more severe in the ABVD group than in the AVD group.BEACOPP was given to the 172 patients with positive findings on the interim scan, and 74.4% had negative findings on a third PET-CT scan; the 3-year progression-free survival rate was 67.5% and the overall survival rate 87.8%.A total of 62 patients died during the trial (24 from Hodgkin's lymphoma), for a 3-year progression-free survival rate of 82.6% and an overall survival rate of 95.8%.CONCLUSIONS: Although the results fall just short of the specified noninferiority margin, the omission of bleomycin from the ABVD regimen after negative findings on interim PET resulted in a lower incidence of pulmonary toxic effects than with continued ABVD but not significantly lower efficacy.(Funded by Cancer Research UK and Others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00678327.).",0,0,0,0

27381209,"Protocol of the Australasian Malignant Pleural Effusion-2 (AMPLE-2) trial: a multicentre randomised study of aggressive versus symptom-guided drainage via indwelling pleural catheters.INTRODUCTION: Malignant pleural effusions (MPEs) can complicate most cancers, causing dyspnoea and impairing quality of life (QoL).Indwelling pleural catheters (IPCs) are a novel management approach allowing ambulatory fluid drainage and are increasingly used as an alternative to pleurodesis.IPC drainage approaches vary greatly between centres.Some advocate aggressive (usually daily) removal of fluid to provide best symptom control and chance of spontaneous pleurodesis.Daily drainages however demand considerably more resources and may increase risks of complications.Others believe that MPE care is palliative and drainage should be performed only when patients become symptomatic (often weekly to monthly).Identifying the best drainage approach will optimise patient care and healthcare resource utilisation.METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A multicentre, open-label randomised trial.Patients with MPE will be randomised 1:1 to daily or symptom-guided drainage regimes after IPC insertion.Patient allocation to groups will be stratified for the cancer type (mesothelioma vs others), performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group status 0-1 vs >/=2), presence of trapped lung (vs not) and prior pleurodesis (vs not).The primary outcome is the mean daily dyspnoea score, measured by a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS) over the first 60 days.Secondary outcomes include benefits on physical activity levels, rate of spontaneous pleurodesis, complications, hospital admission days, healthcare costs and QoL measures.Enrolment of 86 participants will detect a mean difference of VAS score of 14 mm between the treatment arms (5% significance, 90% power) assuming a common between-group SD of 18.9 mm and a 10% lost to follow-up rate.ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Sir Charles Gairdner Group Human Research Ethics Committee has approved the study (number 2015-043).Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at scientific meetings.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ACTRN12615000963527; Pre-results.",0,0,0,0
27382257,"Fondaparinux vs warfarin for the treatment of unsuspected pulmonary embolism in cancer patients.INTRODUCTION: In cancer patients, the chest computer tomography (CT) can be used to identify asymptomatic pulmonary embolism (APE).In most cases, these patients are treated with anticoagulant drugs for at least 3 months.The American College of Physicians recommend treatment of these patients as patients with symptomatic pulmonary embolism.In this study, we evaluated and compared the efficacy and safety of fondaparinux vs warfarin in the prevention of unsuspected pulmonary embolism in patients with active cancer.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective and parallel group study was performed on 64 cancer patients (29 males and 35 females) with APE.A multidetector CT angiography with high spatial and temporal resolution and quality of arterial opacification was used to make the diagnosis.Lung scintigraphy was reserved to selected patients only.Patients were randomized to either the warfarin (Group A) or the fondaparinux (Group B) for 90 days.The first end point of efficacy was the persistence, reduction, or disappearance of thrombosis after 90 days.The second end point was the reappearance of thrombosis after 1 year.The first end point of safety was the development of major bleeding.RESULTS: We enrolled 32 patients into each treatment group.We reached the first end point of efficacy and safety in Group B which showed that fondaparinux was able to induce the disappearance of thrombotic pulmonary with a lower incidence of major bleeding events compared with warfarin.No difference in the secondary end point was recorded.CONCLUSION: We suggest that the treatment of cancer patients with APE can be oriented with the administration of a standard dose of fondaparinux until the next CT lung control (3 months).However, the lack of a randomized clinical trial, including a larger patient cohort, does not allow formulation of final recommendations in these patients.A broader study would be desirable, involving a larger number of patients and a longer follow-up period.",0,0,0,0
27383814,"Effect of Triclosan-Coated Suture and Antibiotic Prophylaxis on Infection and Recurrence after Karydakis Flap Repair for Pilonidal Disease: A Randomized Parallel-Arm Double-Blinded Clinical Trial.BACKGROUND: Pilonidal sinus disease was first described by Mayo in 1833 as ""a cyst that contains hair."" Although surgical treatment of the lesions can have successful outcomes, it also can be associated with relatively high rates of post-operative infectioins and recurrence.Many studies have demonstrated that triclosan-coated sutures (TCS) decrease surgical site infections.OBJECTIVE: The goal of this randomized parallel-arm double-blind clinical trial was to investigate the ability of antibiotic prophylaxis, and secondarily of antibiotic-coated sutures, to prevent post-operative infections in the surgical management of pilonidal sinus disease.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The initial trial protocol aimed to compare early infections in patients who did and did not undergo antibiotic prophylaxis (AP(+) vs. AP(-)).A secondary goal was to compare the effects of TCS and conventional sutures (CS) on early infectious complication rates in the two groups.The AP(-) arm had to be terminated prematurely because of an unacceptably high rate of infectious complications.RESULTS: A total of 80 micro-organisms were recovered from 74 patients (69.8%).Methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most common isolates (30%).The most frequently detected anaerobic micro-organism was Actinomyces israelii (7.5%).The TCS and CS groups had similar rates of micro-organism growth (65.8% vs. 75.0%).There was no significant difference in the occurrence of wound dehiscence.Over the six-month follow-up, there were two recurrences, both in the TCS group.The difference was not significant.CONCLUSIONS: We believe that antibiotic prophylaxis is necessary in patients scheduled for Karydakis flap repair.In our study, TCS tended to be associated with a lower rate of infection, but this trend did not achieve statistical significance.Anaerobic micro-organisms dominated the infective isolates.",0,0,0,0

27387325,"A phase II trial comparing pazopanib with doxorubicin as first-line treatment in elderly patients with metastatic or advanced soft tissue sarcoma (EPAZ): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Anthracycline-based treatment remains the backbone of chemotherapy for nonresectable soft tissue sarcomas (STS).More than 30 % of patients with STS are aged 60 years or older, limiting the choice of treatment to single-agent approaches for this elderly population.Hematological toxicity is frequent during doxorubicin monotherapy, grade 4 neutropenia is reported in 34 %, with a febrile neutropenia rate of 9 % in STS.We assume that comorbidities in the elderly population may limit tolerability of doxorubicin, and novel agents may improve tolerability and health-related quality of life while maintaining efficacy.We therefore investigated whether the tyrosine kinase inhibitor pazopanib exerts such a clinical benefit in elderly patients with STS (pazopanib for elderly [the EPAZ study]).METHODS/DESIGN: This study is a randomized, controlled, open-label, multicenter, phase II noninferiority trial in which pazopanib 800 mg once daily is being compared six cycles of intravenous doxorubicin 75 mg/m(2) as first-line treatment in elderly patients (>/=60 years) with metastatic or advanced STS.A total of 120 patients will be randomized 1:2 to receive doxorubicin or pazopanib, stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (0-1 vs. 2) and liposarcoma histology (yes vs. no).The primary endpoint is progression-free survival based on local tumor assessment according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria.Secondary endpoints include grade 4 neutropenia and febrile neutropenia in hierarchical order, as well as overall survival, objective response rate, health-related quality of life, and geriatric assessments.DISCUSSION: Pazopanib is associated with promising tolerability according to previous studies and may offer a significant clinical advantage in first-line treatment of STS compared with doxorubicin.The elderly population seems especially appealing for such an approach, since these patients are not suitable for aggressive combination therapy.The EPAZ study will confirm whether pazopanib may be an alternative to toxic chemotherapy for elderly patients with STS.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01861951 ; registered on 11 April 2013.EudraCT 2011-004168-30; registered on 4 June 2012.",0,0,0,0
27390378,"Communicating Findings of Delayed Diagnostic Evaluation to Primary Care Providers.BACKGROUND: We previously found that an intervention involving electronic algorithms to detect delays in follow-up of cancer-related abnormal or ""red-flag"" findings and communicating this information to primary care providers (PCPs) led to more timely diagnostic evaluation.In this study, we examined the effectiveness of various communication strategies to inform PCPs about the delayed follow-up.METHODS: After identifying follow-up delays through electronic health record-based algorithms and record reviews, we communicated this information to PCPs using 3 escalating steps.First, we sent secure E-mails.If no evidence of follow-up was found in a medical record review after 1 week, we made up to 3 attempts to reach the PCPs or their nurses via telephone.If they could not be reached, we informed clinic directors as the third and final step.In this analysis, we evaluate PCPs' follow-up in response to these methods of communication.RESULTS: A total of 733 patients with follow-up delays were identified (369 patients in the intervention group and 364 patients in the control group).Communicating information to PCPs about possible follow-up delays led to decreased times to diagnostic evaluation, but communication related to delays did not always lead to follow-up for the patients in the intervention group.Specifically, secure E-mails led to follow-up in 11.1% of cases (41 of 369), telephone calls led to follow-up in 68.6% of cases (225 of 328), and contacting clinic directors led to follow-up in 5 of 11 cases in which communication escalated to this level.CONCLUSION: Strategies to communicate to PCPs information on delayed follow-up of findings suspicious for cancer were useful, but not fail-safe.Additional back-up strategies, such as using case coordinators, might be needed.",0,0,0,0

27430394,"Physical effects of Anma therapy (Japanese massage) for gynecologic cancer survivors: A randomized controlled trial.OBJECTIVES: Cancer survivors often have physical and psychological complaints after standard cancer treatment.We conducted a randomized control trial to evaluate the physical and psychological/emotional effects of Anma therapy (Japanese massage, AMT) in gynecologic cancer survivors.The primary objective was to verify the effects of 8 consecutive weeks of weekly AMT.The secondary objective was to confirm the immediate effects of single-session AMT.We report here results of the physical effects of AMT.METHODS: Forty participants were randomly allocated to an AMT group that received one 40-min AMT session per week for 8weeks and a no-AMT group.The primary endpoint was severity of subjective physical complaints assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS).Secondary endpoints were urine and saliva analyses and psychological/emotional questionnaire scores.RESULTS: In the primary analysis, least-squares means (LSM) estimates of VAS score improvement over the 8weeks were -21.5 (95% confidence interval [CI], -30.1 to -12.8, P=0.0017) in the AMT group (n=20) and 0.8 (95%CI, -7.7 to 9.2, P=0.89) in the no-AMT group (n=20).The difference in the LSM estimates between the groups was -22.2 (95%CI, -34.4 to -10.1, P=0.0007).There were significant differences in VAS score and urinary epinephrine between before and after the intervention session, demonstrating the superiority of AMT.CONCLUSIONS: A single AMT session reduces the severity of subjective physical complaints and might inhibit the sympathetic nervous system in gynecologic cancer survivors.Receiving weekly AMT sessions for eight weeks effectively continues to reduce the severity of subjective physical complaints.",0,0,0,0
27432930,"Effect of Interval (7 or 11 weeks) Between Neoadjuvant Radiochemotherapy and Surgery on Complete Pathologic Response in Rectal Cancer: A Multicenter, Randomized, Controlled Trial (GRECCAR-6).Purpose A pathologic complete response (pCR; ypT0N0) of a rectal tumor after neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy (RCT) is associated with an excellent prognosis.Several retrospective studies have investigated the effect of increasing the delay after RCT.The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of increasing the interval between the end of RCT and surgery on the pCR rate.Methods GRECCAR6 was a phase III, multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-group controlled trial.Patients with cT3/T4 or Tx N+ tumors of the mid or lower rectum who had received RCT (45 to 50 Gy with fluorouracil or capecitabine) were included.Patients were randomly included in the 7-week or the 11-week (11w) group.Primary end point was the pCR rate defined as a ypT0N0 specimen (NCT01648894).Results A total of 265 patients from 24 centers were enrolled between October 2012 and February 2015.The majority of the tumors were cT3 (82%).After RCT, surgery was not performed in nine patients (3.4%) because of the occurrence of distant metastasis (n = 5) or other reasons.Two patients underwent local resection of the tumor scar.A total of 47 (18.6%) specimens were classified as ypT0 (four had invaded lymph nodes [8.5%]).The primary end point (ypT0N0) was not different (7 weeks: 20 of 133, 15.0% v 11w: 23 of 132, 17.4%; P = .5983).Morbidity was significantly increased in the 11w group (44.5% v 32%; P = .0404) as a result of increased medical complications (32.8% v 19.2%; P = .0137).The 11w group had a worse quality of mesorectal resection (complete mesorectum [I] 78.7% v 90%; P = .0156).Conclusion Waiting 11 weeks after RCT did not increase the rate of pCR after surgical resection.A longer waiting period may be associated with higher morbidity and more difficult surgical resection.",0,0,0,0
27433356,"Race or Resource? BMI, Race, and Other Social Factors as Risk Factors for Interlimb Differences among Overweight Breast Cancer Survivors with Lymphedema.Introduction.High BMI is a risk factor for upper body breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) onset.Black cancer survivors are more likely to have high BMI than White cancer survivors.While observational analyses suggest up to 2.2 times increased risk of BCRL onset for Black breast cancer survivors, no studies have explored race or other social factors that may affect BCRL severity, operationalized by interlimb volume difference (ILD).Materials and Methods.ILD was measured by perometry for 296 overweight (25 > BMI < 50) Black (n = 102) or White (n = 194) breast cancer survivors (>6 months from treatment) in the WISER Survivor trial.Multivariable linear regression examined associations between social and physical factors and ILD.Results.Neither Black race (-0.26, p = 0.89) nor BMI (0.22, p = 0.10) was associated with ILD.Attending college (-4.89, p = 0.03) was the strongest factor associated with ILD, followed by having more lymph nodes removed (4.75, p = 0.01), >25% BCRL care adherence (4.10, p = 0.01), and years since treatment (0.55, p < 0.001).Discussion.Neither race nor BMI was associated with ILD among overweight cancer survivors.Education, a proxy for resource level, was the strongest factor associated with greater ILD.Tailoring physical activity and weight loss interventions designed to address BCRL severity by resource rather than race should be considered.",0,0,0,0
27434595,"TRAPEZE: a randomised controlled trial of the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of chemotherapy with zoledronic acid, strontium-89, or both, in men with bony metastatic castration-refractory prostate cancer.BACKGROUND: Bony metastatic castration-refractory prostate cancer is associated with a poor prognosis and high morbidity.TRAPEZE was a two-by-two factorial randomised controlled trial of zoledronic acid (ZA) and strontium-89 (Sr-89), each combined with docetaxel.All have palliative benefits, are used to control bone symptoms and are used with docetaxel to prolong survival.ZA, approved on the basis of reducing skeletal-related events (SREs), is commonly combined with docetaxel in practice, although evidence of efficacy and cost-effectiveness is lacking.Sr-89, approved for controlling metastatic pain and reducing need for subsequent bone treatments, is generally palliatively used in patients unfit for chemotherapy.Phase II analysis confirmed the safety and feasibility of combining these agents.TRAPEZE aimed to determine the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of each agent.METHODS: Patients were randomised to receive six cycles of docetaxel plus prednisolone: alone, with ZA, with a single Sr-89 dose after cycle 6, or with both.Primary outcomes were clinical progression-free survival (CPFS: time to pain progression, SRE or death) and cost-effectiveness.Secondary outcomes were SRE-free interval (SREFI), total SREs, overall survival (OS) and quality of life (QoL).Log-rank test and Cox regression modelling were used to determine clinical effectiveness.Cost-effectiveness was assessed from the NHS perspective and expressed as cost per additional quality-adjusted life-year (QALY).An additional analysis was carried out for ZA to reflect the availability of generic ZA.RESULTS: PATIENTS: 757 randomised (median age 68.7 years; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group scale score 0, 40%; 1, 52%; 2, 8%; prior radiotherapy, 45%); median prostate-specific antigen 143.78 ng/ml (interquartile range 50.8-353.9 ng/ml).Stratified log-rank analysis of CPFS was statistically non-significant for either agent (Sr-89, p = 0.11; ZA, p = 0.45).Cox regression analysis adjusted for stratification variables showed CPFS benefit for Sr-89 [hazard ratio (HR) 0.845, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 0.99; p = 0.036] and confirmed no effect of ZA (p = 0.46).ZA showed a significant SREFI effect (HR 0.76; 95% CI 0.63 to 0.93; p = 0.008).Neither agent affected OS (Sr-89, p = 0.74; ZA, p = 0.91), but both increased total cost (vs. no ZA and no Sr-89, respectively); decreased post-trial therapies partly offset costs [net difference: Sr-89 pound1341; proprietary ZA (Zometa((R)), East Hanover, NJ, USA) pound1319; generic ZA pound251].QoL was maintained in all trial arms; Sr-89 (0.08 additional QALYs) and ZA (0.03 additional QALYs) showed slight improvements.The resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for Sr-89 was pound16,590, with pound42,047 per QALY for Zometa and pound8005 per QALY for generic ZA.CONCLUSION: Strontium-89 improved CPFS, but not OS.ZA did not improve CPFS or OS but significantly improved SREFI, mostly post progression, suggesting a role as post-chemotherapy maintenance therapy.QoL was well maintained in all treatment arms, with differing patterns of care resulting from the effects of Sr-89 on time to progression and ZA on SREFI and total SREs.The addition of Sr-89 resulted in additional cost and a small positive increase in QALYs, with an ICER below the pound20,000 ceiling per QALY.The additional costs and small positive QALY changes in favour of ZA resulted in ICERs of pound42,047 (Zometa) and pound8005 for the generic alternative; thus, generic ZA represents a cost-effective option.Additional analyses on the basis of data from the Hospital Episode Statistics data set would allow corroborating the findings of this study.Further research into the use of ZA (and other bone-targeting therapies) with newer prostate cancer therapies would be desirable.STUDY REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN12808747.FUNDING: This project was funded by the NIHR Health Technology Assessment programme and will be published in full in Health Technology Assessment; Vol. 20, No. 53.See the NIHR Journals Library website for further project information.",0,0,0,0

CONCLUSIONS: In this group of patients with spinal bone metastases we were able to show that guided resistance training of the paravertebral muscles had no essential impact on survival concomitant to RT.Importantly, no local bone progression in group A was detected, nevertheless no prognostic factor for combined treatment could be evaluated.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical trial identifier NCT 01409720 .Registered 8 February 2011.",0,0,0,0
27480145,"Modified FOLFOX6 With or Without Radiation Versus Fluorouracil and Leucovorin With Radiation in Neoadjuvant Treatment of Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer: Initial Results of the Chinese FOWARC Multicenter, Open-Label, Randomized Three-Arm Phase III Trial.PURPOSE: Total mesorectal excision with fluorouracil-based preoperative chemoradiotherapy and postoperative chemotherapy is a standard treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer.This study investigated the addition of oxaliplatin with and without preoperative radiotherapy.METHODS: In this multicenter, open-label, phase III trial, we randomly assigned (1:1:1) Chinese adults (age 18 to 75 years) with locally advanced stage II/III rectal cancer to three treatments: five 2-week cycles of infusional fluorouracil (leucovorin 400 mg/m(2), fluorouracil 400 mg/m(2), and fluorouracil 2.4 g/m(2) over 48 h) plus radiotherapy (46.0 to 50.4 Gy delivered in 23 to 25 fractions during cycles 2 through 4) followed by surgery and seven cycles of infusional fluorouracil, the same treatment plus intravenous oxaliplatin 85 mg/m(2) on day 1 of each cycle (modified FOLFOX6 [mFOLFOX6]), or four to six cycles of mFOLFOX6 followed by surgery and six to eight cycles of mFOLFOX6.Random assignment was performed by using computer-generated block randomization codes.The primary end point was 3-year disease-free survival.Secondary end points of histopathologic response and toxicity are reported.RESULTS: A total of 495 patients were enrolled from June 2010 to February 2015; 475 were evaluable (fluorouracil-radiotherapy, n = 155; mFOLFOX6-radiotherapy, n = 157; mFOLFOX6, n = 163).In the fluorouracil-radiotherapy, mFOLFOX6-radiotherapy, and mFOLFOX6 groups, the rate of pathologic complete response (pCR) was 14.0%, 27.5%, and 6.6%, and downstaging (ypStage 0 to 1) was achieved by 37.1%, 56.4%, and 35.5% of patients, respectively.Higher toxicity and more postoperative complications were observed in patients who received radiotherapy.CONCLUSION: mFOLFOX6-based preoperative chemoradiotherapy results in a higher pCR rate than fluorouracil-based treatment.Perioperative mFOLFOX6 alone had inferior results and a lower pCR rate than chemoradiotherapy but led to a similar downstaging rate as fluorouracil-radiotherapy, with less toxicity and fewer postoperative complications.",0,0,0,0

A prospective, randomized trial.BACKGROUND: Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (E.R.A.S.) programs are now widely accepted in colonic laparoscopic resections because of faster recovery and less perioperative complications.The aim of this study was to assess safety and feasibility of discharging patients operated on by laparoscopic colectomy on postoperative day 2, so long as the first flatus has passed and in the absence of complication-related symptoms.METHODS: This study was a non-inferiority, open-label, single-center, prospective, randomized study comparing ""Ultra"" to Classic E.R.A.S. with discharge on POD 2 and 4, respectively.Seven hundred and sixty-five patients with resectable non-metastatic colonic cancer were analyzed: 384 patients were assigned to ""Ultra"" E.R.A.S. and 381 to Classic E.R.A.S. Primary end-point was mortality; secondary end-points were morbidity, readmission and reoperation rate.Limitations are: it is a single-center experience; it is not double-blind, with the intrinsic risk of intentional or unconscious bias; exclusion criteria because of ""non-compliance"" may be considered arbitrary.RESULTS: Mortality was 0.89 % in ""Ultra"" E.R.A.S. group and 0.59 % in Classic E.R.A.S. (p = 0.571).Morbidity was 34.1 % for ""Ultra"" E.R.A.S. arm and 35.4 % for Classic E.R.A.S. (p = 0.753).Readmissions were 5.6 % for ""Ultra"" E.R.A.S. and 5.9 % for Classic E.R.A.S. (p = 0.359).Reoperation rate was 3.8 % for ""Ultra"" ERAS and 4.7 % for Classic E.R.A.S.

27634489,"Hughes Abdominal Repair Trial (HART) - Abdominal wall closure techniques to reduce the incidence of incisional hernias: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Incisional hernias are common complications of midline closure following abdominal surgery and cause significant morbidity, impaired quality of life and increased health care costs.The 'Hughes Repair' combines a standard mass closure with a series of horizontal and two vertical mattress sutures within a single suture.This theoretically distributes the load along the incision length as well as across it.There is evidence to suggest that this technique is as effective as mesh repair for the operative management of incisional hernias; however, no trials have compared the Hughes Repair with standard mass closure for the prevention of incisional hernia formation following a midline incision.METHODS/DESIGN: This is a 1:1 randomised controlled trial comparing two suture techniques for the closure of the midline abdominal wound following surgery for colorectal cancer.Full ethical approval has been gained (Wales REC 3, MREC 12/WA/0374).Eight hundred patients will be randomised from approximately 20 general surgical units within the United Kingdom.Patients undergoing open or laparoscopic (more than a 5-cm midline incision) surgery for colorectal cancer, elective or emergency, are eligible.Patients under the age of 18 years, those having mesh inserted or undergoing musculofascial flap closure of the perineal defect in abdominoperineal wound closure, and those unable to give informed consent will be excluded.Patients will be randomised intraoperatively to either the Hughes Repair or standard mass closure.The primary outcome measure is the incidence of incisional hernias at 1 year as assessed by standardised clinical examination.The secondary outcomes include quality of life patient-reported outcome measures, cost-utility analysis, incidence of complete abdominal wound dehiscence and C-POSSUM scores.The incidence of incisional hernia at 1 year, assessed by computerised tomography, will form a tertiary outcome.DISCUSSION: A feasibility phase has been completed.The results of the study will be used to inform current and future practice and potentially reduce the risk of incisional hernia formation following midline incisions.TRIAL REGISTRATION: TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN 25616490 .Registered on 1 January 2012.",0,0,0,0

27914822,"Effects of sodium thiosulfate versus observation on development of cisplatin-induced hearing loss in children with cancer (ACCL0431): a multicentre, randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Sodium thiosulfate is an antioxidant shown in preclinical studies in animals to prevent cisplatin-induced hearing loss with timed administration after cisplatin without compromising the antitumour efficacy of cisplatin.The primary aim of this study was to assess sodium thiosulfate for prevention of cisplatin-induced hearing loss in children and adolescents.METHODS: ACCL0431 was a multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial that enrolled participants at 38 participating Children's Oncology Group hospitals in the USA and Canada.Eligible participants aged 1-18 years with newly diagnosed cancer and normal audiometry were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive sodium thiosulfate or observation (control group) in addition to their planned cisplatin-containing chemotherapy regimen, using permuted blocks of four.Randomisation was initially stratified by age and duration of cisplatin infusion.Stratification by previous cranial irradiation was added later as a protocol amendment.The allocation sequence was computer-generated centrally and concealed to all personnel.Participants received sodium thiosulfate 16 g/m(2) intravenously 6 h after each cisplatin dose or observation.The primary endpoint was incidence of hearing loss 4 weeks after final cisplatin dose.Hearing was measured using standard audiometry and reviewed centrally by audiologists masked to allocation using American Speech-Language-Hearing Association criteria but treatment was not masked for participants or clinicians.Analysis of the primary endpoint was by modified intention to treat, which included all randomly assigned patients irrespective of treatment received but restricted to those assessable for hearing loss.Enrolment is complete and this report represents the final analysis.This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00716976.FINDINGS: Between June 23, 2008, and Sept 28, 2012, 125 eligible participants were randomly assigned to either sodium thiosulfate (n=61) or observation (n=64).Of these, 104 participants were assessable for the primary endpoint (sodium thiosulfate, n=49; control, n=55).Hearing loss was identified in 14 (28.6%; 95% CI 16.6-43.3) participants in the sodium thiosulfate group compared with 31 (56.4%; 42.3-69.7) in the control group (p=0.00022).Adjusted for stratification variables, the likelihood of hearing loss was significantly lower in the sodium thiosulfate group compared with the control group (odds ratio 0.31, 95% CI 0.13-0.73; p=0.0036).The most common grade 3-4 haematological adverse events reported, irrespective of attribution, were neutropenia (117 [66%] of 177 participant cycles in the sodium thiosulfate group vs 145 [65%] of 223 in the control group), whereas the most common non-haematological adverse event was hypokalaemia (25 [17%] of 147 vs 22 [12%] of 187).Of 194 serious adverse events reported in 26 participants who had received sodium thiosulfate, none were deemed probably or definitely related to sodium thiosulfate; the most common serious adverse event was decreased neutrophil count: 26 episodes in 14 participants.INTERPRETATION: Sodium thiosulfate protects against cisplatin-induced hearing loss in children and is not associated with serious adverse events attributed to its use.Further research is needed to define the appropriate role for sodium thiosulfate among emerging otoprotection strategies.FUNDING: US National Cancer Institute.",0,0,0,0
27926458,"Changes in relative and absolute concentrations of plasma phospholipid fatty acids observed in a randomized trial of Omega-3 fatty acids supplementation in Uganda.Expressing circulating phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) in relative concentrations has some limitations: the total of all fatty acids are summed to 100%; therefore, the values of individual fatty acid are not independent.In this study we examined if both relative and absolute metrics could effectively measure changes in circulating PLFA concentrations in an intervention trial.66 HIV and HHV8 infected patients in Uganda were randomized to take 3g/d of either long-chain omega-3 fatty acids (1856mg EPA and 1232mg DHA) or high-oleic safflower oil in a 12-week double-blind trial.Plasma samples were collected at baseline and end of trial.Relative weight percentage and absolute concentrations of 41 plasma PLFAs were measured using gas chromatography.Total cholesterol was also measured.Intervention-effect changes in concentrations were calculated as differences between end of 12-week trial and baseline.Pearson correlations of relative and absolute concentration changes in individual PLFAs were high (>0.6) for 37 of the 41 PLFAs analyzed.In the intervention arm, 17 PLFAs changed significantly in relative concentration and 16 in absolute concentration, 15 of which were identical.Absolute concentration of total PLFAs decreased 95.1mg/L (95% CI: 26.0, 164.2; P=0.0085), but total cholesterol did not change significantly in the intervention arm.No significant change was observed in any of the measurements in the placebo arm.Both relative weight percentage and absolute concentrations could effectively measure changes in plasma PLFA concentrations.EPA and DHA supplementation changes the concentrations of multiple plasma PLFAs besides EPA and DHA.Both relative weight percentage and absolute concentrations could effectively measure changes in plasma phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) concentrations.",0,0,0,0
27951450,"Dose-dense adjuvant chemotherapy in premenopausal breast cancer patients: A pooled analysis of the MIG1 and GIM2 phase III studies.BACKGROUND: No evidence exists to recommend a specific chemotherapy regimen in young breast cancer patients.We performed a pooled analysis of two randomised clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of adjuvant dose-dense chemotherapy in premenopausal breast cancer patients and its impact on the risk of treatment-induced amenorrhoea.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the MIG1 study, node-positive or high-risk node-negative patients were randomised to 6 cycles of fluorouracil/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide every 2 (dose-dense) or 3 (standard-interval) weeks.In the GIM2 study, node-positive patients were randomised to 4 cycles of dose-dense or standard-interval EC or FEC followed by 4 cycles of dose-dense or standard-interval paclitaxel.Using individual patient data, the hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival by means of a Cox proportional hazards model and the odds ratio for treatment-induced amenorrhoea through a logistic regression model were calculated for each study.A meta-analysis of the two studies was performed using the random effect model to compute the parameter estimates.RESULTS: A total of 1,549 patients were included.Dose-dense chemotherapy was associated with a significant improved overall survival as compared to standard-interval chemotherapy (HR, 0.71; 95% confidence intervals [CI], 0.54-0.95; p = 0.021).The pooled HRs were 0.78 (95% CI, 0.54-1.12) and 0.65 (95% CI, 0.40-1.06) for patients with hormone receptor-positive and -negative tumours, respectively (interaction p = 0.330).No increased risk of treatment-induced amenorrhoea was observed with dose-dense chemotherapy (odds ratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.80-1.25; p = 0.989).CONCLUSION: Dose-dense adjuvant chemotherapy may be considered the preferred treatment option in high-risk premenopausal breast cancer patients.",0,0,0,0

27957785,"A thymidylate synthase polymorphism is associated with increased risk for bone toxicity among children treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia.BACKGROUND: Bone fractures and osteonecrosis frequently complicate therapy for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).Bone toxicity has been associated with exposure to corticosteroids and methotrexate (MTX) and age greater than 10 years.We tested whether common genetic polymorphisms were associated with bone toxicity during treatment for ALL.PROCEDURE: A total of 615 of 794 children enrolled on Dana Farber Cancer Institute ALL Consortium protocol 05-001 (NCT00400946) met eligibility criteria for inclusion in this analysis.Nineteen candidate polymorphisms were selected a priori, targeting genes related to glucocorticoid metabolism, oxidative damage, and folate physiology.Polymorphisms were genotyped using either PCR-based allelic discrimination or PCR product length analysis.RESULTS: Twenty percent of subjects were homozygous for two 28 bp repeats (2R/2R, where 2R is two 28-nucleotide repeats within the 5' untranslated region [UTR] of the thymidylate synthase [TS] gene) within the 5' UTR of the gene for TS.This 2R/2R genotype was associated with increased risk of osteonecrosis among children younger than 10 years at diagnosis (multivariable hazard ratio [HR] 2.71; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.23-5.95; P = 0.013), and with bone fracture among children >/= 10 years (multivariable HR 2.10; 95% CI 1.11-3.96; P = 0.022).No significant association was observed between TS genotype and red blood cell (RBC) folate, RBC MTX, or relapse risk.CONCLUSIONS: A common genetic variant is associated with increased risk of osteonecrosis among children younger than 10 years at diagnosis and with bone fractures among older children.These findings suggest that children and adolescents with the 2R/2R TS genotype should be closely monitored for the development of bone toxicity during therapy for ALL, and support a clinical trial testing the efficacy of protective interventions specifically in this vulnerable population.",0,0,0,0
27981431,"Adjusting Overall Survival Estimates after Treatment Switching: a Case Study in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.BACKGROUND: If patients in oncology trials receive subsequent therapy, standard intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses may inaccurately estimate the overall survival (OS) effect of the investigational product.In this context, a post-hoc analysis of the phase 3 PREVAIL study was performed with the aim to compare enzalutamide with placebo in terms of OS, adjusting for potential confounding from switching to antineoplastic therapies that are not part of standard metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) treatment pathways in some jurisdictions.METHODS: The PREVAIL study, which included 1717 chemotherapy-naive men with mCRPC randomized to treatment with enzalutamide 160 mg/day or placebo, was stopped after a planned interim survival analysis revealed a benefit in favor of enzalutamide.Data from this cutoff point were confounded by switching from both arms and so were evaluated in terms of OS using two switching adjustment methods: the two-stage accelerated failure time model (two-stage method) and inverse probability of censoring weights (IPCW).RESULTS: Following adjustment for switching to nonstandard antineoplastic therapies by 14.8 (129/872 patients) and 21.3% (180/845 patients) of patients initially randomized to enzalutamide and placebo, respectively, the two-stage and IPCW methods both resulted in numerical reductions in the hazard ratio (HR) for OS [HR 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57-0.81 and HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.52-0.75, respectively] for enzalutamide compared to placebo versus the unadjusted ITT analysis (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.60-0.84).These results suggest a slightly greater effect of enzalutamide on OS than originally reported.CONCLUSION: In the PREVAIL study, switching to nonstandard antineoplastic mCRPC therapies resulted in the ITT analysis of primary data underestimating the benefit of enzalutamide on OS.",1,1,1,0
27983774,"Cost-effectiveness of indwelling pleural catheter compared with talc in malignant pleural effusion.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Malignant pleural effusion is associated with morbidity and mortality.A randomized controlled trial previously compared clinical outcomes and resource use with indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) and talc pleurodesis in this population.Using unpublished quality of life data, we estimate the cost-effectiveness of IPC compared with talc pleurodesis.METHODS: Healthcare utilization and costs were captured during the trial.Utility weights produced by the EuroQol Group five-dimensional three-level questionnaire and survival were used to determine quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained.The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated over the 1-year trial period.Sensitivity analysis used patient survival data and modelled additional nursing time required per week for catheter drainage.RESULTS: Utility scores, cost and QALYs gained did not differ significantly between groups.The ICER for IPC compared with talc was favorable at $US10 870 per QALY gained.IPC was less costly with a probability exceeding 95% of being cost-effective when survival was <14 weeks, and was more costly when 2-h nursing time per week was assumed for catheter drainage.CONCLUSION: IPC is cost-effective when compared with talc, although substantial uncertainty exists around this estimate.IPC appears most cost-effective in patients with limited survival.If significant nursing time is required for catheter drainage, IPC becomes less likely to be cost-effective.Either therapy may be considered as a first-line option in treating malignant pleural effusion in patients without history of prior pleurodesis, with consideration for patient survival, support and preferences.",0,0,0,0

28031424,"The DART Study: Results from the Dose-Escalation and Expansion Cohorts Evaluating the Combination of Dalantercept plus Axitinib in Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma.Purpose: Activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1) is a novel target in angiogenesis.Concurrent targeting of ALK1 and VEGF signaling results in augmented inhibition of tumor growth in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) xenograft models.Dalantercept is an ALK1-receptor fusion protein that acts as a ligand trap for bone morphogenetic proteins 9 and 10.The DART Study evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and antitumor activity of dalantercept plus axitinib in patients with advanced RCC and determined the optimal dose for further testing.Experimental Design: Patients received dalantercept 0.6, 0.9, or 1.2 mg/kg subcutaneously every 3 weeks plus axitinib 5 mg by mouth twice daily until disease progression or intolerance.Results: Twenty-nine patients were enrolled in the dose escalation (n = 15) and expansion (n = 14) cohorts.There were no dose-limiting toxicities or grade 4/5 treatment-related adverse events.In addition to common VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor effects, such as fatigue and diarrhea, commonly seen treatment-related adverse events were peripheral edema, epistaxis, pericardial effusion, and telangiectasia.The objective response rate by RECIST v1.1 was 25% with responses seen at all dose levels.The overall median progression-free survival was 8.3 months.Conclusions: The combination of dalantercept plus axitinib is well tolerated and associated with clinical activity.On the basis of safety and efficacy results, the 0.9 mg/kg dose level was chosen for further study in a randomized phase II trial of dalantercept plus axitinib versus placebo plus axitinib.Clin Cancer Res; 23(14); 3557-65.(c)2016 AACR.",0,0,0,0
28049139,"A randomized phase 2 study of MK-2206 versus everolimus in refractory renal cell carcinoma.Background: Activation of the phosphoinisitide-3 kinase (PI3K) pathway through mutation and constitutive upregulation has been described in renal cell carcinoma (RCC), making it an attractive target for therapeutic intervention.We performed a randomized phase II study in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy refractory patients to determine whether MK-2206, an allosteric inhibitor of AKT, was more efficacious than the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor everolimus.Patients and methods: A total of 43 patients were randomized in a 2:1 distribution, with 29 patients assigned to the MK-2206 arm and 14 to the everolimus arm.Progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary endpoint.Results: The trial was closed at the first futility analysis with an observed PFS of 3.68 months in the MK-2206 arm and 5.98 months in the everolimus arm.Dichotomous response rate profiles were seen in the MK-2206 arm with one complete response and three partial responses in the MK-2206 arm versus none in the everolimus arm.On the other hand, progressive disease was best response in 44.8% of MK2206 versus 14.3% of everolimus-treated patients.MK-2206 induced significantly more rash and pruritis than everolimus, and dose reduction occurred in 37.9% of MK-2206 versus 21.4% of everolimus-treated patients.Genomic analysis revealed that 57.1% of the patients in the PD group had either deleterious TP53 mutations or ATM mutations or deletions.In contrast, none of the patients in the non-PD group had TP53 or ATM defects.No predictive marker for response was observed in this small dataset.Conclusions: Dichotomous outcomes are observed when VEGF therapy refractory patients are treated with MK-2206, and MK-2206 does not demonstrate superiority to everolimus.Additionally, mutations in DNA repair genes are associated with early disease progression, indicating that dysregulation of DNA repair is associated with a more aggressive tumor phenotype in RCC.",1,1,1,1
28056902,"An objective and cross-sectional examination of sun-safe behaviours in New South Wales primary schools.BACKGROUND: Previous evaluations have supported the link between sun protection policies and improved sun protection behaviours.However these evaluations have relied on self-reported data.METHODS: A cross-sectional design as part of an ongoing 18-month cluster-controlled trial in primary schools (n = 20) was used.Researchers conducted direct observations to record students' hat use and teachers' use of sun protective measures during recess and lunch.Researchers also recorded the volume of sunscreen consumed in each school.RESULTS: Only 60% of primary school children wear a sun-safe hat during their breaks when observed using objective measures.Weak correlations were observed between the wearing of a sun-safe hat and a school's socio-economic status (r = 0.26).All other independent variables measured had only very weak correlations (r < 0.19) with sun-safe hat wearing behaviour of students.Sunscreen consumption by school students during the school day is negligible.CONCLUSIONS: A large percentage of NSW primary schools in this study wear sun-safe hats during the school day but this is well below what has been reported in previous national surveys.Given the finite resources of schools and the correlation, though small, with SES status for these behaviours, it behoves researchers to investigate low-cost solutions to these problems.Further qualitative data will also be needed to inform the enablers and barriers for sun-safe behaviour interventions to be adopted in NSW primary schools.",0,0,0,0
28061321,"Effect of Subcutaneous Sterile Vitamin E Ointment on Incisional Surgical Site Infection after Elective Laparoscopic Colorectal Cancer Surgery.BACKGROUND: Despite several interventions having been adopted to reduce the incidence of incisional surgical site infection (SSI), it still remains a challenge for surgeons, because incisional SSI is a common cause of health-care-associated infection, leading to increased morbidity, prolonged hospital stay, patient discomfort, and increased sanitary costs.The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect on incisional SSI of vitamin E ointment in the subcutaneous tissue of patients undergoing a laparoscopic colorectal surgical procedure.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A randomized study was performed.Patients with colorectal neoplasms undergoing an elective laparoscopic surgical procedure were included.The patients were randomized into two groups: Those patients undergoing a subcutaneous vitamin E ointment application (Group 1) and those patients who did not receive it (Group 2).Incisional SSI, post-operative pain, and analytical acute phase reactants were analyzed.RESULTS: There were 108 patients who were assessed for eligibility, and 101 patients were analyzed.The incisional SSI rate was 4% in Group 1 and 17.6% in Group 2 (p = 0.03).Mean post-operative pain, 24 hours after operation, was 17.3 +/- 10.5 mm in Group 1 and 31.9 +/- 18.9 mm in Group 2 (p < 0.001).Median hospital stay was six days in Group 1 and eight days in Group 2 (p < 0.001).White blood cell count was significantly lower in Group 1 (p < 0.001).CONCLUSION: The subcutaneous application of sterile vitamin E acetate ointment leads to a reduction in the incisional SSI rate, lower post-operative pain, and decrease in C-reactive protein and white blood cell count.",0,0,0,0
28071624,"Comparison of two different radiation fractionation schedules with concurrent chemotherapy in head and neck malignancy.INTRODUCTION: The worldwide incidence of head and neck malignancy exceeds half a million cases annually.In radiotherapy (RT), conventional fractionation comprises giving five fractions per week from Monday to Friday.Accelerated RT includes administration of six fractions per week is being advocated.It gives better locoregional control and the median overall treatment time is 39 days as compared to 46 days in conventional group.Our study involved comparison of conventional versus accelerated RT with concurrent chemotherapy, in evaluation of local control and toxicity in the two arms.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty patients of locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma head and neck region were studied.All the patients received cisplatin (30 mg/m2) weekly during the therapy.The patients received RT dose of 70 Gray (Gy) in 35 fractions (#).The patients were randomly assorted into two groups: Group 1 - Study group (n = 30) - Six fractions RT per week (Monday-Saturday).Group 2 - Control group (n = 30) - Five fractions RT per week (Monday-Friday).During and after the treatment, locoregional control, acute and late radiation toxicity were assessed.Results and Observation: There was no significant difference between the two schedules regarding locoregional control rate.The Grade 3 or higher acute toxicities were significantly higher in the accelerated arm although there was no significant difference in late toxicities between the two arms.CONCLUSION: Accelerated fractionation regimen was not more efficacious than conventional fractionation in the treatment of previously untreated head and neck carcinoma.",0,0,0,0
28076829,"Comparing the effect of aromatase inhibitor (letrozole) + cabergoline (Dostinex) and letrozole alone on uterine myoma regression,a randomized clinical trial.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of letrozole in combination with cabergoline and letrozole alone on regression of symptomatic uterine myomas in women of reproductive age.DESIGN: Randomized controlled clinical trial.SETTING: University hospital.PATIENTS: Ninety-one women of reproductive age were enrolled in the study and 88 women were eligible.Eight participants were excluded from the study.INTERVENTIONS: Eighty women of reproductive age with symptomatic myomas >4cm were evaluated in two groups.Participants in Group 1 received 2.5mg letrozole once daily and cabergoline 0.5mg/week from the first day of the menstrual cycle for 12 weeks, and participants in Group 2 received letrozole alone.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes in uterine size and volume; myoma size, volume and number; and side effects of treatment.RESULTS: Overall, 76 patients completed the study.Compared with baseline values, mean uterine volume was reduced significantly in both groups (p=0.01), and there was no significant difference between groups (p=0.99).The mean number of dominant myomas was reduced significantly in both groups (p=0.03), with no significant difference between groups (p=0.6).The mean volume of myomas was reduced significantly in both groups (p=0.01), with no significant difference between groups (p=0.45).Although a significant decrease in number and volume of myomas was documented in each group (p<0.05), the intergroup analyses did not reveal significant differences between the two groups in terms of the change in number (p=0.28) and volume (p=0.96) of myomas.Headache was significantly more common in the letrozole+cabergoline group (nine vs two cases, p=0.02), but the two groups were comparable for the remaining minor side effects.CONCLUSION: This study showed that 12 weeks of treatment with letrozole with and without cabergoline improved the size and volume of the uterus and myomas, led to symptom improvement, and could be used for short-term treatment prior to surgery or fertility programmes.CONDENSATION: Condensation letrozole in combination with cabergoline in the management of uterine fibroids.",0,0,0,0

28109543,"The risk of cancer in kidney transplant recipients may be reduced in those maintained on everolimus and reduced cyclosporine.Kidney transplant recipients are at a high risk of developing cancers after transplantation.Switching from calcineurin inhibitors to sirolimus has been shown to prevent secondary nonmelanoma skin cancer but whether everolimus with reduced exposure to calcineurin inhibitors has similar anti-cancer effects remains unknown.Therefore, we compared the risk of incident cancer over seven years of follow-up among kidney transplant recipients randomized to everolimus plus reduced exposure cyclosporine versus mycophenolate sodium and standard exposure cyclosporine.Using the Australian and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry (ANZDATA), we assessed the seven-year risk of incident cancer and other graft outcomes among a subgroup of recipients who had participated in the A2309 study using adjusted Cox proportional hazard models.Of 95 recipients, 66 were randomized to everolimus (1.5 mg or 3 mg) with reduced cyclosporine and 29 received mycophenolate sodium and standard exposure cyclosporine.Compared to mycophenolate sodium and standard exposure cyclosporine, everolimus treatment was associated with unadjusted hazard ratios of 0.28 (95% confidence interval 0.11-0.74), 0.39 (0.16-0.98) and 0.41 (0.23-0.71), respectively for nonmelanoma skin cancer, non-skin cancers and any cancers.Interestingly, the adjusted hazard ratios were 0.34 (0.13-0.91), 0.35 (0.09-1.25) and 0.32 (0.15-0.71), respectively.There was no association between treatment groups and rejection, graft loss or death.Compared to standard-exposure cyclosporine, everolimus with reduced exposure to cyclosporine may be associated with a reduced risk of cancer, particularly for non-melanoma skin cancer.Thus, if confirmed in larger patient cohorts, de novo use of everolimus with reduced exposure to calcineurin inhibitors may enable a reduction in cancer burden after transplantation.",0,0,0,0

28188086,"Two intermittent vismodegib dosing regimens in patients with multiple basal-cell carcinomas (MIKIE): a randomised, regimen-controlled, double-blind, phase 2 trial.BACKGROUND: Vismodegib, a first-in-class Hedgehog-pathway inhibitor, is approved for use in adults with advanced basal-cell carcinoma.Patients with multiple basal-cell carcinomas, including those with basal-cell nevus (Gorlin) syndrome, need extended treatment.We assessed the safety and activity of two long-term intermittent vismodegib dosing regimens in patients with multiple basal-cell carcinomas.METHODS: In this randomised, regimen-controlled, double-blind, phase 2 trial, we enrolled adult patients with multiple basal-cell carcinomas, including those with basal-cell nevus syndrome, who had one or more histopathologically confirmed and at least six clinically evident basal-cell carcinomas.From a centralised randomisation schedule accessed via an interactive voice or web-based response system, patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to treatment group A (150 mg oral vismodegib per day for 12 weeks, then three rounds of 8 weeks of placebo daily followed by 12 weeks of 150 mg vismodegib daily) or treatment group B (150 mg oral vismodegib per day for 24 weeks, then three rounds of 8 weeks of placebo daily followed by 8 weeks of 150 mg vismodegib daily).Treatment assignment was stratified by diagnosis of basal-cell nevus syndrome, geographical region, and immunosuppression status.The primary endpoint was percentage reduction from baseline in the number of clinically evident basal-cell carcinomas at week 73.The primary analysis was by intention to treat.The safety population included all patients who received at least one dose of study drug.This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01815840, and the study is ongoing.FINDINGS: Between April 30, 2013, and April 9, 2014, 229 patients were randomly assigned treatment, 116 in treatment group A and 113 in treatment group B. The mean number of basal-cell carcinoma lesions at week 73 was reduced from baseline by 62.7% (95% CI 53.0-72.3) in treatment group A and 54.0% (43.6-64.4) in treatment group B. 216 (95%) of 227 patients included in the safety analysis had at least one treatment-emergent adverse event deemed to be related to study treatment (107 [94%] of 114 in treatment group A and 109 [97%] of 113 in treatment group B).The most common grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events were muscle spasms (four [4%] patients in treatment group A vs 12 [11%] in treatment group B), increased blood creatine phosphokinase (one [1%] vs four [4%]), and hypophosphataemia (zero vs three [3%]).Serious treatment-emergent events were noted in 22 (19%) patients in treatment group A and 19 (17%) patients in treatment group B. Four (2%) patients died from adverse events; one (pulmonary embolism in treatment group A) was possibly related to treatment.INTERPRETATION: Both intermittent dosing schedules of vismodegib seemed to show good activity in long-term regimens in patients with multiple basal-cell carcinomas.Further study is warranted.FUNDING: F Hoffmann-La Roche.",0,0,0,0
28188670,"A randomized phase II trial of personalized peptide vaccine with low dose cyclophosphamide in biliary tract cancer.Since the prognosis of advanced biliary tract cancer (aBTC) still remains very poor, new therapeutic approaches, including immunotherapies, need to be developed.In the current study, we conducted an open-label randomized phase II study to test whether low dose cyclophosphamide (CPA) could improve antigen-specific immune responses and clinical efficacy of personalized peptide vaccination (PPV) in 49 previously treated aBTC patients.Patients with aBTC refractory to at least one regimen of chemotherapies were randomly assigned to receive PPV with low dose CPA (100 mg/day for 7 days before vaccination) (PPV/CPA, n = 24) or PPV alone (n = 25).A maximum of four HLA-matched peptides were selected based on the pre-existing peptide-specific IgG responses, followed by subcutaneous administration.T cell responses to the vaccinated peptides in the PPV/CPA arm tended to be greater than those in the PPV alone arm.The PPV/CPA arm showed significantly better progression-free survival (median time: 6.1 vs 2.9 months; hazard ratio (HR): 0.427; P = 0.008) and overall survival (median time: 12.1 vs 5.9 months; HR: 0.376; P = 0.004), compared to the PPV alone arm.The PPV alone arm, but not the PPV/CPA arm, showed significant increase in plasma IL-6 after vaccinations, which might be associated with inhibition of antigen-specific T cell responses.These results suggested that combined treatment with low dose CPA could provide clinical benefits in aBTC patients under PPV, possibly through prevention of IL-6-mediated immune suppression.Further clinical studies would be recommended to clarify the clinical efficacy of PPV/CPA in aBTC patients.",1,1,1,0
28189429,"Regular Aspirin Use and the Risk of Lethal Prostate Cancer in the Physicians' Health Study.BACKGROUND: Regular aspirin use probably protects against some malignancies including prostate cancer (PC), but its impact on lethal PC is particularly unclear.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between regular aspirin and (1) the risk of lethal PC in a large prospective cohort and (2) survival after PC diagnosis.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In 1981/82, the Physicians' Health Study randomized 22 071 healthy male physicians to aspirin, beta-carotene, both, or placebo.After the trial ended in 1988, annual questionnaires have obtained data on aspirin use, cancer diagnoses, and outcomes up to 2009 for the whole cohort, and to 2015 for PC patients.OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: We evaluated the relationship between regular aspirin (>3 tablets/week) and lethal PC (metastases or PC death).Cox proportional-hazards models estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for the risk of lethal PC in the whole cohort and postdiagnosis survival among men initially diagnosed with nonlethal PC.RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Risk analysis revealed that 502 men developed lethal PC by 2009.Current and past regular aspirin was associated with a lower risk of lethal PC (current: HR 0.68, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.52-0.89; past: HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.40-0.74) compared to never users.In the survival analysis, 407/3277 men diagnosed with nonlethal PC developed lethal disease by 2015.Current postdiagnostic aspirin was associated with lower risks of lethal PC (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.52-0.90) and overall mortality (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61-0.9).We could not assess aspirin dose, and inconsistencies were observed in some sensitivity analyses.CONCLUSIONS: Current regular aspirin use was associated with a lower risk of lethal PC among all participants.Current postdiagnostic use was associated with improved survival after diagnosis, consistent with a potential inhibitory effect of aspirin on PC progression.A randomized trial is warranted to confirm or refute these findings.PATIENT SUMMARY: We examined the potential effect of regular aspirin use on lethal prostate cancer.We found that taking aspirin was associated with a lower risk of lethal prostate cancer, and taking it after diagnosis may help to prevent prostate cancer from becoming fatal.",0,0,0,0

28210843,"Updated results from GEST study: a randomized, three-arm phase III study for advanced pancreatic cancer.PURPOSE: The GEST study showed non-inferiority of S-1 but not superiority of gemcitabine plus S-1 (GS) to gemcitabine alone for overall survival with the data by the cut-off date of 31st July in 2010 for chemo-naive patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.We considered it important to determine whether S-1 maintains non-inferiority after a long-term follow-up in the GEST study and to obtain a firm positive conclusion.In addition, it may be an interesting challenge to explore the efficacious profile of GS in the long-term follow-up study.Using the data from the follow-up period, background and efficacy in patients from Taiwan and Japan, as well as the rates of tumor shrinkage in locally advanced and metastatic patients (Waterfall plot) were also analyzed.METHODS: The results of the primary analysis were reconfirmed, and subset analysis of overall survival and progression-free survival was performed based on the overall survival data updated by the cut-off date of 31st July in 2011.RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 29.8 months, and 795 deaths occurred (95.6%).The median overall survival was 8.8 months for gemcitabine, 9.7 months for S-1 (hazard ratio [HR], 0.96; 97.5% confidence interval [CI], 0.79-1.17), and 9.9 months for GS (HR 0.91; 97.5% CI 0.75-1.11).In patients with performance status (PS) 0, the median overall survival was 9.8 months for gemcitabine, 10.9 months for S-1, and 10.5 months for GS.In patients with PS 1, the median overall survival was 6.2 months for gemcitabine, 6.3 months for S-1, and 9.6 months for GS.CONCLUSION: Our survey reconfirmed the non-inferiority of S-1 to gemcitabine and showed S-1 can be used as one of the standard treatment options for advanced pancreatic cancer.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00498225.",0,0,0,0
28216065,"Preliminary evaluation of a telephone-based smoking cessation intervention in the lung cancer screening setting: A randomized clinical trial.Incorporating effective smoking cessation interventions into lung cancer screening (LCS) programs will be essential to realizing the full benefit of screening.We conducted a pilot randomized trial to determine the feasibility and efficacy of a telephone-counseling (TC) smoking cessation intervention vs. usual care (UC) in the LCS setting.In collaboration with 3 geographically diverse LCS programs, we enrolled current smokers (61.5% participation rate) who were: registered to undergo LCS, 50-77 years old, and had a 20+ pack-year smoking history.Eligibility was not based on readiness to quit.Participants completed pre-LCS (T0) and post-LCS (T1) telephone assessments, were randomized to TC (N=46) vs. UC (N=46), and completed a final 3-month telephone assessment (T2).Both study arms received a list of evidence-based cessation resources.TC participants also received up to 6 brief counseling calls with a trained cessation counselor.Counseling calls incorporated motivational interviewing and utilized the screening result as a motivator for quitting.The outcome was biochemically verified 7-day point prevalence cessation at 3-months post-randomization.Participants (56.5% female) were 60.2 (SD=5.4) years old and reported 47.1 (SD=22.2) pack years; 30% were ready to stop smoking in the next 30 days.TC participants completed an average of 4.4 (SD=2.3) sessions.Using intent-to-treat analyses, biochemically verified quit rates were 17.4% (TC) vs. 4.3% (UC), p<.05.This study provides preliminary evidence that telephone-based cessation counseling is feasible and efficacious in the LCS setting.As millions of current smokers are now eligible for lung cancer screening, this setting represents an important opportunity to exert a large public health impact on cessation among smokers who are at very high risk for multiple tobacco-related diseases.If this evidence-based, brief, and scalable intervention is replicated, TC could help to improve the overall cost-effectiveness of LCS.TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT02267096, https://clinicaltrials.gov.",0,0,0,0

28352657,"Randomized, placebo-controlled window trial of EGFR, Src, or combined blockade in head and neck cancer.BACKGROUND.EGFR and Src family kinases are upregulated in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).EGFR interacts with Src to activate STAT3 signaling, and dual EGFR-Src targeting is synergistic in HNSCC preclinical models.pSrc overexpression predicted resistance to the EGFR inhibitor, erlotinib, in a prior window trial.We conducted a 4-arm window trial to identify biomarkers associated with response to EGFR and/or Src inhibition.METHODS.Patients with operable stage II-IVa HNSCC were randomized to 7-21 days of neoadjuvant erlotinib, the Src inhibitor dasatinib, the combination of both, or placebo.Paired tumor specimens were collected before and after treatment.Pharmacodynamic expression of EGFR and Src pathway components was evaluated by IHC of tissue microarrays and reverse-phase protein array of tissue lysates.Candidate biomarkers were assessed for correlation with change in tumor size.RESULTS.From April 2009 to December 2012, 58 patients were randomized and 55 were treated.There was a significant decrease in tumor size in both erlotinib arms (P = 0.0014); however, no effect was seen with dasatinib alone (P = 0.24).High baseline pMAPK expression was associated with response to erlotinib (P = 0.03).High baseline pSTAT3 was associated with resistance to dasatinib (P = 0.099).CONCLUSIONS.Brief exposure to erlotinib significantly decreased tumor size in operable HNSCC, with no additive effect from dasatinib.Baseline pMAPK expression warrants further study as a response biomarker for anti-EGFR therapy.Basal expression of pSTAT3 may be independent of Src, explain therapeutic resistance, and preclude development of dasatinib in biomarker-unselected cohorts.TRIAL REGISTRATION.NCT00779389.FUNDING.National Cancer Institute, American Cancer Society, Pennsylvania Department of Health, V Foundation for Cancer Research, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Astellas Pharma.",1,1,1,1
28375706,"Impact of Diabetes, Insulin, and Metformin Use on the Outcome of Patients With Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2-Positive Primary Breast Cancer: Analysis From the ALTTO Phase III Randomized Trial.Purpose Previous studies have suggested an association between metformin use and improved outcome in patients with diabetes and breast cancer.In the current study, we aimed to explore this association in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2 ) -positive primary breast cancer in the context of a large, phase III adjuvant trial.Patients and Methods The ALTTO trial randomly assigned patients with HER2-positive breast cancer to receive 1 year of either trastuzumab alone, lapatinib alone, their sequence, or their combination.In this substudy, we evaluated whether patients with diabetes at study entry-with or without metformin treatment-were associated with different disease-free survival (DFS), distant disease-free survival (DDFS), and overall survival (OS) compared with patients without diabetes.Results A total of 8,381 patients were included in the current analysis: 7,935 patients (94.7%) had no history of diabetes at diagnosis, 186 patients (2.2%) had diabetes with no metformin treatment, and 260 patients (3.1%) were diabetic and had been treated with metformin.Median follow-up was 4.5 years (0.16 to 6.31 years), at which 1,205 (14.38%), 929 (11.08%), and 528 (6.3%) patients experienced DFS, DDFS, and OS events, respectively.Patients with diabetes who had not been treated with metformin experienced worse DFS (multivariable hazard ratio [HR], 1.40; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.94; P = .043), DDFS (multivariable HR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.10 to 2.22; P = .013), and OS (multivariable HR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.23 to 2.85; P = .004).This effect was limited to hormone receptor-positive patients.Whereas insulin treatment was associated with a detrimental effect, metformin had a salutary effect in patients with diabetes who had HER2-positive and hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.Conclusion Metformin may improve the worse prognosis that is associated with diabetes and insulin treatment, mainly in patients with primary HER2-positive and hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.",0,0,0,0
28382800,"Prevention of lymphocele by using gelatin-thrombin matrix as a tissue sealant after pelvic lymphadenectomy in patients with gynecologic cancers: a prospective randomized controlled study.OBJECTIVE: This prospective randomized controlled pilot study aimed to find whether gelatin-thrombin matrix used as a tissue sealant (FloSeal) can prevent the occurrence of pelvic lymphocele in patients with gynecologic cancer who has undergone pelvic lymphadenectomy.METHODS: Each patient, who undergo a laparotomic pelvic lymph node dissection on both sides, was randomly assigned for FloSeal application on 1 side of the pelvis.The other side of the pelvis without any product application being the control side.The amount of lymph drainage at each side of the pelvis was measured for 3 days, and computed tomography scans were obtained 7 days and 6 months after surgery for detection of pelvic lymphocele.RESULTS: Among 37 cases, the median amount of lymph drainage was significantly decreased in the hemi-pelvis treated with FloSeal compared to the control hemi-pelvis (p=0.025).The occurrence of lymphocele was considerably reduced in treated hemi-pelvis (8/37, 21.6%) compared with control hemi-pelvis (12/37, 32.4%) after 7 post-operative days (p=0.219), and more decreased in the treated hemi-pelvis (5/37, 13.5%) compared with control hemi-pelvis (9/37, 24.3%) after postoperative 6 months (p=0.344).CONCLUSION: The application of FloSeal as a tissue sealant in lymph nodes resected tissues can reduce the incidence of pelvic lymphocele in gynecologic cancer patients.A large randomized controlled study could confirm these preliminary results.",0,0,0,0
28383379,"Effect of a pH-Balanced Vaginal Gel on Dyspareunia and Sexual Function in Breast Cancer Survivors Who Were Premenopausal at Diagnosis: A Randomized Controlled Trial.OBJECTIVE: To assess whether a pH-balanced vaginal gel containing lactic acid is more effective than a placebo (lactate-free gel) in improving dyspareunia and sexual function among breast cancer survivors who were premenopausal at diagnosis and had dyspareunia after adjuvant chemotherapy.METHODS: In a single-center, double-blind, randomized trial, a pH-balanced gel or placebo was administered three times per week at bedtime as well as during sexual intercourse for 8 weeks.The primary outcome was the improvement of dyspareunia measured by pain score of the Female Sexual Function Index after the treatment.Secondary outcomes included the total and individual domains of Female Sexual Function Index score, sexual dysfunction (a total Female Sexual Function Index score less than 25.0), vaginal pH, vaginal maturation index, and adverse events related to the intervention.A sample size of 47 per group was planned to achieve 80% power to detect a 19% difference in the primary outcome.RESULTS: From October 2009 and March 2013, 167 women were screened and 136 were randomized: 69 to a pH-balanced gel and 67 to placebo.Baseline characteristics were similar in both groups.Although there was no difference between the two groups, both experienced a significant improvement of dyspareunia.The increase in median pain score from baseline was 1.2 in both groups (median [interquartile range] from 2.8 [2.0-4.0] to 4.0 [2.8-4.8] in the pH-balanced group and from 3.2 [2.0-4.0] to 4.4 [3.2-4.8] in the placebo group; all P<.01).Overall Female Sexual Function Index score and the frequency of sexual dysfunction also did not differ between the two groups although there was a significant improvement.On the other hand, vaginal pH and vaginal maturation index were slightly but significantly improved only in the pH-balanced group.There were no severe adverse events in either group.CONCLUSION: The pH-balanced vaginal gel is not superior to the placebo in improving dyspareunia and overall sexual function.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, https://www.clinicaltrials.gov, NCT00981305.",0,0,0,0

28577938,"Evaluation of the VeriStrat((R)) serum protein test in patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the lung treated with second-line afatinib or erlotinib in the phase III LUX-Lung 8 study.OBJECTIVES: Identification of biomarkers associated with clinical benefit may be crucial in establishing optimal treatment choice for patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the lung after first-line chemotherapy.In this study, the ability of the VeriStrat serum protein test to predict differential clinical benefit with afatinib versus erlotinib, and the association of VeriStrat status with clinical outcomes irrespective of EGFR-TKI used, was assessed in a retrospective analysis of the phase III LUX-Lung 8 trial.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pretreatment plasma samples were analyzed using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.Spectra were evaluated to assign a VeriStrat 'Good' (VS-G) or VeriStrat 'Poor' (VS-P) classification.Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival, and other endpoints were assessed with respect to pretreatment VeriStrat status; OS was the primary efficacy variable.Outcomes with other efficacy endpoints were similar.RESULTS: Of 795 patients randomized in LUX-Lung 8, 675 were classified (VS-G: 412; VS-P: 263).In the VS-G group, OS was significantly longer with afatinib versus erlotinib (HR 0.79 [95% CI: 0.63-0.98]).In the VS-P group, there was no significant difference in OS between afatinib and erlotinib (HR 0.90 [0.70-1.16]).However, there was no interaction between VeriStrat classification and treatment group for OS (pinteraction=0.5303).OS was significantly longer in VS-G versus VS-P patients, both in the overall VeriStrat-classified population (HR 0.41 [0.35-0.49]) and afatinib-treated patients (HR 0.40 [0.31-0.51]).Multivariate analysis showed that VeriStrat was an independent predictor of OS in afatinib-treated patients, regardless of ECOG PS or best response to first-line chemotherapy.CONCLUSION: VS-G classification is strongly associated with favorable survival outcomes with either afatinib or erlotinib compared with VS-P classification.In VS-G patients, survival outcomes with afatinib are superior to those with erlotinib.VeriStrat classification may guide treatment decisions in patients with SCC of the lung.ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT01523587.",1,1,1,0
28578607,"Abiraterone plus Prednisone in Metastatic, Castration-Sensitive Prostate Cancer.BACKGROUND: Abiraterone acetate, a drug that blocks endogenous androgen synthesis, plus prednisone is indicated for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.We evaluated the clinical benefit of abiraterone acetate plus prednisone with androgen-deprivation therapy in patients with newly diagnosed, metastatic, castration-sensitive prostate cancer.METHODS: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 1199 patients to receive either androgen-deprivation therapy plus abiraterone acetate (1000 mg daily, given once daily as four 250-mg tablets) plus prednisone (5 mg daily) (the abiraterone group) or androgen-deprivation therapy plus dual placebos (the placebo group).The two primary end points were overall survival and radiographic progression-free survival.RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 30.4 months at a planned interim analysis (after 406 patients had died), the median overall survival was significantly longer in the abiraterone group than in the placebo group (not reached vs. 34.7 months) (hazard ratio for death, 0.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.51 to 0.76; P<0.001).The median length of radiographic progression-free survival was 33.0 months in the abiraterone group and 14.8 months in the placebo group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.55; P<0.001).Significantly better outcomes in all secondary end points were observed in the abiraterone group, including the time until pain progression, next subsequent therapy for prostate cancer, initiation of chemotherapy, and prostate-specific antigen progression (P<0.001 for all comparisons), along with next symptomatic skeletal events (P=0.009).These findings led to the unanimous recommendation by the independent data and safety monitoring committee that the trial be unblinded and crossover be allowed for patients in the placebo group to receive abiraterone.Rates of grade 3 hypertension and hypokalemia were higher in the abiraterone group.CONCLUSIONS: The addition of abiraterone acetate and prednisone to androgen-deprivation therapy significantly increased overall survival and radiographic progression-free survival in men with newly diagnosed, metastatic, castration-sensitive prostate cancer.(Funded by Janssen Research and Development; LATITUDE ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01715285 .).",0,0,0,0
28578704,"Dietary supplementation with n-3-fatty acids in patients with pancreatic cancer and cachexia: marine phospholipids versus fish oil - a randomized controlled double-blind trial.BACKGROUND: Like many other cancer patients, most pancreatic carcinoma patients suffer from severe weight loss.As shown in numerous studies with fish oil (FO) supplementation, a minimum daily intake of 1.5 g n-3-fatty acids (n-3-FA) contributes to weight stabilization and improvement of quality of life (QoL) of cancer patients.Given n-3-FA not as triglycerides (FO), but mainly bound to marine phospholipids (MPL), weight stabilization and improvement of QoL has already been seen at much lower doses of n-3-FA (0,3 g), and MPL were much better tolerated.The objective of this double-blind randomized controlled trial was to compare low dose MPL and FO formulations, which had the same n-3-FA amount and composition, on weight and appetite stabilization, global health enhancement (QoL), and plasma FA-profiles in patients suffering from pancreatic cancer.METHODS: Sixty pancreatic cancer patients were included into the study and randomized to take either FO- or MPL supplementation.Patients were treated with 0.3 g of n-3-fatty acids per day over six weeks.Since the n-3-FA content of FO is usually higher than that of MPL, FO was diluted with 40% of medium chain triglycerides (MCT) to achieve the same capsule size in both intervention groups and therefore assure blinding.Routine blood parameters, lipid profiles, body weight, and appetite were measured before and after intervention.Patient compliance was assessed through a patient diary.Quality of life and nutritional habits were assessed with validated questionnaires (EORTC-QLQ-C30, PAN26).Thirty one patients finalized the study protocol and were analyzed (per-protocol-analysis).RESULTS: Intervention with low dose n-3-FAs, either as FO or MPL supplementation, resulted in similar and promising weight and appetite stabilization in pancreatic cancer patients.MPL capsules were slightly better tolerated and showed fewer side effects, when compared to FO supplementation.CONCLUSION: The similar effects between both interventions were unexpected but reliable, since the MPL and FO formulations caused identical increases of n-3-FAs in plasma lipids of included patients after supplementation.The effects of FO with very low n-3-FA content might be explained by the addition of MCT.The results of this study suggest the need for further investigations of marine phospholipids for the improvement of QoL of cancer patients, optionally in combination with MCT.",0,0,0,0
28579538,"Late Recurrence of Barrett's Esophagus After Complete Eradication of Intestinal Metaplasia is Rare: Final Report From Ablation in Intestinal Metaplasia Containing Dysplasia Trial.BACKGROUND & AIMS: The goal of treatment for Barrett's esophagus (BE) with dysplasia is complete eradication of intestinal metaplasia (CEIM).The long-term durability of CEIM has not been well characterized, so the frequency and duration of surveillance are unclear.We report results from a 5-year follow-up analysis of patients with BE and dysplasia treated by radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in the randomized controlled Ablation of Intestinal Metaplasia Containing Dysplasia (AIM) trial.METHODS: Participants for the AIM Dysplasia trial (18-80 years old) were recruited from 19 sites in the United States and had endoscopic evidence of non-nodular dysplastic BE </=8 cm in length.Subjects (n = 127) were randomly assigned (2:1 ratio) to receive either RFA (entire BE segment ablated circumferentially) or a sham endoscopic procedure; patients in the sham group were offered RFA treatment 1 year later, and all patients were followed for 5 years.We collected data on BE recurrence (defined as intestinal metaplasia in the tubular esophagus) and dysplastic BE recurrence among patients who achieved CEIM.We constructed Kaplan-Meier estimates and applied parametric survival analysis to examine proportions of patients without any recurrence and without dysplastic recurrence.RESULTS: Of 127 patients in the AIM Dysplasia trial, 119 received RFA and met inclusion criteria.Of those 119, 110 (92%) achieved CEIM.Over 401 person-years of follow-up (mean, 3.6 years per patient; range, 0.2-5.8 years), 35 of 110 (32%) patients had recurrence of BE or dysplasia, and 19 (17%) had dysplasia recurrence.The incidence rate of BE recurrence was 10.8 per 100 person-years overall (95% CI, 7.8-15.0); 8.3 per 100 person-years among patients with baseline low-grade dysplasia (95% CI, 4.9-14.0), and 13.5 per 100 person-years among patients with baseline high-grade dysplasia (95% CI 8.8-20.7).The incidence rate of dysplasia recurrence was 5.2 per 100 person-years overall (95% CI 3.3-8.2); 3.3 per 100 person-years among patients with baseline low-grade dysplasia (95% CI 1.5-7.2), and 7.3 per 100 person-years among patients with baseline high-grade dysplasia (95% CI 4.2-12.5).Neither BE nor dysplasia recurred at a constant rate.There was a greater probability of recurrence in the first year following CEIM than in the following 4 years combined.CONCLUSIONS: In this analysis of prospective cohort data from the AIM Dysplasia trial, we found BE to recur after CEIM by RFA in almost one third of patients with baseline dysplastic disease; most recurrences occurred during the first year after CEIM.However, patients who achieved CEIM and remained BE free at 1 year after RFA had a low risk of BE recurrence.Studies are needed to determine when surveillance can be decreased or discontinued; our study did not identify any BE or dysplasia recurrence after 4 years of surveillance.",0,0,0,0

28623628,"Does Patient Preference Measurement in Decision Aids Improve Decisional Conflict? A Randomized Trial in Men with Prostate Cancer.BACKGROUND: Shared decision making (SDM) has been advocated as an approach to medical decision making that can improve decisional quality.Decision aids are tools that facilitate SDM in the context of limited physician time; however, many decision aids do not incorporate preference measurement.OBJECTIVES: We aim to understand whether adding preference measurement to a standard patient educational intervention improves decisional quality and is feasible in a busy clinical setting.METHODS: Men with incident localized prostate cancer (n = 122) were recruited from the Greater Los Angeles Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center urology clinic, Olive View UCLA Medical Center, and Harbor UCLA Medical Center from January 2011 to May 2015 and randomized to education with a brochure about prostate cancer treatment or software-based preference assessment in addition to the brochure.Men undergoing preference assessment received a report detailing the relative strength of their preferences for treatment outcomes used in review with their doctor.Participants completed instruments measuring decisional conflict, knowledge, SDM, and patient satisfaction with care before and/or after their cancer consultation.RESULTS: Baseline knowledge scores were low (mean 62%).The baseline mean total score on the Decisional Conflict Scale was 2.3 (+/-0.9), signifying moderate decisional conflict.Men undergoing preference assessment had a significantly larger decrease in decisional conflict total score (p = 0.023) and the Perceived Effective Decision Making subscale (p = 0.003) post consult compared with those receiving education only.Improvements in satisfaction with care, SDM, and knowledge were similar between groups.CONCLUSIONS: Individual-level preference assessment is feasible in the clinic setting.Patients with prostate cancer who undergo preference assessment are more certain about their treatment decisions and report decreased levels of decisional conflict when making these decisions.",0,0,0,0

28743247,"A randomized phase II study of paclitaxel alone versus paclitaxel plus sorafenib in second- and third-line treatment of patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer (PASO).BACKGROUND: We conducted an open-label, randomized, two-arm multi-center study to assess the efficacy and safety of paclitaxel versus paclitaxel + sorafenib in patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer.METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive either paclitaxel monotherapy (80 mg/m(2)) weekly (3 weeks on, 1 week off) plus sorafenib 400 mg orally, twice a day taken continuously throughout 28 day cycles.Sorafenib dose was gradually escalated from a starting dose of 200 mg twice a day.The primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS).RESULTS: A pre-planned efficacy interim analysis was performed on the data of 60 patients, 30 patients in each treatment arm.Median PFS was estimated at 6.6 months (95% CI: 5.1 to 9.0) in patients randomized to single-agent paclitaxel (Arm A) and 5.6 months (95% CI: 3.8 to 6.5) in patients randomized to paclitaxel-sorafenib combination (Arm B) therapy.Contrary to the hypothesis, the treatment effect was statistically significant in favor of paclitaxel monotherapy (hazard ratio 1.80, 95% CI: 1.02 to 3.20; log-rank test P = 0.0409).It was decided to stop the trial early for futility.Median OS was also in favor of Arm A (20.7 months (95% CI: 16.4 to 26.7) versus 12.1 months (95% CI: 5.8 to 20.4) in Arm B. Clinical control was achieved in 28 patients (93.3%) in Arm A and in 21 patients 70.0% in Arm B. Overall response rate was met in 43.3% of patients in Arm A and in 40.0% in Arm B. Toxicities were increased in Arm B with higher rates of diarrhea, nausea, neutropenia, hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) and anorexia, Grad 3 and 4 toxicities were rare.CONCLUSIONS: In this pre-planned interim analysis, paclitaxel-sorafenib combination therapy was not found to be superior to paclitaxel monotherapy with regard to the primary end point, progression-free survival.The trial was therefore discontinued early.There was no indication of more favorable outcomes for combination therapy in secondary efficacy end points.As expected, the safety and toxicity profile of the combination therapy was less favorable compared to monotherapy.Overall, this trial did not demonstrate that adding sorafenib to second- or third-line paclitaxel provides any clinical benefit to patients with HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer.Cautious dosing using a sorafenib ramp up schedule might have contributed to negative results.TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered at EudraCT (No 2009-018025-73) and retrospectively registered at Clinical trials.gov on March 17, 2011 ( NCT01320111 ).",1,1,1,1
28743491,"Individualized risk estimation for postoperative morbidity after hepatectomy: the Humanitas score.BACKGROUND: Estimation of postoperative morbidity after hepatectomy remains challenging.The aim of this prospective study was to develop a surgical score to predict an individual risk of post-hepatectomy complications.METHODS: All consecutive patients scheduled for hepatectomy from February 2012 to September 2015 were included and randomly assigned into a derivation or validation cohort.We developed a score based on preoperative variables, and we tested them using multivariate analyses.Odds-ratio (OR) values were used to build the score.RESULTS: 340 patients were included, 240 in the derivation and 100 in the validation cohort.Multivariate analysis showed that major hepatectomy (OR = 1.62; 95% CI 1.39-3.51), liver stiffness >/=9.7kPa (OR = 2.46; 95% CI 1.16-5.28), BILCHE score (combination of serum bilirubin and cholinesterase) >/=2 (OR = 2.76; 95% CI 0.82-4.28) and esophageal varices (OR = 1.59; 95% CI 1.51-3.61) were independent complications predictors.A 10-point scoring system was introduced.Patients with a score </=4 did not experience complications, whereas patients with >/=7 points experienced up to 54% of complications (P < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: A new, easy and clinically reliable surgical score based on the liver stiffness, BILCHE score, type of hepatectomy, and presence of varices may be used to predict post-hepatectomy morbidity.CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: NCT02454686 (https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/).",0,0,0,0
28751566,"Prolonged versus standard native E. coli asparaginase therapy in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma: final results of the EORTC-CLG randomized phase III trial 58951.Asparaginase is an essential component of combination chemotherapy for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.The value of asparaginase was further addressed in a group of non-very high-risk patients by comparing prolonged (long-asparaginase) versus standard (short-asparaginase) native E. coli asparaginase treatment in a randomized part of the phase III 58951 trial of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Children's Leukemia Group.The main endpoint was disease-free survival.Overall, 1,552 patients were randomly assigned to long-asparaginase (775 patients) or short-asparaginase (777 patients).Patients with grade >/=2 allergy to native E. coli asparaginase were switched to equivalent doses of Erwinia or pegylated E. coli asparaginase.The 8-year disease-free survival rate (+/-standard error) was 87.0+/-1.3% in the long-asparaginase group and 84.4+/-1.4% in the short-asparaginase group (hazard ratio: 0.87; P=0.33) and the 8-year overall survival rate was 92.6+/-1.0% and 91.3+/-1.2% respectively (hazard ratio: 0.89; P=0.53).An exploratory analysis suggested that the impact of long-asparaginase was beneficial in the National Cancer Institute standard-risk group with regards to disease-free survival (hazard ratio: 0.70; P=0.057), but far less so with regards to overall survival (hazard ratio: 0.89).The incidences of grade 3-4 infection during consolidation (25.2% versus 14.4%) and late intensification (22.6% versus 15.9%) and the incidence of grade 2-4 allergy were higher in the long-asparaginase arm (30% versus 21%).Prolonged native E. coli asparaginase therapy in consolidation and late intensification for our non-very high-risk patients did not improve overall outcome but led to an increase in infections and allergy.This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00003728.",1,1,1,0
28754483,"Olaparib tablets as maintenance therapy in patients with platinum-sensitive, relapsed ovarian cancer and a BRCA1/2 mutation (SOLO2/ENGOT-Ov21): a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Olaparib, a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, has previously shown efficacy in a phase 2 study when given in capsule formulation to all-comer patients with platinum-sensitive, relapsed high-grade serous ovarian cancer.We aimed to confirm these findings in patients with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 (BRCA1/2) mutation using a tablet formulation of olaparib.METHODS: This international, multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial evaluated olaparib tablet maintenance treatment in platinum-sensitive, relapsed ovarian cancer patients with a BRCA1/2 mutation who had received at least two lines of previous chemotherapy.Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status at baseline of 0-1 and histologically confirmed, relapsed, high-grade serous ovarian cancer or high-grade endometrioid cancer, including primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer.Patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to olaparib (300 mg in two 150 mg tablets, twice daily) or matching placebo tablets using an interactive voice and web response system.Randomisation was stratified by response to previous platinum chemotherapy (complete vs partial) and length of platinum-free interval (6-12 months vs >/=12 months) and treatment assignment was masked for patients, those giving the interventions, data collectors, and data analysers.The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival and we report the primary analysis from this ongoing study.The efficacy analyses were done on the intention-to-treat population; safety analyses included patients who received at least one dose of study treatment.This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01874353, and is ongoing and no longer recruiting patients.FINDINGS: Between Sept 3, 2013, and Nov 21, 2014, we enrolled 295 eligible patients who were randomly assigned to receive olaparib (n=196) or placebo (n=99).One patient in the olaparib group was randomised in error and did not receive study treatment.Investigator-assessed median progression-free survival was significantly longer with olaparib (19.1 months [95% CI 16.3-25.7]) than with placebo (5.5 months [5.2-5.8]; hazard ratio [HR] 0.30 [95% CI 0.22-0.41], p<0.0001).The most common adverse events of grade 3 or worse severity were anaemia (38 [19%] of 195 patients in the olaparib group vs two [2%] of 99 patients in the placebo group), fatigue or asthenia (eight [4%] vs two [2%]), and neutropenia (ten [5%] vs four [4%]).Serious adverse events were experienced by 35 (18%) patients in the olaparib group and eight (8%) patients in the placebo group.The most common in the olaparib group were anaemia (seven [4%] patients), abdominal pain (three [2%] patients), and intestinal obstruction (three [2%] patients).The most common in the placebo group were constipation (two [2%] patients) and intestinal obstruction (two [2%] patients).One (1%) patient in the olaparib group had a treatment-related adverse event (acute myeloid leukaemia) with an outcome of death.INTERPRETATION: Olaparib tablet maintenance treatment provided a significant progression-free survival improvement with no detrimental effect on quality of life in patients with platinum-sensitive, relapsed ovarian cancer and a BRCA1/2 mutation.Apart from anaemia, toxicities with olaparib were low grade and manageable.FUNDING: AstraZeneca.",1,1,1,1
28756902,"Bevacizumab for advanced cervical cancer: final overall survival and adverse event analysis of a randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 3 trial (Gynecologic Oncology Group 240).BACKGROUND: On Aug 14, 2014, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the antiangiogenesis drug bevacizumab for women with advanced cervical cancer on the basis of improved overall survival (OS) after the second interim analysis (in 2012) of 271 deaths in the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) 240 trial.In this study, we report the prespecified final analysis of the primary objectives, OS and adverse events.METHODS: In this randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 3 trial, we recruited patients with metastatic, persistent, or recurrent cervical carcinoma from 81 centres in the USA, Canada, and Spain.Inclusion criteria included a GOG performance status score of 0 or 1; adequate renal, hepatic, and bone marrow function; adequately anticoagulated thromboembolism; a urine protein to creatinine ratio of less than 1; and measurable disease.Patients who had received chemotherapy for recurrence and those with non-healing wounds or active bleeding conditions were ineligible.We randomly allocated patients 1:1:1:1 (blocking used; block size of four) to intravenous chemotherapy of either cisplatin (50 mg/m(2) on day 1 or 2) plus paclitaxel (135 mg/m(2) or 175 mg/m(2) on day 1) or topotecan (0.75 mg/m(2) on days 1-3) plus paclitaxel (175 mg/m(2) on day 1) with or without intravenous bevacizumab (15 mg/kg on day 1) in 21 day cycles until disease progression, unacceptable toxic effects, voluntary withdrawal by the patient, or complete response.We stratified randomisation by GOG performance status (0 vs 1), previous radiosensitising platinum-based chemotherapy, and disease status (recurrent or persistent vs metastatic).We gave treatment open label.Primary outcomes were OS (analysed in the intention-to-treat population) and adverse events (analysed in all patients who received treatment and submitted adverse event information), assessed at the second interim and final analysis by the masked Data and Safety Monitoring Board.The cutoff for final analysis was 450 patients with 346 deaths.This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00803062.FINDINGS: Between April 6, 2009, and Jan 3, 2012, we enrolled 452 patients (225 [50%] in the two chemotherapy-alone groups and 227 [50%] in the two chemotherapy plus bevacizumab groups).By March 7, 2014, 348 deaths had occurred, meeting the prespecified cutoff for final analysis.The chemotherapy plus bevacizumab groups continued to show significant improvement in OS compared with the chemotherapy-alone groups: 16.8 months in the chemotherapy plus bevacizumab groups versus 13.3 months in the chemotherapy-alone groups (hazard ratio 0.77 [95% CI 0.62-0.95]; p=0.007).Final OS among patients not receiving previous pelvic radiotherapy was 24.5 months versus 16.8 months (0.64 [0.37-1.10]; p=0.11).Postprogression OS was not significantly different between the chemotherapy plus bevacizumab groups (8.4 months) and chemotherapy-alone groups (7.1 months; 0.83 [0.66-1.05]; p=0.06).Fistula (any grade) occurred in 32 (15%) of 220 patients in the chemotherapy plus bevacizumab groups (all previously irradiated) versus three (1%) of 220 in the chemotherapy-alone groups (all previously irradiated).Grade 3 fistula developed in 13 (6%) versus one (<1%).No fistulas resulted in surgical emergencies, sepsis, or death.INTERPRETATION: The benefit conferred by incorporation of bevacizumab is sustained with extended follow-up as evidenced by the overall survival curves remaining separated.After progression while receiving bevacizumab, we did not observe a negative rebound effect (ie, shorter survival after bevacizumab is stopped than after chemotherapy alone is stopped).These findings represent proof-of-concept of the efficacy and tolerability of antiangiogenesis therapy in advanced cervical cancer.FUNDING: National Cancer Institute.",0,0,0,0
28759333,"Do Pattern-Focused Visuals Improve Skin Self-Examination Performance? Explicating the Visual Skill Acquisition Model.Skin self-examination (SSE) consists of routinely checking the body for atypical moles that might be cancerous.Identifying atypical moles is a visual task; thus, SSE training materials utilize pattern-focused visuals to cultivate this skill.Despite widespread use, researchers have yet to explicate how pattern-focused visuals cultivate visual skill.Using eye tracking to capture the visual scanpaths of a sample of laypersons (N = 92), the current study employed a 2 (pattern: ABCDE vs. ugly duckling sign [UDS]) x 2 (presentation: photorealistic images vs. illustrations) factorial design to assess whether and how pattern-focused visuals can increase layperson accuracy in identifying atypical moles.Overall, illustrations resulted in greater sensitivity, while photos resulted in greater specificity.The UDS x photorealistic condition showed greatest specificity.For those in the photo condition with high self-efficacy, UDS increased specificity directly.For those in the photo condition with self-efficacy levels at the mean or lower, there was a conditional indirect effect such that these individuals spent a larger amount of their viewing time observing the atypical moles, and time on target was positively related to specificity.Illustrations provided significant gains in specificity for those with low-to-moderate self-efficacy by increasing total fixation time on the atypical moles.Findings suggest that maximizing visual processing efficiency could enhance existing SSE training techniques.",0,0,0,0

28800861,"Ipatasertib plus paclitaxel versus placebo plus paclitaxel as first-line therapy for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (LOTUS): a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial.BACKGROUND: The oral AKT inhibitor ipatasertib is being investigated in cancers with a high prevalence of PI3K/AKT pathway activation, including triple-negative breast cancer.The LOTUS trial investigated the addition of ipatasertib to paclitaxel as first-line therapy for triple-negative breast cancer.METHODS: In this randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase 2 trial, women aged 18 years or older with measurable, inoperable, locally advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer previously untreated with systemic therapy were recruited from 44 hospitals in South Korea, the USA, France, Spain, Taiwan, Singapore, Italy, and Belgium.Enrolled patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive intravenous paclitaxel 80 mg/m(2) (days 1, 8, 15) with either ipatasertib 400 mg or placebo once per day (days 1-21) every 28 days until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.Randomisation was by stratified permuted blocks (block size of four) using an interactive web-response system with three stratification criteria: previous (neo)adjuvant therapy, chemotherapy-free interval, and tumour PTEN status.The co-primary endpoints were progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population and progression-free survival in the PTEN-low (by immunohistochemistry) population.This ongoing trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02162719).FINDINGS: Between Sept 2, 2014, and Feb 4, 2016, 166 patients were assessed for eligibility and 124 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to paclitaxel plus ipatasertib (n=62) or paclitaxel plus placebo (n=62).Median follow-up was 10.4 months (IQR 6.5-14.1) in the ipatasertib group and 10.2 months (6.0-13.6) in the placebo group.Median progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population was 6.2 months (95% CI 3.8-9.0) with ipatasertib versus 4.9 months (3.6-5.4) with placebo (stratified hazard ratio [HR] 0.60, 95% CI 0.37-0.98; p=0.037) and in the 48 patients with PTEN-low tumours, median progression-free survival was 6.2 months (95% CI 3.6-9.1) with ipatasertib versus 3.7 months (1.9-7.3) with placebo (stratified HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.26-1.32, p=0.18).The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events were diarrhoea (14 [23%] of 61 ipatasertib-treated patients vs none of 62 placebo-treated patients), neutrophil count decreased (five [8%] vs four [6%]), and neutropenia (six [10%] vs one [2%]).No colitis, grade 4 diarrhoea, or treatment-related deaths were reported with ipatasertib.One treatment-related death occurred in the placebo group.Serious adverse events were reported in 17 (28%) of 61 patients in the ipatasertib group and nine (15%) of 62 patients in the placebo group.INTERPRETATION: Progression-free survival was longer in patients who received ipatasertib than in those who received placebo.To our knowledge, these are the first results supporting AKT-targeted therapy for triple-negative breast cancer.Ipatasertib warrants further investigation for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer.FUNDING: F Hoffmann-La Roche.",1,1,1,1
28807031,"Inflammation and pro-resolution inflammation after hepatobiliary surgery.BACKGROUND: The magnitude of the perioperative inflammatory response plays a role in surgical outcomes.However, few studies have explored the mechanisms of the resolution of inflammation in the context of surgery.Here, we described the temporal kinetics of interleukin-6, cortisol, lipoxin A4, and resolvin D in patients who underwent oncologic liver resections.METHODS: All patients gave written informed consent.Demographic and perioperative surgical data were collected, along with blood samples, before surgery and on the mornings of postoperative days 1, 3, and 5.Interleukin-6, cortisol, lipoxin-A4, and resolvin D were measured in plasma.A P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.RESULTS: Forty-one patients were included in the study.Liver resection for colorectal metastatic disease was the most commonly performed surgery.The plasma concentrations of interleukin-6 were highest on day 1 after surgery and remained higher than the baseline up to postoperative day 1.Postoperative complications occurred in 14 (24%) patients.Cortisol concentrations spiked on postoperative day 1.The concentrations of lipoxin A4 and resolvin D were lowest on day 1 after surgery.CONCLUSIONS: The inflammatory response associated with hepatobiliary surgery is associated with low circulating concentrations of lipoxin A4 and resolvin D that mirror, in an opposite manner, the kinetics of interleukin 6 and cortisol.TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT01438476.",0,0,0,0
28812132,"Bowel preparation in CT colonography: Is diet restriction necessary? A randomised trial (DIETSAN).OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether diet restriction affects quality of colon cleansing and patient tolerance during reduced bowel preparation for CT colonography (CTC).METHODS: Asymptomatic and symptomatic patients were enrolled in this pragmatic, single-centre, randomised trial.All patients were randomly assigned (1:1 ratio, blocks of ten) to receive a reduced bowel preparation and faecal tagging with (Diet-Restriction-Group [DR]) or without (No-Diet-Restriction-Group [NDR]) dietary restriction.Five readers performed a blinded subjective image analysis, by means of 4-point Likert-scales from 0 (highest score) to 3 (worst score).Endpoints were the quality of large bowel cleansing and tolerance to the assigned bowel preparation regimen.The trial is registered at ClinicalTrial.gov (URomLSDBAL1).RESULTS: Ninety-five patients were randomly allocated to treatments (48 in NDR-group, 47 in DR-group).Both groups resulted in optimal colon cleansing.The mean residual stool (0.22, 95%CI 0.00-0.44) and fluid burden (0.39, 95%CI 0.25-0.53) scores for patients in DR-group were similar to those in patients in NDR-group (0.25, 95%CI 0.03-0.47 [p = 0.82] and 0.49, 95%CI 0.30-0.67 [p = 0.38], respectively).Tolerance was significantly better in NDR-group.CONCLUSION: A reduced bowel preparation in association with faecal tagging and without any dietary restriction demonstrated optimal colon cleansing effectiveness for CTC, providing better patient compliance compared with dietary restriction.KEY POINTS: * Dietary restriction in reduced bowel preparation regimen can be avoided. *The quality of colon cleansing is not affected by dietary restriction.* The quality of faecal tagging is not affected by dietary restriction.* Avoidance of dietary restriction improves patients' tolerance for CTC.",0,0,0,0
28812167,"Superficial hemangioma is better treated by topical 5-aminolevulinic followed by 595-nm pulsed dye laser therapy rather than 595-nm laser therapy alone.The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and adverse effects of a 595-nm pulsed dye laser therapy alone (PDL alone) with a 5-aminolevulinic (5-ALA) local application followed by a 595-nm PDL (5-ALA PDL) in the treatment of superficial hemangioma (SH).A prospectively randomized study in 181 patients with SH was carried out over a period of 24 months.One hundred and ninety-three patients were seen.One hundred and eighty-one patients with SH were enrolled, of which 165 completed final follow-up.One hundred and nineteen patients received PDL alone and 46 received 5-ALA PDL.The patients were assessed clinically and the patient's parents were given a satisfaction questionnaire.Baseline patient data (gender, lesion size, lesion site, treatment times, cure rate, and adverse reactions) were recorded and the results of the treatment of the two groups were analyzed and compared.Complete clearing of the lesion (recovery grade 4) was achieved in 44/119 (37.0%) of the PDL alone group and 31/46 (67.4%) of the 5-ALA PDL group (X (2) = 10.30, p < 0.001).Atrophic scars, hyper- and hypopigmentation occurred in both groups (X (2) = 3.32, p = 0.564).The patients' parents' satisfaction was greater in the 5-ALA PDL group.The clinical outcome of 5-ALA PDL was superior to that of PDL alone in the treatment of SH and only minor adverse events occurred in each group.",0,0,0,0

28891398,"Geometric analysis of loco-regional recurrences in relation to pre-treatment hypoxia in patients with head and neck cancer.INTRODUCTION: A previous pattern-of-failure study has suggested that up to 50% of the loco-regional failures (LRF) in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) occur outside the initial hypoxic volume determined by [(18)F]-fluoromisonidazole-PET ([(18)F]-FMISO-PET).The aim of the present analysis was to correlate spatial patterns of failure with respect to the pretherapeutic dynamic [(18)F]-FMISO-PET/CT in HNSCC after radiochemotherapy (RCT).MATERIAL AND METHODS: Within a running phase 2 trial using [(18)F]-FMISO-PET imaging prior to RCT in HNSCC patients (n = 54), we have observed so far 11 LRF with a minimum follow-up of 12 months.For nine patients, LRF imaging (CT or [(18)F]-FDG-PET/CT) for pattern-of-failure analysis was available.Analysis included the static 4-h hypoxic subvolume (VH) as well as a M-parameter volume (VM), which is derived from modeling of dynamic PET.Deformable image registration of the CT scan with the recurrent tumor to the pre-treatment [(18)F]-FMISO-PET/CT and the planning CT was done to quantify the hypoxic subvolumes compared to the recurrent tumor volume.Moreover, a point-of-origin analysis was performed.RESULTS: A total of five local, two regional and two loco-regional recurrences were detected.After deformable image registration of the CT scan with the recurrent tumor to the pre-treatment [(18)F]-FMISO-PET/CT and the planning CT, a significant overlap of the recurrence volume with [(18)F]-FMISO-positive subvolumes in the initial gross tumor volume (GTV) was observed.Median overlap of 40.2%, range 9.4-100.0%, for VH and 49.0%, range 4.4-96.4%, for VM was calculated.The point-of-origin analysis showed median distances of 0.0 mm, range 0.0-11.3 mm to VH and 8.6 mm, range 0.0-15.5 mm to VM, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that loco-regional recurrences after RCT originate from the initial GTV (primary tumor and/or lymph node metastases) containing hypoxic subvolumes, which supports the concept of hypoxia imaging-based dose escalation.",0,0,0,0
28916955,"Multicenter, randomized single-port versus multiport laparoscopic surgery (SIMPLE) trial in colon cancer: an interim analysis.BACKGROUND: Single-port laparoscopic surgery (SPLS) was recently introduced as an innovative minimally invasive surgery method.Retrospective studies have revealed the safety and feasibility of SPLS for colon cancer treatment.However, no prospective randomized trials have been performed.The multicenter, randomized SIMPLE (single-port versus multiport laparoscopic surgery) trial aimed to investigate short-term perioperative outcomes of SPLS for colon cancer treatment, compared with multiport laparoscopic surgery (MPLS).METHODS: Between August 2011 and April 2014, a total of 194 patients with colon cancer were recruited from seven hospitals in Korea.Patients were randomly allocated into the SPLS group (n = 99) or MPLS group (n = 95).The primary endpoint was postoperative complications.Operative, postoperative, and pathologic outcomes were analyzed after 50% of the patient study population had been recruited.RESULTS: The patients' demographic characteristics, operative times, estimated blood volume losses, numbers of harvested lymph nodes, and lengths of both resection margins were not significantly different between groups.In the SPLS group, the rates of conversion to MPLS and open surgery were 12.9 and 2.2%, respectively.Postoperative complications occurred in 10.8% of the SPLS, and 12.5% of the MPLS patients (p = 0.714).Times to functional recovery, pain scores, and amounts of analgesia were similar between groups.CONCLUSION: The results of this interim analysis suggested that SPLS is technically safe and appropriate when used for radical resection of colon cancer.(ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01480128).",0,0,0,0

28954297,"Long-term Peripheral Neuropathy in Breast Cancer Patients Treated With Adjuvant Chemotherapy: NRG Oncology/NSABP B-30.Background: The long-term effects of chemotherapy are sparsely reported.Peripheral neuropathy (PN) is one of the most frequent toxicities associated with taxane use for the treatment of early-stage breast cancer.We investigated the impact of the three different docetaxel-based regimens and patient characteristics on long-term, patient-reported outcomes of PN and the impact of PN on long-term quality of life (QOL).Methods: The National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project Protocol B-30 was a randomized trial comparing sequential doxorubicin (A) and cyclophosphamide (C) followed by docetaxel (T) (AC-->T), concurrent ACT, or AT in women with node-positive, early-stage breast cancer.The AC-->T group had a higher cumulative dose of T. PN was one of the symptoms assessed in a QOL substudy.Statistical methods included simple and mixed ordinal logistic regression and general linear models.All statistical tests were two-sided.Results: Of 1512 patients, 41.9% reported PN two years after treatment initiation.Treatment with AT and ACT was associated with less severe long-term PN compared with AC-->T (odds ratio [OR] = 0.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.35 to 0.58; OR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.46 to 0.75).Preexisting PN, older age, obesity, mastectomy, and greater number of positive nodes were also associated with higher risk of long-term PN.Patients who reported worse PN symptoms at 24 months had statistically significantly worse QOL (Ptrend < .001).Conclusions: The administration of docetaxel is associated with long-term PN.The lower rate of long-term PN in AT and ACT patients might be an important consideration in supporting choosing these therapies for individuals with preexisting neuropathic symptoms or other risk factors for neuropathy.",0,0,0,0
28961845,"Borealis-1: a randomized, first-line, placebo-controlled, phase II study evaluating apatorsen and chemotherapy for patients with advanced urothelial cancer.Background: Five-year survival of patients with inoperable, advanced urothelial carcinoma treated with the first-line chemotherapy is 5%-15%.We assessed whether the Hsp27 inhibitor apatorsen combined with gemcitabine plus cisplatin (GC) could improve overall survival (OS) in these patients.Patients and methods: This placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase II trial randomized 183 untreated urothelial carcinoma patients (North America and Europe) to receive GC plus either placebo (N = 62), 600 mg apatorsen (N = 60), or 1000 mg apatorsen (N = 61).In the experimental arm, treatment included loading doses of apatorsen followed by up to six cycles of apatorsen plus GC.Patients receiving at least four cycles could continue apatorsen monotherapy as maintenance until progression or unacceptable toxicity.The primary end point was OS.Results: OS was not significantly improved in the single or combined 600- or 1000-mg apatorsen arms versus placebo [hazard ratio (HR), 0.86 and 0.90, respectively].Exploratory study of specific statistical modeling showed a trend for improved survival in patients with baseline poor prognostic features treated with 600 mg apatorsen compared with placebo (HR = 0.72).Landmark analysis of serum Hsp27 (sHsp27) levels showed a trend toward survival benefit for poor-prognosis patients in 600- and 1000-mg apatorsen arms who achieved lower area under the curve sHsp27 levels, compared with the placebo arm (HR = 0.45 and 0.62, respectively).Higher baseline circulating tumor cells (>/=5 cells/7.5 ml) was observed in patients with poor prognosis in correlation with poor survival.Treatment-emergent adverse events were manageable and more common in both apatorsen-treatment arms.Conclusions: Even though apatorsen combined with standard chemotherapy did not demonstrate a survival benefit in the overall study population, patients with poor prognostic features might benefit from this combination.Serum Hsp27 levels may act as a biomarker to predict treatment outcome.Further exploration of apatorsen in poor-risk patients is warranted.",1,1,1,1
28962948,"Randomized Phase II Trial Comparing Chemoradiotherapy with Chemotherapy for Completely Resected Unsuspected N2-Positive Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.INTRODUCTION: We investigated whether concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) would increase survival in patients with completely resected unsuspected N2-positive NSCLC versus in patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy alone.METHODS: Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to either the CCRT arm or the chemotherapy arm.In the CCRT arm, patients received concurrent thoracic radiotherapy (50 Gy in 25 fractions) with five cycles of weekly paclitaxel (50 mg/m(2)) and cisplatin (25 mg/m(2)), followed by two additional cycles of paclitaxel (175 mg/m(2)) plus cisplatin (80 mg/m(2)) at 3-week intervals.In the chemotherapy arm, patients received four cycles of adjuvant paclitaxel (175 mg/m(2)) and carboplatin (area under the curve = 5.5) every 3 weeks.The primary end point was disease-free survival.RESULTS: We enrolled and analyzed 101 patients (51 received CCRT and 50 received chemotherapy).In all, 74 and 27 patients were preoperatively staged as N0 and N1 diseases, respectively.The baseline characteristics were well balanced between the two arms.The median disease-free survival of the CCRT arm was 24.7 months, which was not significantly different from that of the chemotherapy arm (21.9 months) (hazard ratio = 0.94, 95% confident interval: 0.58-1.52, p = 0.40).There was no difference in overall survival (74.3 months in CCRT arm and 83.5 months in the chemotherapy arm) (hazard ratio = 1.33, 95% confident interval: 0.71-2.49).CONCLUSIONS: There was no survival benefit from adjuvant CCRT compared with from platinum-based chemotherapy alone for completely resected unsuspected N2-positive NSCLC.However, the role of sequential radiotherapy administered after adjuvant chemotherapy is being evaluated, and further study is needed to evaluate the optimal radiotherapy approach for completely resected N2-positive NSCLC.",0,0,0,0
28972083,"Local Adjuvant Treatment with Low-Dose CpG-B Offers Durable Protection against Disease Recurrence in Clinical Stage I-II Melanoma: Data from Two Randomized Phase II Trials.Purpose: Although risk of recurrence after surgical removal of clinical stage I-II melanoma is considerable, there is no adjuvant therapy with proven efficacy.Here, we provide clinical evidence that a local conditioning regimen, aimed at immunologic arming of the tumor-draining lymph nodes, may provide durable protection against disease recurrence (median follow-up, 88.8 months).Experimental Design: In two randomized phase II trials, patients, diagnosed with stage I-II melanoma after excision of the primary tumor, received local injections at the primary tumor excision site within 7 days preceding re-excision and sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy of either a saline placebo (n = 22) or low-dose CpG type B (CpG-B) with (n = 9) or without (n = 21) low-dose GM-CSF.Results: CpG-B treatment was shown to be safe, to boost locoregional and systemic immunity, to be associated with lower rates of tumor-involved SLN (10% vs. 36% in controls, P = 0.04), and, at a median follow-up of 88.8 months, to profoundly improve recurrence-free survival (P = 0.008), even for patients with histologically confirmed (i.e., pathologic) stage I-II disease (P = 0.02).Conclusions: Potentially offering durable protection, local low-dose CpG-B administration in early-stage melanoma provides an adjuvant treatment option for a large group of patients currently going untreated despite being at considerable risk for disease recurrence.Once validated in a larger randomized phase III trial, this nontoxic immunopotentiating regimen may prove clinically transformative.Clin Cancer Res; 23(19); 5679-86.(c)2017 AACR.",0,0,0,0
28985891,"A three-step method for modular lymphadenectomy in gastric cancer surgery: The ability to retrieve sufficient lymph nodes and improve survival.BACKGROUND: Systematic lymphadenectomy for the resection of sufficient lymph nodes is the most important part of curative resection in gastric cancer surgery.Here, we explore the outcomes of the three-step method for modular lymphadenectomy (TSMML) and determine its safety and efficacy, compared with the conventional method for lymphadenectomy (CML).METHODS: From 2008 to 2011, 270 patients with gastric cancer were divided into 2 subgroups: the TSMML group and the CML group.RESULTS: Patients in the TSMML group had a significantly higher median number of retrieved lymph nodes (rLNs), lower median metastatic lymph node ratios (MLRs), and superior 5-year relapse-free survival (RFS) than the CML group.Moreover, the use of the TSMML procedure was an independent protective factor for RFS.No significant intergroup differences were found in morbidity or mortality in these two groups.CONCLUSION: The TSMML procedure is safe and effective and is easy to learn.",0,0,0,0
28993887,"The effect of everolimus on renal angiomyolipoma in pediatric patients with tuberous sclerosis being treated for subependymal giant cell astrocytoma.BACKGROUND: Patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) often have multiple TSC-associated hamartomas, particularly in the brain and kidney.METHODS: This was a post hoc analysis of pediatric patients being treated for subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs) during the phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled EXIST-1 trial.Patients were initially randomly assigned to receive everolimus 4.5 mg/m(2)/day (target blood trough 5-15 mg/dl) or placebo and could continue in an open-label extension phase.Angiomyolipoma response rates were analyzed in patients aged <18 years with >/=1 target angiomyolipoma lesion at baseline.Response was defined as the proportion of patients with a >/=50% reduction in the sum volume of target renal angiomyolipomata from baseline, in the absence of new target angiomyolipomata, a >20% increase in kidney volume from nadir, and angiomyolipoma-related bleeding >/= grade 2.Tolerability was also assessed.RESULTS: Overall, this analysis included 33 patients.Renal angiomyolipoma response was achieved by 75.8% of patients (95% confidence interval, 57.7-88.9%), with sustained mean reductions in renal angiomyolipoma volume over nearly 4 years of treatment.In addition, most (>/=80%) achieved clinically relevant reductions in angiomyolipoma volume (>/=50%), beginning at week 24 and continuing for the remainder of the study.Everolimus was generally well tolerated in this subgroup, with most adverse events being grade 1 or 2 in severity.CONCLUSIONS: Although everolimus is currently not indicated for this use, this analysis from EXIST-1 demonstrates its long-term efficacy and safety for the treatment of renal angiomyolipoma in pediatric patients undergoing treatment for TSC-associated SEGA.",0,0,0,0
29030001,"The occurrence and characteristics of endoscopically unexpected malignant degeneration in large rectal adenomas.BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Large non-pedunculated rectal polyps are most commonly resected by endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) or transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM).Despite pre-procedural diagnostics, unexpected rectal cancer is incidentally encountered within the resected specimen.This study aimed to compare the diagnostic assessment and procedural characteristics of lesions with and without unexpected submucosal invasion.METHODS: A post-hoc analysis of a multicenter randomized trial (TREND study) was performed in which patients with a non-pedunculated rectal polyp of >/=3 cm without endoscopic suspicion of invasive growth were randomized between EMR and TEM.RESULTS: Unexpected rectal cancer was detected in 13% (27/203) of patients; 15 after EMR and 12 after TEM.Most consisted of low-risk T1 cancers (78%, n = 18).There were no differences in the diagnostic assessment between lesions with and without unexpected submucosal invasion.Diagnostic biopsies revealed similar rates of high-grade dysplasia (28% [7/25] vs 18% [26/144]).When compared with EMR of adenomas, EMR procedures of unexpected cancers had a lower success rate of submucosal lifting (60% vs 93%, P < .001), were more often assessed as endoscopically incomplete (33% vs 10%, P = .01), and were more frequently terminated prematurely (60% vs 8%, P = .001).CONCLUSIONS: Diagnostic assessment of large non-pedunculated rectal polyps revealed similar characteristics between unexpected cancers and adenomas.Unexpected cancers during EMR were non-lifting in 40%, endoscopically assessed as incomplete in 33%, and terminated prematurely in 60%.In treatment-naive patients, these factors should raise suspicion of malignancy and need discussion in a multidisciplinary team meeting for decision on further treatment strategies.",0,0,0,0
29033099,"Custirsen (OGX-011) combined with cabazitaxel and prednisone versus cabazitaxel and prednisone alone in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer previously treated with docetaxel (AFFINITY): a randomised, open-label, international, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Docetaxel and cabazitaxel improve overall survival compared with mitoxantrone in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.Custirsen (OGX011) is a second generation highly specific antisense oligonucleotide that inhibits the production of clusterin, an antiapoptotic protein that is upregulated in response to chemotherapy and that confers treatment resistance.We aimed to assess whether custirsen in combination with cabazitaxel and prednisone increases overall survival in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer previously treated with docetaxel.METHODS: In this randomised, open-label, international, phase 3 trial, men with radiographically documented metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer that had progressed after docetaxel treatment with a Karnofsky performance status of more than 70% and who were fit for chemotherapy, were recruited from 95 cancer treatment centres in eight countries.Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) centrally using permuted blocks (block size 8) to receive cabazitaxel plus prednisone (cabazitaxel 25 mg/m(2) intravenously every 21 days plus oral prednisone 10 mg daily) with or without custirsen (640 mg intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15, plus three previous loading doses) until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or the completion of ten treatment cycles.Randomisation was stratified by use of opioids for prostate cancer-related pain at screening, disease progression following first-line docetaxel treatment established by radiographic evidence, and previous treatment with abiraterone or enzalutamide.The co-primary endpoints were overall survival in all randomly assigned patients and in a poor-prognosis subgroup.All analyses were intention to treat with the exception of safety, which was reported for patients who received any assigned treatment.The trial has been completed and the results presented here are the final analysis.This trial is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov, number NCT01578655.FINDINGS: Between Sept 9, 2012, and Sept 29, 2014, 795 patients were screened for enrolment.635 men were eligible for inclusion and were randomly assigned (n=317 in the cabazitaxel and prednisone plus custirsen group and n=318 in the cabazitaxel and prednisone group).Median follow up was 28.3 months (IQR 24.4-34.5) for the custirsen group and 29.8 months (IQR 25.3-35.2) for the control group.Median overall survival in all randomly assigned patients did not differ between the two groups (14.1 months [95% CI 12.7-15.9] in the curtisen group vs 13.4 months [12.1-14.9] in the control group; hazard ratio [HR] 0.95 [95% CI 0.80-1.12]; log-rank p=0.53).In the poor prognosis subgroup, median overall survival also did not differ between the two treatment groups (11.0 months [95% CI 9.3-13.3] in the custursin group vs 10.9 months [8.2-12.4] in the control group; HR 0.97 [95% CI 0.80-1.21]; two-sided p=0.80).The most frequently reported grade 3 or worse adverse events in the custirsen versus control groups were neutropenia (70 [22%] of 315 vs 61 [20%] of 312), anaemia (68 [22%] vs 49 [16%]), fatigue (23 [7%] vs 18 [6%]), asthenia (16 [5%] vs 8 [3%]), bone pain (16 [5%] vs 5 [2%]), and febrile neutropenia (16 [5%] vs 9 [3%]).Serious adverse events were reported in 155 (49%) versus 132 (42%).27 patients died within 30 days of treatment in the cabazitaxel and prednisone plus custirsen group, seven of which were deemed to be treatment related, versus 17 in the cabazitaxel and prednisone group, eight of which were deemed to be treatment related.Of the 21 deaths reported, 15 were reported as complications related to study treatment, either chemotherapy (eight and three, respectively) or study drug (none and four, respectively).INTERPRETATION: We noted no survival benefit in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer with the addition of custirsen to cabazitaxel and prednisone treatment.Cabazitaxel and prednisone remains the standard of care for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer progressing after docetaxel chemotherapy.FUNDING: OncoGenex Pharmaceuticals.",1,1,1,0
29034009,"A multicenter, randomized study of decitabine as epigenetic priming with induction chemotherapy in children with AML.BACKGROUND: Decitabine is a deoxycytidine nucleoside derivative inhibitor of DNA-methyltransferases, which has been studied extensively and is approved for myelodysplastic syndrome in adults but with less focus in children.Accordingly, we conducted a phase 1 multicenter, randomized, open-label study to evaluate decitabine pre-treatment before standard induction therapy in children with newly diagnosed AML to assess safety and tolerability and explore a number of biologic endpoints.RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were fully assessable for all study objectives per protocol (10 in Arm A = epigenetic priming induction, 14 in Arm B = standard induction).All patients experienced neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.The most common grade 3 and 4 non-hematologic adverse events observed were gastrointestinal toxicities and hypophosphatemia.Plasma decitabine PK were similar to previously reported adult data.Overall CR/CRi was similar for the two arms.MRD negativity at end-induction was 85% in Arm A versus 67% in Arm B patients.DNA methylation measured in peripheral blood over the course of treatment tracked with blast clearance and matched marrow aspirates at day 0 and day 21.Unlike end-induction marrow analyses, promoter methylation in blood identified an apparent reversal of response in the lone treatment failure, 1 week prior to the patient's marrow aspirate confirming non-response.Decitabine-induced effects on end-induction (day 35-43 following initiation of treatment) marrows in Arm A were reflected by changes in DNA methylation in matched paired marrow diagnostic aspirates.CONCLUSIONS: This first-in-pediatrics trial demonstrates that decitabine prior to standard combination chemotherapy is feasible and well tolerated in children with newly diagnosed AML.Pre-treatment with decitabine may represent a newer therapeutic option for pediatric AML, especially as it appears to induce important epigenetic alterations.The novel biological correlates studied in this trial offer a clinically relevant window into disease progression and remission.Additional studies are needed to definitively assess whether decitabine can enhance durability responses in children with AML.TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT01177540.",1,1,1,0

29232438,"Refractory or relapsed aggressive B-cell lymphoma failing (R)-CHOP: an analysis of patients treated on the RICOVER-60 trial.BACKGROUND: The prognosis of elderly patients with aggressive B-non-Hodgkin's lymphoma after first lymphoma-related treatment failure (TF-L) is not well described.METHODS: We analysed patient characteristics including the presence of MYC rearrangements and MYC-expression immunohistochemistry (IHC) at diagnosis and modalities of salvage therapy and their impact on the prognosis of patients between 61 and 80 years who had been treated on the RICOVER-60 trial.RESULTS: TF-L occurred in 301 of the 1222 (24.6%) patients; 297 patients could be analysed.Prognosis was extremely poor in patients with primary progressive disease or early relapse (</=12 months) with median survivals of 3.3 and 6.4 months.Survival after TF-L was significantly lower in patients pretreated with R-CHOP compared with CHOP (23.0% versus 36.4% at 2 years, P = 0.016).In patients with MYC translocation at diagnosis Rituximab reduced the risk of TF-L from 58.8% to 26.3%.Survival after TF-L was significant longer for patients after CHOP without MYC translocations (31.8% versus 0% at 2 years, P < 0.001) or negative MYC-IHC (41.0% versus 16.8% at 2 years, P = 0.017) but not after R-CHOP.224 patients (75.4%) received salvage therapy.Rituximab was part of salvage therapy in 57.4% and improved 2-year survival rate from 20.7% to 46.8% (P < 0.001).The benefit of R was significant after first-line CHOP [2-year overall survival (OS) 49.6% versus 19.1%, P < 0.001] as well as after R-CHOP (2-year OS 33.1% and 22.5%, P = 0.034).For patients pretreated with R-CHOP long-term survival was below 15% regardless of the treatment chosen.CONCLUSION: MYC rearrangement and IHC are adverse prognostic factors after TF-L for CHOP treated patients, rituximab as part of first-line therapy reduced the effects of MYC-break.Rituximab improves results of any type of salvage therapy; however, survival after progression/relapse of aggressive B-cell lymphoma in elderly patients pretreated with (R)-CHOP is poor regardless of treatment chosen.",0,0,0,0
29233673,"Conventional versus traction-assisted endoscopic submucosal dissection for gastric neoplasms: a multicenter, randomized controlled trial (with video).BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The aim of this study was to clarify whether dental floss clip (DFC) traction improves the technical outcomes of endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD).METHODS: A superiority, randomized control trial was conducted at 14 institutions across Japan.Patients with single gastric neoplasm meeting the indications of the Japanese guidelines for gastric treatment were enrolled and assigned to receive conventional ESD or DFC traction-assisted ESD (DFC-ESD).Randomization was performed according to a computer-generated random sequence with stratification by institution, tumor location, tumor size, and operator experience.The primary endpoint was ESD procedure time, defined as the time from the start of the submucosal injection to the end of the tumor removal procedure.RESULTS: Between July 2015 and September 2016, 640 patients underwent randomization.Of these, 316 patients who underwent conventional ESD and 319 patients who underwent DFC-ESD were included in our analysis.The mean ESD procedure time was 60.7 and 58.1 minutes for conventional ESD and DFC-ESD, respectively (P = .45).Perforation was less frequent in the DFC-ESD group (2.2% vs .3%, P = .04).For lesions located in the greater curvature of the upper or middle stomach, the mean procedure time was significantly shorter in the DFC-ESD group (104.1 vs 57.2 minutes, P = .01).CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that DFC-ESD does not result in shorter procedure time in the overall patient population, but it can reduce the risk of perforation.When selectively applied to lesions located in the greater curvature of the upper or middle stomach, DFC-ESD provides a remarkable reduction in procedure time.",0,0,0,0
29234923,"Non-inferiority multicenter prospective randomized controlled study of rectal cancer T2-T3s (superficial) N0, M0 undergoing neoadjuvant treatment and local excision (TEM) vs total mesorectal excision (TME).PURPOSE: The standard treatment of rectal adenocarcinoma is total mesorectal excision (TME), in many cases requires a temporary or permanent stoma.TME is associated with high morbidity and genitourinary alterations.Transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) allows access to tumors up to 20 cm from the anal verge, achieves minimal postoperative morbidity and mortality rates, and does not require an ostomy.The treatment of T2, N0, and M0 cancers remains controversial.Preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in association with TEM reduces local recurrence and increases survival.The TAU-TEM study aims to demonstrate the non-inferiority of the oncological outcomes and the improvement in morbidity and quality of life achieved with TEM compared with TME.METHODS: Prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled non-inferiority trial includes patients with rectal adenocarcinoma less than 10 cm from the anal verge and up to 4 cm in size, staged as T2 or T3-superficial N0-M0.Patients will be randomized to two areas: CRT plus TEM or radical surgery (TME).Postoperative morbidity and mortality will be recorded and patients will complete the quality of life questionnaires before the start of treatment, after CRT in the CRT/TEM arm, and 6 months after surgery in both arms.The estimated sample size for the study is 173 patients.Patients will attend follow-up controls for local and systemic relapse.CONCLUSIONS: This study aims to demonstrate the preservation of the rectum after preoperative CRT and TEM in rectal cancer stages T2-3s, N0, M0 and to determine the ability of this strategy to avoid the need for radical surgery (TME).TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01308190.Numero de registro del Comite de Etica e Investigacion Clinica (CEIC) del Hospital universitario Parc Tauli: TAU-TEM-2009-01.",0,0,0,0

29299592,"Chemoprevention of Basal and Squamous Cell Carcinoma With a Single Course of Fluorouracil, 5%, Cream: A Randomized Clinical Trial.Importance: Keratinocyte carcinoma (ie, cutaneous basal and squamous cell carcinoma) is the most common cancer in the United States.Objective: To determine whether topical fluorouracil could prevent surgically treated keratinocyte carcinoma.Design, Setting, and Participants: The Veterans Affairs Keratinocyte Carcinoma Chemoprevention Trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of topical fluorouracil for chemoprevention of keratinocyte carcinoma.Participants were recruited from May 2009 to September 2011 from 12 Veterans Affairs medical centers and followed until June 30, 2013.Participants were veterans (n = 932) with a history of at least 2 keratinocyte carcinomas in the past 5 years; almost all were white males and the median age was 70 years.Interventions: Application of fluorouracil, 5%, (n = 468) or vehicle control cream (n = 464) to the face and ears twice daily for 2 to 4 weeks upon randomization.Main Outcomes and Measures: Surgically treated keratinocyte, basal cell, and squamous cell carcinoma risk on the face and ears in the first year after enrollment; and time to first surgically treated keratinocyte, basal cell, and squamous cell carcinoma.The a priori hypothesis was that fluorouracil would be effective in preventing these cancers.Results: Of 932 participants (916 men [98%]; 926 white [99%]; median age, 70 years), 299 developed a basal cell carcinoma end point (95 in year 1) and 108 developed a squamous cell carcinoma end point (25 in year 1) over 4 years (median follow-up, 2.8 years).Over the entire study, there was no difference between treatment groups in time to first keratinocyte, basal cell, or squamous cell carcinoma.During the first year, however, 5 participants (1%) in the fluorouracil group developed a squamous cell carcinoma vs 20 (4%) in the control group, a 75% (95% CI, 35%-91%) risk reduction (P = .002).The 11% reduction in basal cell carcinoma risk during year 1 (45 [10%] in the fluorouracil group vs 50 [11%] in the control group) was not statistically significant (95% CI, 39% reduction to 31% increase), nor was there a significant effect on keratinocyte carcinoma risk.However, a reduction in keratinocyte carcinomas treated with Mohs surgery was observed.Conclusions and Relevance: A conventional course of fluorouracil to the face and ears substantially reduces surgery for squamous cell carcinoma for 1 year without significantly affecting the corresponding risk for basal cell carcinoma.Trial Registration: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00847912.",0,0,0,0
29310613,"Efficacy of a telephone outcall program to reduce caregiver burden among caregivers of cancer patients [PROTECT]: a randomised controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Informal caregivers provide extended support to people with cancer but they receive little support from the health care system to assist them in their caring role.The aim of this single-blind, multi-centre, randomised controlled trial was to test the efficacy of a telephone outcall program to reduce caregiver burden and unmet needs, and improve psychological well-being among cancer caregivers, as well as evaluating the potential impact on patient outcomes.METHODS: Cancer patient/caregiver dyads (N = 216) were randomised to a telephone outcall program (n = 108) or attention control group (n = 108).The primary outcome was self-reported caregiver burden.Secondary endpoints included depressive symptoms, unmet needs, self-esteem, self-empowerment, and health literacy.Data were collected at baseline and at both 1 and 6 months post-intervention.An intention to treat analysis was performed.RESULTS: The intervention had no effect on the primary outcome (caregiver burden), but reduced the number of caregiver unmet needs (intervention group baseline, mean = 2.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) [1.91-3.54]; intervention group 1 month post intervention, mean = 0.85, 95%CI [0.42-1.44]; control group baseline, mean = 1.30 95%CI [0.80-1.94], control group 1 month post intervention, mean = 1.02 95%CI [0.52-1.69]; p = 0.023).For caregivers at risk for depression, the intervention had a significant effect on caregivers' confidence in having sufficient information to manage their health (p = 0.040).No effects were found for patients' depressive symptoms, unmet needs, self-empowerment, and other health literacy domains.CONCLUSIONS: While caregiver burden was not reduced, the outcall program was effective in reducing unmet needs in caregivers.Provision of cancer information and support via a telephone service may represent a feasible approach to reducing unmet needs among cancer caregiver populations.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ACTRN12613000731796 ; prospectively registered on 02/07/2013.",0,0,0,0
29319209,"Effectiveness of antibacterial prophylaxis during induction chemotherapy in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.BACKGROUND: Pediatric patients receiving induction chemotherapy for newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are at high risk of developing life-threatening infections.We investigated whether uniform antibacterial guidelines, including mandatory antibacterial prophylaxis in afebrile patients during induction, decreases the incidence of microbiologically documented bacteremia.METHODS: Between 2012 and 2015, 230 patients with newly diagnosed ALL (aged 1-21) were enrolled on Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ALL Consortium Protocol 11-001 (DFCI 11-001).Induction therapy, regardless of risk group, included vincristine, prednisone, doxorubicin, methotrexate, and PEG-asparaginase.Afebrile patients received fluoroquinolone prophylaxis at the initiation of induction and those presenting with fever received broad-spectrum antibiotics; antibiotics were continued until blood count recovery.Rates of documented bacteremias and fungal infections on DFCI 11-001 were compared to those on the predecessor protocol (DFCI 05-001), which included the same induction phase without antibiotic prophylaxis guidelines.RESULTS: Sixty-six (28.7%) patients received fluoroquinolone prophylaxis, the remaining patients received broad-spectrum antibiotics.Twenty-four (36.4%) patients on prophylaxis developed fever and seven (10.6%) developed bacteremia.The overall rate of infection during induction on DFCI 11-001 was lower than on DFCl 05-001 (14.3% vs. 26.3%, P < 0.0001) due to a decreased rate of bacteremia (10.9% vs. 24.4%, P < 0.0001).The rate of fungal infections (4.8% vs. 3.6%) and induction death (0.9% vs. 2%) was not significantly different.CONCLUSION: For children with newly diagnosed ALL, uniform antibiotic administration until blood count recovery, including fluoroquinolone prophylaxis for afebrile patients, reduced the incidence of bacteremia during the induction phase.Larger, randomized studies should be performed to confirm these findings.",0,0,0,0
29322972,"A randomized controlled trial to determine the role of intraoperative lumbar cerebrospinal fluid drainage in patients undergoing endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary adenomas.BACKGROUND: Intraoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks are a frequent cause of morbidity in patients undergoing transsphenoidal surgery.This prospective study was performed to examine the impact of intraoperative lumbar subarachnoid drainage (LSAD) on the incidence of this complication and on the extent of resection in patients undergoing endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary adenomas.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study was conducted in a single large academic medical center.All patients with pituitary adenomas who had not undergone prior transsphenoidal surgery were eligible for inclusion in the study.Patients were randomly assigned to undergo transsphenoidal surgery with intraoperative lumbar drain insertion (LSAD group) or no lumbar drain insertion (no LSAD group).An otolaryngologist independently determined the occurrence of an intraoperative CSF leak.Extent of tumor resection was determined by volumetric analysis of postoperative magnetic resonance images in patients with nonfunctional tumors or functional adenomas with a large suprasellar component.RESULTS: Sixty patients were eligible for inclusion, of which 30 were assigned to the LSAD group and 30 to the no LSAD group.There were no statistically significant differences in patient demographics, tumor pathology, or radiology between the two groups.The LSAD catheter was successfully inserted in all patients in the LSAD group.Intraoperative CSF drainage significantly reduced the incidence of CSF leak from 46.7% in the no LSAD group to 3.3% in the LSAD group (P < 0.001).However, there were no statistically significant differences in the incidence of postoperative CSF rhinorrhea between the two groups.There were no major catheter-related complications.There was no statistically significant difference in the extent of resection between the two groups.CONCLUSIONS: Controlled intraoperative CSF drainage significantly reduces the incidence of intraoperative CSF leakage in patients undergoing endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary adenomas.",0,0,0,0
29327085,"Acceptance and commitment therapy for symptom interference in metastatic breast cancer patients: a pilot randomized trial.PURPOSE: Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality in women worldwide.With medical advances, metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients often live for years with many symptoms that interfere with activities.However, there is a paucity of efficacious interventions to address symptom-related suffering and functional interference.Thus, this study examined the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of telephone-based acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) for symptom interference with functioning in MBC patients.METHODS: Symptomatic MBC patients (N = 47) were randomly assigned to six telephone sessions of ACT or six telephone sessions of education/support.Patients completed measures of symptom interference and measures assessing the severity of pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance, depressive symptoms, and anxiety.RESULTS: The eligibility screening rate (64%) and high retention (83% at 8 weeks post-baseline) demonstrated feasibility.When examining within-group change, ACT participants showed decreases in symptom interference (i.e., fatigue interference and sleep-related impairment; Cohen's d range = - 0.23 to - 0.31) at 8 and 12 weeks post-baseline, whereas education/support participants showed minimal change in these outcomes (d range = - 0.03 to 0.07).Additionally, at 12 weeks post-baseline, ACT participants showed moderate decreases in fatigue and sleep disturbance (both ds = - 0.43), whereas education/support participants showed small decreases in these outcomes (ds = - 0.24 and - 0.18 for fatigue and sleep disturbance, respectively).Both the ACT and education/support groups showed reductions in depressive symptoms (ds = - 0.27 and - 0.28) at 12 weeks post-baseline.Group differences in all outcomes were not statistically significant.CONCLUSIONS: ACT shows feasibility and promise in improving fatigue and sleep-related outcomes in MBC patients and warrants further investigation.",0,0,0,0

29482649,"A randomized phase 3 trial comparing paclitaxel plus 5-fluorouracil versus cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil in Chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced esophageal carcinoma-the ESO-shanghai 1 trial protocol.BACKGROUND: Concurrent chemoradiotherapy is a standard modality for locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients.Cisplatin combined with 5-fluorouracil continuous infusion (PF) remains the standard concurrent chemotherapy regimen.However, radiotherapy concurrent with PF showed a high incidence of severe side effects.Paclitaxel showed a promising radiosensitivity enhancement in the treatment of esophageal carcinoma in both vitro and vivo studies.The ESO-Shanghai 1 trial examines the hypothesis that paclitaxel plus 5-fluorouracil (TF) concurrent with radiotherapy has better overall survival and lower toxicity for patients with local advanced ESCC.METHOD: Four hundred thirty-six ESCC patients presenting with stage IIa to IVa will be enrolled in a prospective multicenter randomized phase 3 study.Patients will be randomized to either concurrent chemoradiotherapy with PF (cisplatin 25 mg/m(2)/d, d1-3, plus 5-fluorouracil 1800 mg/m(2), continuous infusion for 72 h) once every 4 weeks for 2 cycles followed by consolidation chemotherapy for 2 cycles or concurrent chemoradiotherapy with weekly TF (5-fluorouracil 300 mg/m(2), continuous infusion for 96 h plus paclitaxel 50 mg/m(2), d1) for 5 weeks followed by consolidation chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil 1800 mg/m(2), continuous infusion for 72 h, plus paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2) d1) once every 4 weeks for 2 cycles.The radiotherapy dose is 61.2 Gy delivered in 34 fractions to the primary tumor including lymph nodes.The primary end-point is the 3-yr overall survival analyzed by intention to treat.The secondary endpoints are disease progression-free survival, local progression-free survival, and number and grade of participants with adverse events.DISCUSSION: The aim of this phase 3 study is to determine whether the TF regimen could replace the standard PF regimen for inoperable ESCC patients.An overall survival benefit of 12% at 3 years should be expected in the TF group to achieve this goal.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01591135 .Registered 18 April 2012.",0,0,0,0
29505522,"The effects of one-lung ventilation mode on lung function in elderly patients undergoing esophageal cancer surgery.The objective of the present study was to explore the effects of different one-lung ventilation (OLV) modes on lung function in elderly patients undergoing esophageal cancer surgery.A total of 180 consecutive elderly patients (ASA Grades I-II, with OLV indications) undergoing elective surgery were recruited in the study.Patients were randomly divided into 4 groups (n = 45).In Group A, patients received low tidal volume (VT < 8 mL/kg) + pressure controlled ventilation (PCV), low tidal volume (VT < 8 mL/kg) + volume-controlled ventilation (VCV) in Group B, high tidal volume (VT >/= 8 mL/kg) + PCV in Group C and high tidal volume (VT >/= 8 mL/kg) + VCV in Group D. Two-lung ventilation involved routine tidal volume (8-10 mL/kg) at a frequency of 12 to 18 times/min, and VCV mode.Clinical efficacy among 4 groups was compared.The partial pressure of end-tidal carbon dioxide (PetCO2) did not significantly differ among 4 groups (all P > .05), and the oxygenation index and SO2 in Group A were significantly higher than in the other groups (P < .05).The PetCO2, peak airway pressure (Ppeak), platform airway pressure (Pplat), and mean airway pressure (Pmean) in Group A were significantly lower than those in the other groups (all P < .05).However, airway resistance (Raw) among 4 groups did not significantly differ (all P > .05).The incidence of pulmonary infection, anastomotic fistula, ventilator-induced lung injury, lung dysfunction, difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation, and multiple organ dysfunction in Groups A and B were lower than that in Groups C and D (all P < .05).The expression levels of IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and C-reactive protein in lavage fluid in Group A were significantly lower than those in the other groups (all P < .05).OLV with low tidal volume (VT < 8 mL/kg) + PCV (5 cmH2O PEEP) improved lung function and mitigated inflammatory responses in elderly patients undergoing esophageal cancer surgery.",0,0,0,0
29522362,"Quality of Life During Treatment With Chemohormonal Therapy: Analysis of E3805 Chemohormonal Androgen Ablation Randomized Trial in Prostate Cancer.Purpose Chemohormonal therapy with docetaxel and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT+D) for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer improves overall survival as compared with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) alone.We compared the quality of life (QOL) between patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer who were treated with ADT+D and those who were treated with ADT alone.Methods Men were randomly assigned to ADT+ D (six cycles) or to ADT alone.QOL was assessed by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P), FACT-Taxane, Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue, and the Brief Pain Inventory at baseline and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to examine changes over time.Mixed-effect models compared the QOL between arms at each time point.Results Seven hundred ninety men were randomly assigned (ADT+D [n = 397] and ADT[ n = 393]) and completed FACT-P (90% at baseline, 86% at 3 months, 83% at 6 months, 78% at 9 months, and 77% at 12 months).ADT+D patients reported a statistically significant decline in FACT-P at 3 months ( P < .001) but FACT-P did not differ significantly between baseline and 12 months ( P = .38).ADT+D FACT-P scores were significantly lower at 3 months ( P = .02) but significantly higher at 12 months ( P = .04) when compared with ADT FACT-P scores.Differences did not exceed the minimal clinically important difference at any time point.ADT+D patients reported significantly lower Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue scores at 3 months than did ADT patients ( P < .001).Over time, both arms reported significantly poorer FACT-Taxane scores ( P < .001) when compared with baseline.Brief Pain Inventory scores were similar between arms.Conclusion Although ADT+D was associated with statistically worse QOL at 3 months, QOL was better at 12 months for ADT+D patients than for ADT patients.Both arms reported a similar minimally changed QOL over time, suggesting that ADT+D is not associated with a greater long-term negative impact on QOL.",1,1,0,0

29534639,"Cytokeratin-18 fragments predict treatment response and overall survival in gastric cancer in a randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer is common malignancy and exhibits a poor prognosis.At the time of diagnosis, the majority of patients present with metastatic disease which precludes curative treatment.Non-invasive biomarkers which discriminate early from advanced stages or predict the response to treatment are urgently required.This study explored the cytokeratin-18 fragment M30 and full-length cytokeratin-18 M65 in predicting treatment response and survival in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of advanced gastric cancer.METHODS: Patients enrolled in the SUN-CASE study received sunitinib or placebo as an adjunct to standard therapy with leucovorin (Ca-folinate), 5-fluorouracil, and irinotecan in second or third line.Treatment response rates, progression-free survival and overall survival were assessed during a follow-up period of 12 months.Cytokeratin-18 fragments were analyzed in 52 patients at baseline and day 14 of therapy.RESULTS: Levels of M30 correlated with the presence of metastasis and lymph node involvement and decreased significantly during chemotherapy.Importantly, baseline levels of M30 were significantly higher in patients who failed therapy.In addition, patients who did not respond to treatment were also identifiable at day 14 based on elevated M30 levels.By stepwise regression analysis, M30 at day 14 was identified as independent predictor of treatment response.Likewise, serum levels of full-length cytokeratin-18 M65 at baseline also correlated with treatment failure and progression-free survival.The addition of sunitinib did not exert any effects on serum levels of M30 or M65.CONCLUSION: The cytokeratin-18 fragment M30 at day 14 identifies patients that fail to second- or third-line therapy for advanced gastric cancer.Validation of this non-invasive biomarker in gastric cancer is warranted.",1,1,1,0
29546523,"The effectiveness of solution-focused brief therapy for psychological distress among Chinese parents of children with a cancer diagnosis: a pilot randomized controlled trial.PURPOSE: Given the critical role of parental care for pediatric cancer patients, this pilot study evaluated the feasibility and effectiveness of a hospital-based solution-focused brief therapy (SFBT) intervention for reducing psychological distress among parents of pediatric cancer patients in China.Differences between treatment and active control (AC) groups were assessed on dimensions of psychological distress.Parents' level of hope was also assessed.METHODS: Participants (N = 44) were randomly assigned to SFBT or AC.Parents received four sessions of SFBT twice a week delivered by graduate-level hospital social workers.Pre- and post-intervention assessments measured change in distress (depression, anxiety, and somatization symptoms) of parents as well as their level of hope.RESULTS: Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) indicated the SFBT group had better outcomes than the AC group on overall distress of somatic, anxiety, depression symptoms and level of hope.Within- and between-group treatment effects reported significantly greater effect of the SFBT group than of the AC group.CONCLUSIONS: Considering the inherent limits of a pilot feasibility study, results suggest that SFBT is a feasible, culturally compatible, and promising intervention for alleviating distress among Chinese parents of children with cancer.Additional comprehensive trials are needed to draw more definitive conclusions.RELEVANCE: SFBT may be beneficial for improving the critical support systems of parents of pediatric cancer patients.Thus, SFBT may have the potential to enhance children's well-being during cancer treatment and recovery.",0,0,0,0
29552975,"MRI-Targeted or Standard Biopsy for Prostate-Cancer Diagnosis.BACKGROUND: Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with or without targeted biopsy, is an alternative to standard transrectal ultrasonography-guided biopsy for prostate-cancer detection in men with a raised prostate-specific antigen level who have not undergone biopsy.However, comparative evidence is limited.METHODS: In a multicenter, randomized, noninferiority trial, we assigned men with a clinical suspicion of prostate cancer who had not undergone biopsy previously to undergo MRI, with or without targeted biopsy, or standard transrectal ultrasonography-guided biopsy.Men in the MRI-targeted biopsy group underwent a targeted biopsy (without standard biopsy cores) if the MRI was suggestive of prostate cancer; men whose MRI results were not suggestive of prostate cancer were not offered biopsy.Standard biopsy was a 10-to-12-core, transrectal ultrasonography-guided biopsy.The primary outcome was the proportion of men who received a diagnosis of clinically significant cancer.Secondary outcomes included the proportion of men who received a diagnosis of clinically insignificant cancer.RESULTS: A total of 500 men underwent randomization.In the MRI-targeted biopsy group, 71 of 252 men (28%) had MRI results that were not suggestive of prostate cancer, so they did not undergo biopsy.Clinically significant cancer was detected in 95 men (38%) in the MRI-targeted biopsy group, as compared with 64 of 248 (26%) in the standard-biopsy group (adjusted difference, 12 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4 to 20; P=0.005).MRI, with or without targeted biopsy, was noninferior to standard biopsy, and the 95% confidence interval indicated the superiority of this strategy over standard biopsy.Fewer men in the MRI-targeted biopsy group than in the standard-biopsy group received a diagnosis of clinically insignificant cancer (adjusted difference, -13 percentage points; 95% CI, -19 to -7; P<0.001).CONCLUSIONS: The use of risk assessment with MRI before biopsy and MRI-targeted biopsy was superior to standard transrectal ultrasonography-guided biopsy in men at clinical risk for prostate cancer who had not undergone biopsy previously.(Funded by the National Institute for Health Research and the European Association of Urology Research Foundation; PRECISION ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02380027 .).",0,0,0,0
29554321,"Robotic Radiosurgery for Brain Metastases Diagnosed With Either SPACE or MPRAGE Sequence (CYBER-SPACE)-A Single-Center Prospective Randomized Trial.BACKGROUND: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) of brain metastases (BM) is recommended in oligometastatic scenarios as a less toxic treatment alternative to whole-brain radiotherapy.Recent findings support SRS for patients with multiple (>3) BM.Furthermore, advances in MR imaging have facilitated the detection of very small BM, as advances in SRS technology have facilitated the highly conformal and simultaneous treatment of multiple target lesions.OBJECTIVE: To compare efficacy and toxicity of repeated frameless robotic SRS of up to 10 simultaneous BM through a single-center prospective randomized trial.METHODS: Two hundred patients will be randomized and receive imaging and treatment based on either the highly sensitive SPACE (sampling perfection with application optimized contrasts using different flip angle evolution) or the MPRAGE (magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo) magnetic resonance imaging sequence.If during follow-up new metastases are detected, treatment is repeated.The primary endpoint is reached when a patient develops more than 10 simultaneous new BM and is thus deemed unsuitable for further SRS.Overall survival will be assessed as secondary endpoint.Quality of life and neurocognition will be evaluated every 3 mo using CANTAB tests and EORTC (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer) questionnaires.EXPECTED OUTCOMES: We expect to show that repeated SRS based on sensitive imaging can delay intracranial dissemination while preserving neurocognitive function and quality of life.DISCUSSION: The present study is the first to prospectively assess the benefit of sensitive imaging and repeated stereotactic irradiation in the treatment of patients with multiple BM.It represents a novel approach, where in a palliative setting advanced technology in treatment and diagnostics is employed to improve tumor control while also reducing toxicity and preserving quality of life.",0,0,0,0

29564720,"Evaluation of the effect of the accordion suturing technique on wound lengths in breast cancer surgery: a randomised clinical trial.BACKGROUND: Cosmetic outcomes and scar lengths remain important considerations in breast cancer surgery.Suturing techniques should decrease scar tissue formation and provide good cosmetic results.The use of an accordion suturing technique may result in decreased surgical wound lengths and better cosmetic outcomes.We compared the outcomes of the accordion suturing technique with the standard suturing technique in breast cancer surgeries.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Female patients undergoing wide local excision of breast cancers were randomised to undergo closure of their surgical wound by either the accordion or the non-accordion (standard) suturing techniques between the months of May and October 2015.Pre-closure and post-closure wound lengths were measured intra-operatively.The primary outcome was a reduction of the surgical wound length at 6 weeks.The secondary outcome was a composite of the absence of hypertrophic scar tissue formation and optimal cosmesis.RESULTS: Thirty eligible women for wide local excision of breast tumours were randomly assigned to the accordion and non-accordion groups (15 accordion and 15 non-accordion).Seven women were excluded from the study because they underwent re-excision of margins for their breast tumours before the end of 6 weeks, and one woman was lost to follow-up.We therefore compared the outcomes of 12 women who underwent closure of their surgical wound by way of the accordion suturing technique to the outcomes of 10 women who underwent closure with the non-accordion (standard) suturing technique.The percentage reduction of wound length at 6 weeks was significantly greater in the accordion group than in the non-accordion group (M = 24.4, SD = 10.2 vs. M = 8.6, SD = 11.5, p = 0.0026).There was no significant difference in the cosmetic outcome between both groups using the James Quinn's wound evaluation score.CONCLUSION: The accordion suturing technique was associated with a significant reduction in surgical wound lengths in breast conserving surgery at 6 weeks without compromising the cosmetic result.",0,0,0,0
29567321,"Effect of early fasting and total parenteral nutrition support on the healing of incision and nutritional status in patients after sacrectomy.INTRODUCTION: Surgical site infection is one of the most common complications for patients after sacrectomy, which often accompanied by poor wound healing, sinus formation and serious metabolic disturbance.HYPOTHESIS: We tried to avoid the surgical site infection caused by feces during early period after surgery through early fasting and total parenteral nutrition (TPN) support, then compared the clinical results of these patients with other patients that received enteral nutrition (EN) early after sacrectomy.METHODS: Forty-eight patients after sacrectomy (the level of sacrectomy above S2) were randomly divided into two groups: TPN group and EN group.The patients of two groups received different nutrition support from the first day to the seventh day after surgery, then the factors such as nutritional and metabolic status after surgery, incidence of complications as well as the time of incision healing and hospitalization were observed.RESULTS: The p-value of total serum protein, albumin, serum alanine aminotransferase, total bilirubin at seventh day after sacrectomy between TPN group and EN group is <0.0005.The p-value of hemoglobin at seventh day after sacrectomy between TPN group and EN group is 0.001.The p-value of total serum protein at fourteenth day after sacrectomy between TPN group and EN group is 0.003.The p-value of albumin and total bilirubin at fourteenth day after sacrectomy between TPN group and EN group is 0.001.The p-value of hemoglobin, serum alanine aminotransferase at fourteenth day after sacrectomy between TPN group and EN group is <0.0005.The incidence of gastrointestinal complication and delay of apparition of feces in EN group were lower than that in TPN group (p=0.041, p<0.0005).The incidence of surgical site infection, the time of incision healing and hospitalization in TPN group were lower than that in EN group (p=0.048, p=0.008, p<0.0005).CONCLUSIONS: The method of fasting and supported by TPN during the early period after sacrectomy contribute to the incision healing, meanwhile, it shortens the hospitalization time and abates the incidence of complications in patients after sacrectomy.TYPE OF STUDY: It is a comparative randomized study.LEVEL OF PROOF: High-powered prospective randomized trial.",0,0,0,0

29580733,"The administration of adjuvant chemo(-immuno) therapy in the post ACOSOG-Z0011 era; a population based study.PURPOSE: The ACOSOG-Z0011-study has resulted in a trend to a more conservative treatment of the axilla for selected sentinel-node-positive patients.However, axillary nodal involvement has always been an important factor for tumor staging and tailoring adjuvant chemotherapy plans.This study evaluates the impact of omitting completion axillary lymph node dissection (cALND) on the administration of adjuvant chemo (-immuno)therapy in Dutch clinical T1-2N0M0 (cT1-2N0M0) sentinel-node-positive breast cancer patients.METHODS: Data were obtained from the nationwide NABON breast cancer audit.Descriptive analyses were used to demonstrate trends in axillary surgery and adjuvant chemo (-immuno)therapy.Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with the prescription of chemo (-immuno)therapy.RESULTS: In this cohort of 4331 patients, the omission of a cALND increased from 34% to 92%, and the administration of chemo (-immuno)therapy decreased from 68% to 55%, between 2011 and 2015 (P < 0.001).Patients treated with cALND had an OR of 2.2 for receiving adjuvant chemo (-immuno)therapy compared with SLNB only patients.Lower age, a hormone receptor (HR) status other than HR-positive, HER2-negative, increasing tumor grade and stage, and a lymph node status >/= pN2 were independently associated with a higher probability of chemo (-immuno)therapy (P < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that Dutch cT1-2N0M0 sentinel node-positive breast cancer patients treated with cALND had a higher independent probability for receiving adjuvant chemo (-immuno)therapy compared with SLNB only patients, even when corrected for lymph node status and HR-status.Probably, the decisions to administer adjuvant chemo (-immuno)therapy were not only based on guidelines and tumor characteristics, but also on the preferences from physicians and patients.",0,0,0,0
29589991,"Comparison of patient flow and provider efficiency of two delivery strategies for HPV-based cervical cancer screening in Western Kenya: a time and motion study.BACKGROUND: Improving patient flow and reducing over-crowding can improve quality, promptness of care, and patient satisfaction.Given low utilization of preventive care in low-resource countries, improved patient flows are especially important in these settings.OBJECTIVE: Compare patient flow and provider efficiency between two cervical cancer screening strategies via self-collected human papillomavirus (HPV).METHODS: We collected time and motion data for patients screened for cervical cancer in 12 communities in rural Migori County, Kenya as part of a larger cluster randomized trial.Six communities were randomized to screening in community health campaigns (CHCs) and six to screening at government clinics.We quantified patient flow: duration spent on each active stage of screening and wait times, and the number of patients arriving at CHCs and clinics each hour of the day.In addition, for four CHCs, we collected time and motion data for providers, and measured provider efficiency as a ratio of active (service delivery) time to total time spent at the clinic.RESULTS: Total duration of screening visits, at CHCs and clinics was 42 and 87 minutes, respectively (p < 0.001 for difference).Total active time lasted longer at CHCs, with a mean of 28 minutes per patient versus 15 minutes at clinics, largely due to differences in duration for group education (p < 0.001).Wait time for registration at clinics was 36 minutes, explaining most of the difference between settings, but sometimes incorporated other health services.CONCLUSIONS: There is a substantial difference in patient flow at clinics compared to CHCs.Shorter duration at CHCs suggests that the model is favorable for patients in limiting time spent on screening.Future cervical cancer screening programs designed for scale-up should consider how this advantage may enhance satisfaction and uptake.For clinic-based screening programs, efforts could be made towards reducing registration wait times.",0,0,0,0
29596123,"Fast-Track Recovery Program After Major Liver Resection: A Randomized Prospective Study.The objective of this study was to compare fast-track (FT) recovery protocol with the conventional one in patients treated with major liver resection by evaluating perioperative morbidity, length of hospitalization, and readmission rate.Sixty-two patients suffering from malignant liver tumors were surgically treated from May 2012 to April 2014.After randomization, they were prospectively divided into two groups: Group A patients (n = 32) followed FT recovery protocol and Group B patients (n = 30) were treated with the conventional (CON) protocol.Postoperative morbidity, readmission rate, and median hospital stay in the two groups were studied.Fast-track protocol was associated with a decreased complication (25%, p = .002), whereas the risk of postoperative morbidity was 2.4 times higher in patients treated with the CON protocol (60%, p = .002).Readmission rate was not significantly different between the two groups (6.25%, p = .35).Age (p = .382) and body mass index (p = .818) were not a suspending factor for following the FT protocol.Overall length of stay (postoperative days) in the FT group was (mean +/- SD) 5.75 +/- .5 and in the CON group was 13.5 +/- 6.7 (p < .001).Fast-track recovery protocol seems to be safe and particularly efficient in patients undergoing major liver resections.",0,0,0,0
29611275,"Clinical and prognostic significance of changes in haemoglobin concentration during 1 year of androgen-deprivation therapy for hormone-naive bone-metastatic prostate cancer.OBJECTIVE: To estimate the strength of change in haemoglobin (Hb) concentrations during 1 year of androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) as a predictor of survival in hormone-naive patients with bone-metastatic (Stage M1b) prostate cancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The patients included in this study were taken from the randomised trial (number 5) carried out by the Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group (SPCG), comparing parenteral oestrogen with total androgen blockade (TAB) in hormone-naive M1b prostate cancer.We identified 597 men where Hb measurements were made at enrolment, as well as at 3, 6 and 12 months of ADT.The time-dependent impact of Hb concentration changes on overall survival (OS) was analysed using multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis.The 10-year OS according to increase/decrease in Hb concentration for the three treatment periods was demonstrated using Kaplan-Meier curves.RESULTS: Multivariate analysis of changes in Hb concentration between baseline and 3 months showed better survival in patients with a decrease in Hb concentration (hazard ratio [HR] 1.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11-1.80) compared to those with an increase, whilst there was no difference in survival associated with a change in Hb concentration between 3 and 6 months (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.76-1.12).Contrary to the first 3 months, poorer survival was seen in patients with a decrease in Hb concentration between 6 and 12 months (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.62-0.92) compared to those with an increase.CONCLUSIONS: In a large cohort of Scandinavian men with hormone-naive M1b prostate cancer, an increase in Hb concentration between baseline and 3 months of ADT was associated with significantly poorer survival, whereas an increase between 6 and 12 months was associated with better survival.These findings provide new information about patterns of change in Hb concentrations during 12 months of ADT for M1b prostate cancer, and survival.Clinicians should be aware of the prognostic value of Hb concentration changes during ADT in M1b prostate cancer.",0,0,0,0
29648580,"Bevacizumab plus hypofractionated radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone in elderly patients with glioblastoma: the randomized, open-label, phase II ARTE trial.Background: The addition of bevacizumab to temozolomide-based chemoradiotherapy (TMZ/RT --> TMZ) did not prolong overall survival (OS) in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma in phase III trials.Elderly and frail patients are underrepresented in clinical trials, but early reports suggested preferential benefit in this population.Patients and methods: ARTE was a 2 : 1 randomized, multi-center, open-label, non-comparative phase II trial of hypofractionated RT (40 Gy in 15 fractions) with bevacizumab (10 mg/kgx14 days) (arm A, N = 50) or without bevacizumab (arm B, N = 25) in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma aged >/=65 years.The primary objective was to obtain evidence for prolongation of median OS by the addition of bevacizumab to RT.Response was assessed by RANO criteria.Quality of life (QoL) was monitored by the EORTC QLQ-C30/BN20 modules.Exploratory studies included molecular subtyping by 450k whole methylome and gene expression analyses.Results: Median PFS was longer in arm A than in arm B (7.6 and 4.8 months, P = 0.003), but OS was similar (12.1 and 12.2 months, P = 0.77).Clinical deterioration was delayed and more patients came off steroids in arm A. Prolonged PFS in arm A was confined to tumors with the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) I methylation subtype (HR 0.25, P = 0.014) and proneural gene expression (HR 0.29, P = 0.025).In a Cox model of OS controlling for established prognostic factors, associations with more favorable outcome were identified for age <70 years (HR 0.52, P = 0.018) and Karnofsky performance score 90%-100% (HR 0.51, P = 0.026).Including molecular subtypes into that model identified an association of the RTK II gene methylation subtype with inferior OS (HR 1.73, P = 0.076).Conclusion: Efficacy outcomes and exploratory analyses of ARTE do not support the hypothesis that the addition of bevacizumab to RT generally prolongs survival in elderly glioblastoma patients.Molecular biomarkers may identify patients with preferential benefit from bevacizumab.Clinical trial registration number: NCT01443676.",1,1,1,0
29652755,"Comprehensive Treatment and Rehabilitation of Patients With Osteosarcoma of the Mandible.OBJECTIVE: The article studies state-of-the art physical therapeutic techniques as a high degree of relevance to minimize invalidation and improve quality of life for patients with dental osteosarcoma.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted in 21 patients with osteogenic sarcoma of mandible (C41.1).There were 10 patients in the experimental group and 11 patients in the control group.RESULTS: A comprehensive treatment and rehabilitation program for patients with osteosarcoma of mandible was developed.The first part of the program comprised 3 basic phases: preop chemotherapy, surgery, and postop rehabilitation.The surgical treatment further included resection of an affected part of the mandible and primary repair of the defect with jaw fragments and an autoimplant joined together with the help of positioning devices.The postop rehabilitation included postop chemotherapy and mesodiencephalic modulation (MDM).The second part of the program comprised preop examination, modeling, using stereolytic 3-dimensional models of the mandible, corrective surgeries, including implantation into the autoimplant-a fragment of patient's fibula, and building of a removable titanium alloy-based denture.MDM sessions were administered after each invasive intervention.CONCLUSIONS: Higher psychological and physical well-being was observed in the experimental group as compared with the control group (P < 0.01) in 2 weeks after the first surgery and 2 months after scheduled corrective surgeries, which finished in denture installation.",0,0,0,0
29654415,"Health-related quality of life of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative advanced breast cancer treated with ribociclib + letrozole: results from MONALEESA-2.PURPOSE: Evaluate patient-reported outcomes (PROs) for postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) advanced breast cancer treated with first-line ribociclib plus letrozole.METHODS: In the phase III MONALEESA-2 study (NCT01958021), 668 patients were randomized 1:1 to ribociclib (600 mg/day; 3-weeks-on/1-week-off) plus letrozole (2.5 mg/day) or placebo plus letrozole.PROs were assessed using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer core quality-of-life (EORTC QLQ-C30) and breast cancer-specific (EORTC QLQ-BR23) questionnaires.Changes from baseline and time to deterioration in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) were analyzed using linear mixed-effect and stratified Cox regression models, respectively.Exploratory analysis of area-under-the-curve for change from baseline in pain score (AUC-pain) was performed.RESULTS: On-treatment HRQoL scores were consistently maintained from baseline and were similar between arms.A clinically meaningful (> 5 points) reduction in pain score was observed as early as Week 8 and was maintained up to Cycle 15 in the ribociclib arm.A statistically significant increase in mean AUC-pain was also observed in the ribociclib arm.Scores for all other EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-BR23 domains were maintained from baseline and were similar between arms.CONCLUSIONS: HRQoL was consistently maintained from baseline in postmenopausal women with HR+, HER2- advanced breast cancer receiving ribociclib plus letrozole and was similar to that observed in the placebo plus letrozole arm.Together with the improved clinical efficacy and manageable safety profile, these PRO results provide additional support for the benefit of ribociclib plus letrozole in this patient population.",1,1,1,1
29656304,"The gentamicin-collagen implant and the risk of distant metastases of rectal cancer following short-course radiotherapy and curative resection: the long-term outcomes of a randomized study.PURPOSE: A previous randomized study conducted by our group showed that application of gentamicin-collagen implant (GCI) into the pelvic cavity after total mesorectal excision (TME) reduced the incidence of distant metastases.Therefore, we decided to conduct a confirmatory study.METHODS: Patients with rectal cancer were included in the study if they met the following criteria: adenocarcinoma of the rectum, preoperative short-term radiotherapy (5 x 5 Gy), and WHO performance score 0-1.RESULTS: One hundred seventy-six patients were randomly assigned either to an experimental group in which GCI was applied (n = 81) or to a control group without GCI (n = 81).Median follow-up was 80 months.Cumulative incidence of distant metastases at 5 years was higher in the control group compared to the experimental group: 23.5 vs 8.6% (HR 2.4 [95% CI 1.1-5.5], P = 0.005).Overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and cancer-specific survival (CSS) did not differ between the experimental group and the control group: HR 0.95 [95% CI 0.55-1.70], P = 0.864; HR 0.85 [95% CI 0.50-1.45], P = 0.548, and HR 0.5 [95%CI 0.22-1.22], P = 0.093, respectively.The predefined by the protocol subgroup analysis for yp stage III disease showed better DFS in the experimental group compared to the control group; HR 0.47 [95%CI 0.23-0.97], P = 0.042).CONCLUSIONS: The results confirmed our previous finding that GCI applied in the pelvis significantly reduced the rate of distant metastases in patients after radical rectal cancer resection.",0,0,0,0
29664663,"Effects of Probiotic Supplementation on Hormonal Profiles, Biomarkers of Inflammation and Oxidative Stress in Women With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial.BACKGROUND: To the best of our knowledge, data on effects of probiotic administration on hormonal profiles, biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are scarce.This investigation was conducted to assess the effects of probiotic supplementation on hormonal profiles, biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress in women with PCOS.METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted on 60 women with PCOS, aged 18-40 years old.Subjects were randomly assigned into 2 groups to receive either probiotics or placebo (n = 30 each group) for 12 weeks.Metabolic profiles were quantified at baseline and after a 12-week intervention.RESULTS: After the 12-week intervention, compared with placebo, probiotic supplementation significantly increased serum sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) (+25.9 +/- 32.5 vs. +0.5 +/- 15.6 nmol/L, P < 0.001) and plasma total antioxidant capacity (TAC) (+8.8 +/- 120.5 vs. -98.3 +/- 246.4 mmol/L, P = 0.04), and significantly decreased serum total testosterone (-0.2 +/- 0.7 vs. +0.2 +/- 0.6 ng/mL, P = 0.03), modified Ferriman-Gallwey (mF-G) scores (-1.7 +/- 1.5 vs. -0.2 +/- 1.0, P < 0.001), serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) (-1150.0 +/- 1295.2 vs. +202.5 +/- 1426.3 ng/mL, P < 0.001) and plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations (-0.2 +/- 0.6 vs. +0.9 +/- 1.3 micromol/L, P < 0.001).We did not observe any detrimental effect of probiotic supplementation on other metabolic profiles.CONCLUSION: Overall, probiotic supplementation of PCOS women for 12 weeks had beneficial effects on total testosterone, SHBG, mFG scores, hs-CRP, TAC and MDA levels but did not affect other metabolic profiles.",0,0,0,0

29678994,"Can exercise delay transition to active therapy in men with low-grade prostate cancer? A multicentre randomised controlled trial.INTRODUCTION: Active surveillance is a strategy for managing low-risk, localised prostate cancer, where men are observed with serial prostate-specific antigen assessments to identify signs of disease progression.Currently, there are no strategies to support active surveillance compliance nor are there interventions that can prevent or slow disease progression, ultimately delaying transition to active treatment before it is clinically required.Recently, we proposed that exercise may have a therapeutic potential in delaying the need for active treatment in men on active surveillance.METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A single-blinded, two arm, multicentre randomised controlled trial will be undertaken with 168 patients randomly allocated in a ratio of 1:1 to exercise or usual care.Exercise will consist of supervised resistance and aerobic exercise performed three times per week for the first 6 months in an exercise clinical setting, and during months 7-12, a progressive stepped down approach will be used with men transitioning to once a week supervised training.Thereafter, for months 13 to 36, the men will self-manage their exercise programme.The primary endpoint will be the time until the patients begin active therapy.Secondary endpoints include disease progression (prostate specific antigen), body composition and muscle density, quality of life, distress and anxiety and an economic analysis will be performed.Measurements will be undertaken at 6 and 12 months (postintervention) and at 24 and 36 months follow-up.The primary outcome (time to initiation of curative therapy) will be analysed using Cox proportional hazards regression.Outcomes measured repeatedly will be analysed using mixed effects models to examine between-group differences.Data will be analysed using an intention-to-treat approach.ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Outcomes from the study will be published in peer-reviewed academic journals and presented in scientific, consumer and clinical meetings.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER:",0,0,0,0
29696328,"Does Intermittent Pringle Maneuver Increase Postoperative Complications After Hepatectomy for Hepatocellular Carcinoma? A Randomized Controlled Trial.BACKGROUND: In a previous study, we have shown that intermittent Pringle maneuver (IPM) might increase postoperative complications after hepatectomy for various indications.Complications which thought to be related to IPM were ascites, pleural effusion, wound infection and intra-abdominal collection.The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that applying IPM during hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) could increase postoperative complications.METHODS: Between January 2013 and October 2016, eligible patients who received elective open hepatectomy for HCC were randomized to have IPM or no Pringle maneuver (NPM).Occurrence of various types of postoperative complications was specifically looked for.A routine postoperative day 5 abdominal ultrasound examination and chest X-ray were done to detect and grade any radiological ascites, pleural effusion and intra-abdominal collection.RESULTS: Fifty IPM and 50 NPM patients with histological proven HCC were recruited for final analysis.Demographics and operative parameters were comparable between the two groups.The postoperative complication rates were similar (IPM 36.0 vs. NPM 28.0%, P = 0.391).However, in the IPM group, more patients developed radiological posthepatectomy ascites (42.0 vs. 22.0%, P = 0.032) and pleural effusion (66.0 vs. 38.0%, P = 0.005).In patients with histologically proven cirrhosis, there were 28 IPM and 25 NPM patients.Again, there was no difference in postoperative complication rate but more radiological posthepatectomy ascites and pleural effusion in the IPM group.CONCLUSION: This trial was not able to detect a difference in postoperative complications whether IPM was applied or not, but use of IPM was associated with more subclinical ascites and pleural effusion.(ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01759901).TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01759901.",0,0,0,0
29698447,"Celecoxib use and circulating oxylipins in a colon polyp prevention trial.Drugs that inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and the metabolism of arachidonic acid (ARA) to prostaglandin E2 are potent anti-inflammatory agents used widely in the treatment of joint and muscle pain.Despite their benefits, daily use of these drugs has been associated with hypertension, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal toxicities.It is now recognized that ARA is metabolized to a number of bioactive oxygenated lipids (oxylipins) by cyclooxygenase (COX), lipoxygenase (LOX), and cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes.Currently, the contribution of individual variability in ARA metabolism in response to the COX-2 inhibitors and potential adverse effects remains poorly understood.Using patient samples from the randomized, placebo-controlled phase III selenium/celecoxib (Sel/Cel) trial for the prevention of colorectal adenomatous polyps, we analyzed plasma concentrations of 74 oxylipins in a subset of participants who received celecoxib (n = 90) or placebo (n = 95).We assessed the effect of celecoxib (with and without low dose aspirin) on circulating oxylipins and systolic blood pressure (SBP).Individual CYP450- and LOX- but not COX-derived metabolites were higher with celecoxib than placebo (P<0.05) and differences were greater among non-aspirin users.LOX derived 5- and 8-HETE were elevated with celecoxib and positively associated with systolic blood pressure (P = 0.011 and P = 0.019 respectively).20-HETE, a prohypertensive androgen-sensitive CYP450 metabolite was higher with celecoxib absent aspirin and was positively associated with SBP in men (P = 0.040) but not women.Independent of celecoxib or aspirin, LOX derived metabolites from ARA were strongly associated with SBP including 5- and 8-HETE.These findings support oxylipins, particularly the ARA LOX-derived, in blood pressure control and indicate that pharmacologic inhibition of COX-2 has effects on LOX and CYP450 ARA metabolism that contribute to hypertension in some patients.",0,0,0,0
29701043,"[Therapeutic effects on ovulation and reproduction promotion with acupuncture and clomiphene in polycystic ovary syndrome].OBJECTIVE: To compare the difference in the therapeutic effects on ovulation disorder in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) between the combined therapy of electroacupuncture and clomiphene and the single medication of clomiphene and to explore the effect mechanism.METHODS: A total of 80 patients of PCOS were randomized into an acupuncture plus medication group (40 cases) and a medication group (40 cases).In the medication group, since the 5th day of menstruation or medicine-withdrawal bleeding, clomiphene was prescribed for oral administration, continuously for 5 days.In the acupuncture plus medication group, the medication was the same as the medication group.Additionally, 30 min electroacupuncture (continuous wave, 2 Hz) was applied to Qihai (CV 6), Guanyuan (CV 4), Zigong (EX-CA 1), Dahe (KI 12), Sanyinjiao (SP 6), Zhongji (CV 3), Diji (SP 8), Shenshu (BL 23), Sanjiaoshu (BL 22) and Ciliao (BL 32), etc.The treatment started on the 5th day of menstruation or medicine-withdrawal bleeding, once every two days, 3 times a week.One cycle of menstruation or 1 month was taken as one course.The treatment cycles were 3 months in the two groups.The level of estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P) in the serum, the endometrial thickness and morphology, ovulation rate and clinical pregnancy rate, as well as the clinical therapeutic effects were compared after treatment in the two groups.RESULTS: Two cases were dropped out because the herbal medicine was taken simultaneously in the acupuncture plus medication group.In the medication group, the medication was discontinued in 3 cases due to gastrointestinal adverse reactions.The total effective rate was 86.8% (33/38) in the acupuncture plus medication group, better than 64.9% (24/37) in the medication group (P<0.05).The ovulation rate in the acupuncture plus medication group was higher than that in the medication group [(86.8%, 33/38) vs (64.9% 24/37), P<0.05].The pregnancy rate in the acupuncture plus medication group was higher than the medication group in tendency, without significant difference [21.1% (8/38) vs 16.2% (6/37), P>0.05].After treatment, the results of endometrial thickness and morphology (A-type rate) in the acupuncture plus medication group were better than those in the medication group (P<0.01, P<0.05).After treatment, regarding the levels of E2 and P in the serum in the window period of implantation, the results in the acupuncture plus medication group were higher remarkably than those in the medication group (both P<0.01).CONCLUSION: The combined intervention of electroacupuncture and clomiphene achieves the definite effects of ovulation and pregnancy promotion in PCOS.It remarkably increases the levels of E2 and P in the serum, the endometrial thickness and A-type rate.The therapeutic effects of the combined intervention are remarkably better than those of the simple application of clomiphene.This combined intervention is safe and tolerable for the adverse reactions.The effect mechanisms may be related to the improvements of estrogen, progestin and endometrial receptivity.",0,0,0,0
29703793,"Liraglutide increases IVF pregnancy rates in obese PCOS women with poor response to first-line reproductive treatments: a pilot randomized study.OBJECTIVE: Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) has been investigated in regulation of reproductive system in animal models.The potential impact of short-term preconception intervention with liraglutide on fertility potential in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has not been evaluated yet.DESIGN: A prospective randomized open-label study was conducted in 28 infertile obese PCOS patients (age: 31.07 +/- 4.75, BMI: 36.7 +/- 3.5 kg/m(2), mean +/- s.d.).They were assigned to metformin (MET) 1000 mg BID or to MET 1000 mg BID combined with low-dose liraglutide 1.2 mg QD s.c.(COMBI) for 12 weeks.Ovarian stimulation protocol was started after a 4-week medication-free period.METHODS: The in vitro fertilization pregnancy rate (PR) was defined as the number of clinical pregnancies confirmed by ultrasound visualization of the fetal cardiac activity, divided by the total number of cycles performed or embryo transfers (ET).The spontaneous PR was followed for 12 months.RESULTS: Patients in the MET group on average lost 7.0 +/- 6.0 kg (P = 0.001) compared with 7.5 +/- 3.9 kg in the COMBI group (P < 0.001) with no significant between-treatment difference (P = 0.246).The PR per ET was significantly higher in the COMBI (85.7%) compared with the MET (28.6%) group (P = 0.03).The cumulative PR in the time frame of 12 months was 69.2% in the COMBI group compared to 35.7% in the MET group.CONCLUSIONS: Preconception intervention with low-dose liraglutide added to metformin is superior to metformin alone in increasing PRs per ET and cumulative PRs in infertile obese women with PCOS, despite comparable weight reduction in both groups.A potential impact of liraglutide on the reproductive system needs further exploration, in particular the GLP-1 impact on endometrial quality and receptivity.",0,0,0,0
29709558,"Bursectomy versus omentectomy alone for resectable gastric cancer (JCOG1001): a phase 3, open-label, randomised controlled trial.BACKGROUND: The role of bursectomy, in which the peritoneal lining covering the pancreas and the anterior plane of the transverse mesocolon are dissected, has long been controversial for preventing peritoneal metastasis.We investigated the survival benefit of bursectomy in patients with resectable gastric cancer.METHODS: This phase 3, open-label, randomised controlled trial was done at 57 hospitals in Japan.Patients aged 20-80 years who had cT3(SS)-cT4a(SE) histologically proven gastric adenocarcinoma with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 and body-mass index less than 30 kg/m(2) and who did not have distant metastasis or bulky lymph nodes were randomly assigned (1:1) during surgery to receive omentectomy alone (non-bursectomy) or bursectomy.Randomisation was done by telephone or website to the Japan Clinical Oncology Group Data Center and used a minimisation method with a random component to adjust for institution, cT status (T3 vs T4a), and type of gastrectomy (distal vs total).Both groups had total or distal gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy.The primary endpoint was overall survival, analysed in the intention-to-treat population.The study is registered with UMIN-CTR, number UMIN000003688.FINDINGS: Between June 1, 2010, and March 30, 2015, 1503 patients were enrolled based on preoperative inclusion and exclusion criteria.Intraoperative inclusion and exclusion criteria were met in 1204 patients, of which 602 were allocated to the non-bursectomy group and 602 were allocated to the bursectomy group.At the planned second interim analysis on Sept 17, 2016, the JCOG Data and Safety Monitoring Committee independently reviewed the results and recommended their early publication on the basis of futility because overall survival was lower in the bursectomy group than the non-bursectomy group, and because the predictive probability of overall survival being significantly higher in bursectomy than non-bursectomy patients at the final analysis was only 12.7%.5-year overall survival was 76.7% (95% CI 72.0-80.6) in the non-bursectomy group and 76.9% (72.6-80.7) in the bursectomy group (hazard ratio 1.05, 95% CI 0.81-1.37, one-sided p=0.65).64 (11%) of 601 in the non-bursectomy group and 77 (13%) of 600 patients in the bursectomy group had grade 3-4 operative morbidity.Pancreatic fistula was significantly more common in the bursectomy group than in the non-bursectomy group (29 [5%] vs 15 [2%]; p=0.032).Six deaths occurred either in hospital or within 1 month of surgery: five in the non-bursectomy group and one in the bursectomy group.INTERPRETATION: Bursectomy did not provide a survival advantage over non-bursectomy.D2 dissection with omentectomy alone should be done as a standard surgery for resectable cT3-T4a gastric cancer.FUNDING: Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan, and the National Cancer Centre Research and Development Fund.",0,0,0,0
29722789,"The importance of jointly analyzing treatment administration and toxicity associated with targeted therapies: a case study of regorafenib in soft tissue sarcoma patients.Background: Different methods have been proposed to analyze adverse events (AEs) associated with targeted therapies.While these AEs lead to dose adjustments for many patients, conventional reporting methods do not take drug administration into consideration.This paper underlines the importance of jointly reporting AEs and drug administration using prevalence, and proposes a complementary approach to reporting.Patients and methods: The prevalence method estimates the probability of progression-free patients being in a particular health state (state 1: AEs with full dose; state 2: AEs with reduced dose; state 3: no AEs with reduced dose) at different time points.To take into account the impact of dose adjustments on efficacy, the weighted prevalence method can be used by assigning utility weights to the different health states.The benefit of these methods was illustrated using data from a phase II trial of regorafenib.Results: Only 4.6% of progression-free patients developed mucositis/stomatitis (grade >/=2) at 3 months.The prevalence of patients not experiencing this AE but whose dose was reduced or treatment interrupted was 58.1%.The weighted prevalence of the regorafenib toxicity profile and dose reduction was higher in the control arm.Conclusion: This case study confirms the importance of jointly analyzing AEs and drug administration.The weighted prevalence approach is an average score that incorporates the dimension of drug administration into AE assessment.This can be helpful for regulatory agencies as well as for clinicians to evaluate the benefit-risk ratio of therapies in their treatment choice.Clinical trial: NCT01900743.",0,0,0,0

29730633,"Use of a GP-endorsed 12 months' reminder letter to promote uptake of bowel scope screening: protocol for a randomised controlled trial in a hard-to-reach population.INTRODUCTION: Flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS) screening is associated with reduced colorectal cancer incidence and mortality when offered as a one-off test to men and women aged 55-64.The test, also referred to as the 'bowel scope screening' (BSS) test, was added to England's national Bowel Cancer Screening Programme in March 2013, where it is offered to men and women aged 55.Since its implementation, uptake of the BSS test has been low, with only 43% of the eligible population attending an appointment.Sending non-participants a reminder at age 56 has been shown to improve uptake by up to nine percentage points at a single centre in London; we hypothesise that adding a general practitioners (GPs) endorsement to the reminder could improve uptake even further.METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This paper describes the protocol for a randomised controlled trial which will examine the effectiveness of adding a GPs endorsement to a reminder for BSS non-participants aged 56.All screening-eligible adults who have not responded to a BSS appointment at London North West Healthcare NHS Trust within 12 months of their initial invitation will be randomised to receive either a GP-endorsed reminder letter or reminder letter without GP endorsement.The primary outcome will be the proportion of individuals screened within each group 8 weeks after the reminder.Statistical comparisons will be made using univariate and multivariate logistic regression, with 'uptake' as the outcome variable, GP reminder group as the exposure and sociodemographic variables as covariates.ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study was approved by the Yorkshire & Humber-Bradford Leeds Research Ethics Committee (16/YH/0298) and the Confidentiality Advisory Group (17/CAG/0162).The results will be disseminated in a peer-reviewed journal in accordance with the Consort statement and will be made available to the public.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN82867861.",0,0,0,0
29733908,"The Impact of Staging by Positron-Emission Tomography on Overall Survival and Progression-Free Survival in Patients With Locally Advanced NSCLC.INTRODUCTION: We investigated the potential impact of stage migration because of positron-emission tomography (PET) scan staging on survival in the locally advanced (stage IIIA/B) NSCLC setting.METHODS: In PROCLAIM, 598 patients with stage IIIA/B nonsquamous NSCLC (intent-to-treat population) were randomized to either pemetrexed plus cisplatin and concurrent thoracic radiotherapy for 3 cycles followed by 4 cycles of pemetrexed consolidation or etoposide plus cisplatin and concurrent thoracic radiotherapy for 2 cycles followed by a consolidation platinum-based doublet regimen for up to 2 cycles.Baseline PET scan (PET Yes versus No) was one of the stratification factors.Subgroup analyses (PET Yes versus No) of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were conducted on the intent-to-treat population regardless of treatment, as the study did not show superior efficacy for either arm.RESULTS: Majority (491 of 598; 82.1%) of patients had a baseline PET scan staging performed.A longer median OS (PET Yes versus No: 27.2 versus 20.8; hazard ratio = 0.81, p = 0.130) and an improved median PFS (PET Yes versus No: 11.3 versus 9.2; hazard ratio = 0.73, p = 0.012) were observed for patients with PET scans compared to those with conventional staging in both treatment arms.CONCLUSIONS: Both a significantly improved PFS and a numerically longer OS in the PET Yes subgroup, compared to patients with conventional staging, are consistent with improved survival due to stage migration.The magnitude of differences in OS and PFS based on PET scan is a reminder of the potential for factors other than the therapeutic intervention to affect outcomes.",1,1,1,0

29909873,"Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of a Navigation Program for Colorectal Cancer Screening to Reduce Social Health Inequalities: A French Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial.BACKGROUND: Patient navigation programs to increase colorectal cancer (CRC) screening adherence have become widespread in recent years, especially among deprived populations.OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the first patient navigation program in France.METHODS: A total of 16,250 participants were randomized to either the usual screening group (n = 8145) or the navigation group (n = 8105).Navigation consisted of personalized support provided by social workers.A cost-effectiveness analysis of navigation versus usual screening was conducted from the payer perspective in the Picardy region of northern France.We considered nonmedical direct costs in the analysis.RESULTS: Navigation was associated with a significant increase of 3.3% (24.4% vs. 21.1%; P = 0.003) in participation.The increase in participation was higher among affluent participants (+4.1%; P = 0.01) than among deprived ones (+2.6%; P = 0.07).The cost per additional individual screened by navigation compared with usual screening (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio) was euro1212 globally and euro1527 among deprived participants.Results were sensitive to navigator wages and to the intervention effectiveness whose variations had the greatest impact on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.CONCLUSIONS: Patient navigation aiming at increasing CRC screening participation is more efficient among affluent individuals.Nevertheless, when the intervention is implemented for the entire population, social inequalities in CRC screening adherence increase.To reduce social inequalities, patient navigation should therefore be restricted to deprived populations, despite not being the most cost-effective strategy, and accepted to bear a higher extra cost per additional individual screened.",0,0,0,0
29915914,"Regular aspirin use and gene expression profiles in prostate cancer patients.PURPOSE: Pharmacoepidemiology studies suggest prognostic benefits of aspirin in prostate cancer.We hypothesized that aspirin induces transcriptional changes in tumors or normal prostate tissue.METHODS: We analyzed the prostatic transcriptome from men diagnosed with prostate cancer during follow-up of the Physicians' Health Study 1 (PHS, n = 149), initially a randomized controlled trial of aspirin.Aspirin target genes were identified through systematic literature review and a drug target database.We compared target gene expression according to regular aspirin use at cancer diagnosis and used whole-transcriptome gene set enrichment analysis to identify gene sets associated with aspirin use.Results were validated in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS, n = 254) and in Connectivity Map.RESULTS: Of 12 target genes identified from prior studies and 540 genes from the drug target database, none were associated with aspirin use.Twenty-one gene sets were enriched in tumor tissue of aspirin users, 18 of which were clustered around ribosome function and translation.These gene sets were associated with exposure to cyclooxygenase inhibitors in Connectivity Map.Their association with cancer prognosis was U-shaped in both cohorts.No gene sets were enriched in normal tissue.In HPFS, neither the target genes nor the gene sets were associated with aspirin use.CONCLUSIONS: Regular aspirin use may affect ribosome function in prostate tumors.Other putative target genes had similar expression in tumors from aspirin users and non-users.If results are corroborated by experimental studies, a potential benefit of aspirin may be limited to a subset of prostate cancer patients.",0,0,0,0

30058942,"Efficacy of a Media Literacy Intervention for Indoor Tanning Prevention.Indoor tanning leads to melanoma, the fifth most common cancer in the USA.The highest rate of indoor tanning is among young women whose exposure to tanned images in the media is linked to protanning attitudes.This study evaluated the efficacy of a media literacy intervention for reducing young women's indoor tanning.Intervention participants analyzed the content and functions of the media influencing protanning attitudes and produced counter-messages to help themselves and peers resist harmful media effects.The message production was of two types: digital argument production or digital story production.The control group received assessments only.This three-group randomized design involved 26 sorority chapters and 247 members in five Midwestern states where indoor tanning is prevalent.At 2- and 6-month follow-up assessments, those in the two intervention conditions were less likely to be indoor tanners (p = .033) and reported lower indoor tanning intentions (p = .002) compared to those in the control condition.No difference between the two intervention groups was found for behavior.Although the argument group exhibited slightly weaker indoor tanning intentions than the story group, the difference was not significant.The results provide the first evidence of the efficacy of a media literacy intervention for indoor tanning reduction.Implications for participative engagement interventions are discussed.",0,0,0,0
30063723,"Associations of angiogenesis-related proteins with specific prognostic factors, breast cancer subtypes and survival outcome in early-stage breast cancer patients. A Hellenic Cooperative Oncology Group (HeCOG) trial.Several studies support an important role of angiogenesis in breast cancer growth and metastasis.The main objectives of the study were to investigate the immunohistochemical expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family ligands (VEGF-A and VEGF-C) and receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3) in breast cancer and their associations with clinicopathological parameters, cancer subtypes/subgroups and patient outcome.Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue samples were collected from early-stage breast cancer patients treated with anthracycline-based chemotherapy within a randomized trial.Immunohistochemistry was performed on serial 2.5 mum thick tissue sections from tissue microarray blocks.High VEGF-A, VEGF-C, VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3 protein expression was observed in 11.8% (N = 87), 80.8% (N = 585), 28.1% (N = 202), 64.6% (N = 359) and 71.8% (N = 517) of the cases, respectively.Significant associations were observed among all proteins (all p-values <0.05), with the exception of the one between VEGF-C and VEGFR1 (chi-square test, p = 0.15).Tumors with high VEGF-A protein expression, as compared to tumors with low expression were more frequently ER/PgR-negative (33.3% vs. 20.8%, chi-square test, p = 0.009) and HER2-positive (44.8% vs. 20.6%, p<0.001).In addition, tumors with high VEGFR1 expression, were more frequently HER2-positive (32.8% vs. 19.6%, p<0.001), while tumors with high VEGFR3 expression were more frequently ER/PgR-negative (24.9% vs. 17.0%, p = 0.024) and HER2-positive (26.9% vs. 14.8%, p = 0.001).High VEGF-A and VEGF-C protein expression was associated with increased DFS in the entire cohort (HR = 0.57, 95% CI 0.36-0.92, Wald's p = 0.020 and HR = 0.71, 95% CI 0.52-0.96, p = 0.025, respectively), as well as in specific subtypes/subgroups, such as HER2-positive (VEGF-A, HR = 0.32, 95% CI 0.14-0.74, p = 0.008) and triple-negative (VEGF-C, HR = 0.44, 95% CI 0.21-0.91, p = 0.027) patients.High vs. low VEGFR1 expression was an unfavorable factor for DFS in triple-negative patients (HR = 2.74, 95% CI 1.26-5.98, p = 0.011), whereas the opposite was observed among the ER/PgR-positive patients (HR = 0.69, 95% CI 0.48-0.98, p = 0.041).Regarding OS, high VEGF-C protein expression was associated with increased OS in the entire cohort (HR = 0.64, 95% CI 0.46-0.89, Wald's p = 0.008), as well as in in specific subtypes/subgroups, such as ER/PgR-negative (HR = 0.37, 95% CI 0.20-0.71, p = 0.003) and triple-negative (HR = 0.42, 95% CI 0.19-0.90, p = 0.026) patients.In conclusion, high expression of angiogenesis-related proteins is associated with adverse clinicopathological parameters in early-stage breast cancer patients and may be surrogate markers of biologically distinct subgroups of ER/PgR-negative or triple-negative tumors with superior outcome.Further validation of our findings in independent cohorts is needed.",0,0,0,0
30063901,"While women await surgery for type I endometrial cancer, depot medroxyprogesterone acetate reduces tumor glandular cellularity.BACKGROUND: Multiple population-level studies have demonstrated an adverse effect of long wait times to surgery on survival for women with endometrial cancer.Other retrospective and nonrandomized prospective studies have shown that preoperative administration of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate decreases tumor glandular cellularity, which may be a surrogate marker for clinically meaningful tumor response.OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether preoperative injection with depot medroxyprogesterone acetate decreases tumor glandular cellularity when compared to placebo injection in women awaiting hysterectomy for endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia or type I endometrial cancer, and to determine whether depot medroxyprogesterone acetate injection affects quality of life while waiting for surgery.STUDY DESIGN: This was a double-blind, randomized controlled trial of 400-mg depot medroxyprogesterone acetate injection or 0.9% saline injection at the preoperative visit.Patients with recent use of progesterone analogs were excluded.A sample size of 76 patients (38 per arm) was calculated to detect a 20% difference in decreased glandular cellularity between arms.Pathologic characteristics including the primary outcome, tumor glandular cellularity, from patients' diagnostic biopsies were reviewed by 2 dedicated gynecologic pathologists and compared to posttreatment hysterectomy specimens.On the night prior to surgery, patients completed the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Endometrial Survey (Version 4) to report quality of life while waiting for surgery.In comparing characteristics between the intervention and control groups, t tests were used for continuous variables, and chi(2) or Fisher exact tests were used where appropriate for categorical data.RESULTS: From March 2015 through March 2016, 148 women were screened and 76 patients were enrolled.In all, 38 patients were randomized to and received depot medroxyprogesterone acetate injection and 38 were randomized to and received placebo injection.Demographics were similar between groups.Patients who received depot medroxyprogesterone acetate injection experienced a larger decrease in tumor glandular cellularity (mean change -64 [-31.8%] vs -14 [-5.5%] cells per quarter high-powered field in depot medroxyprogesterone acetate vs placebo groups, P = .002).This effect was most pronounced in women waiting >/=3 weeks for surgery.Several additional histologic and immunohistochemical markers of tumor differentiation and decreased cell proliferation were more pronounced in the depot medroxyprogesterone acetate group than in the placebo group.There were no significant differences in quality of life between groups on the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Endometrial Survey.Only 5.3% of patients who were approached declined to participate due to concerns regarding an intramuscular injection.CONCLUSION: Administration of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate prior to surgery for type I endometrial cancers caused greater tumor effect than placebo injection.Injection of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate was acceptable to and well tolerated by patients.Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate may represent a meaningful bridge to surgery in women who can expect long wait times.",0,0,0,0
30071296,"Daily Versus Weekly Prostate Cancer Image Guided Radiation Therapy: Phase 3 Multicenter Randomized Trial.PURPOSE: The optimal frequency of prostate cancer image guided radiation therapy (IGRT) has not yet been clearly identified.This study sought to compare the safety and efficacy of daily versus weekly IGRT.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This phase 3 randomized trial recruited patients with N0 localized prostate cancer.The total IGRT doses in the prostate ranged from 70 Gy to 80 Gy, sparing the lymph nodes.Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to 2 prostate IGRT frequency groups: daily and weekly (ie, on days 1, 2, and 3 and then weekly).The primary outcome was 5-year recurrence-free survival.Secondary outcomes included overall survival and toxicity.Post hoc analyses included biochemical progression-free interval, clinical progression-free interval, and other cancer-free interval.RESULTS: Between June 2007 and November 2012, 470 men from 21 centers were randomized into the 2 groups.Median follow-up was 4.1 years.There was no statistically significant difference in recurrence-free survival between the groups (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.81; P = .330).Overall survival was worse in the daily group than in the weekly group (HR = 2.12 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03-4.37]; P = .042).Acute rectal bleeding (grade >/=1) was significantly lower in the daily group (6%) (n = 14) than in the weekly group (11%) (n = 26) (P = .014).Late rectal toxicity (grade >/=1) was significantly lower in the daily group (HR = 0.71 [95% CI, 0.53-0.96]; P = .027).Biochemical progression-free interval (HR = 0.45 [95% CI, 0.25 - 0.80]; P = .007) and clinical progression-free interval (HR = 0.50 [95% CI, 0.24-1.02]; P = .057) were better in the daily group, whereas other cancer-free interval was worse in the daily group (HR = 2.21 [95% CI, 1.10-4.44]; P = .026).CONCLUSIONS: Compared with weekly control, daily IGRT control in prostate cancer significantly improves biochemical progression-free and clinical progression-free interval, and rectal toxicity.",0,0,0,0
30088226,"The Effect of Counseling on Breast Cancer Awareness in Rural Iranian Women: a Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial.In a community such as Iran where late presentation is predominant and the majority of breast cancer patients are diagnosed at advanced stages of the disease, there is an urgent need for improving the level of awareness about breast cancer and early detection measures.Given that rural residents are at higher risk for late diagnosis of breast cancer because they have less education, income, and access to advanced screening technologies, this study was conducted to determine the effect of counseling on breast cancer awareness of rural Iranian women.This randomized clinical trial was conducted on 60 rural women from the Abish Ahmad area in northwestern Iran in 2017.The randomized cluster method was used for sampling.From 20 rural health houses and centers, about one third were selected randomly.From the six selected clusters, three were randomly allocated as the control group and three as the intervention group.Using convenience sampling, 30 women between the ages of 40 and 69 were selected from the control group and 30 from the intervention group.The intervention group attended six group counseling sessions.Data was gathered using a demographic and obstetrical information questionnaire and breast cancer awareness measures.The chi-square, independent t test and ANCOVA by controlling for the baseline scores were used to analyze the data.After counseling, the mean knowledge about breast cancer score was significantly higher in the intervention group than in the control group (adjusted mean difference, 17.02; confidence interval (CI) 95%, 15.44 to 18.59; p < 0.001).The mean barriers to breast cancer screening score showed a significant decrease in the intervention group compared to the control group (AMD, - 1.74; 95% CI - 3.12 to - 0.36, p < 0.001).After intervention, the frequency of breast self-exam showed a significant difference between groups (p < 0.001); but for confidence about noticing breast changes, no significant difference was observed between groups (p = 0.08).Group counseling had a significant effect on enhancing breast cancer awareness of rural Iranian women, except for confidence about noticing breast changes.",0,0,0,0
30096441,"An Automated Intervention Did Not Improve Adherence to Oral Oncolytic Agents While Managing Symptoms: Results From a Two-Arm Randomized Controlled Trial.CONTEXT: An increasing number of oral cancer treatments require patient adherence and symptom self-management.OBJECTIVES: The report presents the effects of a medication reminder and symptom management intervention directed at patients initiating new oral oncolytic agents.METHODS: Patients (N = 272) were recruited at six comprehensive cancer centers, interviewed over the telephone after oral agent initiation, and randomized to either standard care or a medication reminder and symptom management intervention.In the intervention arm, the automated system called patients daily to remind them about taking their medications and weekly to assess 18 symptoms and refer patients to a printed Medication Management and Symptom Management Toolkit.Severity of 18 symptoms was also assessed during telephone interviews at Week 4 (midintervention), Week 8 (postintervention), and Week 12 (follow-up).Adherence was measured using the relative dose intensity, the ratio of dose taken by patient out of dose prescribed by the oncologist, and assessed using pill counts at Weeks 4, 8, and 12 and prescribing information from medical records.RESULTS: The relative dose intensity was high and did not differ by trial arm.Symptom severity was significantly lower (P < 0.01) in the experimental arm at Week 8 but not at Weeks 4 or 12.CONCLUSION: Adherence may be less of a problem than originally anticipated, and intervention was not efficacious possibly because of already high rates of patient adherence to oral oncolytic medication during first 12 weeks.Longer follow-up in future research may identify subgroups of patients who need interventions to sustain adherence.",0,0,0,0

30179056,"Acute hematological toxicity during post-operative bowel sparing image-guided intensity modulated radiation with concurrent cisplatin.OBJECTIVE: To report acute hematological toxicity (HT) in patients receiving post-operative bowel sparing intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and cisplatin and its dosimetric predictors.METHODS: Clinical database of Phase III trial (NCT01279135), that randomized patients to post-operative conformal or intensity modulated radiation therapy, was searched to select patient strata that received bowel sparing IMRT (50 Gy/25#/5 wks) and concurrent cisplatin (40 mg m(-)(2)).Pelvic bone marrow (BM) was retrospectively delineated in two sets: whole bone (WB), and freehand (FH) inner cavity of bone.Dose volume histograms (DVH) of BM were obtained.Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve identified DVH thresholds that predicted for Grade>/= II HT with highest specificity.Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed.RESULTS: Overall 75 patients received concurrent cisplatin.Grades I-V HT was observed in 38.7%, 42.7%, 14.7%, 0%, and 0% patients, respectively.Grade >/= II leukopenia, neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia were observed in 26%, 40%, 26.5%, and 1.4% respectively.None of the HT resulted in treatment break.On univariate analysis, whole pelvis+ lumbar FH V30 >55% & V40>35%, whole pelvis WB and FH V40 > 35%, and lower pelvis WB and FH V40 >20% correlated for Grade >/= II leucopenia and neutropenia.None of the BM dose volume constraints predicted for overall HT or neutropenia on multivariate analysis.CONCLUSION: The IMRT arm of NCT01279135 (PARCER study) that employed strict bowel constraints had unintentional but desirable BM sparing.None of the BM subvolume DVH parameters could be validated on multivariate analysis.ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: The prospective study reports feasibility of bone marrow sparing with bowel sparing post-operative pelvic IMRT and concurrent chemotherapy for cervical cancer.The present study reports low incidence of hematological and gastrointestinal toxicity during post-operative chemoradiation with IMRT.As both whole bone and freehand pelvis BM contours predicted for HT, hence an easier method of whole bone contouring should continue to be used till further validation of more specific BM subvolumes becomes available.The study results highlight the need for further research into dose volume constraints during post-operative IMRT.",0,0,0,0
30189025,"The course and predictors of perceived unsupportive responses by family and friends among women newly diagnosed with gynecological cancers.Perceived unsupportive responses from close others play an important role in psychological adaptation of patients with cancer.Little is known about whether these negative responses change after someone experiences a serious life event, and even less is known about the individual characteristics and related factors that might contribute to both the levels of and changes in perceived unsupportive responses over the course of adaptation to an experience.This longitudinal study aimed to evaluate changes in perceived unsupportive behavior from family and friends among women newly with gynecologic cancer as well as initial demographic, disease, and psychological factors that predict the course of perceived unsupportive behavior over time.Women (N = 125) assigned to the usual care arm of a randomized clinical trial comparing a coping and communication intervention with a supportive counseling intervention to usual care completed six surveys over an 18 month period.Growth models using multilevel modeling were used to predict unsupportive responses over time.Average levels of perceived unsupportive responses from family and friends were low.Unsupportive responses varied from patient to patient, but patients did not report a systematic change in perceived unsupportive responses over time.Cultivating meaning and peace and coping efficacy were associated with fewer perceived unsupportive responses as well as reductions in perceived unsupportive responses over time.Emotional distress, cancer concerns, functional impairment, holding back sharing concerns, and cognitive and behavioral avoidance predicted higher perceived unsupportive responses over time.The findings are discussed in terms of the self-presentation theory and social network responses to persons undergoing difficult life events.",0,0,0,0
30194031,"ODM-204, a Novel Dual Inhibitor of CYP17A1 and Androgen Receptor: Early Results from Phase I Dose Escalation in Men with Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.BACKGROUND: Most prostate cancer patients develop castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) after androgen deprivation therapy treatment.CRPC growth is mediated mostly by androgen receptor signalling driven by primary androgens synthesised largely by the CYP17A1 enzyme.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety profile and dose-limiting toxicities of ODM-204.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this open, uncontrolled, nonrandomised, multicentre, tolerability and pharmacokinetic first-in-man phase I dose escalation study, patients with metastatic CRPC were randomised to receive ODM-204 in sequential cohorts of five dose levels (ie, 50, 100, 200, 300, and 500mg twice daily) concomitantly with prednisone.INTERVENTION: ODM-204, a novel, orally administered, investigational, nonsteroidal dual inhibitor of CYP17A1 and androgen receptor.OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: ODM-204 plasma concentrations, serum testosterone, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels were evaluated and imaging of lesions was performed.RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Of the 23 patients enrolled into the study, 60.9% experienced mild adverse effects considered to be related to the study treatment, which were fatigue, increased/decreased appetite, nausea, asthenia, diarrhoea, and weight decrease.ODM-204 area under the curve (AUC0-12) values increased dose dependently until the 300mg dose.The AUC was lower on day 8 after repeated dosing compared with day 1 from the 200mg dose upwards.Decreases in testosterone levels were seen with ODM-204 treatment confirming androgen deprivation.Of the patients, 13% also demonstrated a >50% decrease in PSA at week 12 and continued ODM-204 treatment for over a year.CONCLUSIONS: ODM-204 was well tolerated up to the highest evaluated dose.There were decreases in both testosterone and PSA levels, suggesting preliminary antitumour activity in the treatment of CRPC.The pharmacokinetic properties of the molecule, however, prevent further development.PATIENT SUMMARY: This study looked at the safety of ODM-204, a novel dual inhibitor of CYP17A1 and the androgen receptor, in castration-resistant prostate cancer patients.ODM-204 treatment was found to be well tolerated, and it also reduced both serum testosterone and prostate-specific antigen levels, but the properties of the molecule prevent further development.",0,0,0,0
30203774,"Drug effect analysis of sorafenib combined with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization in the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.Sorafenib is a new multi-target oral drug that inhibits many kinds of protein kinase small molecules to treat tumors.Currently, sorafenib is one of the drugs that permit systemic treatment of liver cancer in the middle stage.Although sorafenib has good therapeutic effect on liver cancer, the clinical effect of sorafenib alone in the treatment of liver cancer is limited.This study compared the efficacy of sorafenib, TACE (transcatheter arterial chemoembolization), and sorafenib combined with TACE in the treatment of liver cancer patients.The results showed that the curative effect of sorafenib combined with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization is better than that of hepatic artery chemoembolization or sorafenib orally.The total effective rate of combined treatment is 93.8%, while the effective rate of arterial chemoembolization and sorafenib is 64.1% and 72.2% respectively.Combined treatment can significantly prolong the total survival of the patients with liver cancer, which is significantly different from that of arterial chemoembolization or sorafenib alone.",0,0,0,0

The response rate (according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors [RECIST]) was 22% in arm A (4 complete responses [CRs] and 8 partial responses [PRs]) and 17% in arm B (1 CR and 4 PRs).Stable disease or PR or CR was noted in 65% of patients in arm A and 48% of patients in arm B. The combination was found to be superior to monotherapy in patients with high and low levels of serum VEGF and VEGF receptor 2.Adverse events were consistent with the expected profiles of monotherapy with IL-2 and ziv-aflibercept.CONCLUSIONS: Ziv-aflibercept and IL-2 were found to significantly improve PFS compared with IL-2 alone, thereby meeting the primary endpoint of the current study.These findings support further study of immunotherapeutic combination strategies involving VEGF inhibitors.",1,1,1,0
30316737,"Comparison of the Effect of Intermittent and Continuous Aerobic Physical Training on Sexual Function of Women With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome: Randomized Controlled Trial.BACKGROUND: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common condition characterized by hyperandrogenism, anthropometric changes (increased weight and waist-to-hip ratio [WHR]), behavioral changes (sexual dysfunction, anxiety, and depression), and reduced quality of life.Physical exercise may reduce many of the adverse effects of PCOS.However, no studies have yet evaluated the effects of aerobic exercise on the sexual function of women with PCOS.AIM: To compare the effects of continuous and intermittent aerobic physical training on the sexual function and mood of women with PCOS.METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of a controlled clinical trial in which women with PCOS (18-39 years of age) were randomly allocated to 1 of 3 groups for 16 weeks: continuous aerobic training (CAT, n = 23), intermittent aerobic training (IAT, n = 22), or no training (control group, n = 24).The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) was used to assess sexual function, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to assess anxiety and depression.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The main outcome measure used was the FSFI.OUTCOMES: The primary outcomes were changes from baseline in total FSFI score and HAD scores at week 16 to prove the superiority of intermittent aerobic exercise compared with continuous aerobic exercise.RESULTS: After 16 weeks, the CAT group had a significant increase in the total FSFI score, improvements in the FSFI domains of satisfaction and pain, and a reduction in the WHR.The CAT and IAT groups also had significantly lower levels of testosterone after 16 weeks.The IAT group had a significant increase in the total FSFI score and improvements in the desire, excitation, lubrication, orgasm, and satisfaction FSFI domains.The CAT and IAT groups both had significant reductions in anxiety and depression scores after 16 weeks.CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Aerobic physical training protocols could be indicated to promote mental and sexual health in women with PCOS.STRENGTH & LIMITATIONS: This is one of the first studies to examine the effects of different physical training protocols on the sexual function of women with PCOS.The limitations of this study are that we did not consider diet or the frequency of sexual relations of participants with their partners.These factors could have interfered with the outcomes.CONCLUSION: The CAT and IAT protocols improved the sexual function and reduced the anxiety and depression of women with PCOS.Both protocols were similar to improve FSFI domain scores.Lopes IP, Ribeiro VB, Reis RM, et al.

Two-Year Results from a Prospective Randomized Trial in Breast Cancer Survivors.BACKGROUND: In a previous randomized controlled trial it has been demonstrated that arm compression sleeves worn immediately after breast cancer surgery, including axillary lymph node removal in addition to physical therapy are able to reduce the occurrence of early postoperative swelling and of arm lymphedema up to 1 year and to improve quality of life.The aim of the present investigation was to check the further development of the arm swelling in patients using compression sleeves or not, and to compare the quality of life in women treated due to breast cancer 2 years after surgery.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty from originally 23 patients who still wore their compression sleeves (15 mmHg) and 21 from 22 patients who had been randomized into the control group without compression could be seen after one more year.Arm volume measurements were performed and quality of life (QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23 questionnaires) was assessed.RESULTS: Three from 20 patients in the compression group (CG) and 6 from 21 without compression showed arm lymphedema, defined by an increase of the arm volume exceeding 10% compared with the preoperative values.Significant improvement of several quality of life parameters were found in the CG.CONCLUSION: Light compression sleeves worn for 2 years are not only able to reduce the incidence of early postoperative edema and of lymphedema, but also lead to a significant improvement of important quality-of-life parameters like physical functioning, fatigue, pain, arm and breast symptoms, and future perspectives.",0,0,0,0
30357310,"Dose tailoring of adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer based on hematologic toxicities: further results from the prospective PANTHER study with focus on obese patients.Background: Adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) for breast cancer improves relapse-free survival (BCRFS) and overall survival.Differences in terms of efficacy and toxicity could partly be explained by the significant interpatient variability in pharmacokinetics which cannot be captured by dosing according to body surface area.Consequently, tailored dosing was prospectively evaluated in the PANTHER trial.Patients and methods: PANTHER is a multicenter, open-label, randomized phase III trial which compared tailored, dose-dense (DD) epirubicin/cyclophosphamide (E/C) and tailored docetaxel (D) (tDD) with standard interval 5-fluorouracil/E/C and D. The primary end point was BCRFS and the primary efficacy analysis has been previously published.In this secondary analysis, we aimed to retrospectively explore the concept of dose tailoring.Our two hypotheses were that BCRFS would not vary depending on the cumulative administered epirubicin dose; and that dose tailoring would lead to appropriate dosing and improved outcomes for obese patients, who are known to have worse prognosis and increased toxicity after DD ACT.Results: Patients treated with tDD had similar BCRFS regardless of the cumulative epirubicin dose (P = 0.495), while obese patients in this group [body mass index (BMI) >/=30] had improved BCRFS compared with nonobese ones (BMI <30) [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.30-0.89, P = 0.02].Moreover, tDD was associated with improved BCRFS compared with standard treatment only in obese patients (HR = 0.49, 95% CI 0.26-0.90, P = 0.022) but not in nonobese ones (HR = 0.79, 95% CI 0.60-1.04, P = 0.089).The differences were not formally statistically significant (P for interaction 0.175).There were no differences in terms of toxicity across the epirubicin dose levels or the BMI groups.Conclusions: Dose tailoring is a feasible strategy that can potentially improve outcomes in obese patients without increasing toxicity and should be pursued in further clinical studies.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00798070.",0,0,0,0

30545649,"A randomized controlled trial assessing the efficacy of a self-administered psycho-educational intervention for patients with cancer.OBJECTIVE: Bibliotherapy refers to psychological self-help interventions that utilize treatment books to improve psychological well-being.Research supports bibliotherapy as an efficacious intervention for a variety of mental health problems.Yet, few studies have investigated bibliotherapy in psychosocial oncology.The objective of this randomized controlled trial was to examine the efficacy of the NuCare intervention, delivered as a self-directed workbook, for enhancing empowerment, coping, and quality of life and reducing distress in patients with cancer.METHODS: Eighty-nine adult patients with cancer were randomized to receive the workbook for 6 weeks or the control condition, usual care.Participants completed questionnaires at baseline, 6 weeks post-baseline, and 10 weeks post-baseline.RESULTS: The increase of empowerment (main outcome) and quality of life and the decrease of distress in the NuCare group from pre-intervention to follow-up assessment differed significantly from the respective difference scores in the control group.CONCLUSIONS: The self-administered NuCare workbook is a potentially cost-effective, minimal intervention addressing psychosocial needs of patients with cancer.PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Evidence-based bibliotherapy can empower patients and has the promise of reducing the burden on the healthcare system while enhancing the immediacy of psychosocial support.",0,0,0,0
30553078,"Design of a randomized controlled trial on the efficacy of a reproductive health survivorship care plan in young breast cancer survivors.BACKGROUND: Young breast cancer survivors (YBCS) have unmet needs for managing hot flashes, fertility-related concerns, sexual health, and contraception.PURPOSE: Describe the design and participant characteristics of a randomized controlled trial testing the efficacy of the survivorship care plan on reproductive health (SCP-R) intervention on improving hot flashes, fertility-related concerns, sexual health, and contraception in YBCS.METHODS: SCP-R is a web-based intervention with text message support encompassing evidence- based practices on four reproductive health issues.YBCS with >/=1 reproductive health issue are randomized to intervention (full SCP-R access) or attention control (access to list of online resources) arms with 24-week follow-up.The primary outcome will be improvement of at least one reproductive health issue measured by validated self-report instruments.Each YBCS nominated one healthcare provider (HCP), who can access the same materials as their patient.HCP outcomes are preparedness and confidence in discussing each issue.RESULTS: Among 318 YBCS screened, 57.2% underwent randomization.Mean age was 40.0 (SD 5.9), and mean age at cancer diagnosis was 35.6 (SD 5.4).Significant hot flashes, fertility-related concerns, vaginal symptoms, and inadequate contraception were reported by 50.5%, 50%, 46.7%, 62.1% of YBCS, respectively; 70.9% had multiple issues.Among 165 nominated HCPs, 32.7% enrolled.The majority of HCPs reported preparedness (68.5-90.7%) and confidence (50.0-74.1%) in discussing reproductive health issues with YBCS.HCPs were least likely to report preparedness or confidence in discussing fertility-related concerns.CONCLUSION: Conducting a trial for improving YBCS reproductive health online is feasible, providing a mechanism to disseminate evidence-based management.",0,0,0,0
30554923,"Cognition in breast cancer survivors: A pilot study of interval and continuous exercise.OBJECTIVES: The current study investigated the effects of two exercise interventions on cognitive function amongst breast cancer survivors.DESIGN: Pilot randomised-controlled trial.METHODS: Seventeen female cancer survivors (mean: 62.9+/-7.8years) were randomised into three groups: high-intensity interval training (HIIT, n=6); moderate-intensity continuous training (MOD, n=5); or wait-list control (CON, n=6).The HIIT and MOD groups exercised on a cycle ergometer 3days/week for 12-weeks.Primary outcomes were cognitive function assessments utilising CogState.Secondary outcomes were resting middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity, cerebrovascular reactivity and aerobic fitness (VO2peak).Data were analysed with General Linear Mixed Models and Cohen's d effect sizes were calculated.RESULTS: All 17 participants who were randomised were available for follow-up analysis and adherence was similar for HIIT and MOD (78.7+/-13.2% vs 79.4+/-12.0%; p=0.93).Although there were no significant differences in the cognitive and cerebrovascular outcomes, HIIT produced moderate to large positive effects in comparison to MOD and CON for outcomes including episodic memory, working memory, executive function, cerebral blood flow and cerebrovascular reactivity.HIIT significantly increased VO2peak by 19.3% (d=1.28) and MOD had a non-significant 5.6% (d=0.72) increase, compared to CON which had a 2.6% decrease.CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary evidence that HIIT may be an effective exercise intervention to improve cognitive performance, cerebrovascular function and aerobic fitness in breast cancer survivors.Considering the sample size is small, these results should be confirmed through larger clinical trials.",0,0,0,0
30557792,"Association of quality of life with disease characteristics and treatment outcomes in patients with advanced gastric cancer: Exploratory analysis of RAINBOW and REGARD phase III trials.BACKGROUND: Inadequate understanding of interpretation of quality of life (QoL) instruments leads to unsatisfactory data reporting and clinical decision-making, including in gastric cancer care.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pooled QoL data from two phase III studies of ramucirumab with or without paclitaxel in previously treated patients with gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer were used to explore associations with clinical attributes, including tumour response, disease measurability and performance status (PS).The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality-of-Life Questionnaire (QLQ)-C30 was used in both studies.Changes in QLQ-C30 scores from baseline to week 6 as a predictor of clinical outcomes and impacts of changes in clinical status on QoL were estimated by multivariate logistic regression and analyses of variance, respectively.RESULTS: Baseline QoL data were available for 989 patients.Fatigue, pain and appetite loss were prominent baseline symptoms.Disease progression resulted in worse QoL in all functional scales (p < 0.0001 to p = 0.0306), global QoL (p = 0.0011) and symptom scales (fatigue, p < 0.0001; nausea/vomiting, p = 0.0007; pain, p = 0.0052; appetite loss, p = 0.0061).Similar trends were seen with deterioration of PS on QoL. A 15- to 20-point change in global QoL and functional scale scores predicted change in tumour status as did change in fatigue, pain and appetite loss scores.Smaller QoL changes (5-15 points) predicted PS change.Results were similar in patients regardless of baseline disease measurability.CONCLUSIONS: Our study underscores the importance of disease control for maintaining or improving QoL. These data could improve future trial design and routine clinical care for patients receiving therapy for previously treated gastric cancer.NCT00917384, NCT01170663.",0,0,0,0

30679315,"A Phase II Randomized Trial of Panitumumab, Erlotinib, and Gemcitabine Versus Erlotinib and Gemcitabine in Patients with Untreated, Metastatic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma: North Central Cancer Treatment Group Trial N064B (Alliance).LESSONS LEARNED: Dual epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-directed therapy with erlotinib and panitumumab in combination with gemcitabine was superior to gemcitabine and erlotinib, but the clinical relevance is uncertain given the limited role of gemcitabine monotherapy.A significantly longer overall survival was observed in patients receiving the dual EGFR-directed therapy.The dual EGFR-directed therapy resulted in increased toxicity.BACKGROUND: Gemcitabine is active in patients with advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma.The combination of erlotinib, an oral epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor, and gemcitabine was shown to modestly prolong overall survival when compared with gemcitabine alone.The North Central Cancer Treatment Group (now part of Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology) trial N064B compared gemcitabine plus erlotinib versus gemcitabine plus combined EGFR inhibition with erlotinib and panitumumab.METHODS: Eligible patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas were randomized to either gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m(2) on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle with erlotinib 100 mg p.o.daily (Arm A) or the same combination with the addition of panitumumab 4 mg/kg on days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle (Arm B).The primary endpoint of the trial was overall survival.Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival, the confirmed response rate, and toxicity.Comparison between arms for the primary endpoint was done with a one-sided log-rank test, and a p value less than .20 was considered statistically significant.Response rate comparison was done with Fisher's exact test.All other reported p values are two-sided.RESULTS: A total of 92 patients were randomized, 46 to each arm.The median overall survival was 4.2 months in Arm A and 8.3 months in Arm B (hazard ratio, 0.817; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.530-1.260; p = .1792).The progression-free survival was 2.0 months in Arm A and 3.6 months in Arm B (hazard ratio, 0.843; 95% CI, 0.555-1.280; p = .4190).A partial confirmed response was seen in 8.7% of patients on Arm A and 6.5% on Arm B (p = .9999).No patients had a complete response.Grade 3 and higher nonhematologic toxicities were more common in patients on Arm B compared with those on Arm A (82.6% vs. 52.2%; p = .0018).CONCLUSION: Dual EGFR-directed therapy resulted in a significant prolongation of overall survival in patients with advanced adenocarcinoma of the pancreas but was associated with substantially increased toxicities.Dual EGFR-directed therapy in combination with gemcitabine alone cannot be recommended for further study, as single-agent gemcitabine is no longer considered an appropriate therapy for otherwise fit patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.",0,0,0,0
30698069,"Changes in health-related quality of life among gynecologic cancer survivors during the two years after initial treatment: a longitudinal analysis.Background: While many cancer survivors experience persistent impairments in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) for extended periods of time, others recover soon after treatment.The aim of this research is to assess changes in health-related quality of life in endometrial and ovarian cancer survivors during two years post initial treatment, and to assess clinical and sociodemographic characteristics associated with those changes.Methods: This prospective population-based cohort study includes longitudinal data of endometrial (N = 221) and ovarian (N = 174) cancer survivors diagnosed between 2011 and 2014.The EORTC QLQ-C30 functioning scales were used to assess HRQoL after initial treatment and after 6, 12 and 24 months.Clinical (stage, treatment and comorbidities) and sociodemographic (age, marital status and socio-economic status) characteristics were obtained from the Netherlands Cancer Registry and through self-administered questionnaires.Linear mixed models were used to assess changes in HRQoL over time and characteristics associated with these changes.Results: Among both endometrial and ovarian cancer patients, HRQoL improved within the first 6 months after initial treatment.Changes in HRQoL were mainly associated with clinical characteristics including comorbidities, treatment and tumor stage, and to a lesser extent with sociodemographic characteristics such as socioeconomic status.However, these associations varied per tumor type.Endometrial cancer survivors, who received radiotherapy and had no comorbidities, reported greater improvements in some HRQoL scales over time.Ovarian cancer patients who received chemotherapy and with advanced tumor stages reported poorer functioning during treatment.Most functioning domains (global health, physical and role functioning) recovered to levels of patients without chemotherapy or with early-stage disease after 12 months, but cognitive and social functioning remained impaired.Conclusion: Some subgroups of patients, including those with multiple comorbidities, with an advanced tumor stage and who received chemotherapy, may be in need of additional support as they are less likely to show improvements in HRQoL over time.",0,0,0,0
30700317,"Leukotoxicity after moderately Hypofractionated radiotherapy versus conventionally fractionated dose escalated radiotherapy for localized prostate Cancer: a secondary analysis from a randomized study.BACKGROUND: To compare WBC counts during treatment of localized prostate cancer with either conventionally fractionated (CF) or moderately hypofractionated (HYPO) radiotherapy.METHODS: Weekly blood test results were extracted from the charts of patients treated within a phase III study comparing HYPO to CF.In order to compare WBC counts at the same nominal dose in both arms and thus to tease out the effect of fractionation, for each recorded WBC value the corresponding cumulative total dose was extracted as well.WBC counts were binned according to percentiles of the delivered dose and three dose levels were identified at median doses of 16, 34.1 and 52 Gy, respectively.A General Linear Model based on mixed design Analysis Of Variance (ANOVA) was used to test variation of WBC counts between the two treatment arms.RESULTS: Out of 168 randomized patients, 140 (83.3%) had at least one observation for each one of the selected dose levels and were included in the analysis.Mean counts were lower in the CF than the HYPO arm at all selected dose levels, reaching a statistically significant difference at dose level #3 (5397/mm(3) vs 6038/mm(3) for CF and HYPO, respectively, p = 0.004).The GLM model confirms that the impact of dose on WBC counts is significantly lower in the HYPO arm over the CF one (Greenhouse-Geisser test, p = 0.04).Interestingly, while WBC counts tend to drop throughout all dose levels in the CF arm, this is the case only in the earlier part of treatment in the HYPO arm.CONCLUSION: This secondary analysis of a phase III study shows that dose fractionation is correlated to WBC drop during treatment of localized prostate cancer, favoring HYPO over CF.",0,0,0,0
30705033,"Randomized study of imatinib for chronic myeloid leukemia: comparing standard dose escalation with aggressive escalation.In 2007, we conducted a prospective randomized study to compare an aggressive dose escalation (group B, n = 123) with the standard dose escalation proposed by European LeukemiaNet (group A, n = 122).In group B, if patients did not achieve a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) at 3 months or did not achieve a major molecular response (MR3) at 6 months, imatinib was increased to 600 mg.At 6 months CCyR was achieved in 69.4% and 78.7% of patients in groups A and B, respectively.The rate of MR3 at 12 months and 24 months were similar in group A (52.1% and 70.0%) and group B (58.7% and 68.3%).The cumulative incidence of withdrawal by failure without accelerated/blast phase was higher in group A than in group B (9.2% vs 2.5% at 24 months).At 3 and 6 months, the protocol called for the imatinib dose to increase to 600 mg in 90 patients (74.4%) in group B. Among the 42 patients who received increased dose according to the protocol, 25 (60.0%) achieved MR3 at 12 months, whereas only 14 (35.0%) of 40 patients who did not receive an increased dose achieved MR3 (P < .05).The number of patients who withdrew from this study was similar (group A, 20%; group B, 21%).The early aggressive dose escalation failed to produce a better molecular response at 12 months.However, for patients who tolerate imatinib well, but show inadequate response at an early time point, aggressive dose escalation may contribute to achieving a better outcome.This study was registered at http://www.umin.ac.jp/ctr/ as #R000000965.",1,1,1,0
30707756,"A randomized study to improve care for young women with breast cancer at community and academic medical oncology practices in the United States: The Young and Strong study.BACKGROUND: The authors conducted a cluster randomized study to determine the effect of an exportable educational intervention for young women with breast cancer (YWI) on improving care.METHODS: Sites were randomized 1:1 to the YWI or a contact time control physical activity intervention (PAI) stratified by academic or community site.Up to 15 women aged </=45 years with newly diagnosed breast cancer were enrolled at each of 14 academic sites and 10 were enrolled at each of 40 community sites.The primary endpoint, attention to fertility, was ascertained by medical record review.Statistical inferences concerning the effect of the intervention used general estimating equations for clustered data.RESULTS: A total of 467 patients across 54 sites were enrolled between July 2012 and December 2013.The median age of the patients at the time of diagnosis was 40 years (range, 22-45 years).Attention to fertility by 3 months was observed in 55% of patients in the YWI and 58% of patients in the PAI (P = .88).Rates were found to be strongly correlated with age (P < .0001), and were highest in patients aged <30 years.Attention to genetics was similar (80% in the YWI and 81% in the PAI), whereas attention to emotional health was higher in patients in the YWI (87% vs 76%; estimated odds ratio, 2.63 [95% confidence interval, 1.20-5.76; P = .016]).Patients rated both interventions as valuable in providing education (64% in the YWI and 63% in the PAI).CONCLUSIONS: The current study failed to demonstrate differences in attention to fertility with an intervention to improve care for women with breast cancer, although attention to fertility was found to be higher than expected in both groups and emotional health was improved in the YWI group.Greater attention to young women with breast cancer in general may promote more comprehensive care for this population.",0,0,0,0
30753262,"Randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating oral glutamine on radiation-induced oral mucositis and dermatitis in head and neck cancer patients.BACKGROUND: Glutamine is the primary fuel for the gastrointestinal epithelium and maintains the mucosal structure.Oncologists frequently encounter oral mucositis, which can cause unplanned breaks in radiotherapy (RT).OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to explore the association between oral glutamine and acute toxicities in patients with head and neck cancer undergoing RT.METHODS: This was a parallel, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase III trial conducted in a university hospital.A central randomization center used computer-generated tables to allocate interventions to 71 patients with stages I-IV head and neck cancers.The patients, care providers, and investigators were blinded to the group assignment.Eligible patients received either oral glutamine (5 g glutamine and 10 g maltodextrin) or placebo (15 g maltodextrin) 3 times daily from 7 d before RT to 14 d after RT.The primary and secondary endpoints were radiation-induced oral mucositis and neck dermatitis, respectively.These were documented in agreement with the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.RESULTS: The study included 64 patients (placebo n = 33; glutamine n = 31) who completed RT for the completers' analysis.Based on multivariate analysis, glutamine had no significant effect on the severity of oral mucositis (OR: 0.3; 95% CI: 0.05, 1.67; P = 0.169).Only the change in body mass index (BMI) was significant in both multivariate completers (OR: 0.41; 95% CI: 0.20, 0.84; P = 0.015) and per-protocol analysis (OR: 0.40; 95% CI: 0.20, 0.83; P = 0.014).No difference was found in the incidence and severity of neck dermatitis between the two arms.CONCLUSIONS: The decrease in BMI was strongly related to the severity of oral mucositis in the head and neck cancer patients under RT, but not to the use of glutamine.This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03015077.",0,0,0,0
30762141,"Effects of live music during chemotherapy in lymphoma patients: a randomized, controlled, multi-center trial.PURPOSE: Chemotherapy is associated with both somatic and psychological side effects.Music might ease these problems.Several randomized controlled trials have investigated the effect of music, but the results are inconclusive.We aimed to examine whether live or pre-recorded music listening decreases anxiety during chemotherapy in newly diagnosed lymphoma patients.METHODS: A total of 143 patients with non-Hodgkin and Hodgkin lymphomas were randomly assigned into three groups receiving either 30 min of patient-preferred live music (n = 47), 30 min of patient-preferred pre-recorded music (n = 47), or standard care (n = 49) during up to five outpatient chemotherapy sessions.The primary endpoint was anxiety measured by the Spielberger's State Anxiety Inventory.Secondary endpoints included blood pressure, pulse rate, nausea and vomiting, serum catecholamine levels pre- and post-intervention to measure arousal levels, and health-related quality of life.The Musical Ability Test was used to link musical ability to the primary endpoint.RESULTS: When adjusting for age, sex, diagnosis, number of sessions, and baseline anxiety, the linear mixed model showed a borderline statistically significant reduction in the primary outcome anxiety in the live music group compared to standard care (7% (95% CI, - 14% to 0%, p = 0.05), while the effect of pre-recorded music was non-significant (5% (95% CI, - 12% to + 3%, p = 0.18).No intervention effects were seen in secondary outcomes.CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that patient-preferred live music reduces anxiety among patients with malignant lymphomas undergoing chemotherapy.Musical ability among this group of cancer patients seems not to be a determining factor for effect of music intervention.",0,0,0,0

30930074,"Saline-pocket endoscopic submucosal dissection for superficial colorectal neoplasms: a randomized controlled trial (with video).BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Colorectal endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is a time-consuming procedure because of the technical difficulty.The newly developed saline-pocket ESD (SP-ESD) provides a clearer view and better traction of the submucosal layer compared with the standard ESD with gas insufflation (S-ESD).This study aimed to prospectively compare the efficacy and safety between S-ESD and SP-ESD in patients with superficial colorectal neoplasms (SCNs).METHODS: From April 2017 to November 2018, 95 patients with SCNs >/=20 mm in diameter were prospectively and randomly enrolled.Four patients were excluded because of an incomplete ESD procedure.Patients were finally allocated to 2 groups, S-ESD with 45 patients and SP-ESD with 46 patients.The primary outcome was dissection speed.Secondary outcomes were ESD procedure time, en bloc and complete resection rates, perforation rate, and adverse effects.RESULTS: Median dissection speed was significantly faster in the SP-ESD than the S-ESD group (20.1 mm(2)/min [range, 17.3-28.1] vs 16.3 mm(2)/min [range, 11.4-19.8]; P < .001).Median procedure time was significantly shorter in the SP-ESD than the S-ESD group (29.5 minutes [range, 22.3-44] vs 41 minutes [range, 31-55]; P < .001).The en bloc and complete resection rates were 100% in both groups.No perforations occurred among patients.The volume of saline solution used in the SP-ESD group was significantly greater than that in the S-ESD group (200 mL [range, 120-250] vs 150 mL [range, 100-200]; P = .016).CONCLUSIONS: SP-ESD improved dissection speed and procedure time compared with S-ESD.SP-ESD may be an alternative method for resection of SCNs.(Clinical trial registration number: UMIN 000026317.).",0,0,0,0
30959123,"Prostate-Specific Antigen After Neoadjuvant Androgen Suppression in Prostate Cancer Patients Receiving Short-Term Androgen Suppression and External Beam Radiation Therapy: Pooled Analysis of Four NRG Oncology Radiation Therapy Oncology Group Randomized Clinical Trials.PURPOSE: To validate whether prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level after neoadjuvant androgen suppression (neoAS) is associated with long-term outcome after neoAS and external beam radiation therapy (RT) with concurrent short-term androgen suppression (AS) in patients with prostate cancer.METHODS AND MATERIALS: This study included 2404 patients.The patients were treated with neoAS before RT and concurrent AS (without post-RT AS) and were pooled from NRG Oncology/RTOG trials 9202, 9408, 9413, and 9910.Multivariable models were used to test associations between the prespecified dichotomized post-neoAS, pre-RT PSA level (</=0.1 vs >0.1 ng/mL) groupings, and clinical outcomes.RESULTS: The median follow-up for surviving patients was 9.4 years.The median post-neoAS, pre-RT PSA level was 0.3 ng/mL, with 32% of patients having levels </=0.1 ng/mL. Race, Gleason score, tumor stage, node stage, pretreatment PSA level, and duration of neoAS were associated with the groups of patients with PSA levels </=0.1 and >0.1 ng/mL. In univariate analyses, post-neoAS, pre-RT PSA level >0.1 ng/mL was associated with increased risks of biochemical failure (hazard ratio [HR], 2.04; P < .0001); local failure (HR, 2.51; P < .0001); distant metastases (HR, 1.73; P = .0006); cause-specific mortality (HR, 2.36; P < .0001); and all-cause mortality (HR, 1.24; P = .005).In multivariable models that also included baseline and treatment variables, post-neoAS, pre-RT PSA level >0.1 ng/mL was independently associated with increased risk of biochemical failure (HR, 2.00; P < .0001); local failure (HR, 2.33; P < .0001); and cause-specific mortality (HR, 1.75; P = .03).CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a PSA level >0.1 ng/mL after neoAS and before the start of RT had less favorable clinical outcomes than patients whose PSA level was </=0.1 ng/mL. The role of post-neoAS, pre-RT PSA level relative to PSA levels obtained along the continuum of medical care is not presently defined but could be tested in future clinical trials.",0,0,0,0
30962136,"Laparoscopic versus open liver resection in the posterosuperior segments: a sub-group analysis from the OSLO-COMET randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic liver resection in the posterosuperior segments is technically challenging.This study aimed to compare the perioperative outcomes for laparoscopic and open resection of colorectal liver metastases located in the posterosuperior segments.METHODS: This was a subgroup analysis of the OSLO-COMET randomized controlled trial, where 280 patients were randomly assigned to open or laparoscopic parenchyma-sparing liver resections of colorectal metastases.Patients with tumors in the posterosuperior segments were identified, and perioperative outcomes and health related quality of life (HRQoL) were compared.RESULTS: We identified a total of 136 patients, 62 in the laparoscopic and 74 in the open group.The postoperative complication rate was 26% in the laparoscopic and 31% in the open group.The blood loss was less in the open group (500 vs. 250 ml, P = 0.006), but the perioperative transfusion rate was similar.The operative time was similar, while postoperative hospital stay was shorter in the laparoscopic group (2 vs. 4 days, P < 0.001).HRQoL was significantly better after laparoscopy at 1 month.CONCLUSION: In patients undergoing laparoscopic or open liver resection of colorectal liver metastases in the posterosuperior segments, laparoscopic surgery was associated with shorter hospital stay and comparable perioperative outcomes.",0,0,0,0
30975219,"Re-endothelialisation after Synergy stent and Absorb bioresorbable vascular scaffold implantation in acute myocardial infarction: COVER-AMI study.BACKGROUND/AIMS: Drug eluting stent (DES) decrease the risk of restenosis by reducing the neointimal response.However, DES may impair strut coverage, and this has been associated with late stent/scaffold thrombosis.Bioresorbable vascular scaffold (BVS) may overcome the risk of stent/scaffold thrombosis when completely resorbed.The purpose of this randomised trial was to compare the arterial healing response in the short term, as a surrogate for safety and efficacy, between the metallic everolimus-eluting stent (Synergy; Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA, USA) and the everolimus BVS (Absorb; Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, CA, USA) in the particular setting of acute myocardial infarction (AMI).This pilot study sought to compare the neointimal response of metallic everolimus DES (Synergy) with polymeric everolimus BVS (Absorb) by optical coherence tomography (OCT) 3 months after an AMI.METHODS: COVER-AMI was a single-centre, single-blind, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial.Patients with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) who underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention were randomly allocated (1:1) to treatment with the Synergy DES or Absorb BVS.The primary endpoint was the 3-month neointimal response assessed as the percentage of uncovered struts, neointimal thickness, in-stent/scaffold area obstruction, and pattern of neointima.The main secondary endpoint included the device-oriented composite endpoint according to the Academic Research Consortium definition.RESULTS: Twenty patients without clinical and/or angiographic complications (Synergy (n = 10) or BVS (n = 10); mean age 59.0 years; 20% female) were enrolled in our centre.The stent diameter was higher in the Synergy group (3.7 +/- 0.4 mm vs 3.4 +/- 0.4 mm in the BVS group, p = 0.01).At 3 months, no significant differences in angiographic lumen loss were observed between the everolimus DES and everolimus BVS (0.04 mm (IQR 0.00-0.07) vs 0.11 mm (IQR 0.04-0.31), p = 0.165).OCT analysis of 420 cross-sections showed that the total neointimal area and in-stent obstruction were lower in the Synergy group, while OCT analysis at the strut level (n = 3942 struts) showed that the rate of uncovered struts was lower in the BVS group.CONCLUSIONS: Stenting of culprit lesions in the setting of STEMI resulted in a nearly complete arterial healing for both the Synergy and the BVS devices.Lower neointimal thickness and in-stent obstruction but a higher rate of uncovered struts were observed in the Synergy group.These findings provide the basis for further exploration in clinically oriented outcome trials.",0,0,0,0
30982687,"Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy versus standard of care palliative treatment in patients with oligometastatic cancers (SABR-COMET): a randomised, phase 2, open-label trial.BACKGROUND: The oligometastatic paradigm suggests that some patients with a limited number of metastases might be cured if all lesions are eradicated.Evidence from randomised controlled trials to support this paradigm is scarce.We aimed to assess the effect of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) on survival, oncological outcomes, toxicity, and quality of life in patients with a controlled primary tumour and one to five oligometastatic lesions.METHODS: This randomised, open-label phase 2 study was done at 10 hospitals in Canada, the Netherlands, Scotland, and Australia.Patients aged 18 or older with a controlled primary tumour and one to five metastatic lesions, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score of 0-1, and a life expectancy of at least 6 months were eligible.After stratifying by the number of metastases (1-3 vs 4-5), we randomly assigned patients (1:2) to receive either palliative standard of care treatments alone (control group), or standard of care plus SABR to all metastatic lesions (SABR group), using a computer-generated randomisation list with permuted blocks of nine.Neither patients nor physicians were masked to treatment allocation.The primary endpoint was overall survival.We used a randomised phase 2 screening design with a two-sided alpha of 0.20 (wherein p<0.20 designates a positive trial).All analyses were intention to treat.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01446744.FINDINGS: 99 patients were randomised between Feb 10, 2012, and Aug 30, 2016.Of 99 patients, 33 (33%) were assigned to the control group and 66 (67%) to the SABR group.Two (3%) patients in the SABR group did not receive allocated treatment and withdrew from the trial; two (6%) patients in the control group also withdrew from the trial.Median follow-up was 25 months (IQR 19-54) in the control group versus 26 months (23-37) in the SABR group.Median overall survival was 28 months (95% CI 19-33) in the control group versus 41 months (26-not reached) in the SABR group (hazard ratio 0.57, 95% CI 0.30-1.10; p=0.090).Adverse events of grade 2 or worse occurred in three (9%) of 33 controls and 19 (29%) of 66 patients in the SABR group (p=0.026), an absolute increase of 20% (95% CI 5-34).Treatment-related deaths occurred in three (4.5%) of 66 patients after SABR, compared with none in the control group.INTERPRETATION: SABR was associated with an improvement in overall survival, meeting the primary endpoint of this trial, but three (4.5%) of 66 patients in the SABR group had treatment-related death.Phase 3 trials are needed to conclusively show an overall survival benefit, and to determine the maximum number of metastatic lesions wherein SABR provides a benefit.FUNDING: Ontario Institute for Cancer Research and London Regional Cancer Program Catalyst Grant.",0,0,0,0

31063024,"Symptom Assessment in Patients with Advanced Cancer: Are the Most Severe Symptoms the Most Bothersome?Objective: We investigated correspondence between symptom severity and symptom bothersomeness in patients with advanced cancer.Background: Symptom severity is commonly assessed in clinical cancer settings, but bothersomeness of these symptoms is less often measured.Methods: Participants with advanced cancer enrolled in a cluster-randomized trial of early palliative care completed the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS) and the quality of life at the end of life (QUAL-E) measure as part of their baseline assessment.For each symptom, we examined the correspondence between the symptom being indicated as most severe on the ESAS and rated as most bothersome on the QUAL-E. Results: For the 386 patients who completed relevant sections of the ESAS and QUAL-E, tiredness (32.8%), sleep (23.8%), and appetite (20.2%) were most frequently rated as most severe, whereas pain (28.9%) and tiredness (24.3%) were most frequently indicated as most bothersome.The most bothersome and most severe symptom corresponded in 42%.Pain and/or tiredness were consistently among the top three most bothersome symptoms, whereas appetite was frequently rated the most severe symptom but was rarely perceived as the most bothersome.The probability that patients rating a symptom as most severe would also rate it as most bothersome was highest for pain (66%), nausea (58%), and tiredness (40%).Discussion: ESAS symptom severity does not necessarily indicate patients' most bothersome symptom; regardless of severity, pain and tiredness are most frequently perceived as most bothersome.Further research should investigate the clinical benefits of patients also indicating their three most bothersome ESAS symptoms.",0,0,0,0

31070690,"Sorafenib Plus Hepatic Arterial Infusion of Oxaliplatin, Fluorouracil, and Leucovorin vs Sorafenib Alone for Hepatocellular Carcinoma With Portal Vein Invasion: A Randomized Clinical Trial.Importance: Sorafenib is the first-line treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein invasion; however, it has shown unsatisfactory survival benefit.Sorafenib plus hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) of oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and leucovorin (FOLFOX) has shown promising results for these patients in a previous phase 2 study.Objective: To investigate the efficacy and safety of sorafenib plus HAIC compared with sorafenib for hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein invasion.Design, Setting, and Participants: This randomized, open-label clinical trial enrolled 818 screened patients.Of the 818 participants, 247 with hepatocellular carcinoma and portal vein invasion were randomly assigned (1:1) via a computer-generated sequence to receive sorafenib plus HAIC or sorafenib.This trial was conducted at 5 hospitals in China and enrolled patients from April 1, 2016, to October 10, 2017, with a follow-up period of 10 months.Interventions: Randomization to receive 400 mg sorafenib twice daily (sorafenib group) or 400 mg sorafenib twice daily plus HAIC (SoraHAIC group) (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2, leucovorin 400 mg/m2, fluorouracil bolus 400 mg/m2 on day 1, and fluorouracil infusion 2400 mg/m2 for 46 hours, every 3 weeks).Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary endpoint was overall survival by intention-to-treat analysis.Safety was assessed in patients who received at least 1 dose of study treatment.Results: For 247 patients (median age, 49 years; range, 18-75 years; 223 men and 24 women), median overall survival was 13.37 months (95% CI, 10.27-16.46) in the SoraHAIC group vs 7.13 months (95% CI, 6.28-7.98) in the sorafenib group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.35; 95% CI, 0.26-0.48; P < .001).The SoraHAIC group showed a higher response rate than the sorafenib group (51 [40.8%] vs 3 [2.46%]; P < .001), and a longer median progression-free survival (7.03 [95% CI, 6.05-8.02] vs 2.6 [95% CI, 2.15-3.05] months; P < .001).Grade 3/4 adverse events that were more frequent in the SoraHAIC group than in the sorafenib group included neutropenia (12 [9.68%] vs 3 [2.48%]), thrombocytopenia (16 [12.9%] vs 6 [4.96%]), and vomiting (8 [6.45%] vs 1 [0.83%]).Conclusions and Relevance: Sorafenib plus HAIC of FOLFOX improved overall survival and had acceptable toxic effects compared with sorafenib in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and portal vein invasion.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02774187.",1,1,1,0
31080129,"Diagnostic accuracy of whole-body MRI versus standard imaging pathways for metastatic disease in newly diagnosed non-small-cell lung cancer: the prospective Streamline L trial.BACKGROUND: Whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (WB-MRI) could be an alternative to multi-modality staging of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but its diagnostic accuracy, effect on staging times, number of tests needed, cost, and effect on treatment decisions are unknown.We aimed to prospectively compare the diagnostic accuracy and efficiency of WB-MRI-based staging pathways with standard pathways in NSCLC.METHODS: The Streamline L trial was a prospective, multicentre trial done in 16 hospitals in England.Eligible patients were 18 years or older, with newly diagnosed NSCLC that was potentially radically treatable on diagnostic chest CT (defined as stage IIIb or less).Exclusion criteria were severe systemic disease, pregnancy, contraindications to MRI, or histologies other than NSCLC.Patients underwent WB-MRI, the result of which was withheld until standard staging investigations were complete and the first treatment decision made.The multidisciplinary team recorded its treatment decision based on standard investigations, then on the WB-MRI staging pathway (WB-MRI plus additional tests generated), and finally on all tests.The primary outcome was difference in per-patient sensitivity for metastases between standard and WB-MRI staging pathways against a consensus reference standard at 12 months, in the per-protocol population.Secondary outcomes were difference in per-patient specificity for metastatic disease detection between standard and WB-MRI staging pathways, differences in treatment decisions, staging efficiency (time taken, test number, and costs) and per-organ sensitivity and specificity for metastases and per-patient agreement for local T and N stage.This trial is registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial registry, number ISRCTN50436483, and is complete.FINDINGS: Between Feb 26, 2013, and Sept 5, 2016, 976 patients were screened for eligibility.353 patients were recruited, 187 of whom completed the trial; 52 (28%) had metastasis at baseline.Pathway sensitivity was 50% (95% CI 37-63) for WB-MRI and 54% (41-67) for standard pathways, a difference of 4% (-7 to 15, p=0.73).No adverse events related to imaging were reported.Specificity did not differ between WB-MRI (93% [88-96]) and standard pathways (95% [91-98], p=0.45).Agreement with the multidisciplinary team's final treatment decision was 98% for WB-MRI and 99% for the standard pathway.Time to complete staging was shorter for WB-MRI (13 days [12-14]) than for the standard pathway (19 days [17-21]); a 6-day (4-8) difference.The number of tests required was similar WB-MRI (one [1-1]) and standard pathways (one [1-2]).Mean per-patient costs were pound317 (273-361) for WBI-MRI and pound620 (574-666) for standard pathways.INTERPRETATION: WB-MRI staging pathways have similar accuracy to standard pathways, and reduce the staging time and costs.FUNDING: UK National Institute for Health Research.",0,0,0,0
31120501,"Effect of Gemcitabine and nab-Paclitaxel With or Without Hydroxychloroquine on Patients With Advanced Pancreatic Cancer: A Phase 2 Randomized Clinical Trial.Importance: Autophagy is a mechanism of treatment resistance to chemotherapy that has a role in the maintenance of pancreatic cancer.Hydroxychloroquine sulfate (HCQ) is an inhibitor of autophagy that inhibits the fusion of the autophagosome to the lysosome.Objective: To determine whether HCQ improves overall survival at 1 year in combination with gemcitabine hydrochloride and nab-paclitaxel (GA) among patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.Design, Setting, and Participants: Open-label, phase 2 randomized clinical trial conducted between March 18, 2013, and November 16, 2017, at the University of Pennsylvania, HonorHealth, and The Johns Hopkins University among 112 patients with previously untreated metastatic or advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, and adequate marrow and organ function.All efficacy analyses were performed for the intention-to-treat population.Interventions: Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive GA with or without HCQ.All patients received standard doses of GA, and those randomized to receive HCQ were treated continuously with 600 mg orally twice daily.Main Outcome and Measure: Overall survival at 1 year.Results: A total of 112 patients (45 women and 67 men; median age, 65 years; range, 43-86 years) were enrolled; 55 were randomized to receive GA plus HCQ, and 57 to receive GA.Overall survival at 12 months was 41% (95% CI, 27%-53%) in the HCQ group and 49% (95% CI, 35%-61%) in the non-HCQ group.Median progression-free survival was 5.7 months (95% CI, 4.0-9.3 months) in the HCQ group and 6.4 months (95% CI, 4.5-7.6 months) in the non-HCQ group.Median overall survival was 11.1 months (95% CI, 9.0-14.2 months) in the HCQ group and 12.1 months (95% CI, 9.3-15.5 months) in the non-HCQ group.Overall response rate was 38.2% (n = 21) in the HCQ group and 21.1% (n = 12) in the non-HCQ group (P = .047).Treatment-related grade 3 or 4 adverse events that differed between the HCQ and non-HCQ groups were neutropenia (23 of 54 [42.6%] vs 12 of 53 [22.6%]), anemia (2 of 54 [3.7%] vs 9 of 53 [17.0%]), fatigue (4 of 54 [7.4%] vs 0), nausea (5 of 54 [9.3%] vs 0), peripheral neuropathy (7 of 54 [13.0%] vs 3 of 53 [5.7%]), visual changes (3 of 54 [5.6%] vs 0), and neuropsychiatric symptoms (3 of 54 [5.6%] vs 0).Conclusions and Relevance: The addition of HCQ to block autophagy did not improve the primary end point of overall survival at 12 months.These data do not support the routine use of GA plus HCQ for metastatic pancreatic cancer in the absence of a biomarker.However, improvement seen in the overall response rate with HCQ may indicate a role for HCQ in the locally advanced setting, where tumor response may permit resection.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01506973.",0,0,0,0
31124042,"Overview of results from the Vitamin D Assessment (ViDA) study.BACKGROUND: The Vitamin D Assessment (ViDA) study is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of monthly vitamin D supplementation in reducing the incidence of a range of acute and chronic diseases and intermediate outcomes.METHODS: The study was carried out in Auckland, New Zealand, among 5110 adults, aged 50-84 years, who were followed for a median 3.3 years.The intervention was vitamin D3 (2.5 mg or 100,000 IU) or placebo softgel oral capsules, mailed monthly to participants' homes, with two capsules sent in the first mail-out post-randomisation (i.e. 200,000 IU bolus, or placebo), followed 1 month later (and thereafter monthly) with 100,000 IU vitamin D3 or placebo capsules.Outcomes were monitored through routinely collected health data and self-completed questionnaires.RESULTS: The results showed no beneficial effect of vitamin D supplementation on incidence of cardiovascular disease, falls, non-vertebral fractures and all cancer.However, beneficial effects from vitamin D supplementation were seen: for persistence with taking statins in participants on long-term statin therapy; and also in bone mineral density and arterial function in participants with low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, and in lung function among ever smokers (especially if vitamin D deficient).The latter findings are consistent with several previous studies, CONCLUSION: Monthly high-dose vitamin D supplementation does not prevent a range of diseases, but may be beneficial for some intermediate outcomes in people who are vitamin D deficient.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry identifier: ACTRN12611000402943.",0,0,0,0

31247017,"Effects of laughter therapy on quality of life in patients with cancer: An open-label, randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Few randomized controlled trials have assessed the effects of laughter therapy on health-related quality of life (QOL) in cancer patients.This study aimed to evaluate these effects as an exploratory endpoint in cancer patients as part of a randomized controlled trial conducted at a single institution in Japan.METHODS: The Initiative On Smile And CAncer (iOSACA) study was an open-label randomized controlled trial conducted in 2017 in which participants aged 40-64 years with cancer were randomly assigned to either an intervention group (laughter therapy) or control group (no laughter therapy).Each participant in the intervention group underwent a laughter therapy session once every two weeks for seven weeks (total of four sessions).Each session involved a laughter yoga routine followed by Rakugo or Manzai traditional Japanese verbal comedy performances.We assessed QOL as a secondary endpoint in this intention-to-treat population using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30).The questionnaire was completed at baseline (Week 0) and at Weeks 3 and 7.Mixed-effects models for repeated measures were developed to compare time-dependent changes in each QOL domain from baseline between the intervention and control groups.RESULTS: Four participants retracted consent and one participant was retrospectively excluded from analysis due to unmet inclusion criteria.The analysis was conducted using 56 participants, with 26 in the intervention group and 30 in the control group.Questionnaire completion rates were high (>90%), with similar QOL scores reported at baseline in both groups.The mixed-effects models showed that the intervention group had significantly better cognitive function and less pain than the control group for a short period.CONCLUSION: Laughter therapy may represent a beneficial, noninvasive complementary intervention in the clinical setting.Further studies are needed to verify the hypotheses generated from this exploratory study.",0,0,0,0
31255586,"Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for Symptom Interference in Advanced Lung Cancer and Caregiver Distress: A Pilot Randomized Trial.CONTEXT: Advanced lung cancer patients typically have a poor prognosis and many symptoms that interfere with functioning, contributing to high rates of emotional distress in both patients and family caregivers.There remains a need for evidence-based interventions to improve functional outcomes and distress in this population.OBJECTIVES: This pilot trial examined the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of telephone-based Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) for symptomatic, advanced lung cancer patients and their distressed family caregivers.Primary outcomes were patient symptom interference with functioning and patient and caregiver distress.METHODS: Symptomatic, advanced lung cancer patients and distressed caregivers (n = 50 dyads) were randomly assigned to six sessions of ACT or an education/support condition.Patients completed measures of symptom interference and measures assessing the severity of fatigue, pain, sleep disturbance, and breathlessness.Patients and caregivers completed measures of distress and illness acceptance and struggle.RESULTS: The eligibility screening rate (51%) and retention rate (76% at six weeks postintervention) demonstrated feasibility.No group differences were found with respect to patient and caregiver outcomes.Both groups showed a small, significant decrease in struggle with the illness over the study period, but did not show meaningful change in other outcomes.CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that telephone-based ACT is feasible for many advanced lung cancer patients and caregivers, but may not substantially reduce symptom interference and distress.Low baseline levels of certain symptoms may have contributed to null findings.Next steps include applying ACT to specific, clinically meaningful symptom interference and varying intervention dose and modality.",0,0,0,0
31274231,"Final analysis of a phase I/IIa trial of the folate-binding protein-derived E39 peptide vaccine to prevent recurrence in ovarian and endometrial cancer patients.BACKGROUND: E39, an HLA-A2-restricted, immunogenic peptide derived from the folate-binding protein (FBP), is overexpressed in multiple malignancies.We conducted a phase I/IIa trial of the E39 + GM-CSF vaccine with booster inoculations of either E39 or E39' (an attenuated version of E39) to prevent recurrences in disease-free endometrial and ovarian cancer patients(pts).Here, we present the final 24-month landmark analysis.PATIENTS AND METHODS: HLA-A2 + patients receiving E39 + GM-CSF were included in the vaccine group (VG), and HLA-A2- pts (or HLA-A2 + patients refusing vaccine) were followed as the control group (CG).VG group received 6 monthly inoculations as the primary vaccine series (PVS) and were randomized to receive either E39 or E39' booster inoculations.Demographic, safety, immunologic, and disease-free survival (DFS) data were collected and evaluated.RESULTS: Fifty-one patients were enrolled; 29 in the VG and 22 in the CG.Fourteen patients received <1000 mug and 15 received 1000 mug of E39.There were no clinicopathologic differences between VG and CG or between dose groups.E39 was well tolerated.At the 24 months landmark, DFS was 55.5% (VG) vs 40.0% (CG), P = 0.339.Patients receiving 1000 mug and boosted patients also showed improved DFS (P < 0.03).DFS was improved in the 1000 mug group after treatment of primary disease (90.0% vs CG:42.9%, P = 0.007), but not in recurrent patients.In low-FBP expressing patients, DFS was 100.0% (1000 mug), 50.0% (<1000 mug), and 25.0% (CG), P = 0.029.CONCLUSIONS: This phase I/IIa trial reveals that E39 + GM-CSF is safe and may be effective in preventing recurrence in high-risk ovarian and endometrial cancer when optimally dosed (1000 mug) to FBP low patients being treated for primary disease.",1,1,1,0
31274657,"Clinical Evaluation of Intraoperative Near Misses in Laparoscopic Rectal Cancer Surgery.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the frequency, nature, and severity of intraoperative adverse near miss events within advanced laparoscopic surgery and report any associated clinical impact.BACKGROUND: Despite implementation of surgical safety initiatives, the intraoperative period is poorly documented with evidence of underreporting.Near miss analyses are undertaken in high-risk industries but not in surgical practice.METHODS: Case video and data from 2 laparoscopic total mesorectal excision randomized controlled trials were analyzed (ALaCaRT ACTRN12609000663257, 2D3D ISRCTN59485808).Intraoperative adverse events were identified and categorized using the observational clinical human reliability analysis technique.The EAES classification was applied by 2 blinded assessors.EAES grade 1 events (nonconsequential error, no damage, or need for correction) were considered near misses.Associated clinical impact was assessed with early morbidity and histopathology outcomes.RESULTS: One hundred seventy-five cases contained 1113 error events.Six hundred ninety-eight (62.7%) were near misses (median 3, IQR 2-5, range 0-15) with excellent inter-rater and test-retest reliability (kappa=0.86, 95% CI 0.83-0.89, P < 0.001 and kappa=0.88, 95% CI 0.85-0.9, P < 0.001 respectively).Significantly more near misses were seen in patients who developed early complications (4 (3-6) vs. 3 (2-4), P < 0.001).Higher numbers of near misses were seen in patients with more numerous (P = 0.002) and more serious early complications (P = 0.003).Cases containing major intraoperative adverse events contained significantly more near misses (5 (3-7) vs. 3 (2-5), P < 0.001) with a major event observed for every 19.4 near misses.CONCLUSION: Intraoperative adverse events and near misses can be reliably and objectively captured in advanced laparoscopic surgery.Near misses are commonplace and closely associated with morbidity outcomes.",0,0,0,0

31398258,"Randomized controlled trial on the effect of an online decision aid for young female cancer patients regarding fertility preservation.STUDY QUESTION: Does the use of an online decision aid (DA) about fertility preservation (FP), in addition to standard counselling by a specialist in reproductive medicine, reduce decisional conflict compared to standard counselling alone?SUMMARY ANSWER: Female cancer patients who could make use of the online DA had a significantly lower short-term decisional conflict score.WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Nowadays, female cancer patients have several options for preserving fertility, but having to decide whether to opt for FP within a short time frame after cancer diagnosis and before the start of treatment is challenging.According to previous studies focussing mainly on breast cancer patients, decisional conflict among these women is high, and they have expressed the need for additional support.STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: The study was a randomized controlled trial including female cancer patients who were referred by their treating oncologist to a specialist in reproductive medicine for fertility counselling.Participants were randomly assigned to the control group (counselling only) or to the intervention group (counselling and additional use of the online DA immediately after counselling).Recruitment was ongoing from July 2016 to December 2017 at eight fertility centres in Switzerland and Germany.PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The online DA was developed by an interdisciplinary team of specialists in reproductive medicine, gynaecologists, oncologists and psychologists.Of 79 recruited participants, 59 completed the first assessment and could therefore be enrolled in the study.They were asked to complete an online questionnaire at three time points: at T1, after counselling (control group, n = 27) or after counselling and the additional use of the DA (intervention group, n = 24); at T2, 1 month later (N = 41: control group, n = 23; intervention group, n = 18); and at T3, 12 months later (N = 37: control group, n = 20; intervention group, n = 17).The survey comprised questions about fertility-related knowledge, attitude towards FP, willingness to undergo FP and socio-demographic data, as well as the decisional conflict and decisional regret scales.MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: All participants showed low decisional conflict scores.Women who used the online DA in addition to counselling (intervention group) showed a significantly lower total score on the Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS) compared to the control group at T1 (P = 0.008; M = 12.15, SD = 4.38; 95% CI, 3.35-20.95) and at T2 (P = 0.043; M = 9.35, SD = 4.48; 95% CI, 0.31-18.38).At T3, the mean total score of the DCS was still lower in the intervention group compared to the control group; however, this group difference was no longer significant (P = 0.199, M = 6.86, SD = 5.24; 95% CI, -3.78 to 17.51).The majority of participants had already made a decision regarding FP (yes or no) at T1 (72.5%): 91.7% in the intervention group compared to 55.6% in the control group (P = 0.014).Those who had decided already at T1 showed significantly lower decisional conflict (P = 0.007; M = 13.69, SD = 4.89; 95% CI, 3.86-23.52).The average number of DA sessions per user was 2.23, and 80.8% of the participants completed the DA's value clarification exercises.Participants in the intervention group were satisfied with the DA and would recommend it to other patients.LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The recruitment of participants was challenging because of the emotionally difficult situation patients were in.This led to the limited sample size for final analysis.Education levels were high in two-thirds of the participants.It is difficult to say whether the DA would be equally effective in women with a lower educational background.WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: There is evidence that the DA served as a helpful complement to the decision-making process for young female cancer patients qualifying for FP.This is, to our knowledge, the first randomized controlled trial evaluating a DA targeted at patients with several cancer types and in a language other than English (i.e. German).This study contributes to extending the range of the still limited number of DAs in the context of FP.STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): The study was supported by a research grant of the Swiss Cancer Research.The authors declare that no competing interests exist.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: Clinicaltrials.gov, trial no.

Sixteen patients (12%) had high serum levels of Hsp27 at baseline.In this small group, patients who received apatorsen had median PFS of 10.8 months, and those who received placebo had median PFS 4.8 months.CONCLUSION: The addition of apatorsen to carboplatin and pemetrexed was well tolerated but did not improve outcomes in patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC cancer in the first-line setting.IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This randomized, double-blinded, phase II trial evaluated the efficacy of carboplatin and pemetrexed plus either apatorsen, an antisense oligonucleotide targeting heat shock protein 27 mRNA, or placebo in patients with previously untreated metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).The addition of apatorsen to carboplatin and pemetrexed was well tolerated but did not improve outcomes in patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC cancer in the first-line setting.",1,1,1,0
31444669,"Low-Frequency Sonophoresis of Chinese Medicine Formula Improves Efficacy of Malignant Pleural Effusion Treatment.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether low-frequency ultrasound-facilitated transdermal delivery of a Chinese medicine (CM) formula could improve the efficacy of intrapleural administration of interleukin-2 (IL-2) in treatment of malignant pleural effusion (MPE).METHODS: A total of 110 eligible participants were randomized into the low-frequency sonophoresis (LFS) of CM (LSF/CM) group (55 cases) and the control group (55 cases) by simple randomization using a random number table.The control group was treated with an intrapleural administration of IL-2; and the LFS/CM group was treated with LFS of a CM gel formulation, combined with the same IL-2 injection as in the control group.The CM formula consisted of Semen Lepidii, Semen Sinapis, Ramulus Cinnamomi, Poriacocos, Herba Lycopi, and Radix Paeoniae Rubra.After 2-week treatment, the therapeutic outcome was determined by the change of the amount of MPE, which was evaluated by B-scan ultrasound and/or chest X-ray, and the change of quality of life (QOL) scores, which were evaluated by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status.RESULTS: A significantly higher objective remission rate (ORR) was obtained with intrapleural IL-2 plus LFS/CM than IL-2 treatment alone (P=0.049).In addition, more patients in the LFS/CM group than in the control group had an improved QOL score (P=0.048), and no patients in the LFS/CM group had a reduced QOL.CONCLUSION: LFS of CM formulation could effectively alleviate MPE and improve the QOL of cancer patients.",0,0,0,0
31468214,"Assessment of DIEP Flap Perfusion with Intraoperative Indocyanine Green Fluorescence Imaging in Vasopressor-Dominated Hemodynamic Support Versus Liberal Fluid Administration: A Randomized Controlled Trial With Breast Cancer Patients.BACKGROUND: Dogmatic denial of vasopressor agents for blood pressure regulation during free-flap surgery is associated with concomitant large-volume intraoperative fluid administration.Yet, the doctrinal banning of vasopressors during microvascular breast reconstruction still is a subject of controversy.Several retrospective observations have recently drawn attention to serious iatrogenic consequences of intravenous crystalloid overload in microsurgery such as thrombus formation and increased flap failure rates.METHODS: This prospective randomized controlled trial investigated the potential effects of fluid-restrictive vasopressor-dominated hemodynamic support (FRV) compared with vasopressor-restrictive liberal fluid administration (LFA) on clinically relevant perfusion of the deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap via intraoperative indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging.The primary end point of the study was quantitative assessment of the percentage of insufficiently perfused tissue (NP) on the overall flap.Major complications were assessed as secondary end points.RESULTS: In 44 DIEP flap breast reconstructions after mastectomy, FRV circulatory support resulted in no statistically significant difference in total flap perfusion as detected via ICG fluorescence imaging in direct comparison with a traditional LFA strategy (NPFRV, 31.8% +/- 12.2% vs NPLFA, 29.5% +/- 13.3%; p = 0.559).One flap failure was registered with LFA, whereas no major complication occurred in the FRV cohort.CONCLUSIONS: According to the results of this study, neither a norepinephrine concentration of 0.065 +/- 0.020 mug/kg/min (FRV) nor fluid administration of 5.1 +/- 2.2 ml/kg/h (LFA) has a clinically significant impact on microperfusion in a standard DIEP flap procedure for breast reconstruction.Consistent with the current literature reporting a rise in complications with intraoperative fluid over-resuscitation, one flap failure occurred in the LFA cohort.",0,0,0,0
31473189,"Accrual of older adults to cancer clinical trials led by the Canadian cancer trials group - Is trial design a barrier?BACKGROUND: Older adults (OA), aged 65years and over, are under-represented in studies.Strict exclusion criteria have been identified as a potential barrier to accrual of OA.This study aims to determine: 1) whether accrual of OA to trials led by the Canadian Cancer Trials Group (CCTG) has increased since 2003; 2) whether exclusion criteria have broadened over time; 3) whether exclusion criteria are associated with lower accrual of OA.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Phase III and randomized phase II CCTG-led trials initiated from 1990 onwards were included.Trial protocols were reviewed for exclusion criteria.Associations between trial characteristics and percentage of OA accrued were compared using multivariate linear regression modelling.The frequency of exclusion criteria in trials initiated pre- and post-2003 was compared using the Chi-Square test or Fisher exact test.RESULTS: Sixty-nine trials involving 34,957 patients were included.Accrual of OA to trials remained low compared to OA diagnosed with cancer in Canada (40.8% vs. 56.1%, p<.001).There was a small increase in the accrual of OA since 2003 (42.8% vs. 39.3%, p=.04).There was no relaxation of exclusion criteria over time.Studies initiated prior to 2003, breast cancer studies and studies with exclusion criteria based on renal dysfunction were associated with lower accrual of OA (p<.05).Central nervous system studies were associated with higher accrual of OA (p=.03).CONCLUSION: OA remain under-represented in trials.While there has been minimal change in exclusion criteria over time, renal dysfunction was the only exclusion criteria associated with lower accrual of OA.",0,0,0,0

31501084,"Regression Discontinuity Analysis of Salvage Radiotherapy in Prostate Cancer.There is a lack of randomized evidence comparing early (eSRT) to late (lSRT) salvage radiotherapy (SRT) after radical prostatectomy (RP) for prostate cancer (PCa).Moreover, the existing evidence is often affected by lead-time bias.We sought to address this gap in a cohort of 1458 PCa patients undergoing SRT for biochemical recurrence (BCR) after RP in two tertiary care centers between 1992 and 2013.Using a quasi-randomized study design known as regression discontinuity (RD) and adjusting for lead-time bias, we compared metastasis-free survival (MFS) at 5 and 10years after surgery between eSRT (prostate-specific antigen [PSA] <0.5ng/ml) and lSRT (PSA>/=0.5ng/ml).Overall, 1049 patients (71.9%) underwent eSRT and 409 (28.1%) lSRT at a mean follow-up of 84 mo (interquartile range (IQR) 52-120.4).The MFS rate decreased nonsignificantly at the proposed cutoff by 0.04 (95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.06 to 0.19) at 5years and by 0.07 (95% CI:-0.12 to 0.32) at 10years.Cox regression analysis revealed a hazard ratio for the cutoff examined of 1.3 (95% CI: 0.8-2.4; p=0.2).In conclusion, in a quasirandomized study design accounting for lead-time bias, eSRT (PSA<0.5ng/ml) did not improve MFS.Our results underline the need for level-one evidence to compare eSRT and lSRT.PATIENT SUMMARY: We compared early versus late salvage radiotherapy (SRT) for biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy by simulating a randomized trial.We found that early SRT (initiated at prostate-specific antigen <0.5ng/ml) compared to late SRT did not improve metastasis-free survival.",0,0,0,0

31518715,"Absence of Iodine Staining Associates With Progression of Esophageal Lesions in a Prospective Endoscopic Surveillance Study in China.BACKGROUND & AIMS: Chromoendoscopy with iodine staining is used to identify esophageal squamous dysplasia and esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCCs)-absence of staining indicates suspicious regions of dysplasia.However, screening detects precancerous lesions (mild and moderate dysplasia) that do not require immediate treatment; it is a challenge to which lesions are at risk for progression.We investigated the association between absence of iodine staining at chromoendoscopy screening and lesion progression using 6 years of follow-up data from a population-based randomized controlled trial in China.We then constructed and validated a model to calculate risk of progression to severe dysplasia, carcinoma in situ, or ESCC.METHODS: We collected data from 1468 participants (45-69 years old) who were either negative for iodine staining at a baseline chromoendoscopy or found to have mild or moderate dysplasia in histologic analysis of biopsies in the Endoscopic Screening for Esophageal Cancer study in China, from January 2012 through September 2016; 788 of these participants were re-examined by endoscopy after a median interval of 4.2 years (development cohort).We investigated the association between absence of iodine staining and progression of esophageal lesions using Cox prediction models, considering corresponding baseline pathology findings and patient answers to a comprehensive questionnaire.Patients who did not receive a follow-up examination (n = 680) was used as the validation cohort; outcome events in these patients were identified by annual door to door active interviews or linkage with local electronic registry data.The primary outcome was incident esophageal severe dysplasia, carcinoma in situ, or ESCC.RESULTS: In the development cohort, 11 lesions that did not stain with iodine but were classified as not dysplastic in the histology analysis were found to be severe dysplasia, carcinoma in situ, or ESCC at the follow-up evaluation.These lesions accounted for 39.3% of all progressed lesions (n = 28).In the validation cohort, 6 patients with lesions did not stain with iodine but were classified as not dysplastic by histology had a later diagnosis of ESCC, determined from medical records; these patients accounted for 50.0% of all patients with lesion progression (n = 12) until the closing date of this study.We developed a model based on patient age, body mass index, pathology findings, and baseline iodine staining to calculate risk for severe dysplasia, carcinoma in situ, or ESCC.It identified patients for severe dysplasia, carcinoma in situ, or ESCC in the development set with an area under the curve of 0.868 (95% CI, 0.817-0.920) and in the validation set with an area under the curve of 0.850 (95% CI, 0.748-0.952).Almost no cases would be missed if subjects determined to be high or intermediate-high risk subjects by the model were included in surveillance.CONCLUSIONS: Absence of iodine staining at baseline chromoendoscopy identifies esophageal lesions at risk of progression with a high level of sensitivity.A model that combines results of iodine chromoendoscopy with other patient features identifies patients at risk of lesion progression with greater accuracy than histologic analysis of baseline biopsies.",0,0,0,0

31526892,"Impact of choice of volumetry software and nodule management guidelines on recall rates in lung cancer screening.PURPOSE: Appropriate lung nodule management is essential to minimizing unnecessary patient recall in lung cancer screening.Two European guidelines provide differing recommendations in that participants with nodules >/=100 mm(3) or >/=80 mm(3) respectively should be recalled, at baseline.Nodule size estimation is known to vary between volumetry software packages (VSPs).The aim of this study was to examine the impact of choice of VSP on participant recall rates, when applying different European nodule management guidelines.An additional aim was to compare recall rates between 7 VSPs and manual diameter measurements.METHODS: 156 small-sized lung nodules (50-150 mm(3)) from the UK Lung Screening trial were measured using 7 different VSPs (VSP1-7) and also using manual diameter.The type of VSP used in the NELSON study (VSP1), on which European nodule management guidelines are based, provided the reference standard.Nodule size was compared using Bland Altman, and recall rates by Mcnemar's test.RESULTS: Compared to the reference standard, a 100 mm(3) threshold for recall, resulted in no difference in recall rates only for VSP 5 & 7.Using an 80mm(3) threshold resulted in no difference in recall rates for VSP2 & 6.Recall rates were significantly higher for VSP 4 regardless of threshold and when using manual diameter measurements.CONCLUSIONS: Appropriate nodule size thresholds for recall in screening depend on the type of volumetry software used.The results highlight the importance of benchmarking of volumetry packages.",0,0,0,0
31537473,"Radiation-induced cystitis treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy (RICH-ART): a randomised, controlled, phase 2-3 trial.BACKGROUND: Late radiation cystitis is an adverse effect of cancer treatment with radiotherapy in the pelvic region.Symptoms of late radiation cystitis can be assessed with the Expanded Prostate Index Composite Score (EPIC).Previous reports indicate that hyperbaric oxygen therapy reduces symptoms from late radiation cystitis, but the evidence is predominantly based on non-randomised and retrospective studies.We aimed to assess whether hyperbaric oxygen therapy would mitigate symptoms of late radiation cystitis.METHODS: We did a randomised, controlled, phase 2-3 trial (RICH-ART [Radiation Induced Cystitis treated with Hyperbaric oxygen-A Randomised controlled Trial]) at five Nordic university hospitals.All patients aged 18-80 years, with pelvic radiotherapy completed at least 6 months previously, a score of less than 80 in the urinary domain of the Expanded Prostate Index Composite Score (EPIC), and referred to participating hyperbaric clinics due to symptoms of late radiation cystitis, were eligible for inclusion.Exclusion criteria were ongoing bleeding requiring blood transfusion exceeding 500 mL in the past 4 weeks, permanent urinary catheter, bladder capacity less than 100 mL, fistula in the urinary bladder, previous treatment with hyperbaric oxygen therapy for late radiation injuries, and contraindications to hyperbaric oxygen therapy.After computer-generated 1:1 randomisation with block sizes of four for each stratification group (sex, time from radiotherapy to inclusion, and previous invasive surgery in the pelvic area), patients received hyperbaric oxygen therapy (30-40 sessions, 100% oxygen, breathed at a pressure of 240-250 kPa, for 80-90 min daily) or standard care with no restrictions for other medications or interventions.No masking was applied.The primary outcome was change in patient-perceived urinary symptoms assessed with EPIC from inclusion to follow-up at visit 4 (6-8 months later), measured as absolute change in EPIC urinary total score.RICH-ART closed enrolment on Dec 31, 2017; the last follow-up data will be compiled in 2023.RICH-ART is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01659723, and with the European Medicines Agency, number EudraCT 2012-001381-15.FINDINGS: Of 223 patients screened between May 9, 2012, and Dec 20, 2017, 87 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to either hyperbaric oxygen therapy (n=42) or standard care (n=45).After excluding eight patients who withdrew consent directly after randomisation (one in the hyperbaric oxygen therapy group and seven in the standard care group), 79 were included in the intention-to-treat analyses (n=41 in the hyperbaric oxygen therapy group, n=38 in the standard care group).Median time from randomisation to visit 4 was 234 days (IQR 210-262) in the hyperbaric oxygen therapy group and 217 days (195-237) in the standard care group.The difference between change in group mean of EPIC urinary total score at visit 4 was 10.1 points (95% CI 2.2-18.1; p=0.013; 17.8 points [SD 18.4] in the hyperbaric oxygen therapy group vs 7.7 points [15.5] in the standard care group).17 (41%) of 41 patients in the hyperbaric oxygen therapy group experienced transient grade 1-2 adverse events, related to sight and hearing, during the period of hyperbaric oxygen therapy.INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that hyperbaric oxygen therapy relieves symptoms of late radiation cystitis.We conclude that hyperbaric oxygen therapy is a safe and well tolerated treatment.FUNDING: The regional research fund of Region Vastra Gotaland, Sweden, the regional Health Technology Assessment Centre at Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Sweden, and Lions Cancer Research Fund of Western Sweden.",0,0,0,0

31558480,"Randomized Phase II Trial and Tumor Mutational Spectrum Analysis from Cabozantinib versus Chemotherapy in Metastatic Uveal Melanoma (Alliance A091201).PURPOSE: The surface receptor MET is highly expressed on primary uveal melanoma; MET inhibitors demonstrated early clinical signals of efficacy in slowing uveal melanoma growth.The primary objective of our study was to compare the progression-free survival rate at 4 months (PFS4) of patients with uveal melanoma treated with cabozantinib or chemotherapy.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with metastatic uveal melanoma and RECIST measurable disease were randomized 2:1 to receive either cabozantinib (arm 1) versus temozolomide or dacarbazine (arm 2) with restaging imaging every two cycles.Cross-over from arm 2 to cabozantinib after progression was allowed (arm 2X).Available tumor specimens were analyzed by whole-exome sequencing (WES) and results were correlated with outcome.RESULTS: Forty-six eligible patients were accrued with 31, 15, and 9 in arms 1, 2, and 2X, respectively.Median lines of prior therapy, including hepatic embolization, were two.Rates of PFS4 in arm 1 and arm 2 were 32.3% and 26.7% (P = 0.35), respectively, with median PFS time of 60 and 59 days (P = 0.964; HR = 0.99).Median overall survival (OS) was 6.4 months and 7.3 months (P = 0.580; HR = 1.21), respectively.Grade 3-4 Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events were present in 61.3%, 46.7%, and 37.5% in arms 1, 2, and 2X, respectively.WES demonstrated a mean tumor mutational burden of 1.53 mutations/Mb and did not separate OS </= or >1 year (P = 0.14).Known mutations were identified by WES and novel mutations were nominated.CONCLUSIONS: MET/VEGFR blockade with cabozantinib demonstrated no improvement in PFS but an increase in toxicity relative to temozolomide/dacarbazine in metastatic uveal melanoma.",1,1,1,1
31560068,"Addition of docetaxel to hormonal therapy in low- and high-burden metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer: long-term survival results from the STAMPEDE trial.BACKGROUND: STAMPEDE has previously reported that the use of upfront docetaxel improved overall survival (OS) for metastatic hormone naive prostate cancer patients starting long-term androgen deprivation therapy.We report on long-term outcomes stratified by metastatic burden for M1 patients.METHODS: We randomly allocated patients in 2 : 1 ratio to standard-of-care (SOC; control group) or SOC + docetaxel.Metastatic disease burden was categorised using retrospectively-collected baseline staging scans where available.Analysis used Cox regression models, adjusted for stratification factors, with emphasis on restricted mean survival time where hazards were non-proportional.RESULTS: Between 05 October 2005 and 31 March 2013, 1086 M1 patients were randomised to receive SOC (n = 724) or SOC + docetaxel (n = 362).Metastatic burden was assessable for 830/1086 (76%) patients; 362 (44%) had low and 468 (56%) high metastatic burden.Median follow-up was 78.2 months.There were 494 deaths on SOC (41% more than the previous report).There was good evidence of benefit of docetaxel over SOC on OS (HR = 0.81, 95% CI 0.69-0.95, P = 0.009) with no evidence of heterogeneity of docetaxel effect between metastatic burden sub-groups (interaction P = 0.827).Analysis of other outcomes found evidence of benefit for docetaxel over SOC in failure-free survival (HR = 0.66, 95% CI 0.57-0.76, P < 0.001) and progression-free survival (HR = 0.69, 95% CI 0.59-0.81, P < 0.001) with no evidence of heterogeneity of docetaxel effect between metastatic burden sub-groups (interaction P > 0.5 in each case).There was no evidence that docetaxel resulted in late toxicity compared with SOC: after 1 year, G3-5 toxicity was reported for 28% SOC and 27% docetaxel (in patients still on follow-up at 1 year without prior progression).CONCLUSIONS: The clinically significant benefit in survival for upfront docetaxel persists at longer follow-up, with no evidence that benefit differed by metastatic burden.We advocate that upfront docetaxel is considered for metastatic hormone naive prostate cancer patients regardless of metastatic burden.",1,1,1,0

31601493,"Analysis of the relapse patterns and risk factors of endometrial cancer following postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy in a phase III randomized clinical trial.OBJECTIVE: This study was to analyze patterns and risk factors of relapse after postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy for endometrial cancer.METHODS: Among patients enrolled in a randomized phase III trial (JGOG2043) investigating the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy for endometrial cancer at a high risk of progression, the recurrent patients were studied.Clinical information were collected, and correlation between relapse-related factors and clinicopathological factors were analyzed.RESULTS: Among 193 patients analyzed, 50% had local relapse and 63% had distant relapse.Local relapse involved regional lymph nodes in 30%, while distant relapse involved the abdominal cavity in 42%.Imaging was used to confirm relapse in 83%, and the median disease-free interval (DFI) was 11.5 months.Factors showing a significant correlation with DFI </=12 months were residual tumor at surgery (p < 0.01), Grade 3 histology (p < 0.01), and lymph node metastasis (p = 0.03).In contrast, treatment with paclitaxel and carboplatin showed a significant correlation with DFI >12 months (p = 0.04).The median post-relapse overall survival (RS) was 23.9 months.In multivariate analysis, CA125 >/= 100 U/mL prior to relapse (p < 0.01), distant metastasis (p < 0.01), DFI </= 12 months (p = 0.02), and not performing para-aortic lymphadenectomy (p = 0.01) were independently related to poor RS.CONCLUSIONS: Relapse of endometrial cancer following adjuvant chemotherapy often occurs by 1 year after treatment, with common relapse sites of the abdominal cavity and regional lymph nodes.Among treatment-related factors, RS was correlated with DFI and para-aortic lymphadenectomy.",0,0,0,0
31606897,"Extending venous thromboembolism secondary prevention with apixaban in cancer patients: The EVE trial.BACKGROUND: Cancer-associated venous thromboembolism (VTE) carries a high rate of recurrence and death.Guidelines recommend continued anticoagulation therapy as long as active cancer persists.Apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily is the FDA-approved dose for secondary prevention regardless of VTE causation.Whether this apixaban dose is appropriate for secondary VTE prevention in cancer patients is not clear.The rationale and design of this investigator initiated phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, trial assessing apixaban 2.5 mg vs 5 mg twice daily for 12 months for the secondary VTE prevention in cancer patients (n = 370) who have completed 6 months (but no more than 12 months) of anticoagulation is provided (NCT03080883).METHODS/DESIGN: The primary study objective is to estimate differences in the combined rate of major plus clinically relevant non-major bleeding for apixaban 2.5 mg vs 5 mg twice daily.Secondary efficacy outcome is to assess rates of venous or arterial thromboembolism.Participating centers are chosen from the Academic and Community Cancer Research United (ACCRU) consortium.CONCLUSION: We anticipate these trial results to provide evidence supporting low-dose apixaban as a safe agent for secondary prevention of cancer-associated VTE for patients who have already completed 6-12 months of anticoagulation.",0,0,0,0
31628954,"Underwater versus conventional endoscopic resection of nondiminutive nonpedunculated colorectal lesions: a prospective randomized controlled trial (with video).BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Incomplete resection of colorectal neoplasia decreases the efficacy of colonoscopy.Conventional resection (CR) of polyps, performed in a gas-distended colon, is the current standard, but incomplete resection rates of approximately 2% to 30% for nondiminutive (>5 mm), nonpedunculated lesions are reported.Underwater resection (UR) is a novel technique.The aim of this study was to determine the incomplete resection rates of colorectal lesions removed by UR versus CR.METHODS: In a randomized controlled trial, patients with small (6-9 mm) and large (>/=10 mm) nonpedunculated lesions were assigned to CR (gas-distended lumen) or UR (water-filled, gas-excluded lumen).Small lesions in both arms were removed with a dedicated cold snare.For CR, large lesions were removed with a hot snare after submucosal injection.For UR, large lesions were removed with a hot snare without submucosal injection.Four-quadrant biopsy samples around the resection sites were used to evaluate for incomplete resection.RESULTS: Four hundred sixty-two eligible polyps (248 UR vs 214 CR) from 255 patients were removed.Incomplete resection rates for UR and CR were low and did not differ (2% vs 1.9%, P = .91).UR was performed significantly faster for lesions >/=10mm in size (10-19 mm, 2.9 minutes vs 5.6 minutes, P < .0001); >/=20 mm, 7.3 minutes vs 9.5 minutes, P = .015).CONCLUSIONS: Low incomplete resection rates are achievable with UR and CR.UR is effective and safe with the advantage of faster resection and potential cost savings for removal of larger (>/=10 mm) lesions by avoiding submucosal injection.As an added approach, UR has potential to improve the cost-effectiveness of colonoscopy by increasing efficiency and reducing cost while maintaining quality.(Clinical trial registration number: NCT02889679.).",0,0,0,0

31792878,"Oral morphine drops for prompt relief of breathlessness in patients with advanced cancer-a randomized, double blinded, crossover trial of morphine sulfate oral drops vs. morphine hydrochloride drops with ethanol (red morphine drops).PURPOSE: Episodic breathlessness is frequent in palliative cancer patients.Opioids are the only pharmacological agents with sufficient evidence in treatment.In Denmark, the main recommendation is red morphine drops (RMD), an off-label solution of morphine, ethanol, and red color (cochenille) described since 1893 (Pharmacopoea Danica).In 2015, the Danish Medicines Agency increased focus on off-label medicines and recommended registered morphine drops without ethanol instead.However, our palliative patients told us that RMD was better.For that reason, we conducted a clinical trial to clarify any perceived difference between the two types of drops.METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double blinded, crossover trial.Patients were asked to perform standardized activity (2-min walk) aiming to provoke breathlessness.Primary endpoint (breathlessness NRS) and secondary endpoints (saturation, pulse, respiratory frequency) were measured before (t = 0) and after test medicine at t = 1, t = 3, t = 5, t = 10, and t = 20 min.After 2-4 days (washout period), the patients repeated the test, receiving the alternative drops in a blinded setup (crossover).RESULTS: In the first 3 min, the relative drop in breathlessness for morphine drops with ethanol (RMD) was significant more than for morphine drops without ethanol.We found no significant difference in secondary endpoints.CONCLUSIONS: A conclusion could be that ethanol might facilitate morphine absorption in the mouth.Our results needs further research of opioid absorption in the mouth as well as trials, testing morphine vs. more lipophilic opioids.The RMD drops are cheap, easy to use, and noninvasive and keep the patient independent of health care professionals.",0,0,0,0
31808538,"Serratus plane block for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery major lung resection: a randomized controlled trial.OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of 2 different analgesic approaches on pain, postoperative rehabilitation exercises and rescue analgesics of 2 groups of patients undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) major lung resection for cancer.METHODS: A total of 94 patients undergoing a VATS major lung resection were randomly allocated to 2 groups: the control group received intravenous and oral (i.e. systemic) analgesics while the intervention group received systemic analgesics plus pre-emptive serratus plane block.Pain perception was recorded until drainage removal or until 2 p.m. of postoperative day (POD) 3.In particular, the primary end point was defined as the peak pain perception on POD 1 (in the time frame between 6 a.m. and 2 p.m.).Secondary end points were the number of forced inspiration manoeuvers during rehabilitative incentive spirometry on POD 1 and 2 and the overall number of rescue analgesics requested by patients.RESULTS: Serratus plane block provided a better pain control between 6 a.m. and 2 p.m. of POD 1 (Numeric Rating Scale 1.7 vs 3.5; P < 0.001).Patients in the intervention group performed more forced inspiration manoeuvers at a mean higher volume during incentive spirometry (8.9 vs 7, P < 0.001, and 1010 vs 865 ml, P = 0.02).They required fewer rescue doses of analgesics (0.57 vs 1.1; P = 0.008).CONCLUSIONS: Serratus plane block provided a better pain control, entailing a better performance during postoperative rehabilitation exercises in terms of duration and quality of incentive spirometry.It diminished the patient's need for rescue analgesics during the early postoperative period.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT03134729.",0,0,0,0
31808921,"Effect of True and Sham Acupuncture on Radiation-Induced Xerostomia Among Patients With Head and Neck Cancer: A Randomized Clinical Trial.Importance: Radiation-induced xerostomia (RIX) is a common, often debilitating, adverse effect of radiation therapy among patients with head and neck cancer.Quality of life can be severely affected, and current treatments have limited benefit.Objective: To determine if acupuncture can prevent RIX in patients with head and neck cancer undergoing radiation therapy.Design, Setting, and Participants: This 2-center, phase 3, randomized clinical trial compared a standard care control (SCC) with true acupuncture (TA) and sham acupuncture (SA) among patients with oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal carcinoma who were undergoing radiation therapy in comprehensive cancer centers in the United States and China.Patients were enrolled between December 16, 2011, and July 7, 2015.Final follow-up was August 15, 2016.Analyses were conducted February 1 through 28, 2019.Intervention: Either TA or SA using a validated acupuncture placebo device was performed 3 times per week during a 6- to 7-week course of radiation therapy.Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was RIX, as determined by the Xerostomia Questionnaire in which a higher score indicates worse RIX, for combined institutions 1 year after radiation therapy ended.Secondary outcomes included incidence of clinically significant xerostomia (score >30), salivary flow, quality of life, salivary constituents, and role of baseline expectancy related to acupuncture on outcomes.Results: Of 399 patients randomized, 339 were included in the final analysis (mean [SD] age, 51.3 [11.7] years; age range, 21-79 years; 258 [77.6%] men), including 112 patients in the TA group, 115 patients in the SA group, and 112 patients in the SCC group.For the primary aim, the adjusted least square mean (SD) xerostomia score in the TA group (26.6 [17.7]) was significantly lower than in the SCC group (34.8 [18.7]) (P = .001; effect size = -0.44) and marginally lower but not statistically significant different from the SA group (31.3 [18.6]) (P = .06; effect size = -0.26).Incidence of clinically significant xerostomia 1 year after radiation therapy ended followed a similar pattern, with 38 patients in the TA group (34.6%), 54 patients in the SA group (47.8%), and 60 patients in the SCC group (55.1%) experiencing clinically significant xerostomia (P = .009).Post hoc comparisons revealed a significant difference between the TA and SCC groups at both institutions, but TA was significantly different from SA only at Fudan University Cancer Center, Shanghai, China (estimated difference [SE]: TA vs SCC, -9.9 [2.5]; P < .001; SA vs SCC, -1.7 [2.5]; P = .50; TA vs SA, -8.2 [2.5]; P = .001), and SA was significantly different from SCC only at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas (estimated difference [SE]: TA vs SCC, -8.1 [3.4]; P = .016; SA vs SCC, -10.5 [3.3]; P = .002; TA vs SA, 2.4 [3.2]; P = .45).Conclusions and Relevance: This randomized clinical trial found that TA resulted in significantly fewer and less severe RIX symptoms 1 year after treatment vs SCC.However, further studies are needed to confirm clinical relevance and generalizability of this finding and to evaluate inconsistencies in response to sham acupuncture between patients in the United States and China.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01266044.",0,0,0,0

31813636,"Long-term primary results of accelerated partial breast irradiation after breast-conserving surgery for early-stage breast cancer: a randomised, phase 3, equivalence trial.BACKGROUND: Whole-breast irradiation after breast-conserving surgery for patients with early-stage breast cancer decreases ipsilateral breast-tumour recurrence (IBTR), yielding comparable results to mastectomy.It is unknown whether accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) to only the tumour-bearing quadrant, which shortens treatment duration, is equally effective.In our trial, we investigated whether APBI provides equivalent local tumour control after lumpectomy compared with whole-breast irradiation.METHODS: We did this randomised, phase 3, equivalence trial (NSABP B-39/RTOG 0413) in 154 clinical centres in the USA, Canada, Ireland, and Israel.Adult women (>18 years) with early-stage (0, I, or II; no evidence of distant metastases, but up to three axillary nodes could be positive) breast cancer (tumour size </=3 cm; including all histologies and multifocal breast cancers), who had had lumpectomy with negative (ie, no detectable cancer cells) surgical margins, were randomly assigned (1:1) using a biased-coin-based minimisation algorithm to receive either whole-breast irradiation (whole-breast irradiation group) or APBI (APBI group).Whole-breast irradiation was delivered in 25 daily fractions of 50 Gy over 5 weeks, with or without a supplemental boost to the tumour bed, and APBI was delivered as 34 Gy of brachytherapy or 38.5 Gy of external bream radiation therapy in 10 fractions, over 5 treatment days within an 8-day period.Randomisation was stratified by disease stage, menopausal status, hormone-receptor status, and intention to receive chemotherapy.Patients, investigators, and statisticians could not be masked to treatment allocation.The primary outcome of invasive and non-invasive IBTR as a first recurrence was analysed in the intention-to-treat population, excluding those patients who were lost to follow-up, with an equivalency test on the basis of a 50% margin increase in the hazard ratio (90% CI for the observed HR between 0.667 and 1.5 for equivalence) and a Cox proportional hazard model.Survival was assessed by intention to treat, and sensitivity analyses were done in the per-protocol population.This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00103181.FINDINGS: Between March 21, 2005, and April 16, 2013, 4216 women were enrolled.2109 were assigned to the whole-breast irradiation group and 2107 were assigned to the APBI group.70 patients from the whole-breast irradiation group and 14 from the APBI group withdrew consent or were lost to follow-up at this stage, so 2039 and 2093 patients respectively were available for survival analysis.Further, three and four patients respectively were lost to clinical follow-up (ie, survival status was assessed by phone but no physical examination was done), leaving 2036 patients in the whole-breast irradiation group and 2089 in the APBI group evaluable for the primary outcome.At a median follow-up of 10.2 years (IQR 7.5-11.5), 90 (4%) of 2089 women eligible for the primary outcome in the APBI group and 71 (3%) of 2036 women in the whole-breast irradiation group had an IBTR (HR 1.22, 90% CI 0.94-1.58).The 10-year cumulative incidence of IBTR was 4.6% (95% CI 3.7-5.7) in the APBI group versus 3.9% (3.1-5.0) in the whole-breast irradiation group.44 (2%) of 2039 patients in the whole-breast irradiation group and 49 (2%) of 2093 patients in the APBI group died from recurring breast cancer.There were no treatment-related deaths.Second cancers and treatment-related toxicities were similar between the two groups.2020 patients in the whole-breast irradiation group and 2089 in APBI group had available data on adverse events.The highest toxicity grade reported was: grade 1 in 845 (40%), grade 2 in 921 (44%), and grade 3 in 201 (10%) patients in the APBI group, compared with grade 1 in 626 (31%), grade 2 in 1193 (59%), and grade 3 in 143 (7%) in the whole-breast irradiation group.INTERPRETATION: APBI did not meet the criteria for equivalence to whole-breast irradiation in controlling IBTR for breast-conserving therapy.Our trial had broad eligibility criteria, leading to a large, heterogeneous pool of patients and sufficient power to detect treatment equivalence, but was not designed to test equivalence in patient subgroups or outcomes from different APBI techniques.For patients with early-stage breast cancer, our findings support whole-breast irradiation following lumpectomy; however, with an absolute difference of less than 1% in the 10-year cumulative incidence of IBTR, APBI might be an acceptable alternative for some women.FUNDING: National Cancer Institute, US Department of Health and Human Services.",0,0,0,0

31958417,"Addition of anti-thymocyte globulin to standard graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis versus standard treatment alone in patients with haematological malignancies undergoing transplantation from unrelated donors: final analysis of a randomised, open-label, multicentre, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Previous trials testing prevention strategies for chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD) have measured its cumulative incidence.In this trial of anti-thymocyte globulin, we measured treatment-independence at a long-term timepoint as the primary endpoint.METHODS: This was a randomised, open-label, multicentre, phase 3 trial done at ten centres in Canada and one in Australia.Eligible patients had a haematological malignancy (leukaemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, or lymphoma), were between 16 and 70 years of age, eligible for transplantation with a Karnofsky score of at least 60, and received an unrelated donor (fully matched or one-locus mismatched at HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, or DRB1 loci) graft following myeloablative or non-myeloablative-reduced intensity conditioning.Patients were randomly assigned to receive anti-thymocyte globulin 4.5 mg/kg plus standard GVHD prophylaxis (cyclosporine or tacrolimus plus methotrexate or mycophenolate) or standard GVHD prophylaxis alone.The primary endpoint, freedom from immunosuppressive therapy without resumption at 12 months, was previously reported.Here we report on the prespecified 24-month analysis.Analyses were per-protocol, excluding those patients who did not proceed to transplantation.This trial is registered as ISRCTN 29899028 and NCT01217723, status completed.FINDINGS: Between June 9, 2010, and July 8, 2013, we recruited and randomly assigned 203 eligible patients to receive anti-thymocyte globulin (n=101) or no additional treatment (n=102) along with standard GVHD prophylaxis.7 (3%) patients did not receive a transplant and were excluded from the analysis.38 (38%) of 99 evaluable patients in the anti-thymocyte globulin plus GVHD prophylaxis group were free from immunosuppressive therapy at 24 months compared with 18 (19%) of 97 patients in the standard GVHD prophylaxis group (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 3.49 [95% CI 1.60-7.60]; p=0.0016).At 24 months, the cumulative incidence of relapse was 16.3% (95% CI 8.9-23.7) in the anti-thymocyte globulin plus GVHD prophylaxis group compared with 17.5 (9.9-25.1) in the standard GVHD prophylaxis group (p=0.73) and non-relapse mortality was 21.2% (95% CI 13.2-29.2) versus 31.3% (21.9-40.7; p=0.15).The cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD at 24 months was 26.3% (95% CI 17.5-35.1) in the anti-thymocyte globulin group and 41.3% (31.3-51.3) in the standard GVHD prophylaxis group (p=0.032).Overall survival at 24 months was 70.6% (95% CI 60.6-78.6) in the anti-thymocyte globulin plus GVHD prophylaxis group compared with 53.3% (42.8-62.8) in the standard GVHD prophylaxis group (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.56, 95% CI [0.35-0.90]; p=0.017).Symptoms of chronic GVHD by the Lee Scale were more prevalent in the standard GVHD prophylaxis group, with scores of 13.27 (SD 10.94) in the anti-thymocyte globulin plus GVHD prophylaxis group and 20.38 (SD 14.68) in the standard GVHD prophylaxis group (p=0.040).Depressive symptoms were more prominent in the standard GVHD prophylaxis group, the mean Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale (CES-D) scores were 10.40 (SD 9.88) in the anti-thymocyte globulin group and 14.62 (SD 12.26) in the standard GVHD prophylaxis group (p=0.034).Serious adverse events (CTCAE grade 4 or 5) occurred in 38 (38%) patients in the anti-thymocyte globulin group and in 49 (51%) in the standard GVHD prophylaxis group, the most common being infection and GVHD.One patient in the anti-thymocyte globulin plus GVHD prophylaxis group died of Epstein-Barr virus hepatitis, but no deaths were attributable to anti-thymocyte globulin.INTERPRETATION: The results of this prespecified 24-month analysis suggest that pretreatment with anti-thymocyte globulin provides clinically meaningful benefits when added to standard GVHD prophylaxis in patients undergoing unrelated donor transplantation, including decreases in use of immunosuppressive therapy, chronic GVHD and its symptoms, depressive symptoms, and improved overall survival.Anti-thymocyte globulin should be included in the preparative regimens of patients with haematological malignancies selected for unrelated donor transplantation.FUNDING: Canadian Institutes of Health Research and Sanofi.",0,0,0,0
31967742,"Duloxetine and pregabalin in neuropathic pain of lung cancer patients.INTRODUCTION: Neuropathic pain occurs in 1% of the population and is difficult to manage.This chronic pain causes psychological distress and impacts patient's quality of life, especially in cancer patients.The aim of this study was to show and compare the efficacy of pregabalin and duloxetine, which are reported in the group of first-line treatment at European Federation of Neurological Societies (EFNS) guidelines on the pharmacological treatment of neuropathic pain (2010 revision) in lung cancer patients by using visual analogue scale (VAS) and Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Sign (LANSS).PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective, randomized, open label, 3 month of study was conducted.A total of 44 patients that were diagnosed with neuropathic pain (14 women and 30 men) were included in the study.Patient's LANSS and VAS values were recorded before treatment.Then, 22 patients undergo pregabalin and 22 patients undergo duloxetine therapy.But due to side effects (dizziness, constipation), two patients had stopped to use pregabalin.Their LANSS and VAS values were recorded after 1 and 3 months of therapy.RESULTS: When we compare LANSS and VAS scores before treatment, after 1 and 3 months of treatment with pregabalin and duloxetine, a significant decrease was observed in both groups at the 1 and 3 months (p < .01).Duloxetine is superior to pregabalin in reducing the LANSS scores when we compare two groups.CONCLUSIONS: Both duloxetine and pregabalin are effective in the treatment of neuropathic pain of lung cancer patients.And as far as we know, this is the first study comparing the efficacy of duloxetine and pregabalin in the neuropathic pain of lung cancer patients.",0,0,0,0
31977567,"Prognostic value of the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio in enteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.Accessible prognostic tools are needed to individualize treatment of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs).Data suggest neutrophil/lymphocyte ratios (NLRs) have prognostic value in some solid tumors, including NETs.In the randomized double-blind CLARINET study (NCT00353496; EudraCT 2005-004904-35), the somatostatin analog lanreotide autogel/depot increased progression-free survival (PFS) compared with placebo in patients with inoperable or metastatic intestinal and pancreatic NETs (grades 1-2, Ki-67 < 10%).The exploratory post-hoc analyses presented here evaluated the prognostic value of NLR in the CLARINET study cohort, in the context of and independently from treatment.Kaplan-Meier PFS plots were generated for patients with available NLR data, in subgroups based on NLR values, and 24-month survival rates were calculated.P values and hazard ratios for prognostic effects were generated using Cox models.31216222 Baseline characteristics were balanced between lanreotide autogel/depot 120 mg (n = 100) and placebo (n = 101) arms.Irrespective of treatment, raw 24-month PFS rates were comparable across subgroups based on NLR tertiles [37.3% (low), 38.8% (middle), 38.8% (high); n = 67 per group] and NLR cutoff of 4 [38.1% (NLR </= 4; n = 176), 40.0% (NLR > 4; n = 25)].Furthermore, NLRs were not prognostic in Cox models, irrespective of subgroups used.The therapeutic effect of lanreotide autogel/depot 120 mg was independent of NLRs (P > 0.1).These exploratory post-hoc analyses in patients with advanced intestinal and pancreatic NETs contrast with previous data suggesting NLR has prognostic potential in NETs.This may reflect the inclusion of patients with lower-grade tumors or use of higher NLR cutoff values in the current analysis.",0,0,0,0
31986451,"A candidate androgen signalling signature predictive of response to abiraterone acetate in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.BACKGROUND: The unmet need for predictive biomarkers emerged from the unpredictable pattern of response to androgen signalling inhibition in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).Here, we report on the testing of a previously identified candidate androgen signalling signature associated with response to androgen signalling inhibition.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report on the outcome of the first module of a phase II trial on abiraterone acetate (AA) followed by combination with dasatinib or sunitinib.Bone marrow biopsies (BMBs) with matched bone marrow aspirate and blood samples were collected at baseline and upon progression.End-points included assessment of a prespecified molecular signature consisting of nuclear androgen receptor (AR) overexpression, cytochrome P450, family 17, subfamily A, polypeptide 1 (CYP17) expression, and AR-C-/N terminal expression ratio of >/=0.8 by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in patients with benefit versus primary resistance to AA (i.e. progression within 4 months).Tumour markers also included v-ets avian erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homologue (ERG), androgen receptor splice variant (ARV7) by IHC and steroids by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.RESULTS: Of 170 patients accrued from 03/2011 to 02/2015, 44 (26%) were primary resistant to AA.Forty-eight patients had tumour infiltrated BMB at baseline.Pretreatment androgen signalling signature was linked to benefit from AA (p < 0.001).Presence of ERG was associated with benefit (p = 0.05), whereas nuclear ARV7 presence and 20 or more bone lesions at baseline with primary resistance (p = 0.04 and p = 0.0006, respectively).CONCLUSION: Testing of a prespecified androgen signalling signature was highly supportive of its predictive value in maximal androgen deprivation strategies in mCRPC.Further validation is under way.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01254864.",0,0,0,0
31987974,"Derivation of Dose/Volume Constraints for the Anorectum from Clinician- and Patient-Reported Outcomes in the CHHiP Trial of Radiation Therapy Fractionation.PURPOSE: The CHHiP trial randomized 3216 men with localized prostate cancer (1:1:1) to 3 radiation therapy fractionation schedules: 74 Gy in 37 fractions over 7.4 weeks; 60 Gy in 20 fractions over 4 weeks; and 57 Gy in 19 fractions over 3.8 weeks.Literature-based dose constraints were applied with arithmetic adjustment for the hypofractionated arms.This study aimed to derive anorectal dose constraints using prospectively collected clinician-reported outcomes (CROs) and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and to assess the added predictive value of spatial dose metrics.METHODS AND MATERIALS: A case-control study design was used; 7 CRO and 5 PRO bowel symptoms were evaluated.Cases experienced a moderate or worse symptom 1 to 5 years after-radiation therapy and did not have the symptom before radiation therapy.Controls did not experience the symptom at baseline or between 1 to 5 years after radiation therapy.The anorectum was recontoured from the anal verge to the rectosigmoid junction; dose/volume parameters were extracted.Univariate logistic regression, atlases of complication indices, and bootstrapped receiver-operating-characteristic analysis (1000 replicates, balanced outcomes) were used to derive dose constraints for the whole cohort (hypofractionated schedules were converted to 2-Gy equivalent schedules using alpha/beta = 3 Gy) and separate hypofractionated/conventional fractionation cohorts.Only areas under the curve with 95% confidence interval lower limits >0.5 were considered statistically significant.Any constraint derived in <95% to 99% of bootstraps was excluded.RESULTS: Statistically significant dose constraints were derived for CROs but not PROs.Intermediate to high doses were important for rectal bleeding, whereas intermediate doses were important for increased bowel frequency, fecal incontinence, and rectal pain.Spatial dose metrics did not improve prediction of CROs or PROs.A new panel of dose constraints for hypofractionated schedules to 60 Gy or 57 Gy are V20Gy <85%, V30Gy <57%, V40Gy <38%, V50Gy <22%, and V60Gy <0.01%.CONCLUSIONS: Dose constraints differed among symptoms, indicating potentially different pathogenesis of radiation-induced side effects.Derived dose constraints were stricter than those used in CHHiP and may reduce bowel symptoms after radiation therapy.",0,0,0,0

31995688,"Family History of Gastric Cancer and Helicobacter pylori Treatment.BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori infection and a family history of gastric cancer are the main risk factors for gastric cancer.Whether treatment to eradicate H. pylori can reduce the risk of gastric cancer in persons with a family history of gastric cancer in first-degree relatives is unknown.METHODS: In this single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we screened 3100 first-degree relatives of patients with gastric cancer.We randomly assigned 1838 participants with H. pylori infection to receive either eradication therapy (lansoprazole [30 mg], amoxicillin [1000 mg], and clarithromycin [500 mg], each taken twice daily for 7 days) or placebo.The primary outcome was development of gastric cancer.A prespecified secondary outcome was development of gastric cancer according to H. pylori eradication status, assessed during the follow-up period.RESULTS: A total of 1676 participants were included in the modified intention-to-treat population for the analysis of the primary outcome (832 in the treatment group and 844 in the placebo group).During a median follow-up of 9.2 years, gastric cancer developed in 10 participants (1.2%) in the treatment group and in 23 (2.7%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.21 to 0.94; P = 0.03 by log-rank test).Among the 10 participants in the treatment group in whom gastric cancer developed, 5 (50.0%) had persistent H. pylori infection.Gastric cancer developed in 0.8% of participants (5 of 608) in whom H. pylori infection was eradicated and in 2.9% of participants (28 of 979) who had persistent infection (hazard ratio, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.10 to 0.70).Adverse events were mild and were more common in the treatment group than in the placebo group (53.0% vs. 19.1%; P<0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Among persons with H. pylori infection who had a family history of gastric cancer in first-degree relatives, H. pylori eradication treatment reduced the risk of gastric cancer.(Funded by the National Cancer Center, South Korea; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01678027.).",0,0,0,0
32005202,"Integrated cervical cancer screening in Mayuge District Uganda (ASPIRE Mayuge): a pragmatic sequential cluster randomized trial protocol.BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is almost entirely preventable through vaccination and screening, yet remains one of the 'gravest threats to women's lives' according to the World Health Organization.Specific high-risk subtypes of human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) are well-established as the primary cause of cervical cancer.Uganda has one of the highest cervical cancer incidence rates in the world (54.8 per 100,000) as a result of limited screening access and infrastructure.The integration of a self-collected cervical cancer screening program using HPV testing within existing community-based primary health care services could increase access to screening and reduce cervical cancer rates among Ugandan women.METHODS: Using a pragmatic, sequential, cluster randomized trial design; we will compare the effectiveness of two cervical cancer screening models for self-collected HPV testing: 1) community health worker recruitment (door-to-door); and 2) community health meetings.In Mayuge district, Uganda, 31 villages are randomized to one of two treatment arms.Due to the nature of this trial, blinding is not possible.Women are eligible to participate if they have no previous history of hysterectomy or treatment for cervical cancer or pre-cancer and are aged 25-49 years old.All participants receive an integrated package of cervical cancer screening and education.Samples are tested for HPV using GeneXpert point of care testing.All women who test positive for HR-HPV types are referred to a designated health centre for follow-up inspection by Visual Inspection with Acetic acid (VIA) and treatment with thermal ablation.The primary outcome for the trial is the number of women who attend follow-up for VIA screening at a designated Health Centre after a positive HR-HPV test out of all women screened per arm.Secondary outcomes include: cervical cancer screening knowledge; patient-reported experience measures for self-collected cervical cancer screening; and HPV incidence.DISCUSSION: Results from this study will inform the national scale-up of cervical cancer screening in Uganda, aligning with the World Health Organization's target of achieving cervical cancer elimination through the pillar of increased HPV screening coverage.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN, ISRCTN12767014.Registered 14 May 2019, https://doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN12767014; clinicaltrials.gov, NCT04000503; Registered 27 June 2019, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04000503 PROTOCOL VERSION: January 8, 2020, version 1.",0,0,0,0
32014125,"Ropeginterferon alfa-2b versus standard therapy for polycythaemia vera (PROUD-PV and CONTINUATION-PV): a randomised, non-inferiority, phase 3 trial and its extension study.BACKGROUND: The PROUD-PV and CONTINUATION-PV trials aimed to compare the novel monopegylated interferon ropeginterferon alfa-2b with hydroxyurea, the standard therapy for patients with polycythaemia vera, over 3 years of treatment.METHODS: PROUD-PV and its extension study, CONTINUATION-PV, were phase 3, randomised, controlled, open-label, trials done in 48 clinics in Europe.Patients were eligible if 18 years or older with early stage polycythaemia vera (no history of cytoreductive treatment or less than 3 years of previous hydroxyurea treatment) diagnosed by WHO's 2008 criteria.Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to ropeginterferon alfa-2b (subcutaneously every 2 weeks, starting at 100 mug) or hydroxyurea (orally starting at 500 mg/day).After 1 year, patients could opt to enter the extension part of the trial, CONTINUATION-PV.The primary endpoint in PROUD-PV was non-inferiority of ropeginterferon alfa-2b versus hydroxyurea regarding complete haematological response with normal spleen size (longitudinal diameter of </=12 cm for women and </=13 cm for men) at 12 months; in CONTINUATION-PV, the coprimary endpoints were complete haematological response with normalisation of spleen size and with improved disease burden (ie, splenomegaly, microvascular disturbances, pruritus, and headache).We present the final results of PROUD-PV and an interim analysis at 36 months of the CONTINUATION-PV study (per statistical analysis plan).Analyses for safety and efficacy were per-protocol.The trials were registered on EudraCT, 2012-005259-18 (PROUD-PV) and 2014-001357-17 (CONTINUATION-PV, which is ongoing).FINDINGS: Patients were recruited from Sept 17, 2013 to March 13, 2015 with 306 enrolled.257 patients were randomly assigned, 127 were treated in each group (three patients withdrew consent in the hydroxyurea group), and 171 rolled over to the CONTINUATION-PV trial.Median follow-up was 182.1 weeks (IQR 166.3-201.7) in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b and 164.5 weeks (144.4-169.3) in the standard therapy group.In PROUD-PV, 26 (21%) of 122 patients in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b group and 34 (28%) of 123 patients in the standard therapy group met the composite primary endpoint of complete haematological response with normal spleen size.In CONTINUATION-PV, complete haematological response with improved disease burden was met in 50 (53%) of 95 patients in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b group versus 28 (38%) of 74 patients in the hydroxyurea group, p=0.044 at 36 months.Complete haematological response without the spleen criterion in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b group versus standard therapy group were: 53 (43%) of 123 patients versus 57 (46%) of 125 patients, p=0.63 at 12 months (PROUD-PV), and 67 (71%) of 95 patients versus 38 (51%) of 74 patients, p=0.012 at 36 months (CONTINUATION-PV).The most frequently reported grade 3 and grade 4 treatment-related adverse events were increased gamma-glutamyltransferase (seven [6%] of 127 patients) and increased alanine aminotransferase (four [3%] of 127 patients) in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b group, and leucopenia (six [5%] of 127 patients) and thrombocytopenia (five [4%] of 127 patients) in the standard therapy group.Treatment-related serious adverse events occurred in three (2%) of 127 patients in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b group and five (4%) of 127 patients in the hydroxyurea group.One treatment-related death was reported in the standard therapy group (acute leukaemia).INTERPRETATION: In patients with early polycythaemia vera, who predominantly presented without splenomegaly, ropeginterferon alfa-2b was effective in inducing haematological responses; non-inferiority to hydroxyurea regarding haematological response and normal spleen size was not shown at 12 months.However, response to ropeginterferon alfa-2b continued to increase over time with improved responses compared with hydroxyurea at 36 months.Considering the high and durable haematological and molecular responses and its good tolerability, ropeginterferon alfa-2b offers a valuable and safe long-term treatment option with features distinct from hydroxyurea.FUNDING: AOP Orphan Pharmaceuticals AG.",0,0,0,0
32015513,"Predictive factors for early progression during induction chemotherapy and chemotherapy-free interval: analysis from PRODIGE 9 trial.BACKGROUND: Identifying patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who will have an early disease progression during induction chemotherapy (IC) and identifying patients who may have a chemotherapy-free interval (CFI) after IC are two major challenges.METHODS: A logistic model was used to identify factors associated with early progression during IC and with short duration of the first CFI in 488 patients enrolled in the PRODIGE 9 trial.Independent factors were defined with a threshold 0.10.RESULTS: In multivariate analysis, baseline leukocytes >10 x 10(9)/L (OR = 1.98 [1.02-3.8], p = 0.04), and stable or increasing CEA at 2 months (OR = 3.61 [1.68-7.75], p = 0.01) were independent factors associated with progression during IC.Male gender (OR = 1.725 [0.92-3.325], p = 0.09) and no tumour response at first evaluation (OR = 1.90 [0.96-3.76], p = 0.07) were significantly associated with a short CFI.The presence of BRAF V600E mutation was also associated with short CFI (OR = 4.59 [0.95; 22.3], p = 0.058).CONCLUSION: High baseline leukocyte count and the lack of CEA decrease level at first evaluation were associated with early progression, and could be in favour of early chemotherapy intensification.Male gender, no tumour response at first evaluation and BRAF mutation are associated with a short CFI, and may be considered for maintenance chemotherapy after IC.CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: NCT00952029.",0,0,0,0

400 mg/m(2) intravenous bolus of fluorouracil; 2400 mg/m(2) continuous infusion of fluorouracil for 48 h) plus bevacizumab (5 mg/kg intravenously over 30 min) followed by FOLFIRI (180 mg/m(2) of intravenous irinotecan over 120 min concurrently with 200 mg/m(2) of leucovorin; 400 mg/m(2) intravenous bolus of fluorouracil; 2400 mg/m(2) continuous infusion of fluorouracil for 48 h) plus bevacizumab after disease progression.In the experimental group, patients received FOLFOXIRI (165 mg/m(2) of intravenous irinotecan over 60 min; 85 mg/m(2) intravenous oxaliplatin concurrently with 200 mg/m(2) of leucovorin over 120 min; 3200 mg/m(2) continuous infusion of fluorouracil for 48 h) plus bevacizumab followed by the reintroduction of the same regimen after disease progression.Combination treatments were repeated every 14 days for up to eight cycles followed by fluorouracil and leucovorin (at the same dose administered at the last induction cycle) plus bevacizumab maintenance until disease progression, unacceptable adverse events, or consent withdrawal.Patients and investigators were not masked.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival 2, defined as the time from randomisation to disease progression on any treatment given after first disease progression, or death, analysed by intention to treat.Safety was assessed in patients who received at least one dose of their assigned treatment.Study recruitment is complete and follow-up is ongoing.This trial is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT02339116.FINDINGS: Between Feb 26, 2015, and May 15, 2017, 679 patients were randomly assigned and received treatment (340 in the control group and 339 in the experimental group).At data cut-off (July 30, 2019) median follow-up was 35.9 months (IQR 30.1-41.4).Median progression-free survival 2 was 19.2 months (95% CI 17.3-21.4) in the experimental group and 16.4 months (15.1-17.5) in the control group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.74, 95% CI 0.63-0.88; p=0.0005).During the first-line treatment, the most frequent of all-cause grade 3-4 events were diarrhoea (57 [17%] vs 18 [5%]), neutropenia (168 [50%] vs 71 [21%]), and arterial hypertension (25 [7%] vs 35 [10%]) in the experimental group compared with the control group.Serious adverse events occurred in 84 (25%) patients in the experimental group and in 56 (17%) patients in the control group.Eight treatment-related deaths were reported in the experimental group (two intestinal occlusions, two intestinal perforations, two sepsis, one myocardial infarction, and one bleeding) and four in the control group (two occlusions, one perforation, and one pulmonary embolism).After first disease progression, no substantial differences in the incidence of grade 3 or 4 adverse events were reported between the control and experimental groups, with the exception of neurotoxicity, which was only reported in the experimental group (six [5%] of 132 patients).Serious adverse events after disease progression occurred in 20 (15%) patients in the experimental group and 25 (12%) in the control group.Three treatment-related deaths after first disease progression were reported in the experimental group (two intestinal occlusions and one sepsis) and four in the control group (one intestinal occlusion, one intestinal perforation, one cerebrovascular event, and one sepsis).INTERPRETATION: Upfront FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab followed by the reintroduction of the same regimen after disease progression seems to be a preferable therapeutic strategy to sequential administration of chemotherapy doublets, in combination with bevacizumab, for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer selected according to the study criteria.FUNDING: The GONO Cooperative Group, the ARCO Foundation, and F Hoffmann-La Roche.",0,0,0,0

32234755,"A Randomized, Open-label, Presurgical, Window-of-Opportunity Study Comparing the Pharmacodynamic Effects of the Novel Oral SERD AZD9496 with Fulvestrant in Patients with Newly Diagnosed ER(+) HER2(-) Primary Breast Cancer.PURPOSE: Fulvestrant, the first-in-class selective estrogen receptor (ER) degrader (SERD), is clinically effective in patients with ER(+) breast cancer, but it has administration and pharmacokinetic limitations.Pharmacodynamic data suggest complete ER degradation is not achieved at fulvestrant's clinically feasible dose.This presurgical study (NCT03236974) compared the pharmacodynamic effects of fulvestrant with AZD9496, a novel, orally bioavailable, nonsteroidal, potent SERD, in treatment-naive patients with ER(+) HER2(-) primary breast cancer awaiting curative intent surgery.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive AZD9496 250 mg twice daily from day 1 for 5-14 days, or fulvestrant 500 mg on day 1.On-treatment imaging-guided core tumor biopsies were taken between day 5 and 14 and compared with pretreatment diagnostic biopsies.The primary objective was to compare the effects of AZD9496 and fulvestrant on ER expression.Secondary objectives included changes in progesterone receptor (PR) and Ki-67 pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships and safety.RESULTS: Forty-six women received treatment (AZD9496 n = 22; fulvestrant n = 24); 35 paired biopsies were evaluable (AZD9496 n = 15; fulvestrant n = 20).The least square mean estimate for ER H-score reduction was 24% after AZD9496 versus 36% after fulvestrant treatment (P = 0.86).AZD9496 also reduced PR H-scores (-33.3%) and Ki-67 levels (-39.9%) from baseline, but was also not superior to fulvestrant (PR: -68.7%, P = 0.97; Ki-67: -75.4%, P = 0.98).No new safety findings were identified.CONCLUSIONS: This was the first presurgical study to demonstrate that an oral SERD affects its key biological targets.However, AZD9496 was not superior to fulvestrant at the dose tested.",1,1,1,1
32240542,"Effects of mobile text messaging on breast cancer and breast self-examination (BSE) knowledge, BSE self-efficacy, and BSE frequency: a randomised controlled trial.AIMS: Educating women regarding breast cancer and increasing breast self-examination uptake continues to remain a major challenge despite the intensive campaigns.An innovative, cost-effective and easily customised intervention is needed especially in under-resourced and hard to reach communities.This paper is a report examining the effects of mobile text messaging on women's knowledge of breast cancer and BSE, BSE self-efficacy and frequency of BSE.METHODS: A randomised controlled trial design was used.The study sample consisted of 128 women of reproductive age (WRA) (64 in the experimental group and 64 in the control group) from two communities in the Philippines during the months of August to October 2018.Three to five short messages were sent to the participants in the experimental group daily for one month while the control group did not receive the messages.RESULTS: Women who received mobile text messages had higher knowledge of breast cancer (F = 21.756, p = 0.001) and breast self-examination (F = 6.776, p = 0.010) than the control group.However, no significant improvements were seen in the BSE self-efficacy (F = 1.446, p = 0.232) and frequency of BSE (F = 3.374, p = 0.69).CONCLUSION: Mobile text messaging significantly improved the knowledge on breast cancer and breast self-examination among women; however, it did not affect their breast self-examination self-efficacy and frequency.Mobile text messaging can be a viable tool that can be used by healthcare workers in order to educate women regarding breast cancer and breast self-examination.",0,0,0,0
32246224,"A randomized, phase 2 study of deoxyuridine triphosphatase inhibitor, TAS-114, in combination with S-1 versus S-1 alone in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.Introduction TAS-114 is a potent inhibitor of deoxyuridine triphosphatase, which is a gatekeeper protein preventing uracil and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) misincorporation into DNA.TAS-114 has been suggested to enhance the antitumor activity of 5-FU.This randomized, phase 2 study investigated TAS-114 plus S-1 (TAS-114/S-1) vs. S-1 in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.Methods Patients with advanced NSCLC, previously treated with >/= 2 regimens, were randomized 1:1 to receive TAS-114 (400 mg)/S-1 (30 mg/m(2)) or S-1 (30 mg/m(2)).Progression-free survival (PFS, independent central review) was the primary endpoint.Secondary endpoints included disease control rate (DCR), overall survival (OS), overall response rate (ORR), and safety.Results In total, 127 patients received treatment.Median PFS was 3.65 and 4.17 months in the TAS-114/S-1 and S-1 groups, respectively (hazard ratio [HR] 1.16, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.71-1.88; P = 0.2744).DCR was similar between groups (TAS-114/S-1 80.3%, S-1 75.9%) and median OS was 7.92 and 9.82 months for the TAS-114/S-1 and S-1 groups, respectively (HR 1.31, 95% CI 0.80-2.14; P = 0.1431).The ORR was higher in the TAS-114/S-1 group than the S-1 group (19.7% vs. 10.3%), and more patients with tumor shrinkage were observed in the TAS-114/S-1 group.Incidence rates of anemia, skin toxicities, and Grade >/= 3 treatment-related adverse events were higher in the TAS-114/S-1 group compared with the monotherapy group.Conclusions Although the TAS-114/S-1 combination improved the response rate, this did not translate into improvements in PFS.Clinical Trial Registration No. NCT02855125 (ClinicalTrials.gov) registered on 4 August 2016.",1,1,1,0

32329651,"The Potential Long-Term Comparative Effectiveness of Larotrectinib and Entrectinib for Second-Line Treatment of TRK Fusion-Positive Metastatic Lung Cancer.BACKGROUND: Larotrectinib and entrectinib are FDA-approved therapies for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase gene fusion (TRK fusion-positive) whose cancer has metastasized and progressed.Early evidence indicates that these targeted therapies may offer dramatic survival benefits versus traditional cytotoxic regimens, but it remains uncertain how larotrectinib and entrectinib compare with each other.OBJECTIVE: To simulate and compare expected life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for both TRK inhibitors.METHODS: We developed a partitioned survival model to project the long-term comparative effectiveness of larotrectinib versus entrectinib in second-line treatment of metastatic NSCLC.Larotrectinib survival data were derived from a 13-month follow-up of 12 patients with TRK fusion-positive NSCLC in the NCT02122913 (phase 1) and NCT02576431 (NAVIGATE) trials.Entrectinib survival data were derived from a 13-month follow-up of 10 patients with TRK fusion-positive NSCLC in the ALKA-372-001, STARTRK-1, and STARTRK-2 trials.For larotrectinib and entrectinib progression-free survival and overall survival (OS), in-trial survival was extrapolated using parametric curve fits.Exponential fits were selected for all survival models based on minimal Bayesian information criteria and clinical plausibility.Lifetime survival curves were used to estimate expected mean/median survival.QALYs were estimated by applying preprogression and postprogression health state utilities derived from the literature.RESULTS: In the base case, treatment with larotrectinib and entrectinib resulted in 5.4 and 1.2 median preprogression life-years and 7.0 and 1.8 median total life-years, respectively.Mean preprogression life-years (QALYs) were 7.5 (5.0) and 1.9 (1.2), and mean total life-years (QALYs) were 9.2 (5.8) and 4.4 (2.4), respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Among TRK inhibitors for metastatic NSCLC, larotrectinib is estimated to provide improved life-year and QALY outcomes versus entrectinib based on parametric extrapolations of in-trial survival data.Our analysis is limited by lack of NSCLC-specific data on entrectinib OS, the small samples of patients with NSCLC in the trials, and a cross-trial comparison.Future studies should re-evaluate the comparative effectiveness of larotrectinib versus entrectinib as more patients are treated and as long-term survival data mature.DISCLOSURES: Funding for this study was contributed by Bayer Healthcare, which reviewed the manuscript drafts, and employees contributed to the manuscript as coauthors.Xia and Williamson are employees of Bayer Healthcare.Roth, Carlson, and Sullivan are consultants to Bayer Healthcare and retain rights to all final revisions to the manuscript.Carlson also reports fees from Adaptive Biotechnologies, unrelated to this work.Roth reports consulting fees from BMS, unrelated to this work.",0,0,0,0

32341031,"Single-Cell Circulating Tumor Cell Analysis Reveals Genomic Instability as a Distinctive Feature of Aggressive Prostate Cancer.PURPOSE: Aggressive variant prostate cancer (AVPC) represents a clinical subset distinguished by therapy resistance and poor prognosis, linked to combined losses of the tumor suppressor genes (TSG) PTEN, RB1, and TP53.Circulating tumor cells (CTC) provide a minimally invasive opportunity for identification and molecular characterization of AVPC.We aimed to evaluate the incidence and clinical significance of compound (2+)TSG losses and genomic instability in prostate cancer CTC, and to expand the set genomic biomarkers relevant to AVPC.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Genomic analysis of chromosomal copy-number alterations (CNA) at single-cell resolution was performed in CTC from patients with and without AVPC before initiating chemotherapy with cabazitaxel or cabazitaxel and carboplatin.We evaluated associations between single-CTC genomics and clinical features, progression-free survival, and overall survival.RESULTS: A total of 257 individual CTC were sequenced from 47 patients (1-22 CTC/patient).Twenty patients (42.6%) had concurrent 2+TSG losses in at least one CTC in association with poor survival and increased genomic instability, inferred by high large-scale transitions scores.Higher LST in CTC were independent of CTC enumerated, clinically more indicative of aggressive behavior than co-occurring TSG losses, and molecularly associated with gains in chromosomal regions including PTK2, Myc, and NCOA2; increased androgen receptor expression; and BRCA2 loss.In 57 patients with matched cell-free tumor DNA data, CTC were more frequently detectable and evaluable for CNA analysis (in 73.7% vs. 42.1%, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that genomic instability in CTC is a hallmark of advanced prostate cancer aggressiveness, and support single-CTC sequencing as a compelling tool to noninvasively characterize cancer heterogeneity.",0,0,0,0

32352505,"Efficacy of Nivolumab and AVD in Early-Stage Unfavorable Classic Hodgkin Lymphoma: The Randomized Phase 2 German Hodgkin Study Group NIVAHL Trial.Importance: In early-stage unfavorable classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), conventional therapy induces high cure rates but also relevant acute and long-term toxic effects.Nivolumab is well tolerated and highly effective in relapsed/refractory cHL but has not been adequately studied in first-line treatment of early-stage cHL.The NIVAHL trial evaluated nivolumab in this setting with the aim to develop a highly effective yet tolerable systemic therapy to ultimately mitigate morbidity in patients who survive cHL.Objective: To evaluate efficacy of 2 experimental nivolumab-based first-line treatment strategies in patients with early-stage unfavorable cHL.Design, Setting, and Participants: This was an open-label, multicenter, phase 2 randomized clinical trial, open between April 2017 and October 2018.The trial took place at 35 trial centers across Germany, ranging from academic centers to private offices.Eligibility was defined by age 18 to 60 years, cHL confirmed by expert pathology review, early-stage unfavorable disease by German Hodgkin Study Group criteria (stage I to II with risk factor[s]), and absence of serious concomitant disease or organ dysfunction.Among 110 enrolled patients, 109 were eligible.Interventions: Systemic therapy, per random assignment (1:1) to either concomitant treatment with 4 cycles of nivolumab and doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (N-AVD) or sequential treatment with 4 doses of nivolumab, 2 cycles of N-AVD, and 2 cycles of AVD at standard doses, followed by 30-Gy involved-site radiotherapy.Main Outcomes and Measures: Complete remission (CR) rate after study treatment, aiming at excluding a CR rate of 80% or lower via a 2-sided 95% CI for each treatment group.Results: Of 109 patients included in this study, 65 (59.6%) were women, and the median (range) age was 27 (18-60) years.At interim staging after 2 cycles of N-AVD or 4 doses of nivolumab monotherapy, 54 of 54 (100%) and 49 of 51 (96%) response-eligible patients, respectively, achieved an objective response, with CR in 47 (87%) and 26 (51%) patients, respectively.Among 101 patients eligible for primary end point analysis, 46 of 51 (90%; 95% CI, 79%-97%) patients receiving concomitant therapy and 47 of 50 (94%; 95% CI, 84%-99%) patients receiving sequential therapy achieved CR after study treatment.With a median follow-up of 13 months, 12-month progression-free survival was 100% for patients receiving concomitant treatment and 98% (95% CI, 95%-100%) for patients receiving sequential therapy.Conclusions and Relevance: Both strategies combining nivolumab and AVD are feasible and resulted in high remission rates.Despite narrowly missing the efficacy benchmark in the concomitant group, the excellent 12-month progression-free survival and the unexpectedly high CR rate after 4 doses of nivolumab monotherapy warrant further evaluation of this approach in the first-line treatment of patients with early-stage cHL.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03004833.",0,0,0,0
32359057,"Examining the Impact of Alcohol Labels on Awareness and Knowledge of National Drinking Guidelines: A Real-World Study in Yukon, Canada.OBJECTIVE: Alcohol labels are one strategy for communicating health information to consumers.This study tested the extent to which consumers recalled alcohol labels with national drinking guidelines and examined the impact of labels on awareness and knowledge of the guidelines.METHOD: A quasi-experimental study was conducted in two jurisdictions in northern Canada examining the impact of labels on the following outcomes: unprompted and prompted recall of the drinking guideline label message, awareness of the drinking guidelines, and knowledge of the daily and weekly recommended drink limits.The intervention site applied labels with national drinking guidelines, a cancer warning, and standard drink information to alcohol containers in its liquor store, whereas the comparison site did not apply these labels.In total, 2,049 cohort participants in both sites were recruited to complete surveys before and at two time points after the intervention.Changes in outcomes were examined using generalized estimating equations.RESULTS: After the intervention, unprompted and prompted recall of the drinking guideline label message increased more in the intervention versus comparison site (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 10.8, 95% CI [0.9, 127.6]; AOR = 7.0, 95% CI [3.3, 14.9], respectively).Awareness of the drinking guidelines increased 2.9 times more in the intervention versus comparison site (AOR = 2.9, 95% CI [2.0, 4.3]).In addition, knowledge of the daily and weekly drink limits increased 1.5 and 1.4 times more in the intervention versus comparison site, respectively (daily: AOR = 1.5, 95% CI [1.0, 2.1]; weekly: AOR = 1.4, 95% CI [1.0, 2.0]).CONCLUSIONS: Enhanced alcohol labels get noticed and may be an effective population-level strategy for increasing awareness and knowledge of national drinking guidelines.",0,0,0,0
32363529,"Linked Color Imaging Can Improve Detection Rate of Early Gastric Cancer in a High-Risk Population: A Multi-Center Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial.BACKGROUND: Early diagnosis of gastric cancer is difficult in China due to the lack of a valid method for endoscopic screening.Early gastric cancer, especially flat gastric cancer, lacks specific endoscopic features.Many cases appear to be similar to ordinary gastritis cases under normal white light endoscopy, which can lead to misdiagnosis.AIMS: In order to find a new method to improve detection rate of early gastric cancer in China, we designed a trial to validate linked color imaging (LCI) for screening of early gastric cancer in a high-risk population, as compared to white light imaging (WLI).METHOD: Subjects were randomly allocated to either the LCI + WLI or WLI group and then subjected to gastroscopy and all endoscopies were made after special preparation.All endoscopists had knowledge of this experiment.The main indicator was the rate of detection of gastric neoplastic lesions.The difference in the detection rate between the two groups is reported.RESULTS: The detection rate was 4.31% in the WLI group and 8.01% in the LCI + WLI group.This is a difference of 3.70% with a P value < 0.001 and an OR (95% CI) of 1.934 (1.362, 2.746).The lower limit of the 95% CI was greater than 0, and the superiority margin was 1%.CONCLUSION: The detection rate of gastric neoplastic lesions was higher in the LCI + WLI group than in the WLI group, LCI might be an effective method for screening early gastric cancer.",0,0,0,0

32459377,"Validation of the 7-item Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G7) as a short measure of quality of life in patients with advanced cancer.BACKGROUND: Assessing quality of life is essential for individuals with advanced cancer, but lengthy assessments can be burdensome.The authors investigated the psychometric characteristics of the FACT-G7, a 7-item quality-of-life measure derived from the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) scale, in advanced cancer.METHODS: Data were obtained from outpatients with advanced cancer who were enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of early palliative care.At baseline, 228 intervention participants and 233 control participants (N = 461) completed the FACT-G and measures of symptom severity, quality of life near the end of life, problematic medical communication, and satisfaction with care.Follow-up measures were administered monthly for 4 months.RESULTS: The FACT-G7 showed good internal consistency (Cronbach alpha = .72-.80), and its single-factor structure was supported.It correlated strongly with the FACT-G total, physical, and functional indices and with symptom severity (absolute r = 0.73-0.92); more moderately with the FACT-G emotional index and with symptom impact and preparation for the end of life (r = .40-.71); and least with the FACT-G social/family index and with relationship with health care provider, life completion, problematic medical communication, and care satisfaction measures (absolute r = .26-.44).Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status groups differed on FACT-G7 scores, as expected (all P < .001).Improvements in FACT-G7 scores in the intervention group compared with the control group at 3-month (P = .049) and 4-month (P = .034) follow-up supported responsiveness to change and somewhat greater sensitivity than the FACT-G scores.CONCLUSIONS: The FACT-G7 is a valid, brief measure particularly of the physical and functional facets of quality of life.It may enable rapid quality-of-life assessments in patients with advanced cancer.",0,0,0,0
32469095,"Drug cost savings in phase III hematological oncology clinical trials in a university hospital.The rapid emergence of expensive anticancer therapies is leading to exponential growth in healthcare expenses.In clinical trials, most investigational drugs are provided free of charge by industrial and academic sponsors.This results in drug cost savings for healthcare payers, who are no longer charged with the cost of the standard-of-care treatment, which would have been administered outside the trial.This study aims to estimate drug cost savings resulting from patient enrolment in hematological oncology clinical trials, from a public payer perspective.Retrospective screening identified all patients with hematological malignancies included from 2011 to 2016 in a phase III trial and having received at least one sponsor-provided cycle.Drug cost savings were defined as the standard treatment costs not charged to the payer due to sponsor provision of treatment.For each patient, cost savings were determined by the number of cycles received in the trial and the cost of standard (control arm) treatment.Of the 345 patients included in eligible trials during study period, 272 received sponsor-provided drugs.Drug cost savings could be estimated for 177 patients (65.1%) included in 27 trials.Total cost savings were euro5218 million (US$ 6804 million) for 1720 sponsor-provided cycles.Mean cost saving per patient was euro19 182.7 +/-29 865.7 ($25 015.24 +/- 39 478.25).Most cost-saving trials were industry-sponsored (77.8%), although academic trials generated 40.15% of total cost savings.Enrolling patients in clinical trials, whether industry-sponsored or academic, leads to substantial drug cost savings for payers.Implications are significant for public payers facing increasing financial constraints, as savings can be reallocated to patient care.",0,0,0,0
32475079,"Mepitel Film is superior to Biafine cream in managing acute radiation-induced skin reactions in head and neck cancer patients: a randomised intra-patient controlled clinical trial.INTRODUCTION: We previously showed that Mepitel Film decreased the severity of acute radiation-induced skin reactions in head and neck cancer patients.In the current study, we compared the effect of Mepitel Film and Biafine cream on skin reaction severity in a larger cohort of head and neck cancer patients.METHODS: A total of 44 head and neck cancer patients were recruited with 39 patients contributing full data sets for analysis.Patients received a dose of 50 Gy in 25 fractions to the bilateral lymph nodes in the neck.Left and right lymph node areas were randomised to either Mepitel Film or Biafine cream, applied prophylactically.Skin reaction severity was measured using Radiation-Induced Skin Reaction Assessment Scale (RISRAS) and expanded Radiation Oncology group (RTOG) grades.Skin dose was measured using gafchromic Film.RESULTS: Skin reaction severity (combined RISRAS score) underneath Mepitel Film was decreased by 30% (P < 0.001) and moist desquamation rates by 41% (P < 0.001).Skin dose underneath Mepitel Film and Biafine cream was similar (P = 0.925) and unlikely to have affected skin reaction severity.The vast majority (80%) of patients preferred Mepitel Film over Biafine cream.Negative aspects of Mepitel Film included poor adherence (11/39) and discomfort (16/39) during hot weather and showering and itchy skin underneath Mepitel Film (12/39).CONCLUSIONS: Mepitel Film was superior to Biafine cream in reducing the severity of acute radiation-induced skin reactions and moist desquamation incidence in our head and neck patient cohort.",0,0,0,0
32483861,"L-Dex, arm volume, and symptom trajectories 24 months after breast cancer surgery.PURPOSE: Study objectives were to examine: (a) biomarker trajectories (change from presurgical baseline values of Lymphedema index (L-Dex) units and arm volume difference) and symptom cluster scores 24 months after breast cancer surgery and (b) associations of these objective biomarkers and symptom cluster scores.Patient/treatment characteristics influencing trajectories were also evaluated.METHODS: A secondary analysis of data from the published interim analysis of a randomized parent study was undertaken using trajectory analysis.Five hundred and eight participants included in the prior analysis with 24 months of postsurgical follow-up were initially measured with bioelectric impedance spectroscopy (BIS) and tape measure (TM) and completed self-report measures.Patients were reassessed postsurgery for continuing eligibility and then randomized to either BIS or TM groups and measured along with self-report data at regular and optional* visits 3, 6,12,15*,18, 21*, and 24-months.RESULTS: Three subclinical trajectories were identified for each biomarker (decreasing, stable, increasing) and symptom cluster scores (stable, slight increase/decrease, increasing).Subclinical lymphedema was identified throughout the 24-month period by each biomarker.An L-Dex increase at 15 months in the BIS group was noted.The self-report sets demonstrated contingency coefficients of 0.20 (LSIDS-A soft tissue, P = .031) and 0.19 (FACTB+4, P = .044) with the L-Dex unit change trajectories.CONCLUSIONS: These data support the need for long-term (24 months) prospective surveillance with frequent assessments (every 3 months) at least 15 months after surgery.Statistically significant convergence of symptom cluster scores with L-Dex unit change supports BIS as beneficial in the early identification of subclinical lymphedema.",0,0,0,0

Week 8 AFP response rate was 50% for cabozantinib versus 13% for placebo.In the cabozantinib arm, median OS for patients with and without AFP response was 16.1 versus 9.1 months (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.45-0.84).AFP response was independently associated with longer OS.The optimal cutoff for association with OS in the cabozantinib arm was </=0% change in AFP at Week 8 [AFP control; HR 0.50 (95% CI, 0.35-0.71)].HRs for PFS were consistent with those for OS.CONCLUSIONS: Cabozantinib improved outcomes versus placebo across a range of baseline AFP levels.On-treatment AFP response and control rates were higher with cabozantinib than placebo, and were associated with longer OS and PFS with cabozantinib.",1,1,1,0
32660748,"Concomitant Antibiotic Use and Survival in Urothelial Carcinoma Treated with Atezolizumab.Antibiotic effects on the gut microbiota may negatively impact survival with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs).However, there is minimal evidence regarding whether antibiotic impacts are specific to ICIs or impacts in urothelial carcinoma (UC).In a post hoc analysis of IMvigor210 (single-arm atezolizumab) and IMvigor211 (phase III randomised trial of atezolizumab vs chemotherapy), the association between antibiotic use and overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) was assessed via Cox proportional hazard analysis.Antibiotic use was defined as any antibiotic administration between 30 d prior to and 30 d after treatment initiation.Antibiotic use was associated with worse OS (n = 847, hazard ratio or HR [95% confidence interval {CI}] = 1.44 [1.19-1.73]) and PFS (1.24 [1.05-1.46]) with atezolizumab, but not chemotherapy (n = 415, 1.15 [0.91-1.46] and 1.09 [0.88-1.36], respectively).In the randomised cohort of IMvigor211, the OS treatment effect (HR [95% CI]) of atezolizumab versus chemotherapy was 0.95 (95% CI 0.71-1.25) for antibiotic users, compared with 0.73 (0.60-0.88) for nonusers (p[interaction] = 0.1).Similar associations were noted in the PD-L1 IC2/3 population.In conclusion, antibiotic use was associated with worse survival outcomes in UC patients treated with atezolizumab.The study does not justify a change in antibiotic selection for infections; however antibiotic overuse occurs in cancer care and this needs to be evaluated for ICIs.PATIENT SUMMARY: In this report from clinical trials IMvigor210 and IMvigor211, it was demonstrated that antibiotic use is consistently associated with worse survival in patients with urothelial carcinoma treated with atezolizumab.No antibiotic association was observed in patients treated with chemotherapy, suggesting that antibiotics may specifically reduce the effectiveness of cancer immunotherapies.Future research will continue to explore the effect of antibiotics on other immune checkpoint inhibitors and confirm whether immune checkpoint inhibitors remain the treatment of choice in cancer patients requiring antibiotics.",0,0,0,0

Rates of grade 3/4 adverse events were 51.9%, 93.9%, and 60.0% in arms A, B, and C, respectively.VEN + BR led to increased toxicity and lower dose intensity of BR than in arm C, but efficacy was similar.Optimizing dose and schedule to maintain BR dose intensity may improve efficacy and tolerability of VEN + BR, while VEN + R data warrant further study.This study was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT02187861.",0,0,0,0
32787364,"A novel nomogram based on SEER database for the prediction of liver metastasis in patients with small-cell lung cancer.BACKGROUND: To establish and validate a nomogram to predict liver metastasis in patients with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC).METHODS: Information on patients diagnosed with SCLC between 2010 and 2015 was retrospectively retrieved from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database.Risk factors for liver metastasis were identified by logistic regression analyses to construct a nomogram.The predictive accuracy was evaluated by concordance indexes (c-index) and calibration plots, and the comparison of discrimination between the nomogram and other routine staging systems was achieved with the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) analysis.Decision curve analysis (DCA) was performed to measure the clinical performance of the nomogram.RESULTS: A total of 12,957 patients met our inclusion criteria and were randomly assigned to training (n=6,479) and validation (n=6,478) sets.The nomogram which was established based on independent clinicopathological factors had poor accuracy, and after other distant metastatic sites were added into the predictive model, the new nomogram displayed better discrimination power, with c-indexes of 0.703 in the training set and 0.712 in the validation set.Both internal and external calibration plots approached 45 degrees.The AUCs and net benefit of the predictive model were both higher than those of routine staging systems.CONCLUSIONS: The validated nomogram might be a practical tool for clinicians to quantify the risk of liver metastasis in patients with SCLC and improve cancer management.",0,0,0,0

32791985,"A monocentric, open-label randomized standard-of-care controlled study of XONRID(R), a medical device for the prevention and treatment of radiation-induced dermatitis in breast and head and neck cancer patients.BACKGROUND: This study was an open-label, 2-arms, monocentric, randomized clinical trial comparing Xonrid(R), a topical medical device, versus standard of care (SOC) in preventing and treating acute radiation dermatitis (ARD) in Head and Neck Cancer (HNC) and Breast Cancer (BC) patients undergoing radiotherapy (RT).METHODS: Eligible HNC and BC patients were randomized 1:1 to receive Xonrid(R) + SOC or SOC during RT.Patients were instructed to apply Xonrid(R) on the irradiated area three times daily, starting on the first day of RT and until 2 weeks after RT completion or until the development of grade >/= 3 skin toxicity.The primary endpoint was to evaluate the proportion of patients who developed an ARD grade < 2 at the 5th week in both groups.Secondary endpoints were median time to grade 2 (G2) skin toxicity onset; changes in skin erythema and pigmentation and trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL); patient-reported skin symptoms.All patients were evaluated at baseline, weekly during RT and 2 weeks after treatment completion.The evaluation included: clinical toxicity assessment; reflectance spectrometry (RS) and TEWL examination; measurement of patients' quality of life (QoL) through Skindex-16 questionnaire.RESULTS: Eighty patients (40 for each cancer site) were enrolled between June 2017 and July 2018.Groups were well balanced for population characteristics.All BC patients underwent 3-Dimensional Conformal RT (3D-CRT) whereas HNC patients underwent Volumetric-Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT).At week 5 the proportion of BC patients who did not exhibit G2 ARD was higher in Xonrid(R) + SOC group (p = 0.091).In the same group the onset time of G2 ARD was significantly longer than in SOC-alone group (p < 0.0491).For HNC groups there was a similar trend, but it did not reach statistical significance.For both cancer sites, patients' QoL, measured by the Skindex-16 score, was always lower in the Xonrid(R) + SOC group.CONCLUSION: Despite the failure to achieve the primary endpoint, this study suggests that Xonrid(R) may represent a valid medical device in the prevention and treatment of ARD at least in BC patients, delaying time to develop skin toxicity and reducing the proportion of patients who experienced G2 ARD during RT treatment and 2 weeks later.TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori di Milano (INT 52/14 - NCT02261181 ).Registered on ClinicalTrial.gov on 21st August 2017.",0,0,0,0
32803636,"Influence of green tea consumption on endoxifen steady-state concentration in breast cancer patients treated with tamoxifen.BACKGROUND: Many cancer patients use additional herbs or supplements in combination with their anti-cancer therapy.Green tea-active ingredient epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG)-is one of the most commonly used dietary supplements among breast cancer patients.EGCG may alter the metabolism of tamoxifen.Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the influence of green tea supplements on the pharmacokinetics of endoxifen; the most relevant active metabolite of tamoxifen.METHODS: In this single-center, randomized cross-over trial, effects of green tea capsules on endoxifen levels were evaluated.Patients treated with tamoxifen for at least 3 months were eligible for this study.After inclusion, patients were consecutively treated with tamoxifen monotherapy for 28 days and in combination with green tea supplements (1 g twice daily; containing 300 mg EGCG) for 14 days (or vice versa).Blood samples were collected on the last day of monotherapy or combination therapy.Area under the curve (AUC0-24h), maximum concentration (Cmax) and minimum concentration (Ctrough) were obtained from individual plasma concentration-time curves.RESULTS: No difference was found in geometric mean endoxifen AUC0-24h in the period with green tea versus tamoxifen monotherapy (- 0.4%; 95% CI - 8.6 to 8.5%; p = 0.92).Furthermore, no differences in Cmax (- 2.8%; - 10.6 to 5.6%; p = 0.47) nor Ctrough (1.2%; - 7.3 to 10.5%; p = 0.77) were found.Moreover, no severe toxicity was reported during the whole study period.CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the absence of a pharmacokinetic interaction between green tea supplements and tamoxifen.Therefore, the use of green tea by patients with tamoxifen does not have to be discouraged.",0,0,0,0

DESIGN: YonLife is a cluster-randomised, open-label, proof-of-concept study.The intervention incorporates electronic PRO assessment, a case vignette and expert-consented treatment recommendations.PARTICIPANTS: Six hospitals were randomised to the control arm (CA) or interventional arm (IA).Seventy-nine patients were included of whom 40 were analysed as per-protocol analysis set.PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary end point was the change of Functional Assessment for Cancer Therapy (FACT-G) total score after 9 weeks.Secondary outcomes included QoL (FACT-G subscales), anorexia and cachexia (Functional Assessment of Anorexia/Cachexia Therapy (FAACT)), symptoms (MD Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI)), anxiety and depression (HADS), pain intensity and interference (Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)) and survival assessment.RESULTS: After 9 weeks of treatment, QoL declined less in the IA (DeltaFACT-G total score: -2.4, 95% CI: -9.2 to 4.5) as compared with CA (DeltaFACT-G total score: -3.9; 95% CI:-11.3 to 3.5; p=0.765).In almost all FACT-G subscales, average declines were lower in IA, but without reaching statistical significance.Smaller adverse trends between arms were observed for MDASI, FAACT, HADS and BPI scales.These trends failed to reach statistical significance.Overall mean survival was longer in IA (648 days) than in CA (389 days, p=0.110).QoL was predicted by symptom severity, symptom interference, depression and anxiety.CONCLUSION: Our data suggest a potentially favourable effect of an electronic patient-reported outcomes based intervention on QoL that needs to be reappraised in confirmatory studies.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier (NCT02204111).",0,0,0,0
32865062,"Comparison of Image-Guided Iodine-125 Seed Interstitial Brachytherapy and Local Chemotherapy Perfusion in Treatment of Advanced Pancreatic Cancer.OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of iodine-125 seed interstitial brachytherapy and local chemotherapy perfusion in treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer.METHODS: The present open prospective randomized control study included a total of 165 cases of advanced pancreatic cancer patients who were admitted in our hospital during December 2016 to April 2019.All patients were randomized into two groups with 84 cases in iodine-125 group and 81 cases in chemotherapy perfusion group.Basic clinical characteristics and demographic data were collected.The main outcome was the tumor efficiency.The pain condition was measured by visual analogue scale (VAS) and the Karnofsky score was also measured at different time points, before the treatment, 1 d, 7 d, 14 d, 1 mon, 2 mon and 3 mon after treatment.Serum levels of CEA, CA19-9 and CA50 were measured by immunochemiluminescence.The overall survival was analyzed by K-M curve.RESULTS: The ratio of partial remission patients was significantly higher, and the ratio of stable disease (SD)+progressive disease patients was also remarkably lower in iodine-125 group than the chemotherapy perfusion group.The mean VAS scores decreased markedly after treatment and were significantly lower and the mean Karnofsky scores were remarkably higher in iodine-125 group than the chemotherapy perfusion group.The levels of CA19-9 and CA50 were remarkably lower in iodine-125 group, however no significant difference was found for CEA.The survival analysis by K-M curve showed the iodine-125 patients had longer overall survival time than the chemotherapy perfusion group.No infection, pancreatic fistula, biliary fistula, intestinal fistula, gastrointestinal obstruction or radiation enteritis was found in both groups.CONCLUSION: Iodine-125 seed interstitial brachytherapy could achieve better efficacy with no increased side complications than chemotherapy perfusion in advanced pancreatic cancer.",0,0,0,0
32868525,"Optimal Criteria for G3 (Poorly Differentiated) Stage II Colon Cancer: Prospective Validation in a Randomized Controlled Study (SACURA Trial).Grade 3 (G3, poorly differentiated) is an important treatment-decision factor in stage II colon cancer, but no unified diagnostic criteria are established.According to previous studies, an intratumoural poorly differentiated area with no glandular formation (POR) that fills the microscopic field of a x40 objective lens was an essential factor that defined G3.We aimed to prospectively validate this in a randomized controlled study of adjuvant chemotherapy (SACURA trial).We enrolled 991 patients with stage II colon cancer.POR was graded according to the x40 objective lens rule and the intensity of poorly differentiated clusters (Grade), and its prognostic power was compared with that of the conventional tumor grade on the basis of predominant histology rule (Grade).According to Grade, 313, 526, and 152 tumors were classified as G1, G2, and G3, respectively, and the 5-year relapse-free survival (RFS) rates were 91.1%, 82.9%, and 74.7%, respectively (P<0.0001).When G3 and G3 were alternatively added to the prognostic model consisting of 8 conventional factors, only G3 was a significant factor for RFS (P=0.040, Wald test).The adverse impact of G3 on RFS was greater in the microsatellite stable/microsatellite instability-low subset than that in the full analysis set.In the microsatellite stable/microsatellite instability-low subset, the 5-year RFS rate of patients with G3 tumors in the chemotherapy group achieved greater improvement (9.1%) than the surgery-alone group.The least differentiation policy with the x40 objective lens rule may be highlighted as the diagnostic criterion for G3 because of its validated prognostic value.",0,0,0,0

32948387,"Double-Needle Lavage for Effective Treatment of Difficult-Aspiration Thyroid Cystic Nodules: A Single-Center Controlled Trial.PURPOSE: To explore the safety and efficacy of double-needle lavage (DNL) in the treatment of difficult aspiration thyroid cystic nodules.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This single-center, prospective, randomized controlled trial was conducted using 100 thyroid cysts from 100 patients who were treated in our hospital from January 2018 to August 2019.These patients were placed into 2 groups; group A including 40 patients treated with single-needle aspiration (SNA), and group B including 60 patients treated with DNL.The safety and efficacy of these 2 aspiration methods were compared.RESULTS: Ten patients in group A that did not benefit from SNA were transferred to group B. No complication occurred in either group.Notably, DNL showed significantly higher efficacy than SNA.This was evidenced by the higher extraction rate of materials in the capsule (A vs B, 91 +/- 6.51% vs 98.45 +/- 1.74%, P < .001) and overall nodule volume reduction rate in group B (A vs B, 87.54 +/- 7.84% vs 95.62 +/- 3.66%, P < .001).In group B, patients who received DNL treatment with 2 needles pointed at the upper and lower extremes of the cystic nodules (B2) exhibited significantly better aspiration effects compared to patients in which the 2 needles were pointed at the same ultrasound plane (B1) (P < .05), especially for patients with maximum diameter of nodules >/=3 cm (P < .01).CONCLUSIONS: DNL treatment could efficiently and safely replace cystic material from thyroid gland.Moreover, our results indicate that DNL treatment in which 2 needles are pointed at the 2 extremes of cystic nodules yields higher efficacy in patients with maximum diameter of nodules >/=3 cm.",0,0,0,0
32962673,"Assessment of the effect of platelet rich plasma on the healing of operated sacrococcygeal pilonidal sinus by lay-open technique: a randomized clinical trial.BACKGROUND: Sacrococcygeal pilonidal sinus disease (PSD) is an infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue at the upper part of the natal cleft of the buttocks.Excision and healing by granulation ""lay-open"" method is still more preferable than other methods of midline closure or using flaps but the healing time is lengthy.The present study was performed to assess the healing promotion effect of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) on the pilonidal sinus wounds treated by the lay-open method.METHODS: One hundred patients suffering from PSD were randomly divided into two groups, they were treated by the lay-open method, at General surgery department, Kafr El-Sheik University hospital, Egypt, during the period from December 2018 to December 2019.Group (A) was adopted the regular dressing postoperatively, while group (B) was treated with PRP injection into the wound at 4 and 12 postoperative days.RESULTS: Accelerated rate of wound healing was detected in group (B) in day 10, with a significant difference detected in days 15, 20, 25 and 30 postoperative, with a mean time of complete healing 45 +/- 2.6 days in group B, while it was 57 +/- 2.4 days in group A with a p-value of 0.001 which indicates considerable effect in the treated group.CONCLUSIONS: PRP injection is an effective new technique in accelerating the healing of pilonidal wound after surgery, with a significant decrease in post-operative pain, complications and an early return to work.TRIAL REGISTRATION: retrospectively registered.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: 12/35/1016 issued on December 2018 from the Institution Review Board at Kafr El Sheikh University.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04430413.",0,0,0,0
32967939,"MRI and (18)FET-PET Predict Survival Benefit from Bevacizumab Plus Radiotherapy in Patients with Isocitrate Dehydrogenase Wild-type Glioblastoma: Results from the Randomized ARTE Trial.PURPOSE: To explore a prognostic or predictive role of MRI and O-(2-(18)F-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine ((18)FET) PET parameters for outcome in the randomized multicenter trial ARTE that compared bevacizumab plus radiotherapy with radiotherpay alone in elderly patients with glioblastoma.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase wild-type glioblastoma ages 65 years or older were included in this post hoc analysis.Tumor volumetric and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) analyses of serial MRI scans from 67 patients and serial (18)FET-PET tumor-to-brain intensity ratios (TBRs) from 31 patients were analyzed blinded for treatment arm and outcome.Multivariate Cox regression analysis was done to account for established prognostic factors and treatment arm.RESULTS: Overall survival benefit from bevacizumab plus radiotherapy compared with radiotherapy alone was observed for larger pretreatment MRI contrast-enhancing tumor [HR per cm(3) 0.94; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.89-0.99] and for higher ADC (HR 0.18; CI, 0.05-0.66).Higher (18)FET-TBR on pretreatment PET scans was associated with inferior overall survival in both arms.Response assessed by standard MRI-based Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology criteria was associated with overall survival in the bevacizumab plus radiotherapy arm by trend only (P = 0.09).High (18)FET-TBR of noncontrast-enhancing tumor portions during bevacizumab therapy was associated with inferior overall survival on multivariate analysis (HR 5.97; CI, 1.16-30.8).CONCLUSIONS: Large pretreatment contrast-enhancing tumor mass and higher ADCs identify patients who may experience a survival benefit from bevacizumab plus radiotherapy.Persistent (18)FET-PET signal of no longer contrast-enhancing tumor after concomitant bevacizumab plus radiotherapy suggests pseudoresponse and predicts poor outcome.",0,0,0,0
32975708,"Randomized phase II clinical trial and biomarker analysis of paclitaxel plus epirubicin versus vinorelbine plus epirubicin as neoadjuvant chemotherapy in locally advanced HER2-negative breast cancer with TEKT4 variations.PURPOSE: Resistance to paclitaxel remains a major challenge in treating breast cancer.Our preclinical study suggested that TEKT4 germline variations in breast cancer are associated with paclitaxel resistance and increase vinorelbine sensitivity.This clinical trial compared the efficacy of paclitaxel and vinorelbine in breast cancer neoadjuvant chemotherapy.METHODS: In this open-label, single-center, phase II trial, female patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, stage IIB-IIIC breast cancer harboring TEKT4 germline variations were randomly assigned to the paclitaxel plus epirubicin (PE) or vinorelbine plus epirubicin (NE).The primary endpoint was the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate, and the secondary endpoints were the objective response rate (ORR) and safety.Targeted sequencing of a panel comprising 484 breast-related genes was performed to identify pCR-associated somatic mutations in each group.RESULTS: 91 Patients were assigned to PE (46 patients) or NE (45 patients).NE numerically increased the pCR rate (22.2% versus 8.7%, P = 0.074).The ORRs for NE and PE were 82.2% and 76.1%, respectively.Interestingly, NE (15.4%) showed a significantly higher pCR rate than PE (0%) in the hormone receptor (HR)-positive subgroup (P = 0.044).Both regimens were well tolerated, with grade 3 and 4 toxicities reported at the expected levels.The biomarker analysis showed that UNC13D mutation predicted the pCR rate in NE (P = 0.011).CONCLUSIONS: Although the primary endpoint was not met, NE might bring clinical benefit to HR-positive patients or patients simultaneously carrying UNC13D mutations.",1,1,1,1
32979042,"Quality of life outcomes from a randomized controlled trial of patient navigation in Latina breast cancer survivors.INTRODUCTION: Breast cancer survivorship is a life-long process involving challenges to health-care communities and individuals, especially Latinas.Patient Navigation has shown some success in meeting these challenges.The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of an enhanced Patient Navigation program (Intervention; PN+) vs Control (PN) over time on general cancer and breast cancer-specific quality of life (QoL) in Latina breast cancer survivors (BCS).METHODS: We conducted a 2-year, two-arm randomized controlled trial of the ""Staying Healthy"" program among Latina BCS.The design compared PN+ vs PN over time.We recruited 60 patients into each study arm and randomized them by sequential numerical assignment.PN+ participants received culturally tailored educational materials and active, personalized Patient Navigation services, including phone calls, transportation, and care coordination.PN participants were navigated only upon request.Primary outcomes included general cancer (Functional Assessments of Cancer Therapy [FACTS]-G) and breast cancer-specific (FACT-B) QoL. RESULTS: PN+ participants had significantly improved QoL measures compared to PN at 6-month follow-up on all subscales (P-values .007-.04) except physical well-being (PWB; P = .11).Intervention effect size coefficient (standard error) for FACT-G overall was 7.9 (3.1); P = .01.For FACT-B, it was 10.9 (3.9); P = .006.Again, all subscales showed significant effects [range 1.7-3.1 (0.8-1.2); P-values .006-.04], except for PWB [1.5 (1.0); P = .16] and social/family well-being (SWB) [2.1 (1.1); P = .06].There were no differences between groups at baseline.DISCUSSION: Multiple cultural, psychosocial, and socioeconomic variables contributing to these intervention effects will be addressed in future studies.As the national BCS population continues to increase, more Patient Navigation-focused partnerships among patients, health-care professionals, research groups, and community organizations are needed to improve BCS experiences.The Staying Healthy program has the potential to serve as a national survivorship care model for improving Latina BCS QoL.",0,0,0,0
32987492,"Evaluation of postoperative pain in patients undergoing modified radical mastectomy with pectoralis or serratus-intercostal fascial plane blocks.BACKGROUND: Regional nerve blocks are an integral part of multimodal analgesia and should be chosen based on their efficacy, convenience, and minimal side effects.Here, we compare the use of pectoral (PEC II) and serratus-intercostal fascial plane (SIFP) blocks in breast carcinoma cases undergoing modified radical mastectomy (MRM) in terms of the postoperative analgesic efficacy and shoulder mobility.METHODS: The primary outcome of this prospective controlled study was to compare the postoperative static and dynamic pain scores, and the secondary outcome was to assess the shoulder pain, range of shoulder joint motion, and hemodynamic parameters.Sixty patients were randomly allocated to three groups and given general anesthesia.All patients received paracetamol, diclofenac, and rescue doses of tramadol based on the Institute's Acute Pain Service (APS) policy.No block was performed in group C (control), whereas groups P and S received PEC II and SIFP blocks, respectively, before surgical incision.RESULTS: The groups were comparable in terms of age, weight, height, and body mass index distribution (P > 0.05).Dynamic pain relief was significantly better 12 and 24 h postoperatively in groups P (P = 0.034 and P = 0.04, respectively) and S (P = 0.01 and P = 0.02, respectively) compared to group C.

33002438,"Adjuvant radiotherapy versus early salvage radiotherapy plus short-term androgen deprivation therapy in men with localised prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy (GETUG-AFU 17): a randomised, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Adjuvant radiotherapy reduces the risk of biochemical progression in prostate cancer patients after radical prostatectomy.We aimed to compare adjuvant versus early salvage radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy, combined with short-term hormonal therapy, in terms of oncological outcomes and tolerance.METHODS: GETUG-AFU 17 was a randomised, open-label, multicentre, phase 3 trial done at 46 French hospitals.Men aged at least 18 years who had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 1 or less, localised adenocarcinoma of the prostate treated with radical prostatectomy, who had pathologically-staged pT3a, pT3b, or pT4a (with bladder neck invasion), pNx (without pelvic lymph nodes dissection), or pN0 (with negative lymph nodes dissection) disease, and who had positive surgical margins were eligible for inclusion in the study.Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to either immediate adjuvant radiotherapy or delayed salvage radiotherapy at the time of biochemical relapse.Random assignment, by minimisation, was done using web-based software and stratified by Gleason score, pT stage, and centre.All patients received 6 months of triptorelin (intramuscular injection every 3 months).The primary endpoint was event-free survival.Efficacy and safety analyses were done on the intention-to-treat population.The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00667069.FINDINGS: Between March 7, 2008, and June 23, 2016, 424 patients were enrolled.We planned to enrol 718 patients, with 359 in each study group.However, on May 20, 2016, the independent data monitoring committee recommended early termination of enrolment because of unexpectedly low event rates.At database lock on Dec 19, 2019, the overall median follow-up time from random assignment was 75 months (IQR 50-100), 74 months (47-100) in the adjuvant radiotherapy group and 78 months (52-101) in the salvage radiotherapy group.In the salvage radiotherapy group, 115 (54%) of 212 patients initiated study treatment after biochemical relapse.205 (97%) of 212 patients started treatment in the adjuvant group.5-year event-free survival was 92% (95% CI 86-95) in the adjuvant radiotherapy group and 90% (85-94) in the salvage radiotherapy group (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.48-1.36; log-rank p=0.42).Acute grade 3 or worse toxic effects occurred in six (3%) of 212 patients in the adjuvant radiotherapy group and in four (2%) of 212 patients in the salvage radiotherapy group.Late grade 2 or worse genitourinary toxicities were reported in 125 (59%) of 212 patients in the adjuvant radiotherapy group and 46 (22%) of 212 patients in the salvage radiotherapy group.Late genitourinary adverse events of grade 2 or worse were reported in 58 (27%) of 212 patients in the adjuvant radiotherapy group versus 14 (7%) of 212 patients in the salvage radiotherapy group (p<0.0001).Late erectile dysfunction was grade 2 or worse in 60 (28%) of 212 in the adjuvant radiotherapy group and 17 (8%) of 212 in the salvage radiotherapy group (p<0.0001).INTERPRETATION: Although our analysis lacked statistical power, we found no benefit for event-free survival in patients assigned to adjuvant radiotherapy compared with patients assigned to salvage radiotherapy.Adjuvant radiotherapy increased the risk of genitourinary toxicity and erectile dysfunction.A policy of early salvage radiotherapy could spare men from overtreatment with radiotherapy and the associated adverse events.FUNDING: French Health Ministry and Ipsen.",0,0,0,0
33010183,"Acute effects of aerobic exercise and relaxation training on fatigue in breast cancer survivors: A feasibility trial.OBJECTIVE: This three-armed randomized controlled feasibility trial tested the acceptability and acute effects of aerobic exercise and technology-guided mindfulness training (relative to standalone interventions) on cancer-related fatigue among breast cancer survivors (BCS).METHODS: BCS recruited from Central Illinois completed pre- and post-testing using established measures and were randomized to one of three groups (combined aerobic exercise with guided-mindfulness relaxation, aerobic exercise only, and relaxation only), conducted in three 90 min sessions over the course of 7 days in a fitness room and research office on a university campus.RESULTS: We enrolled 40 BCS (Mage = 57.33 +/- 8.75), MBMI = 27.38 +/- 5.27, Mfatigue = 4.56 +/- 1.81 as measured by the Piper Fatigue Scale.More favorable post-intervention evaluations were reported by the combined group, compared to aerobic exercise or relaxation only (p < 0.05).Reductions in fatigue favoring the combined group (p = 0.05) showed a modest effect size (Cohen's d = 0.91) compared to aerobic exercise only.CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide preliminary evidence for the feasibility of combining evidence-based techniques to address fatigue among BCS.The combined approach, incorporating mobile health technology, presents an efficacious and well-received design.If replicated in longer trials, the approach could provide a promising opportunity to deliver broad-reaching interventions for improved outcomes in BCS.Preregistered-ClinicalTrials NCT03702712.",0,0,0,0
33010985,"Prostate-specific Antigen Progression in Enzalutamide-treated Men with Nonmetastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer: Any Rise in Prostate-specific Antigen May Require Closer Monitoring.BACKGROUND: There is no universally accepted definition for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression.However, changes in PSA in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) are used to inform treatment decisions.OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 (PCWG2) definition of PSA progression is adequate to predict radiographic or clinical progression in enzalutamide-treated men with nonmetastatic CRPC (nmCRPC).DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A post hoc, retrospective analysis of men with nmCRPC from PROSPER (NCT02003924) was performed.INTERVENTION: Continued androgen deprivation therapy; patients randomized 2:1 to enzalutamide 160 mg/d or placebo.OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Metastasis-free survival (MFS) in men with and without PSA progression, defined by PCWG2, and PSA at the time of radiographic progression were assessed.RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: As of June 28, 2017, in enzalutamide-treated patients, the risk of metastasis or death was increased significantly in those with PSA progression versus those without (hazard ratio [HR] 3.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.95-5.41; p < 0.0001).Median MFS was not reached (NR; 95% CI, NR-NR) in patients without PSA progression and was 22.6 mo (95% CI, 21.9-29.0) in those with PSA progression.In placebo-treated patients, PSA progression was not significantly associated with MFS (HR 1.72; 95% CI, 0.86-3.45; p = 0.1).Median MFS was NR (95% CI, 25.6-NR) in patients without PSA progression and 18.3 mo (95% CI, 14.9-19.4) in those with PSA progression.The median PSA increase from nadir at the time of radiographic progression was 1.4 ng/mL in enzalutamide-treated men and 25.6 ng/mL for the placebo arm.CONCLUSIONS: In men with nmCRPC and rapidly rising PSA, radiographic progression often occurred without PCWG2-defined PSA progression, suggesting that any increase in PSA may warrant closer monitoring.While PCWG2-defined PSA progression was associated with radiographic progression in enzalutamide-treated men, our findings argue for prospective re-evaluation of this threshold.PATIENT SUMMARY: In this report, we looked at changes in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in enzalutamide-treated men with nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who no longer respond to testosterone-lowering treatment.We found that even very small changes in PSA while on treatment could be an early indication of disease progression and should trigger closer monitoring.",0,0,0,0
33027722,"Hysteroscopic versus cervical injection for sentinel node detection in endometrial cancer: A multicenter prospective randomised controlled trial from the Multicenter Italian Trials in Ovarian cancer (MITO) study group.AIM: During the last years, the role of sentinel lymph node mapping (SLNM) for endometrial cancer (EC) surgical treatment has increased in popularity.However, several controversies remain about different technical steps of SLNM.Thus, a randomised control trial was designed to compare cervical (CI) and hysteroscopic (HI) indocyanine green (ICG) injection for SLNM of newly diagnosed EC undergoing surgical staging.The primary end-point of the study was to compare these two techniques in terms of para-aortic detection rate.METHODS: Patients with apparent stage I or II histologically confirmed EC undergoing surgery were included in the study.This randomised trial distinguished patients in two study groups according to two different techniques of ICG SLNM: CI versus HI injection.Patients who met the inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to CI or HI injection in a 1:1 ratio.The central randomisation system allocated patient randomisation numbers sequentially in the order in which the patients were enrolled.This randomised trial was not blinded for either patients or the surgeons.RESULTS: From March 2017 until April 2019, a total of 165 patients were randomised in this study: 85 (51.5%) in the CI group and 80 (48.5%) in the HI group.After randomisation, 14 (8.5%) patients were excluded from the study.Finally, 151 patients were included in the analysis: 82 (54.3%) in the CI group and 69 (45.7%) in the HI group.Hysteroscopy injection shows an ability to detect Sentinel nodes (SNLs) in the para-aortic area of about 10% greater compared with CI injection, although this difference did not reach statistical significance.The HI technique was superior in detecting isolated para-aortic SLNs (5.8% Versus 0%).The CI injection was correlated with higher SLN detection rates at the pelvic level compared with HI injection.Pelvic and overall detection was higher in the CI group.CONCLUSIONS: The present study supports the adoption of CI instead of HI injection because the former allows better identification of sentinel nodes (especially in the pelvic area).Detection of SLN in the para-aortic area was slightly higher in patients receiving a HI injection, but the difference with the CI route was not statistically significant.",0,0,0,0
33044292,"Colonic J-Pouch or Straight Colorectal Reconstruction After Low Anterior Resection For Rectal Cancer: Impact on Quality of Life and Bowel Function: A Multicenter Prospective Randomized Study.BACKGROUND: Patient-reported outcomes associated with different bowel reconstruction techniques following anterior resection for rectal cancer are still a matter of debate.OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess quality of life and bowel function in patients who underwent colonic J-pouch or straight colorectal anastomosis reconstruction after low anterior resection.DESIGN: Bowel function and quality of life were assessed within a multicenter randomized trial.Questionnaires were administered before the surgery (baseline) and at 6, 12, and 24 months after surgery.SETTINGS: Patients were enrolled by 19 centers.The enrollment started in October 2009 and was stopped in February 2016.The study was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov (Identifier: NCT01110798).PATIENTS: Patients who underwent low anterior resection for primary mid-low rectal cancer and who were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either stapled colonic J-pouch or straight colorectal anastomosis were selected.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes measured were quality of life and bowel function.RESULTS: Of the 379 patients who were evaluable, 312 (82.3%) completed the baseline, 259 (68.3%) the 6-month, 242 (63.9%) the 12-month, and 199 (52.5%) the 24-month assessment.Bowel functioning and quality of life did not significantly differ between arms for almost all domains.The total bowel function score, the urgency, and the stool fractionation scores significantly worsened after surgery and remained impaired over time in both arms (p < 0.0032), whereas constipation improved after surgery but recovered to baseline levels from 1 year onward (p < 0.0036).All patients showed a significant and continuous improvement in emotional functioning (p < 0.0013) and future perspective (p < 0.0001) from baseline to the end of the study.LIMITATIONS: Limitations of the study include missing data, which increased over time;

33048394,"Number of screening rounds attended and incidence of high-risk prostate cancer in the Finnish Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (FinRSPC).BACKGROUND: The European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer has shown a 20% reduction in prostate cancer (PC) mortality by prostate-specific antigen-based screening.In addition, screening has been shown to reduce the risk of advanced PC.The objective of the current study was to analyze the impact of screening participation on the incidence of PC by risk group.METHODS: The participants in the screening arm of the Finnish trial (31,867 men) were classified according to screening attendance in a time-dependent fashion.Initially, all men in the screening arm were regarded as nonattenders until the first screening attendance; they then remained in the once-screened group until the second screen and similarly for the possible third round.The control arm formed the reference group.Follow-up started at randomization and ended at the time of diagnosis of PC, emigration, or the end of 2015.PC cases were divided into risk groups according to European Association of Urology definitions.RESULTS: The incidence of low-risk PC increased with the number of screens, whereas no clear relation with participation was noted in the intermediate-risk and high-risk cases.For patients with advanced PC, attending screening at least twice was associated with a lower risk.CONCLUSIONS: Screening reduces the risk of advanced PC after only 2 screening cycles.A single screen demonstrated no benefit in terms of PC incidence.Repeated screening is necessary to achieve screening advantages.",0,0,0,0
33051340,"Pembrolizumab with or without radiation therapy for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer: a randomized phase I/II trial.BACKGROUND: In this phase I/II trial, we evaluated the safety and effectiveness of pembrolizumab, with or without concurrent radiotherapy (RT), for lung and liver lesions from metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (mNSCLC).METHODS: Patients with lung or liver lesions amenable to RT plus at least one additional non-contiguous lesion were included regardless of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) status.Pembrolizumab was given at 200 mg every 3 weeks for up to 32 cycles with or without concurrent RT.Metastatic lesions were treated with stereotactic body RT (SBRT; 50 Gy in 4 fractions) if clinically feasible or with traditionally fractionated RT (45 Gy in 15 fractions) if not.The primary end point was the best out-of-field lesion response, and a key secondary end point was progression-free survival (PFS).RESULTS: The median follow-up time was 20.4 months.One hundred patients (20 phase I, 80 phase II) were evaluable for toxicity, and 72 phase II patients were evaluable for treatment response.No patients in the phase I group experienced grade 4-5 events; in the phase II group, two had grade 4 events and nine had grade 3 events.The ORR in the combined-modality cohort (irrespective of RT schema) was 22%, vs 25% in the pembrolizumab group (irrespective of receipt of salvage RT) (p=0.99).In the concurrent pembrolizumab+RT groups, the out-of-field ORRs were 38% in the pembrolizumab+SBRT group and 10% in the pembrolizumab+traditional RT group.When examining the pembrolizumab-alone patients, the out-of-field ORRs were 33% in those designated to receive salvage SBRT (if required) and 17% for salvage traditional RT.In all patients, the median PFS for pembrolizumab alone was 5.1 months (95% CI 3.4 to 12.7 months), and pembrolizumab/RT (regardless of schema) was 9.1 months (95% CI 3.6 to 18.4 months) (p=0.52).An exploratory analysis revealed that for patients with low PD-L1 expression, the median PFS was 4.6 vs 20.8 months for pembrolizumab with and without RT, respectively (p=0.004).CONCLUSIONS: Concurrent immunoradiotherapy for mNSCLC is safe, although larger trials are required to address which patients benefit most from RT.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT02444741.",1,1,1,1
33052757,"ARTSCAN III: A Randomized Phase III Study Comparing Chemoradiotherapy With Cisplatin Versus Cetuximab in Patients With Locoregionally Advanced Head and Neck Squamous Cell Cancer.PURPOSE: We performed an open-label randomized controlled phase III study comparing treatment outcome and toxicity between radiotherapy (RT) with concomitant cisplatin versus concomitant cetuximab in patients with locoregionally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC; stage III-IV according to the Union for International Cancer Control TNM classification, 7th edition).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eligible patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive either intravenous cetuximab 400 mg/m(2) 1 week before start of RT followed by 250 mg/m(2)/wk, or weekly intravenous cisplatin 40 mg/m(2), during RT.RT was conventionally fractionated.Patients with T3-T4 tumors underwent a second random assignment 1:1 between standard RT dose 68.0 Gy to the primary tumor or dose escalation to 73.1 Gy.Primary end point was overall survival (OS) evaluated using adjusted Cox regression analysis.Secondary end points were locoregional control, local control with dose-escalated RT, pattern of failure, and adverse effects.RESULTS: Study inclusion was prematurely closed after an unplanned interim analysis when 298 patients had been randomly assigned.At 3 years, OS was 88% (95% CI, 83% to 94%) and 78% (95% CI, 71% to 85%) in the cisplatin and cetuximab groups, respectively (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.63; 95% CI, 0.93 to 2.86; P = .086).The cumulative incidence of locoregional failures at 3 years was 23% (95% CI, 16% to 31%) compared with 9% (95% CI, 4% to 14%) in the cetuximab versus the cisplatin group (Gray's test P = .0036).The cumulative incidence of distant failures did not differ between the treatment groups.Dose escalation in T3-T4 tumors did not increase local control.CONCLUSION: Cetuximab is inferior to cisplatin regarding locoregional control for concomitant treatment with RT in patients with locoregionally advanced HNSCC.Additional studies are needed to identify possible subgroups that still may benefit from concomitant cetuximab treatment.",0,0,0,0
33057696,"Effect of Integrating Machine Learning Mortality Estimates With Behavioral Nudges to Clinicians on Serious Illness Conversations Among Patients With Cancer: A Stepped-Wedge Cluster Randomized Clinical Trial.Importance: Serious illness conversations (SICs) are structured conversations between clinicians and patients about prognosis, treatment goals, and end-of-life preferences.Interventions that increase the rate of SICs between oncology clinicians and patients may improve goal-concordant care and patient outcomes.Objective: To determine the effect of a clinician-directed intervention integrating machine learning mortality predictions with behavioral nudges on motivating clinician-patient SICs.Design, Setting, and Participants: This stepped-wedge cluster randomized clinical trial was conducted across 20 weeks (from June 17 to November 1, 2019) at 9 medical oncology clinics (8 subspecialty oncology and 1 general oncology clinics) within a large academic health system in Pennsylvania.Clinicians at the 2 smallest subspecialty clinics were grouped together, resulting in 8 clinic groups randomly assigned to the 4 intervention wedge periods.Included participants in the intention-to-treat analyses were 78 oncology clinicians who received SIC training and their patients (N = 14607) who had an outpatient oncology encounter during the study period.Interventions: (1) Weekly emails to oncology clinicians with SIC performance feedback and peer comparisons; (2) a list of up to 6 high-risk patients (>/=10% predicted risk of 180-day mortality) scheduled for the next week, estimated using a validated machine learning algorithm; and (3) opt-out text message prompts to clinicians on the patient's appointment day to consider an SIC.Clinicians in the control group received usual care consisting of weekly emails with cumulative SIC performance.Main Outcomes and Measures: Percentage of patient encounters with an SIC in the intervention group vs the usual care (control) group.Results: The sample consisted of 78 clinicians and 14607 patients.The mean (SD) age of patients was 61.9 (14.2) years, 53.7% were female, and 70.4% were White.For all encounters, SICs were conducted among 1.3% in the control group and 4.6% in the intervention group, a significant difference (adjusted difference in percentage points, 3.3; 95% CI, 2.3-4.5; P < .001).Among 4124 high-risk patient encounters, SICs were conducted among 3.6% in the control group and 15.2% in the intervention group, a significant difference (adjusted difference in percentage points, 11.6; 95% CI, 8.2-12.5; P < .001).Conclusions and Relevance: In this stepped-wedge cluster randomized clinical trial, an intervention that delivered machine learning mortality predictions with behavioral nudges to oncology clinicians significantly increased the rate of SICs among all patients and among patients with high mortality risk who were targeted by the intervention.Behavioral nudges combined with machine learning mortality predictions can positively influence clinician behavior and may be applied more broadly to improve care near the end of life.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03984773.",0,0,0,0
33069888,"Long-Term Overall Survival From KEYNOTE-021 Cohort G: Pemetrexed and Carboplatin With or Without Pembrolizumab as First-Line Therapy for Advanced Nonsquamous NSCLC.INTRODUCTION: In cohort G of KEYNOTE-021 (NCT02039674), first-line pembrolizumab plus pemetrexed-carboplatin significantly improved the objective response rate and progression-free survival versus chemotherapy alone with manageable toxicity in advanced nonsquamous NSCLC.We report the long-term outcomes from this study.METHODS: Patients with previously untreated advanced nonsquamous NSCLC without sensitizing EGFR or ALK alterations were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive open-label pemetrexed 500 mg/m(2) plus carboplatin at area under the concentration-time curve of 5 mg/mL/min (four cycles) with or without pembrolizumab 200 mg (up to 2 years), with optional pemetrexed maintenance, each administered every 3 weeks.Eligible patients could crossover from the chemotherapy arm to pembrolizumab monotherapy after progression.Responses were assessed per the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1.RESULTS: After the median time of 49.4 months from randomization to data cutoff, objective response rate (58% versus 33%) and progression-free survival (median: 24.5 versus 9.9 mo; hazard ratio: 0.54; 95% confidence interval: 0.350.83) remained improved with pembrolizumab combination (n = 60) versus chemotherapy (n = 63), regardless of programmed death ligand 1 status.Median overall survival was 34.5 versus 21.1 months (hazard ratio: 0.71; 95% confidence interval: 0.451.12), despite a 70% crossover rate from chemotherapy alone to antiprogrammed death (ligand) 1 therapy.Among the 12 patients who completed 2 years of pembrolizumab, 92% were alive at data cutoff; the estimated 3-year duration of response rate was 100%.Grade 3 to 5 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 39% of patients receiving pembrolizumab combination and 31% receiving chemotherapy.CONCLUSIONS: First-line pembrolizumab plus pemetrexed-carboplatin continued to show improved response and survival versus chemotherapy alone in advanced nonsquamous NSCLC, with durable clinical benefit in patients who completed 2 years of therapy.No new safety signals were observed with longer follow-up.",0,0,0,0
33079393,"Health-related quality of life outcomes for the LEAP study-CALGB 70305 (Alliance): A lymphedema prevention intervention trial for newly diagnosed breast cancer patients.BACKGROUND: Lymphedema is an adverse effect of breast cancer treatment that causes swelling and pain in the arm and hand.We tested 2 lymphedema prevention interventions and their impact on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in a group-randomized trial at 38 cooperative group sites within the United States.METHODS: Patients were recruited before breast surgery.Sites were randomly assigned to education-only (EO) lymphedema prevention or education plus exercise and physical therapy (LEAP).Lymphedema was defined as a >/=10% difference in arm volume at any time from baseline to 18 months postsurgery.HRQOL was assessed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast plus 4 lymphedema items (FACT-B+4).Longitudinal mixed model regression analysis, adjusting for key demographic and clinical variables, examined participants' HRQOL by intervention group and lymphedema status.RESULTS: A total of 547 patients (56% LEAP) were enrolled and completed HRQOL assessments.The results revealed no differences between the interventions in preventing lymphedema (P = .37) or HRQOL (FACT-B+4 total score; P = .8777).At 18 months, the presence of lymphedema was associated with HRQOL at borderline significance (P = .0825).However, African American patients reported greater lymphedema symptoms (P = .0002) and better emotional functioning (P = .0335) than patients of other races or ethnicities.Lower HRQOL during the intervention was associated with younger age (P </= .0001), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status >0 (P = .0002), >/=1 positive lymph nodes (P = .0009), having no education beyond high school (P < .0001), having undergone chemotherapy (P = .0242), and having had only axillary node dissection or sentinel node biopsy versus both (P = .0007).CONCLUSION: The tested interventions did not differ in preventing lymphedema or in HRQOL outcomes.African American women reported greater HRQOL impacts due to lymphedema symptoms than women of other races or ethnicities.",0,0,0,0
33079411,"A randomized study to prevent lymphedema in women treated for breast cancer: CALGB 70305 (Alliance).BACKGROUND: Lymphedema affects many women who are treated for breast cancer.We examined the effectiveness of an education-only (EO) versus education plus sleeve compression/exercise intervention (lymphedema education and prevention [LEAP]) on lymphedema incidence and range of motion (ROM) in a group-randomized trial across 38 cooperative group sites.METHODS: The treating institution was randomly assigned to either EO or LEAP by a study statistician.All patients at a treating institution participated in the same intervention (EO or LEAP) to minimize contamination bias.Participants completed surveys, arm volume measurements, and self-reported ROM assessments before surgery and at 12 and 18 months after surgery.Lymphedema was defined as a >/=10% difference in limb volume at any time post-surgery up to 18 months after surgery or diagnosis by a health provider.Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests were used to compare lymphedema-free rates between groups, stratified by lymph node surgery type.Self-reported ROM differences were compared between groups.RESULTS: A total of 554 participants (56% LEAP) were included in the analyses.At 18 months, lymphedema-free rates were 58% (EO) versus 55% (LEAP) (P = .37).ROM for both arms was greater in LEAP versus EO at 12 months; by 18 months, most women reported full ROM, regardless of group.In LEAP, only one-third wore a sleeve >/=75% of the time; 50% performed lymphedema exercises at least weekly.CONCLUSION: Lymphedema incidence did not differ by intervention group at 18 months.Poor adherence in the LEAP group may have contributed.However, physical therapy may speed recovery of ROM.Further research is needed to effectively reduce the incidence and severity of lymphedema in patients who have breast cancer.",0,0,0,0
33082202,"Assessing 10-Year Safety of a Single Negative HPV Test for Cervical Cancer Screening: Evidence from FOCAL-DECADE Cohort.BACKGROUND: Long-term safety of a single negative human papillomavirus (HPV) test for cervical cancer screening is unclear.The HPV FOr cerviCAL Cancer Trial (FOCAL) was a randomized trial comparing HPV testing with cytology.The FOCAL-DECADE cohort tracked women who received one HPV test during FOCAL, and were HPV negative, for up to 10 years to identify cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CIN2+) and grade 3 or worse (CIN3+) detected through a provincial screening program.METHODS: FOCAL participants who received one HPV test, were negative, and had at least one post-FOCAL cervix screen were included (N = 5,537).We constructed cumulative incidence curves of CIN2+/CIN3+ detection, analyzed cumulative risk of detection at intervals post-HPV test, calculated average incidence rates for detection, and compared hazard across ages.RESULTS: Ten years after one negative HPV test, the probability of CIN2+ detection was lower than 1%, with most lesions detected 7 years or later.Average incidence rates of CIN2+/CIN3+ lesions over follow-up were 0.50 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.31-0.78] and 0.18 (95% CI, 0.07-0.36) per 1,000 person-years, respectively.Hazards were higher for younger ages (nonsignificant trend).CONCLUSIONS: Among women with a single negative HPV test, long-term risk of CIN2+ detection was low, particularly through 7 years of follow-up; thus, one negative HPV test appears to confer long-term protection from precancerous lesions.Even 10-year risk is sufficiently low to support extended testing intervals in average-risk populations.IMPACT: Our findings support the safety of screening policies using HPV testing alone at 5-year or longer intervals.",0,0,0,0
33105418,"Assessment of High Flow Nasal Cannula Oxygenation in Endobronchial Ultrasound Bronchoscopy: A Randomized Controlled Trial.BACKGROUND: Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) has been widely implemented in evaluating mediastinal disease.EBUS-TBNA is performed with low flow oxygen systems or general anesthesia.Little data exist on use of high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) in EBUS-TBNA.METHODS: This was a single center parallel group randomized controlled trial comparing oxygenation through HFNC (Optiflow) against nasal prongs during EBUS.The primary end-point was the drop in oxygen saturations from procedure commencement, recorded by pulse oximetry, to the lowest level during EBUS-TBNA.Secondary end-points included changes in venous blood carbon dioxide, lowest oxygen saturation, changes in end-tidal CO2 during the procedure, intubation within 8 hours of the procedure and patient experience reported on a visual analog scale.RESULTS: We randomized 20 patients to each study arm.The primary outcome of oxygen desaturation during the procedure was statistically significant with a difference of 7.7 percentage points (95% confidence interval, 4.91-10.49, P<0.001).The secondary outcome measure of lowest oxygen saturation was also statistically significant with a difference of -9.2 (95% confidence interval, -11.96 to -6.44, P<0.001).There was no difference in safety outcomes, visual analog scale score or in their willingness to return for repeat procedure.CONCLUSION: This single institution study in a university, tertiary referral center confirms that EBUS-TBNA performed with HFNC is associated with a statistically significant lower drop in oxygen saturation.Additional studies are needed to assess if this translates into improved clinical outcomes postprocedure.",0,0,0,0
33112273,"Conventional thyroidectomy vs thyroid thermal ablation on postoperative quality of life and satisfaction for patients with benign thyroid nodules.Objective: The complications and treatment effects of conventional thyroidectomy and thyroid thermal ablation should be compared in order to identify the best intervention for patients with benign thyroid nodules.Methods: Patients (18-50 years old) who had benign thyroid nodules and were eligible for both thyroidectomy and thyroid thermal ablation were randomly allocated (1:1) to either conventional thyroidectomy group or thyroid thermal ablation group.Patients' satisfaction and condition-specific quality of life were measured with the Thyroid-Specific Quality-of-Life Questionnaire Scale (QoL) at the 15th post-randomization month and were set as the co-primary outcome.Results: A total of 450 patients were enrolled and randomized (225 patients in each group).At the 15th month after randomization, more patients in the thyroid thermal ablation group were satisfied with the treatment effects compared to those in the conventional thyroidectomy group.More patients in the thyroid thermal ablation group have a QoL score of 410 (QOL scores ranges from 0 to 410) than patients in conventional thyroidectomy.Eight (4%) of the 209 patients in conventional thyroidectomy group and 6 (3%) of the 208 patients in thyroid thermal ablation group had at least one severe postoperative complication.The time to achieve volume reduction was longer in the thermal ablation group.Conclusion: Thyroid thermal ablation is superior to conventional thyroidectomy in terms of patients satisfaction, post-operative quality of life, and shorter hospital stay but takes longer to achieve BTNs volume reduction.The complication rates between the two groups were similar.",0,0,0,0
33119142,"Decision support for men with prostate cancer: Concordance between treatment choice and tumor risk.BACKGROUND: Decision support tools improve decisional conflict and elicit patient preferences related to prostate cancer treatment.It was hypothesized that men using the Personal Patient Profile-Prostate (P3P) would be more likely to pursue guideline-concordant treatment.METHODS: Men from a trial assessing the P3P decision support intervention were identified.The primary exposure was allocation to P3P (vs usual care), and the outcome was appropriate treatment per guidelines (eg, low risk = active surveillance).It was assessed whether providers recommended against any treatment options (ie, restricted).A multivariable model was fit for men with low-risk cancer that estimated the odds of the outcome of interest.RESULTS: This study identified 295 men in the cohort: 113 (38%) had low-risk disease, 119 (40%) had favorable intermediate-risk disease, and 63 (21%) had unfavorable intermediate-risk disease.Among low-risk patients, more men pursued active surveillance after using P3P whether they were given unrestricted (62% vs 54% with usual care; P = .54) or restricted options (71% vs 59% with usual care; P = .34).After adjustments, only Black race (odds ratio [OR], 0.31; 95% CI, 0.11-0.89) and restricted options (OR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.08-0.65) had an inverse association with the receipt of surveillance for patients with low-risk prostate cancer.An impact associated with P3P versus usual care (OR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.36-2.20) was not observed.CONCLUSIONS: Among men in a trial assessing a decision support tool, Black race and restricted treatment options were associated with less use of active surveillance for low-risk prostate cancer.Although the P3P instrument ameliorates decisional conflict, its use was not associated with more appropriate alignment of treatment with disease risk.",0,0,0,0
33128132,"Use of an anti-reflux catheter to improve tumor targeting for holmium-166 radioembolization-a prospective, within-patient randomized study.PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to investigate whether the use of an anti-reflux catheter improves tumor targeting for colorectal cancer patients with unresectable, chemorefractory liver metastases (mCRC) treated with holmium-166 ((166)Ho)-radioembolization.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this perspective, within-patient randomized study, left and right hepatic perfusion territories were randomized between infusion with a Surefire(R) anti-reflux catheter or a standard microcatheter.The primary outcome was the difference in tumor to non-tumor (T/N) activity distribution.Secondary outcomes included the difference in infusion efficiency, absorbed doses, predictive value of (166)Ho-scout, dose-response relation, and survival.RESULTS: Twenty-one patients were treated in this study (the intended number of patients was 25).The median T/N activity concentration ratio with the use of the anti-reflux catheter was 3.2 (range 0.9-8.7) versus 3.6 (range 0.8-13.3) with a standard microcatheter.There was no difference in infusion efficiency (0.04% vs. 0.03% residual activity for the standard microcatheter and anti-reflux catheter, respectively) (95%CI - 0.05-0.03).No influence of the anti-reflux catheter on the dose-response rate was found.Median overall survival was 7.8 months (95%CI 6-13).CONCLUSION: Using a Surefire(R) anti-reflux catheter did not result in a higher T/N activity concentration ratio in mCRC patients treated with (166)Ho-radioembolization, nor did it result in improved secondary outcomes measures.TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT02208804.",0,0,0,0

33170506,"What matters most: Randomized controlled trial of breast cancer surgery conversation aids across socioeconomic strata.BACKGROUND: Women of lower socioeconomic status (SES) with early-stage breast cancer are more likely to report poorer physician-patient communication, lower satisfaction with surgery, lower involvement in decision making, and higher decision regret compared to women of higher SES.The objective of this study was to understand how to support women across socioeconomic strata in making breast cancer surgery choices.METHODS: We conducted a 3-arm (Option Grid, Picture Option Grid, and usual care), multisite, randomized controlled superiority trial with surgeon-level randomization.The Option Grid (text only) and Picture Option Grid (pictures plus text) conversation aids were evidence-based summaries of available breast cancer surgery options on paper.Decision quality (primary outcome), treatment choice, treatment intention, shared decision making (SDM), anxiety, quality of life, decision regret, and coordination of care were measured from T0 (pre-consultation) to T5 (1-year after surgery.RESULTS: Sixteen surgeons saw 571 of 622 consented patients.Patients in the Picture Option Grid arm (n = 248) had higher knowledge (immediately after the visit [T2] and 1 week after surgery or within 2 weeks of the first postoperative visit [T3]), an improved decision process (T2 and T3), lower decision regret (T3), and more SDM (observed and self-reported) compared to usual care (n = 257).Patients in the Option Grid arm (n = 66) had higher decision process scores (T2 and T3), better coordination of care (12 weeks after surgery or within 2 weeks of the second postoperative visit [T4]), and more observed SDM (during the surgical visit [T1]) compared to usual care arm.Subgroup analyses suggested that the Picture Option Grid had more impact among women of lower SES and health literacy.Neither intervention affected concordance, treatment choice, or anxiety.CONCLUSIONS: Paper-based conversation aids improved key outcomes over usual care.The Picture Option Grid had more impact among disadvantaged patients.LAY SUMMARY: The objective of this study was to understand how to help women with lower incomes or less formal education to make breast cancer surgery choices.Compared with usual care, a conversation aid with pictures and text led to higher knowledge.It improved the decision process and shared decision making (SDM) and lowered decision regret.A text-only conversation aid led to an improved decision process, more coordinated care, and higher SDM compared to usual care.The conversation aid with pictures was more helpful for women with lower income or less formal education.Conversation aids with pictures and text helped women make better breast cancer surgery choices.",0,0,0,0
33186365,"Advance care planning in patients with advanced cancer: A 6-country, cluster-randomised clinical trial.BACKGROUND: Advance care planning (ACP) supports individuals to define, discuss, and record goals and preferences for future medical treatment and care.Despite being internationally recommended, randomised clinical trials of ACP in patients with advanced cancer are scarce.METHODS AND FINDINGS: To test the implementation of ACP in patients with advanced cancer, we conducted a cluster-randomised trial in 23 hospitals across Belgium, Denmark, Italy, Netherlands, Slovenia, and United Kingdom in 2015-2018.Patients with advanced lung (stage III/IV) or colorectal (stage IV) cancer, WHO performance status 0-3, and at least 3 months life expectancy were eligible.The ACTION Respecting Choices ACP intervention as offered to patients in the intervention arm included scripted ACP conversations between patients, family members, and certified facilitators; standardised leaflets; and standardised advance directives.Control patients received care as usual.Main outcome measures were quality of life (operationalised as European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer [EORTC] emotional functioning) and symptoms.Secondary outcomes were coping, patient satisfaction, shared decision-making, patient involvement in decision-making, inclusion of advance directives (ADs) in hospital files, and use of hospital care.In all, 1,117 patients were included (442 intervention; 675 control), and 809 (72%) completed the 12-week questionnaire.Patients' age ranged from 18 to 91 years, with a mean of 66; 39% were female.The mean number of ACP conversations per patient was 1.3.Fidelity was 86%.Sixteen percent of patients found ACP conversations distressing.Mean change in patients' quality of life did not differ between intervention and control groups (T-score -1.8 versus -0.8, p = 0.59), nor did changes in symptoms, coping, patient satisfaction, and shared decision-making.Specialist palliative care (37% versus 27%, p = 0.002) and AD inclusion in hospital files (10% versus 3%, p < 0.001) were more likely in the intervention group.A key limitation of the study is that recruitment rates were lower in intervention than in control hospitals.CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that quality of life effects were not different between patients who had ACP conversations and those who received usual care.The increased use of specialist palliative care and AD inclusion in hospital files of intervention patients is meaningful and requires further study.Our findings suggest that alternative approaches to support patient-centred end-of-life care in this population are needed.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN registry ISRCTN63110516.",0,0,0,0

33212557,"[Effect of open-lung ventilation strategy on oxygenation-impairment during laparoscopic colorectal cancer resection].Objective: After general anesthesia and mechanical ventilation for laparoscopic colorectal cancer resection, about 90% of patients would have different degrees of atelectasis.Authors speculated that an open-lung strategy (OLS) comprising moderate positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and intermittent recruitment maneuvers (RM) can reduce atelectrauma and thus reduce the incidence of oxygenation-impairment during low-tidal-volume ventilation for laparoscopic colorectal cancer resection.The purpose of this study was to verify this hypothesis and provide a better intraoperative ventilation scheme for laparoscopic colorectal cancer resection.Methods: This was a prospectively randomized controlled clinical trial which was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Sixth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University (2017ZSLYEC-002), and registered at the ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03160144).From January to July 2017, patients who underwent laparoscopic colorectal cancer resection, with age > 40 years, estimated pneumoperitoneum time >/= 1.5 h, pulse oxygen saturation >/= 92%, and risk grade for postoperative pulmonary complications >/= 2 were prospectively enrolled.The patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status >/= IV, body mass index >/= 30 kg/m(2), pneumonia, acute respiratory failure or sepsis within 1 month, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary bullae and progressive neuromuscular diseases, and those participating in other interventional clinical trials were excluded.The enrolled patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to the OLS group (with a PEEP of 6-8 cm H(2)O and intermittent RM), and the NOLS group (without using PEEP and RM).Partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO(2)) /fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO(2)) and shunt fraction (Q(S)/Q(T)) were calculated via arterial and central venous blood gas analysis performed at 0.5 h (T(1)), 1.5 h (T(2)) after pneumoperitoneum induction and at 20 min after admission to the recovery room.Driving pressure immediately before pneumoperitoneum induction (T(0)) and at T(2) were calculated via monitoring data.The primary outcome was oxygenation-impairment (PaO(2)/FiO(2) </= 300 mmHg) during mechanical ventilation.Results: In each group, 48 patients under general anesthesia and low-tidal-volume ventilation were included in the final analysis.During ventilation, the oxygenation-impairment occurred in 7 patients (14.6%) of OLS group and in 17 patients (35.4%) of NOLS group, whose difference was statistically significant between two groups (chi(2)=5.556, RR=0.31, 95%CI: 0.12 to 0.84, P=0.033).During ventilation, the patients in the OLS group had higher PaO(2)/FiO(2) [T(1): (427+/-103) mmHg vs. (366+/-109) mmHg, t=-2.826, P=0.006; T(2): (453+/-103) mmHg vs. (388+/-122) mmHg, t=-2.739, P=0.007], lower Q(S)/Q(T) [ T(1): (9.2+/-6.5) % vs. (12.6+/-7.7) %, t=2.322, P=0.022; T(2): (7.0+/-5.8)% vs.(10.9+/-9.2)%, t=2.408, P=0.019], and lower driving pressure [T(0): (6+/-3) cm H(2)O vs. (10+/-2) cm H(2)O, t=7.421, P<0.001; T(2): (13+/-3) cm H(2)O vs. (17+/-4) cm H(2)O, t=5.417, P<0.001] than those in the NOLS group, with stratistical differences in all comparisons.In recovery room, though PaO(2)/FiO(2) [(70.3+/-9.4) mmHg vs. (66.8+/-9.4) mmHg, P=0.082] was still higher and Q(S)/Q(T) [(18.6+/-8.3)% vs. (21.8+/-8.4)%, P=0.070] was still lower in the OLS group as compared to the NOLS group, the differences were not statistically significant (both P>0.05).Conclusion: The application of such an OLS during low-tidal-volume ventilation can greatly reduce the incidence of oxygenation-impairment in laparoscopic colorectal cancer resection, and such effect may last to the period of emergence from anesthesia.",0,0,0,0

33271093,"Efficacy of the bivalent HPV vaccine against HPV 16/18-associated precancer: long-term follow-up results from the Costa Rica Vaccine Trial.BACKGROUND: Oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) infections cause most cases of cervical cancer.Here, we report long-term follow-up results for the Costa Rica Vaccine Trial (publicly funded and initiated before licensure of the HPV vaccines), with the aim of assessing the efficacy of the bivalent HPV vaccine for preventing HPV 16/18-associated cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CIN2+).METHODS: Women aged 18-25 years were enrolled in a randomised, double-blind, controlled trial in Costa Rica, between June 28, 2004, and Dec 21, 2005, designed to assess the efficacy of a bivalent vaccine for the prevention of infection with HPV 16/18 and associated precancerous lesions at the cervix.Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive an HPV 16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine or control hepatitis A vaccine.Vaccines were administered intramuscularly in three 0.5 mL doses at 0, 1, and 6 months and participants were followed up annually for 4 years.After the blinded phase, women in the HPV vaccine group were invited to enrol in the long-term follow-up study, which extended follow-up for 7 additional years.The control group received HPV vaccine and was replaced with a new unvaccinated control group.Women were followed up every 2 years until year 11.Investigators and patients were aware of treatment allocation for the follow-up phase.At each visit, clinicians collected cervical cells from sexually active women for cytology and HPV testing.Women with abnormal cytology were referred to colposcopy, biopsy, and treatment as needed.Women with negative results at the last screening visit (year 11) exited the long-term follow-up study.The analytical cohort for vaccine efficacy included women who were HPV 16/18 DNA-negative at vaccination.The primary outcome of this analysis was defined as histopathologically confirmed CIN2+ or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 or worse associated with HPV 16/18 cervical infection detected at colposcopy referral.We calculated vaccine efficacy by year and cumulatively.This long-term follow-up study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00867464.FINDINGS: 7466 women were enrolled in the Costa Rica Vaccine Trial; 3727 received the HPV vaccine and 3739 received the control vaccine.Between March 30, 2009, and July 5, 2012, 2635 women in the HPV vaccine group and 2836 women in the new unvaccinated control group were enrolled in the long-term follow-up study.2635 women in the HPV vaccine group and 2677 women in the control group were included in the analysis cohort for years 0-4, and 2073 women from the HPV vaccine group and 2530 women from the new unvaccinated control group were included in the analysis cohort for years 7-11.Median follow-up time for the HPV group was 11.1 years (IQR 9.1-11.7), 4.6 years (4.3-5.3) for the original control group, and 6.2 years (5.5-6.9) for the new unvaccinated control group.At year 11, vaccine efficacy against incident HPV 16/18-associated CIN2+ was 100% (95% CI 89.2-100.0); 34 (1.5%) of 2233 unvaccinated women had a CIN2+ outcome compared with none of 1913 women in the HPV group.Cumulative vaccine efficacy against HPV 16/18-associated CIN2+ over the 11-year period was 97.4% (95% CI 88.0-99.6).Similar protection was observed against HPV 16/18-associated CIN3-specifically at year 11, vaccine efficacy was 100% (95% CI 78.8-100.0) and cumulative vaccine efficacy was 94.9% (73.7-99.4).During the long-term follow-up, no serious adverse events occurred that were deemed related to the HPV vaccine.The most common grade 3 or worse serious adverse events were pregnancy, puerperium, and perinatal conditions (in 255 [10%] of 2530 women in the unvaccinated control group and 201 [10%] of 2073 women in the HPV vaccine group).Four women in the unvaccinated control group and three in the HPV vaccine group died; no deaths were deemed to be related to the HPV vaccine.INTERPRETATION: The bivalent HPV vaccine has high efficacy against HPV 16/18-associated precancer for more than a decade after initial vaccination, supporting the notion that invasive cervical cancer is preventable.FUNDING: US National Cancer Institute.",0,0,0,0
33289280,"High-Flow Nasal Cannula Therapy for Exertional Dyspnea in Patients with Cancer: A Pilot Randomized Clinical Trial.BACKGROUND: Exertional dyspnea is common in patients with cancer and limits their function.The impact of high-flow nasal cannula on exertional dyspnea in nonhypoxemic patients is unclear.In this double-blind, parallel-group, randomized trial, we assessed the effect of flow rate (high vs. low) and gas (oxygen vs. air) on exertional dyspnea in nonhypoxemic patients with cancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with cancer with oxygen saturation >90% at rest and exertion completed incremental and constant work (80% maximal) cycle ergometry while breathing low-flow air at 2 L/minute.They were then randomized to receive high-flow oxygen, high-flow air, low-flow oxygen, or low-flow air while performing symptom-limited endurance cycle ergometry at 80% maximal.The primary outcome was modified 0-10 Borg dyspnea intensity scale at isotime.Secondary outcomes included dyspnea unpleasantness, exercise time, and adverse events.RESULTS: Seventy-four patients were enrolled, and 44 completed the study (mean age 63; 41% female).Compared with low-flow air at baseline, dyspnea intensity was significantly lower at isotime with high-flow oxygen (mean change, -1.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], -2.1, -0.12) and low-flow oxygen (-1.83; 95% CI, -2.7, -0.9), but not high-flow air (-0.2; 95% CI, -0.97, 0.6) or low-flow air (-0.5; 95% CI, -1.3, 0.4).Compared with low-flow air, high-flow oxygen also resulted in significantly longer exercise time (difference + 2.5 minutes, p = .009), but not low-flow oxygen (+0.39 minutes, p = .65) or high-flow air (+0.63 minutes, p = .48).The interventions were well tolerated without significant adverse effects.CONCLUSION: Our preliminary findings support that high-flow oxygen improved both exertional dyspnea and exercise duration in nonhypoxemic patients with cancer.(ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02357134).IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: In this four-arm, double-blind, randomized clinical trial examining the role of high-flow nasal cannula on exertional dyspnea in patients with cancer without hypoxemia, high-flow oxygen, but not high-flow air, resulted in significantly lower dyspnea scores and longer exercise time.High-flow oxygen delivered by high-flow nasal cannula devices may improve clinically relevant outcomes even in patients without hypoxemia.",0,0,0,0

33295007,"Apalutamide for metastatic, castration-sensitive prostate cancer in the Japanese population: A subgroup analysis of the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 TITAN study.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of apalutamide + androgen deprivation therapy versus androgen deprivation therapy alone in Japanese patients with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer from the phase 3, randomized, global TITAN study.METHODS: Men with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer randomly (1:1) received 240 mg apalutamide + androgen deprivation therapy or matching placebo + androgen deprivation therapy.The primary efficacy endpoints were radiographic progression-free survival and overall survival.Secondary efficacy endpoints were time to cytotoxic chemotherapy, pain progression, chronic opioid use, and skeletal-related events.Safety was also assessed.RESULTS: Of the 1052 patients included in the TITAN study, 51 (4.85%) were Japanese (apalutamide group, n = 28; placebo group, n = 23).In all, 81.8% of patients in the apalutamide and 71.8% in the placebo group did not experience radiographic progression or death, and the hazard ratio for radiographic progression-free survival favored treatment with apalutamide (hazard ratio 0.712, 95% confidence interval 0.205-2.466; P = 0.59).At 24 months, 85.7% of patients in the apalutamide group and 81.5% in the placebo group were alive, and the hazard ratio for overall survival favored apalutamide (hazard ratio 0.840, 95% confidence interval 0.210-3.361; P = 0.805).In the interim analysis, the median radiographic progression-free survival and overall survival were not reached in the apalutamide group and time to cytotoxic chemotherapy was delayed following apalutamide treatment.The safety profile of apalutamide in the Japanese subpopulation was comparable with that of the global population, except for skin rash.CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present analyses suggest that apalutamide + androgen deprivation therapy in Japanese patients had favorable efficacy compared with androgen deprivation therapy alone, and these findings are comparable to those in the overall population.Apalutamide + androgen deprivation therapy can be considered as one of the therapeutic options for a broad spectrum of metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer regardless of prior treatment and disease extent in Japanese patients.",1,1,1,0
33306240,"Machine-learning radiomics to predict early recurrence in perihilar cholangiocarcinoma after curative resection.BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Up to 40%-65% of patients with perihilar cholangiocarcinoma (PHC) rapidly progress to early recurrence (ER) even after curative resection.Quantification of ER risk is difficult and a reliable prognostic prediction tool is absent.We developed and validated a multilevel model, integrating clinicopathology, molecular pathology and radiology, especially radiomics coupled with machine-learning algorithms, to predict the ER of patients after curative resection in PHC.METHODS: In total, 274 patients who underwent contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) and curative resection at 2 institutions were retrospectively identified and randomly divided into training (n = 167), internal validation (n = 70) and external validation (n = 37) sets.A machine-learning analysis of 18,120 radiomic features based on multiphase CECT and 48 clinico-radiologic characteristics was performed for the multilevel model.RESULTS: Comprehensively, 7 independent factors (tumour differentiation, lymph node metastasis, pre-operative CA19-9 level, enhancement pattern, A-Shrink score, V-Shrink score and P-Shrink score) were built to the multilevel model and quantified the risk of ER.We benchmarked the gain in discrimination with the area under the curve (AUC) of 0.883, superior to the rival clinical and radiomic models (AUCs 0.792-0.805).The accuracy (ACC) of the multilevel model was 0.826, which was significantly higher than those of the conventional staging systems (AJCC 8th (0.641), MSKCC (0.617) and Gazzaniga (0.581)).CONCLUSION: The radiomics-based multilevel model demonstrated superior performance to rival models and conventional staging systems, and could serve as a visual prognostic tool to plan surveillance of ER and guide post-operative individualized management in PHC.",0,0,0,0
33307192,"Esophagectomy With Three-Field Versus Two-Field Lymphadenectomy for Middle and Lower Thoracic Esophageal Cancer: Long-Term Outcomes of a Randomized Clinical Trial.INTRODUCTION: The optimal extent of lymphadenectomy during esophagectomy remains unclear.In this trial, we aim to clarify whether three-field (cervical-thoracic-abdominal) lymphadenectomy improved patient survival over two-field (thoracic-abdominal) lymphadenectomy for esophageal cancer.METHODS: Between March 2013 and November 2016, a total of 400 patients with middle and lower thoracic esophageal cancer were included and randomly assigned to undergo esophagectomy with either three- or two-field lymphadenectomy at a 1:1 ratio.Analyses were done according to the intention-to-treat principle.The primary end point was overall survival (OS), calculated from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause.RESULTS: Demographic characteristics were similar in the two arms.The median follow-up time was 55 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 52-58).OS (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.019, 95% CI: 0.727-1.428, p = 0.912) and the disease-free survival (DFS) (HR = 0.868, 95% CI: 0.636-1.184, p = 0.371) were comparable between the two arms.The cumulative 5-year OS was 63% in the three-field arm, as compared with 63% in the two-field arm; 5-year DFS was 59% and 53%, respectively.On the basis of whether the patients had mediastinal or abdominal lymph node metastasis or not, OS was also comparable between the two arms.In this cohort, only advanced tumor stage (pathologic TNM stages III-IV) was identified as the risk factor associated with reduced OS (HR = 3.330, 95% CI: 2.140-5.183, p < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: For patients with middle and lower thoracic esophageal cancer, there was no improvement in OS or DFS after esophagectomy with three-field lymphadenectomy over two-field lymphadenectomy.",0,0,0,0
33328218,"Exercise intervention and sexual function in advanced prostate cancer: a randomised controlled trial.OBJECTIVES: Treatments for prostate cancer such as androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), surgery and radiation therapy can adversely affect sexual, urinary and bowel function.Preliminary research has demonstrated the efficacy of exercise to preserve sexual function in men with localised prostate cancer receiving ADT, though this has yet to be investigated in a metastatic setting.We examined the effects of a 12-week exercise programme comprising resistance, aerobic and flexibility training on sexual health and function in men with advanced prostate cancer.METHODS: Patients with prostate cancer (70.0+/-8.4 year; body mass index 28.7+/-4.0 kg/m(2)) with bone metastases (rib/thoracic spine, 66.7%; lumbar spine, 43.9%; pelvis, 75.4%; femur, 40.4%; humerus, 24.6%; other sites, 70.2%) were randomly assigned to supervised exercise 3 days/week (n=28) or usual care (n=29).Sexual health and function were assessed using the International Index of Erectile Function, the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite and the EORTC-PR25 at baseline and 12 weeks.RESULTS: Patients attended 89% of planned sessions and there were no adverse events.After adjusting for baseline values, there was no significant difference between groups for any measure of sexual function and activity (p>0.05).Additionally, there was no significant difference between groups for urinary and bowel function assessed by the EORTC-PR25 (p>0.05).CONCLUSIONS: A short-term programme of supervised exercise does not appear to enhance indices of sexual health and function in men with advanced prostate cancer.Limitations of the intervention included the conservative modular exercise programme, which deliberately avoided loading bone metastatic sites.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ACTRN12611001158954.",0,0,0,0
33346856,"Improving quality of life through the routine use of the patient concerns inventory for head and neck cancer patients: main results of a cluster preference randomised controlled trial.PURPOSE: The patient concerns inventory (PCI) is a prompt list allowing head and neck cancer (HNC) patients to discuss issues that otherwise might be overlooked.This trial evaluated the effectiveness of using the PCI at routine outpatient clinics for one year after treatment on health-related QOL (HRQOL).METHODS: A pragmatic cluster preference randomised control trial with 15 consultants, 8 'using' and 7 'not using' the PCI intervention.Patients treated with curative intent (all sites, disease stages, treatments) were eligible.RESULTS: Consultants saw a median (inter-quartile range) 16 (13-26) patients, with 140 PCI and 148 control patients.Of the pre-specified outcomes, the 12-month results for the mean University of Washington Quality of Life (UW-QOLv4) social-emotional subscale score suggested a small clinical effect of intervention of 4.6 units (95% CI 0.2, 9.0), p = 0.04 after full adjustment for pre-stated case-mix.Results for UW-QOLv4 overall quality of life being less than good at 12 months (primary outcome) also favoured the PCI with a risk ratio of 0.83 (95% CI 0.66, 1.06) and absolute risk 4.8% (- 2.9%, 12.9%) but without achieving statistical significance.Other non-a-priori analyses, including all 12 UWQOL domains and at consultant level also suggested better HRQOL with PCI.Consultation times were unaffected and the number of items selected decreased over time.CONCLUSION: This novel trial supports the integration of the PCI approach into routine consultations as a simple low-cost means of benefiting HNC patients.It adds to a growing body of evidence supporting the use of patient prompt lists more generally.",0,0,0,0
33347776,"Hypothermia During Partial Nephrectomy for Patients with Renal Tumors: A Randomized Controlled Trial.PURPOSE: Surgeons induce renal hypothermia during partial nephrectomy to preserve kidney function, without strong evidence of benefit.This trial examined the effectiveness and safety of renal hypothermia during partial nephrectomy.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a parallel randomized controlled trial of hypothermia versus no hypothermia (control group) during partial nephrectomy at 6 academic hospitals.Eligible patients had a planned open partial nephrectomy for the treatment of a renal tumor.During surgery, after clamping the renal hilum, patients were randomized to the intervention or control arm in a 1:1 ratio using permuted blocks of variable lengths (2 and 4), stratified by institution, using a computer-based program.Surgeons and study coordinators were masked to treatment allocation until the renal hilum was clamped.Overall glomerular filtration rates were determined before, and 1-year after, surgery.The primary outcome was measured glomerular filtration rate (mGFR) assessed by the plasma clearance of (99m)Tc-DTPA.The trial (NCT01529658) was designed with 90% power to detect a minimal clinically important difference in mGFR of 10 ml/minute/1.73 m(2) at a 5% significance level.RESULTS: Of the 184 patients randomized, hypothermia and control patients had similar baseline mean mGFR (87.1 vs 81.0 ml/minute/1.73 m(2)).One hundred and sixty-one (79 hypothermia, 82 control) were alive with primary outcome data 1 year after surgery.The change in mGFR 1 year after surgery was -6.6 ml/minute/1.73 m(2) in the hypothermia group and -7.8 ml/minute/1.73 m(2) in the control group (mean difference 1.2 ml/minute/1.73 m(2), 95% CI -3.3 to 5.6).Operated-kidney change in mGFR was similar between groups (-5.8 vs -6.3 ml/minute/1.73 m(2); mean difference 0.5 ml/minute/1.73 m(2), 95% CI -2.9 to 3.8).No clinically significant difference in the mGFR was observed when patients were stratified by pre-planned subgroups.Renal hypothermia did not impact the secondary outcomes of surgical complications and patient reported quality of life.CONCLUSIONS: Renal hypothermia during partial nephrectomy does not preserve kidney function in patients with normal or mildly impaired renal function.",0,0,0,0

33367545,"Impact of gemtuzumab ozogamicin on MRD and relapse risk in patients with NPM1-mutated AML: results from the AMLSG 09-09 trial.Monitoring of measurable residual disease (MRD) provides prognostic information in patients with Nucleophosmin1-mutated (NPM1mut) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and represents a powerful tool to evaluate treatment effects within clinical trials.We determined NPM1mut transcript levels (TLs) by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and evaluated the prognostic impact of NPM1mut MRD and the effect of gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) on NPM1mut TLs and the cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) in patients with NPM1mut AML enrolled in the randomized phase 3 AMLSG 09-09 trial.A total of 3733 bone marrow (BM) samples and 3793 peripheral blood (PB) samples from 469 patients were analyzed.NPM1mut TL log10 reduction >/= 3 and achievement of MRD negativity in BM and PB were significantly associated with a lower CIR rate, after 2 treatment cycles and at end of treatment (EOT).In multivariate analyses, MRD positivity was consistently revealed to be a poor prognostic factor in BM and PB.With regard to treatment effect, the median NPM1mut TLs were significantly lower in the GO-Arm across all treatment cycles, resulting in a significantly greater proportion of patients achieving MRD negativity at EOT (56% vs 41%; P = .01).The better reduction in NPM1mut TLs after 2 treatment cycles in MRD positive patients by the addition of GO led to a significantly lower CIR rate (4-year CIR, 29.3% vs 45.7%, P = .009).In conclusion, the addition of GO to intensive chemotherapy in NPM1mut AML resulted in a significantly better reduction in NPM1mut TLs across all treatment cycles, leading to a significantly lower relapse rate.",0,0,0,0
33373276,"Augmented Reduced-Intensity Regimen Does Not Improve Postallogeneic Transplant Outcomes in Acute Myeloid Leukemia.PURPOSE: Reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens have extended the curative potential of allogeneic stem-cell transplantation to older adults with high-risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplasia (MDS) but are associated with a high risk of disease relapse.Strategies to reduce recurrence are urgently required.Registry data have demonstrated improved outcomes using a sequential transplant regimen, fludarabine/amsacrine/cytarabine-busulphan (FLAMSA-Bu), but the impact of this intensified conditioning regimen has not been studied in randomized trials.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred forty-four patients (median age, 59 years) with high-risk AML (n = 164) or MDS (n = 80) were randomly assigned 1:1 to a fludarabine-based RIC regimen or FLAMSA-Bu.Pretransplant measurable residual disease (MRD) was monitored by flow cytometry (MFC-MRD) and correlated with outcome.RESULTS: There was no difference in 2-year overall survival (hazard ratio 1.05 [85% CI, 0.80 to 1.38] P = .81) or cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) (hazard ratio 0.94 [95%CI, 0.60 to 1.46] P = .81) between the control and FLAMSA-Bu arms.Detectable pretransplant MFC-MRD was associated with an increased CIR (2-year CIR 41.0% v 20.0%, P = .01) in the overall trial cohort with a comparable prognostic impact when measured by an unsupervised analysis approach.There was no evidence of interaction between MRD status and conditioning regimen intensity for relapse or survival.Acquisition of full donor T-cell chimerism at 3 months abrogated the adverse impact of pretransplant MRD on CIR and overall survival.CONCLUSION: The intensified RIC conditioning regimen, FLAMSA-Bu, did not improve outcomes in adults transplanted for high-risk AML or MDS regardless of pretransplant MRD status.Our data instead support the exploration of interventions with the ability to accelerate acquisition of full donor T-cell chimerism as a tractable strategy to improve outcomes in patients allografted for AML.",1,1,1,0

33422006,"Impact of time-varying cumulative bevacizumab exposures on survival: re-analysis of data from randomized clinical trial in patients with metastatic colo-rectal cancer.BACKGROUND: As cancer treatment, biotherapies can be as effective as chemotherapy while reducing the risk of secondary effects, so that they can be taken over longer periods than conventional chemotherapy.Thus, some trials aimed at assessing the benefit of maintaining biotherapies during chemotherapy-free intervals (CFI).For example, the recent PRODIGE9 trial assessed the effect of maintaining bevacizumab during CFI in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients.However, its analysis was hindered by a small difference of exposure to the treatment between the randomized groups and by a large proportion of early drop outs, leading to a potentially unbalanced distribution of confounding factors among the trial completers.To address these limitations, we re-analyzed the PRODIGE9 data to assess the effects of different exposure metrics on all-cause mortality of patients with mCRC using methods originally developed for observational studies.METHODS: To account for the actual patterns of drug use by individual patients and for possible cumulative effects, we used five alternative time-varying exposure metrics: (i) cumulative dose, (ii) quantiles of the cumulative dose, (iii) standardized cumulative dose, (iv) Theoretical Blood Concentration (TBC), and (v) Weighted Cumulative Exposure (WCE).The last two metrics account for the timing of drug use.Treatment effects were estimated using adjusted Hazard Ratio from multivariable Cox proportional hazards models.RESULTS: After excluding 112 patients who died during the induction period, we analyzed data on 382 patients, among whom 320 (83.8%) died.All time-varying exposures improved substantially the model's fit to data, relative to using only the time-invariant randomization group.All exposures indicated a protective effect for higher cumulative bevacizumab doses.The best-fitting WCE and TBC models accounted for both the cumulative effects and the different impact of doses taken at different times.CONCLUSIONS: All time-varying analyses, regardless of the exposure metric used, consistently suggested protective effects of higher cumulative bevacizumab doses.However, the results may partly reflect the presence of a confusion bias.Complementing the main ITT analysis of maintenance trials with an analysis of potential cumulative effects of treatment actually taken can provide new insights, but the results must be interpreted with caution because they do not benefit from the randomization.TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov, NCT00952029 .Registered 8 August 2009.",0,0,0,0

33476595,"Cytoreductive surgery plus hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy versus cytoreductive surgery alone for colorectal peritoneal metastases (PRODIGE 7): a multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: The addition of hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) to cytoreductive surgery has been associated with encouraging survival results in some patients with colorectal peritoneal metastases who were eligible for complete macroscopic resection.We aimed to assess the specific benefit of adding HIPEC to cytoreductive surgery compared with receiving cytoreductive surgery alone.METHODS: We did a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial at 17 cancer centres in France.Eligible patients were aged 18-70 years and had histologically proven colorectal cancer with peritoneal metastases, WHO performance status of 0 or 1, a Peritoneal Cancer Index of 25 or less, and were eligible to receive systemic chemotherapy for 6 months (ie, they had adequate organ function and life expectancy of at least 12 weeks).Patients in whom complete macroscopic resection or surgical resection with less than 1 mm residual tumour tissue was completed were randomly assigned (1:1) to cytoreductive surgery with or without oxaliplatin-based HIPEC.Randomisation was done centrally using minimisation, and stratified by centre, completeness of cytoreduction, number of previous systemic chemotherapy lines, and timing of protocol-mandated systemic chemotherapy.Oxaliplatin HIPEC was administered by the closed (360 mg/m(2)) or open (460 mg/m(2)) abdomen techniques, and systemic chemotherapy (400 mg/m(2) fluorouracil and 20 mg/m(2) folinic acid) was delivered intravenously 20 min before HIPEC.All individuals received systemic chemotherapy (of investigators' choosing) with or without targeted therapy before or after surgery, or both.The primary endpoint was overall survival, which was analysed in the intention-to-treat population.Safety was assessed in all patients who received surgery.This trial is registed with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00769405, and is now completed.FINDINGS: Between Feb 11, 2008, and Jan 6, 2014, 265 patients were included and randomly assigned, 133 to the cytoreductive surgery plus HIPEC group and 132 to the cytoreductive surgery alone group.After median follow-up of 63.8 months (IQR 53.0-77.1), median overall survival was 41.7 months (95% CI 36.2-53.8) in the cytoreductive surgery plus HIPEC group and 41.2 months (35.1-49.7) in the cytoreductive surgery group (hazard ratio 1.00 [95.37% CI 0.63-1.58]; stratified log-rank p=0.99).At 30 days, two (2%) treatment-related deaths had occurred in each group.. Grade 3 or worse adverse events at 30 days were similar in frequency between groups (56 [42%] of 133 patients in the cytoreductive surgery plus HIPEC group vs 42 [32%] of 132 patients in the cytoreductive surgery group; p=0.083); however, at 60 days, grade 3 or worse adverse events were more common in the cytoreductive surgery plus HIPEC group (34 [26%] of 131 vs 20 [15%] of 130; p=0.035).INTERPRETATION: Considering the absence of an overall survival benefit after adding HIPEC to cytoreductive surgery and more frequent postoperative late complications with this combination, our data suggest that cytoreductive surgery alone should be the cornerstone of therapeutic strategies with curative intent for colorectal peritoneal metastases.FUNDING: Institut National du Cancer, Programme Hospitalier de Recherche Clinique du Cancer, Ligue Contre le Cancer.",0,0,0,0
33485464,"First-line nivolumab plus ipilimumab in unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma (CheckMate 743): a multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Approved systemic treatments for malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) have been limited to chemotherapy regimens that have moderate survival benefit with poor outcomes.Nivolumab plus ipilimumab has shown clinical benefit in other tumour types, including first-line non-small-cell lung cancer.We hypothesised that this regimen would improve overall survival in MPM.METHODS: This open-label, randomised, phase 3 study (CheckMate 743) was run at 103 hospitals across 21 countries.Eligible individuals were aged 18 years and older, with previously untreated, histologically confirmed unresectable MPM, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1.Eligible participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to nivolumab (3 mg/kg intravenously once every 2 weeks) plus ipilimumab (1 mg/kg intravenously once every 6 weeks) for up to 2 years, or platinum plus pemetrexed chemotherapy (pemetrexed [500 mg/m(2) intravenously] plus cisplatin [75 mg/m(2) intravenously] or carboplatin [area under the concentration-time curve 5 mg/mL per min intravenously]) once every 3 weeks for up to six cycles.The primary endpoint was overall survival among all participants randomly assigned to treatment, and safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of study treatment.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02899299, and is closed to accrual.FINDINGS: Between Nov 29, 2016, and April 28, 2018, 713 patients were enrolled, of whom 605 were randomly assigned to either nivolumab plus ipilimumab (n=303) or chemotherapy (n=302).467 (77%) of 605 participants were male and median age was 69 years (IQR 64-75).At the prespecified interim analysis (database lock April 3, 2020; median follow-up of 29.7 months [IQR 26.7-32.9]), nivolumab plus ipilimumab significantly extended overall survival versus chemotherapy (median overall survival 18.1 months [95% CI 16.8-21.4] vs 14.1 months [12.4-16.2]; hazard ratio 0.74 [96.6% CI 0.60-0.91]; p=0.0020).2-year overall survival rates were 41% (95% CI 35.1-46.5) in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab group and 27% (21.9-32.4) in the chemotherapy group.Grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events were reported in 91 (30%) of 300 patients treated with nivolumab plus ipilimumab and 91 (32%) of 284 treated with chemotherapy.Three (1%) treatment-related deaths occurred in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab group (pneumonitis, encephalitis, and heart failure) and one (<1%) in the chemotherapy group (myelosuppression).INTERPRETATION: Nivolumab plus ipilimumab provided significant and clinically meaningful improvements in overall survival versus standard-of-care chemotherapy, supporting the use of this first-in-class regimen that has been approved in the USA as of October, 2020, for previously untreated unresectable MPM.FUNDING: Bristol Myers Squibb.",0,0,0,0

33497028,"The effect of Oxygen application with nCPAP for the prevention of desaturation during EBUS-TBNA.PURPOSE: EBUS-TBNA is a frequently used diagnostic method for mediastinal/hilar lymphadenopathies and masses.This procedure is performed with intravenous sedation (IVS).During IVS, patients often develop hypoxemia and nasal oxygen delivery is insufficient in some patients.The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of oxygen application with nCPAP on hypoxemia during EBUS-TBNA.METHODS: Patients with EBUS-TBNA indication who did not have any serious heart-lung disease were randomly divided into two groups.One group received only oxygen and the other group received nCPAP+oxygen.Patient characteristics, arterial oxygen saturations, anesthetic agents, CPAP pressures, oxygen concentrations and processing times were recorded during the procedure.Practitioner satisfaction was evaluated at the end.RESULTS: 29 nCPAP+oxygen, 31 oxygen patients were included in the study.There were no significant differences in terms of age, sex, smoking history and presence of additional diseases in two groups.Neck circumference, BMI and STOP BANG questionnaire values were similar.Desaturation time was significantly longer in oxygen group than nCPAP+oxygen group (316+/-390 sec, 12+/-118 sec, respectively, p=0,019).Snoring was detected during the procedure in 22 patients in the oxygen group and in 11 patients in the nCPAP group (p=0,01).There were no serious complications in both groups.Practitioner satisfaction was higher in the nCPAP group but this was not statistically significant (p=0,052).CONCLUSION: Oxygen application by nCPAP during EBUS-TBNA under IVS, significantly reduces desaturation time.Oxygen delivery with nCPAP seems to be a better choice especially for the patients with high Mallampati index.",0,0,0,0
33503496,"A randomized trial of physical activity for cognitive functioning in breast cancer survivors: Rationale and study design of I Can! Improving Cognition After Cancer.INTRODUCTION: Difficulties with cognition are extremely common among breast cancer survivors and can significantly impact quality of life, daily functioning, and ability to return to work.One promising intervention is increasing physical activity, as it has been effective in improving cognition in non-cancer populations.Few physical activity intervention trials with cognition outcomes have included cancer survivors.This project builds upon our previous work indicating that increased physical activity can improve objectively measured processing speed and self-reported cognition among breast cancer survivors.METHODS: The I Can! study will examine whether a physical activity intervention improves cognition among 250 post-treatment breast cancer survivors (Stages I-III, <5 years post-treatment) who are reporting cognitive difficulties.This 2-arm randomized controlled trial comparing a 6-month physical activity intervention (Exercise Group) to a health & wellness attention-comparison condition (Health & Wellness Group) will examine intervention effects on cognition (at 3 and 6 months) and maintenance of effects at 12 months.The primary aim is to investigate the impact of exercise on objectively measured processing speed and self-reported cognition.Secondary aims are to investigate maintenance of cognitive changes and examine candidate biological mechanisms and psychological mediators.CONCLUSION: The I Can! study will contribute to the scientific, public health, and survivorship intervention literature by providing new information on the impact of physical activity for cognitive impairment in breast cancer survivors.Findings from this study will inform guidelines for physical activity to improve the lives of millions of breast cancer survivors.",0,0,0,0
33504909,"Comparison of deep and moderate neuromuscular blockade in microwave ablation of liver tumours: a randomized-controlled clinical trial.Microwave ablation (MWA) is gaining popularity for the treatment of small primary hepatocellular carcinoma and metastatic lesions especially if patients are not candidates for surgical resection.Deep neuromuscular blockade (DMB) is perceived to improve surgical working conditions compared to moderate neuromuscular blockade (MMB) but no studies have examined the same benefits in MWA of liver tumours.This study aimed to compare the clinical outcomes of DMB and MMB in MWA of liver tumours in terms of liver excursion, performance scores by the interventional radiologists and patients, requirements of additional muscle relaxants and complications.50 patients were recruited and 45 patients (22 in MMB group, 23 in DMB group) completed the study.The mean liver excursion for the MMB group (1.42 +/- 1.83 mm) was significantly higher than the DMB group (0.26 +/- 0.38 mm) (p = 0.001).The mean Leiden-Surgical Rating Scale (L-SRS) rated by the two interventional radiologists were 4.5 +/- 0.59 and 3.6 +/- 0.85 for the DMB and MMB groups, respectively (p = 0.01).There was also statistically significant difference on patient satisfaction scores (0-10: Extremely Dissatisfied-Extremely Satisfied) between DMB (8.74 +/- 1.1) and MMB (7.86 +/- 1.25) groups (p = 0.01).5 patients from MMB group and none from DMB group required bolus relaxant during the MWA procedure.Adverse events were also noted to be more severe in the MMB group.In conclusion, DMB significantly reduced liver excursion and movement leading to improved accuracy, safety and success in ablating liver tumour.",0,0,0,0
33506496,"Efficacy of sedation with dexmedetomidine plus propofol during esophageal endoscopic submucosal dissection.BACKGROUND AND AIM: During endoscopic submucosal dissection for superficial esophageal cancer, patient body movement can sometimes occur, which may cause discontinuation of the procedure.Propofol and dexmedetomidine have recently been found to be useful sedatives for endoscopic submucosal dissection.This study investigated whether sedation using propofol plus dexmedetomidine can suppress the patient's body movements during esophageal endoscopic submucosal dissection and compared this combination with sedation using propofol alone.METHODS: This was a prospective double-blind randomized controlled trial.Patients with superficial esophageal cancers who underwent esophageal endoscopic submucosal dissection at Yokohama City University Hospital were prospectively enrolled and were randomly assigned to the propofol and the propofol plus dexmedetomidine groups.The primary endpoint was the incidence of restlessness.The secondary endpoints were the satisfaction score, maintenance dose of propofol, and number of rescue propofol injections.RESULTS: Sixty-six patients (propofol group: n = 33; combination group: n = 33) were included.The combination group had a significantly lower incidence of restlessness than the propofol group (3.0% vs 27.3%, P = 0.02).In the combination group, the satisfaction scores of the endoscopists were significantly higher, the maintenance dose of propofol was significantly lower, and the number of rescue propofol injections was lower than those in the propofol group (3.0% vs 18.2%, P < 0.001).Although the incidence of bradycardia was significantly higher in the combination group (30.3% vs 3.0%, P < 0.01), no serious adverse effects occurred.CONCLUSION: The propofol plus dexmedetomidine combination provided excellent sedation that effectively suppressed the patient's body movements during esophageal endoscopic submucosal dissection.",0,0,0,0

33544247,"Feasibility and suitability of a graded exercise test in patients with aggressive hemato-oncological disease.PURPOSE: Physical activity promises to reduce disease-related symptoms and therapy-related side effects in patients suffering from aggressive lymphoma (L) or acute leukemia (AL).For an efficient training program, determination of patients' physical capacity with a purposive exercise test is crucial.Here, we evaluated the feasibility and suitability of a graded exercise test (GXT) frequently applied in patients suffering from solid tumors by assessing whether patients achieved criteria for maximal exercise testing according to the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM).METHODS: The GXT was performed by 51 patients with an aggressive L or AL prior to the start or in the earliest possible phase of high-dose chemotherapy, following a recommended protocol for cancer patients, starting at 20 Watts (W), with an increase of 10 W/min until volitional exhaustion.Subsequently, we investigated whether the following ACSM criteria were fulfilled: (1) failure of heart rate to increase despite increasing workload, (2) post-exercise capillary lactate concentration >/= 8.0 mmol L(-1), (3) rating of perceived exertion at exercise cessation > 17 on the 6-20 Borg Scale.RESULTS: Out of 51 patients, two, six, and 35 participants met the first, second, and third criterion, respectively.No relevant relationships between the completion of the criteria and patients' characteristics (e.g., gender, age) were found.CONCLUSION: Although results of this study suggest a general feasibility of the applied GXT, the ACSM criteria were not met by the majority of the participants.Therefore, this study raises doubts about the suitability of the GXT protocol and the ACSM criteria for this group of patients.",0,0,0,0
33545710,"Generalized approach for radiotherapy treatment planning by optimizing projected health outcome: preliminary results for prostate radiotherapy patients.Research in cancer care increasingly focuses on survivorship issues, e.g. managing disease- and treatment-related morbidity and mortality occurring during and after treatment.This necessitates innovative approaches that consider treatment side effects in addition to tumor cure.Current treatment-planning methods rely on constrained iterative optimization of dose distributions as a surrogate for health outcomes.The goal of this study was to develop a generally applicable method to directly optimize projected health outcomes.We developed an outcome-based objective function to guide selection of the number, angle, and relative fluence weight of photon and proton radiotherapy beams in a sample of ten prostate-cancer patients by optimizing the projected health outcome.We tested whether outcome-optimized radiotherapy (OORT) improved the projected longitudinal outcome compared to dose-optimized radiotherapy (DORT) first for a statistically significant majority of patients, then for each individual patient.We assessed whether the results were influenced by the selection of treatment modality, late-risk model, or host factors.The results of this study revealed that OORT was superior to DORT.Namely, OORT maintained or improved the projected health outcome of photon- and proton-therapy treatment plans for all ten patients compared to DORT.Furthermore, the results were qualitatively similar across three treatment modalities, six late-risk models, and 10 patients.The major finding of this work was that it is feasible to directly optimize the longitudinal (i.e. long- and short-term) health outcomes associated with the total (i.e. therapeutic and stray) absorbed dose in all of the tissues (i.e. healthy and diseased) in individual patients.This approach enables consideration of arbitrary treatment factors, host factors, health endpoints, and times of relevance to cancer survivorship.It also provides a simpler, more direct approach to realizing the full beneficial potential of cancer radiotherapy.",0,0,0,0
33573861,"Robotic-assisted Versus Laparoscopic Surgery: Outcomes from the First Multicentre, Randomised, Patient-blinded Controlled Trial in Radical Prostatectomy (LAP-01).BACKGROUND: The LAP-01 trial was designed to address the lack of high-quality literature comparing robotic-assisted (RARP) and laparoscopic (LRP) radical prostatectomy.OBJECTIVE: To compare the functional and oncological outcomes between RARP and LRP at 3 mo of follow-up.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this multicentre, randomised, patient-blinded controlled trial, patients referred for radical prostatectomy to four hospitals in Germany were randomly assigned (3:1) to undergo either RARP or LRP.OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The primary outcome was time to continence recovery at 3 mo based on the patient's pad diary.Secondary outcomes included continence and potency as well as quality of life in addition to oncological outcomes for up to 3 yr of follow-up.Time to continence was analysed by log-rank test and depicted by the Kaplan-Meier method.Continuous measurements were analysed by means of linear mixed models.RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: A total of 782 patients were randomised.The primary endpoint was evaluable in 718 patients (547 RARPs; full analysis set).At 3 mo, the difference in continence rates was 8.7% in favour of RARP (54% vs 46%, p = 0.027).RARP remained superior to LRP even after adjustment for the randomisation stratum nerve sparing and age >65 yr (hazard ratio = 1.40 [1.09-1.81], p = 0.008).A significant benefit in early potency recovery was also identified, while similar oncological and morbidity outcomes were documented.It is a limitation that the influence of different anastomotic techniques was not investigated in this study.CONCLUSIONS: RARP resulted in significantly better continence recovery at 3 mo.PATIENT SUMMARY: In this randomised trial, we looked at the outcomes following radical prostate surgery in a large German population.We conclude that patients undergoing robotic prostatectomy had better continence than those undergoing laparoscopic surgery when assessed at 3 mo following surgery.Age and the nerve-sparing technique further affected continence restoration.",0,0,0,0

33617184,"Deep learning applied to two-dimensional color Doppler flow imaging ultrasound images significantly improves diagnostic performance in the classification of breast masses: a multicenter study.BACKGROUND: The current deep learning diagnosis of breast masses is mainly reflected by the diagnosis of benign and malignant lesions.In China, breast masses are divided into four categories according to the treatment method: inflammatory masses, adenosis, benign tumors, and malignant tumors.These categorizations are important for guiding clinical treatment.In this study, we aimed to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) for classification of these four breast mass types using ultrasound (US) images.METHODS: Taking breast biopsy or pathological examinations as the reference standard, CNNs were used to establish models for the four-way classification of 3623 breast cancer patients from 13 centers.The patients were randomly divided into training and test groups (n = 1810 vs. n = 1813).Separate models were created for two-dimensional (2D) images only, 2D and color Doppler flow imaging (2D-CDFI), and 2D-CDFI and pulsed wave Doppler (2D-CDFI-PW) images.The performance of these three models was compared using sensitivity, specificity, area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), positive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV), positive (LR+) and negative likelihood ratios (LR-), and the performance of the 2D model was further compared between masses of different sizes with above statistical indicators, between images from different hospitals with AUC, and with the performance of 37 radiologists.RESULTS: The accuracies of the 2D, 2D-CDFI, and 2D-CDFI-PW models on the test set were 87.9%, 89.2%, and 88.7%, respectively.The AUCs for classification of benign tumors, malignant tumors, inflammatory masses, and adenosis were 0.90, 0.91, 0.90, and 0.89, respectively (95% confidence intervals [CIs], 0.87-0.91, 0.89-0.92, 0.87-0.91, and 0.86-0.90).The 2D-CDFI model showed better accuracy (89.2%) on the test set than the 2D (87.9%) and 2D-CDFI-PW (88.7%) models.The 2D model showed accuracy of 81.7% on breast masses </=1 cm and 82.3% on breast masses >1 cm; there was a significant difference between the two groups (P < 0.001).The accuracy of the CNN classifications for the test set (89.2%) was significantly higher than that of all the radiologists (30%).CONCLUSIONS: The CNN may have high accuracy for classification of US images of breast masses and perform significantly better than human radiologists.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chictr.org, ChiCTR1900021375; http://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.aspx?proj=33139.",0,0,0,0
33621350,"Three-dimensional multipath DenseNet for improving automatic segmentation of glioblastoma on pre-operative multimodal MR images.PURPOSE: Convolutional neural networks have achieved excellent results in automatic medical image segmentation.In this study, we proposed a novel three-dimensional (3D) multipath DenseNet for generating the accurate glioblastoma (GBM) tumor contour from four multimodal pre-operative MR images.We hypothesized that the multipath architecture could achieve more accurate segmentation than a singlepath architecture.METHODS: Two hundred and fifty-eight GBM patients were included in this study.Each patient had four MR images (T1-weighted, contrast-enhanced T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and FLAIR) and the manually segmented tumor contour.We built a 3D multipath DenseNet that could be trained to achieve an end-to-end mapping from four MR images to the corresponding GBM tumor contour.A 3D singlepath DenseNet was also built for comparison.Both DenseNets were based on the encoder-decoder architecture.All four images were concatenated and fed into a single encoder path in the singlepath DenseNet, while each input image had its own encoder path in the multipath DenseNet.The patient cohort was randomly split into a training set of 180 patients, a validation set of 39 patients, and a testing set of 39 patients.Model performance was evaluated using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), average surface distance (ASD), and 95% Hausdorff distance (HD95% ).Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were conducted to assess statistical significances.RESULTS: The singlepath DenseNet achieved the DSC of 0.911 +/- 0.060, ASD of 1.3 +/- 0.7 mm, and HD95% of 5.2 +/- 7.1 mm, while the multipath DenseNet achieved the DSC of 0.922 +/- 0.041, ASD of 1.1 +/- 0.5 mm, and HD95% of 3.9 +/- 3.3 mm.The P-values of all Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were less than 0.05.CONCLUSIONS: Both DenseNets generated GBM tumor contours in good agreement with the manually segmented contours from multimodal MR images.The multipath DenseNet achieved more accurate tumor segmentation than the singlepath DenseNet.Here presented the 3D multipath DenseNet that demonstrated an improved accuracy over comparable algorithms in the clinical task of GBM tumor segmentation.",0,0,0,0
33645308,"Including a general practice endorsement letter with the testing kit in the Bowel Cancer Screening Programme: Results of a cluster randomised trial.OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of general practitioner endorsement accompanying the screening kit rather than with the invitation letter on participation in the NHS Bowel Cancer Screening Programme and on the socioeconomic gradient in participation in the Programme.METHODS: The NHS Bowel Cancer Screening Programme in England is delivered via five regional hubs.In early 2016, we carried out a cluster-randomised trial, with hub-day of invitation as the randomisation unit.We randomised 150 hub-days of invitation to the intervention group, GP endorsement on the letter accompanying the guaiac faecal occult blood testing kit (75 hub-days, 197,366 individuals) or control, usual letter (75 hub-days, 197,476 individuals).The endpoint was participation, defined as return of a valid kit within 18 weeks of initial invitation.Because of the cluster randomisation, data were analysed by a hierarchical logistic regression, allowing a random effect for date of invitation.Socioeconomic status was represented by the index of multiple deprivation.RESULTS: Participation was 59.4% in the intervention group and 58.7% in the control group, a significant difference (p = 0.04).There was no heterogeneity of the effect of intervention by index of multiple deprivation.We found that there was some confounding between date and screening episode order (first or subsequent screen).This in turn may have induced confounding with age and slightly diluted the result.CONCLUSIONS: General practitioner endorsement induces a modest increase in participation in bowel cancer screening, but does not affect the socioeconomic gradient.When considering cluster randomisation as a research method, careful scrutiny of potential confounding is indicated in advance if possible and in analysis otherwise.",0,0,0,0
33651099,"End-of-treatment PET/CT predicts PFS and OS in DLBCL after first-line treatment: results from GOYA.GOYA was a randomized phase 3 study comparing obinutuzumab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) vs standard-of-care rituximab plus CHOP in patients with previously untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).This retrospective analysis of GOYA aimed to assess the association between progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) with positron emission tomography (PET)-based complete response (CR) status.Overall, 1418 patients were randomly assigned to receive 8 21-day cycles of obinutuzumab (n = 706) or rituximab (n = 712) plus 6 or 8 cycles of CHOP.Patients received a mandatory fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose-PET/computed tomography scan at baseline and end of treatment.After a median follow-up of 29 months, the numbers of independent review committee-assessed PFS and OS events in the entire cohort were 416 (29.3%) and 252 (17.8%), respectively.End-of-treatment PET CR was highly prognostic for PFS and OS according to Lugano 2014 criteria (PFS: hazard ratio [HR], 0.26; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.19-0.38; P < .0001; OS: HR, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.08-0.17; P < .0001), irrespective of international prognostic index score and cell of origin.In conclusion, the results from this prospectively acquired large cohort corroborated previously published data from smaller sample sizes showing that end-of-treatment PET CR is an independent predictor of PFS and OS and a promising prognostic marker in DLBCL.Long-term survival analysis confirmed the robustness of these data over time.Additional meta-analyses including other prospective studies are necessary to support the substitution of PET CR for PFS as an effective and practical surrogate end point.This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT01287741.",0,0,0,0
33655778,"Personalized Decision Making on Genomic Testing in Early Breast Cancer: Expanding the MINDACT Trial with Decision-Analytic Modeling.BACKGROUND: Genomic tests may improve upon clinical risk estimation with traditional prognostic factors.We aimed to explore how evidence on the prognostic strength of a genomic signature (clinical validity) can contribute to individualized decision making on starting chemotherapy for women with breast cancer (clinical utility).METHODS: The MINDACT trial was a randomized trial that enrolled 6693 women with early-stage breast cancer.A 70-gene signature (Mammaprint) was used to estimate genomic risk, and clinical risk was estimated by a dichotomized version of the Adjuvant!Online risk calculator.Women with discordant risk results were randomized to the use of chemotherapy.We simulated the full risk distribution of these women and estimated individual benefit, assuming a constant relative effect of chemotherapy.RESULTS: The trial showed a prognostic effect of the genomic signature (adjusted hazard ratio 2.4).A decision-analytic modeling approach identified far fewer women as candidates for genetic testing (4% rather than 50%) and fewer benefiting from chemotherapy (3% rather than 27%) as compared with the MINDACT trial report.The selection of women benefitting from genetic testing and chemotherapy depended strongly on the required benefit from treatment and the assumed therapeutic effect of chemotherapy.CONCLUSIONS: A high-quality pragmatic trial was insufficient to directly inform clinical practice on the utility of a genomic test for individual women.The indication for genomic testing may be far more limited than suggested by the MINDACT trial.",1,1,0,0
33667670,"Phase III, randomized trial of mirvetuximab soravtansine versus chemotherapy in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer: primary analysis of FORWARD I.BACKGROUND: Mirvetuximab soravtansine (MIRV) is an antibody-drug conjugate comprising a folate receptor alpha (FRalpha)-binding antibody, cleavable linker, and the maytansinoid DM4, a potent tubulin-targeting agent.The randomized, open-label, phase III study FORWARD I compared MIRV and investigator's choice chemotherapy in patients with platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC).PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients with 1-3 prior lines of therapy and whose tumors were positive for FRalpha expression were randomly assigned, in a 2 : 1 ratio, to receive MIRV (6 mg/kg, adjusted ideal body weight) or chemotherapy (paclitaxel, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, or topotecan).The primary endpoint was progression-free survival [PFS, Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, blinded independent central review] in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population and in the prespecified FRalpha high population.RESULTS: A total of 366 patients were randomized; 243 received MIRV and 109 received chemotherapy.The primary endpoint, PFS, did not reach statistical significance in either the ITT [hazard ratio (HR), 0.98, P = 0.897] or the FRalpha high population (HR, 0.69, P = 0.049).Superior outcomes for MIRV over chemotherapy were observed in all secondary endpoints in the FRalpha high population including improved objective response rate (24% versus 10%), CA-125 responses (53% versus 25%), and patient-reported outcomes (27% versus 13%).Fewer treatment-related grade 3 or higher adverse events (25.1% versus 44.0%), and fewer events leading to dose reduction (19.8% versus 30.3%) and treatment discontinuation (4.5% versus 8.3%) were seen with MIRV compared with chemotherapy.CONCLUSIONS: In patients with platinum-resistant EOC, MIRV did not result in a significant improvement in PFS compared with chemotherapy.Secondary endpoints consistently favored MIRV, particularly in patients with high FRalpha expression.MIRV showed a differentiated and more manageable safety profile than chemotherapy.",1,1,1,0
33686901,"Associations of Age, Gender, and Family Income with Quality of Life in Children With Advanced Cancer.Background: Children with cancer often experience decreased quality of life (QOL) throughout the illness trajectory.The purpose of this study was to explore the associations of demographic characteristics with QOL in children with advanced cancer.Methods: This secondary analysis was part of a larger randomized clinical trial that evaluated the efficacy of a legacy intervention for children (7-17 years) with relapsed/refractory cancer and their primary parent caregivers.Assessments included child self-reports on the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) Cancer Module.Researchers used descriptive and linear regression statistical methods.Results: Children (n = 128) averaged 10.9 years (SD = 3.0).The majority were female (n = 68, 53%), white (n = 107, 84%), had a hematologic malignancy (n = 67, 52%), with family incomes of $50,000 or less (n = 81, 63.3%).Statistically significant positive associations of both age and income level with PedsQL scores were observed (p < .05) but not gender (p > .05).The strongest correlations for age were with the procedural anxiety (beta = 0.42), treatment anxiety (beta = 0.26), and total (beta = 0.28) scores (all p < .01).In general, there was a positive correlation between family income levels and PedsQL scores (p < .05).The strongest correlations for income were with nausea (R = 0.49), appearance (R = 0.44), pain, and treatment anxiety (both R = 0.42) (all p < .01).Associations adjusted for age remained essentially the same (all p < .01).Discussion: Children with advanced cancer with lower family income and younger age are at high risk for poorer QOL.Oncology nurses should seek to identify families who may benefit from additional resources to promote QOL.",0,0,0,0

The goal of our study was to determine interest in participating in our 3-month home-based walking regimen in patients with advanced stage lung cancer.We used a randomized design to evaluate for potential benefit in PA and patient-reported outcomes.METHODS: We performed an open-label, 1:1 randomized trial in 40 patients with stage III/IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) evaluating enrollment rate, PA, QoL, dyspnea, depression, and biomarkers.Compared to usual care (UC), the intervention group (IG) received an accelerometer, in-person teaching session, and gain-framed text messages for 12 weeks.RESULTS: We enrolled 56% (40/71) of eligible patients.Participants were on average 65 years and enrolled 1.9 years from diagnosis.Most patients were women (75%), and receiving treatment (85%) for stage IV (73%) adenocarcinoma (83%).A minority of patients were employed part-time or full time (38%).Both groups reported low baseline PA (IG mean 37 (Standard deviation (SD) 46) vs UC 59 (SD 56) minutes/week; p = 0.25).The IG increased PA more than UC (mean change IG + 123 (SD 212) vs UC + 35 (SD 103) minutes/week; p = 0.051)).Step count in the IG was not statistically different between baseline (4707 step/day), week 6 (5605; p = 0.16), and week 12 (4606 steps/day; p = 0.87).The intervention improved EORTC role functioning domain (17 points; p = 0.022) with borderline improvement in dyspnea (- 13 points; p = 0.051) compared to UC.In patients with two blood samples (25%), we observed a significant increase in soluble PD-1 (219.8 (SD 54.5) pg/mL; p < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Our pilot trial using a 3-month, home-based, mobile health intervention enrolled over half of eligible patients with stage III and IV NSCLC.The intervention increased PA, and may improve several aspects of QoL. We also identified potential biomarker changes relevant to lung cancer biology.Future research should use a larger sample to examine the effect of exercise on cancer biomarkers, which may mediate the association between PA and QoL.

34196397,"Assessment of the Validity of the Sinonasal Outcomes Test-22 in Pituitary Surgery: A Multicenter Prospective Trial.OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Sinonasal Outcomes Test-22 (SNOT-22) is used widely as a patient-reported sinonasal quality-of-life (QOL) instrument for endoscopic endonasal pituitary surgery.However, it has never been validated in this population.This study explores the psychometric validity of SNOT-22 to determine if it is a valid scale in patients undergoing endoscopic pituitary surgery.STUDY DESIGN: Multicenter prospective trial.METHODS: Adult patients (n = 113) with pituitary tumors undergoing endoscopic surgery were enrolled in a multicenter study.Patient-reported QOL was assessed using SNOT-22 and the Anterior Skull Base Nasal Inventory-12.Face validity, internal consistency, responsiveness to clinical change, test-retest reliability, and concurrent validity were determined using standard statistical methods.RESULTS: Internal consistency using Cronbach's alpha at baseline and 2 weeks postoperatively were 0.911 and 0.922, indicating SNOT-22 performed well as a single construct.Mean QOL scores were significantly worse at 2 weeks than baseline (16.4 +/- 15.1 vs. 23.1 +/- 16.4, P < .001), indicating the scale is responsive to clinical change.However, only 11/22 items demonstrated significant changes in mean scores at 2 weeks.Correlation between scores at 2 and 3 weeks was high, suggesting good test-retest reliability, r(107) = 0.75, P < .001.Factor analysis suggests the five-factor solution proposed for the SNOT-22 in rhinosinusitis patients is not valid in pituitary surgery patients.CONCLUSIONS: The SNOT-22 is a valid QOL instrument in patients undergoing endoscopic pituitary surgery.However, because it includes 22 items, can be applied only as a single construct, 50% of the items do not demonstrate changes after surgery, and is not as sensitive to change as other scales, shorter instruments developed specifically for this patient population may be preferable.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 2 Laryngoscope, 131:E2757-E2763, 2021.",0,0,0,0
34216815,"Alternative dosing of exemestane in postmenopausal women with ER-positive breast cancer. Design and methods of a randomized presurgical trial.INTRODUCTION: Aromatase inhibitors are effective in lowering breast cancer incidence among postmenopausal women, but adverse events represent a barrier to their acceptability and adherence as a preventive treatment.This study aims to assess whether lowering exemestane schedule may retain biological activity while improving tolerability in breast cancer patients.METHODS/DESIGN: We are conducting a, pre-surgical, non-inferiority phase IIb study in postmenopausal women with newly diagnosed estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer.Participants are randomized to receive either exemestane 25 mg/day or 25 mg/three times-week or once a week for 4 to 6 weeks prior to surgery.The primary endpoint is the percentage change of serum estradiol concentration between baseline and surgery comparing the three arms.Sample size of 180 women was calculated assuming a 6% non-inferiority of the percent change of estradiol in the lower dose arms compared with the 80% decrease predicted in the full dose arm, with 80% power and using a one-sided 5% significance level and a two-sample t-test.Main secondary outcomes are: safety; change in Ki-67 in cancer and adjacent pre-cancer tissue, circulating sex hormones, adipokines, lipid profile, insulin and glucose changes, in correlation with drug and metabolites concentrations.RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The present paper is focused on methodology and operational aspects of the study.A total of 180 participants have ben enrolled.The trial is still blinded, and the analyses are ongoing.Despite the short term duration, results may have relevant implications for clinical management of women at increased risk of developing a ER positive breast cancer.",0,0,0,0
34256828,"Process evaluation of the Bridging the Age Gap in Breast Cancer decision support intervention cluster randomised trial.BACKGROUND: The Bridging the Age Gap in Breast Cancer research programme sought to improve treatment decision-making for older women with breast cancer by developing and testing, in a cluster randomised trial (n = 1339 patients), two decision support interventions (DESIs).Both DESIs were used in the intervention arm and each comprised an online risk prediction model, brief decision aid and information booklet.One DESI supported the decision to have either primary endocrine therapy (PET) or surgery with adjuvant therapies and the second supported the decision to have adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery or not.METHODS: Sixteen sites were randomly selected to take part in the process evaluation.Multiple methods of data collection were used.Medical Research Council (MRC) guidelines for the evaluation of complex interventions were used.RESULTS: Eighty-two patients, mean age 75.5 (range 70-93), provided data for the process evaluation.Seventy-three interviews were completed with patients.Ten clinicians from six intervention sites took part in telephone interviews.Dose: Ninety-one members of staff in the intervention arm received intervention training.Reach: The online tool was accessed on 324 occasions by 27 clinicians.Reasons for non-use of the online tool were commonly that the patient had already made a decision or that there was no online access in the clinic.Of the 32 women for whom there were data available, fifteen from the intervention arm and six from the usual care arm were offered a choice of treatment.Fidelity: Clinicians used the online tool in different ways, with some using it during the consultation and others checking the online survival estimates before the consultation.Adaptation: There was evidence of adaptation when using the DESIs.A lack of infrastructure, e.g. internet access, was a barrier to the use of the online tool.The brief decision aid was rarely used.Mediators: Shared decision-making: Most patients felt able to contribute to decision-making and expressed high levels of satisfaction with the process.Participants' responses to intervention: Six patients reported the DESIs to be very useful, one somewhat useful and two moderately useful.CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians who participated were mainly supportive of the interventions and had attempted some adaptations to make the interventions applicable, but there were practical and engagement barriers that led to sub-optimal adoption in routine practice.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN46099296 .Registered on 11 August 2016-retrospectively registered.",0,0,0,0
34263641,"Specific survival nomograms based on SEER database for small intestine adenocarcinoma.BACKGROUND: Small intestine cancers, as an extremely rare tumor type, account only for 3% of all gastrointestinal tumors.Small intestine adenocarcinoma (SIA), representing approximately one-third of all small bowel cancers, has received relatively little attention, both in research efforts and clinical cognizance.Owing to anatomical proximity and rarity, small bowel adenocarcinomas are frequently grouped with colorectal adenocarcinomas.Therefore, a large SIA patient cohort is needed to develop and validate new nomogram prognostic models specific to SIA patients.METHODS: Patients diagnosed with SIA between 2004 and 2016 were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and Final Results (SEER) database.All patients were randomly assigned to the training cohort and the validation cohort (2:1).The basic clinical information, detailed pathological staging, and treatment information of the patients were included in the analysis.Nomograms were shaped following the evaluations of the Cox regression model and verified using the decision curve analysis (DCA), time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, concordance index (C-index), and calibration curves.RESULTS: The entire group comprised 6,947 patients with small intestine adenocarcinoma.According to the results of the multivariate Cox regression analysis, ten variables, including marital status, age, pathological grade, tumor location, T (tumor), N (nodes), M (metastasis) stage, surgery, chemotherapy, and regional nodes examined (RNE), were independent predictors of both of overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS).All significant variables were used to create the nomograms for OS and CSS.Various methods verified the reliability of the nomograms.The C-indexes of the OS and CSS nomogram were 0.756 (95% CI, 0.748-0.764) and 0.771 (95% CI, 0.761-0.781) in the training cohort and 0.748 (95% CI, 0.736-0.760) and 0.767 (95% CI, 0.752-0.781) in the validation cohort.The calibration curve showed good agreement between the nomogram prediction and actual survival.DCA indicated a clear net benefit of these new forecasting models.CONCLUSIONS: This study built and verified nomograms to predict OS and CSS for rare SIA, which appear to be excellent tools to augment the clinically available evidence to facilitate the discussion between SIA patients and clinicians regarding therapeutic choice.",0,0,0,0

34323924,"Metformin in Combination With Chemoradiotherapy in Locally Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: The OCOG-ALMERA Randomized Clinical Trial.Importance: Unresected locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC) shows poor survival outcomes even after aggressive concurrent chemoradiotherapy.Whether metformin, a diabetes agent that inhibits the mitochondria oxidative phosphorylation chain, could improve radiotherapy and chemotherapy response in LA-NSCLC remains to be studied.Objective: To examine whether metformin, given concurrently with chemoradiotherapy and as consolidation treatment, could improve outcomes in patients with LA-NSCLC.Design, Setting, and Participants: The Ontario Clinical Oncology Group Advanced Lung Cancer Treatment With Metformin and Chemoradiotherapy (OCOG-ALMERA) study was a multicenter phase 2 randomized clinical trial.Patients were stratified for stage IIIA vs IIIB LA-NSCLC and use of consolidation chemotherapy.The trial was designed to enroll 96 patients with unresected LA-NSCLC who did not have diabetes.The trial was conducted from September 24, 2014, to March 8, 2019.Interventions: Patients were randomized to platinum-based chemotherapy, concurrent with chest radiotherapy (60-63 Gy), with or without consolidation chemotherapy or the same treatment plus metformin, 2000 mg/d, during chemoradiotherapy and afterward for up to 12 months.Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who experienced a failure event (ie, locoregional disease progression, distant metastases, death, and discontinuation of trial treatment or planned evaluations for any reason within 12 months).Proportions were compared using a 2-sided Fisher exact test.Conventional progression-free and overall survival were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.Adverse events were graded with Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.03.All randomized patients were included in an intention-to-treat analysis.Results: The trial was stopped early due to slow accrual.Between 2014 and 2019, 54 patients were randomized (26 in experimental arm and 28 in control arm).Participants included 30 women (55.6%); mean (SD) age was 65.6 (7.6) years.Treatment failure was detected in 18 patients (69.2%) receiving metformin within 1 year vs 12 (42.9%) control patients (P = .05).The 1-year progression-free survival rate was 34.8% (95% CI, 16.6%-53.7%) in the metformin arm and 63.0% (95% CI, 42.1%-78.1%) in the control arm (hazard ratio, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.14-5.10) The overall survival rates were 47.4% (95% CI, 26.3%-65.9%) in the metformin arm and 85.2% (95% CI, 65.2%-94.2%) in the control arm (hazard ratio, 3.80; 95% CI, 1.49-9.73).More patients in the experimental arm vs control arm (53.8% vs 25.0%) reported at least 1 grade 3 or higher adverse event.Conclusions and Relevance: In this randomized clinical trial, the addition of metformin to chemoradiotherapy was associated with worse treatment efficacy and increased toxic effects compared with combined modality therapy alone.Metformin is not recommended in patients with LA-NSCLC who are candidates for chemoradiotherapy.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02115464.",0,0,0,0
34344355,"A proof-of-concept sub-study exploring feasibility and preliminary evidence for the role of physical activity on neural activity during executive functioning tasks among young adults after cancer treatment.BACKGROUND: Executive functioning (EF) deficits are troubling for adolescents and young adults (AYAs) after cancer treatment.Physical activity (PA) may enhance neural activity underlying EF among older adults affected by cancer.Establishing whether PA enhances neural activity among AYAs is warranted.As part of a two-arm, mixed-methods pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT), this proof-of-concept sub-study sought to answer the following questions: (1) is it feasible to use neuroimaging with EF tasks to assess neural activity changes following a 12-week PA intervention? And (2) is there preliminary evidence that a 12-week PA intervention enhances neural activity among AYAs after cancer treatment?METHODS: AYAs in the pilot RCT were approached for enrollment into this sub-study.Those who were eligible and enrolled, completed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with EF tasks (letter n-back, Go/No Go) pre- and post-PA intervention.Sub-study enrollment, adherence to scheduled fMRI scans, outliers, missing data, and EF task performance data were collected.Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics, blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) analyses, and paired sample t-tests.RESULTS: Nine eligible participants enrolled into this sub-study; six attended scheduled fMRI scans.One outlier was identified and was subsequently removed from the analytical sample.Participants showed no differences in EF task performance from pre- to post-PA intervention.Increases in neural activity in brain regions responsible for motor control, information encoding and processing, and decision-making were observed post-PA intervention (p < 0.05; n = 5).CONCLUSIONS: Findings show that fMRI scans during EF tasks detected neural activity changes (as assessed by the BOLD signal) from pre- to post-PA intervention.Results thus suggest future trials confirming that PA enhances neural activity underlying EF are needed, though feasibility issues require careful consideration to ensure trial success.TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov, NCT03016728.Registered January 11, 2017, clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03016728.",0,0,0,0

34374082,"Racial differences in survival and response to therapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer: A secondary analysis of CALGB/SWOG 80405 (Alliance A151931).BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between self-identified race and overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and response to therapy among patients enrolled in the randomized Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB)/SWOG 80405 trial.METHODS: Patients with advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer who were enrolled in the CALGB/SWOG 80405 trial were identified by race.On the basis of covariates (treatment arm, KRAS status, sex, age, and body mass index), each Black patient was exact matched with a White patient.The association between race and OS and PFS was examined using a marginal Cox proportional hazard model for matched pairs.The interaction between KRAS status and race was tested in the model.The association between race and response to therapy and adverse events were examined using a marginal logistic regression model.RESULTS: In total, 392 patients were matched and included in the final data set.No difference in OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73-1.16), PFS (HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.78-1.20), or response to therapy (odds ratio [OR], 1.00; 95% CI, 0.65-1.52) was observed between Black and White patients.Patients with KRAS mutant status (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.02-1.67), a performance statusscore of 1 (reference, a performance status of 0; HR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.18-1.88), or >/=3 metastatic sites (reference, 1 metastatic site; HR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.22-2.28) experienced worse OS.Black patients experienced lower rates and risk of grade >/=3 fatigue (6.6% vs 13.3%; OR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.24-0.91) but were equally likely to be treated with a dose reduction (OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.72-1.65).CONCLUSIONS: No difference in OS, PFS, or response to therapy was observed between Black patients and White patients in an equal treatment setting of the CALGB/SWOG 80405 randomized controlled trial.LAY SUMMARY: Despite improvements in screening and treatment, studies have demonstrated worse outcomes in Black patients with colorectal cancer.The purpose of this study was to determine whether there was a difference in cancer-specific outcomes among Black and White patients receiving equivalent treatment on the CALGB/SWOG 80405 randomized clinical trial.In this study, there was no difference in overall survival, progression-free survival, or response to therapy between Black and White patients treated on a clinical trial.These findings suggest that access to care and differences in treatment may be responsible for racial disparities in colorectal cancer.",0,0,0,0
34376554,"Phase Ib study of patients with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer treated with different sequencing regimens of atezolizumab and sipuleucel-T.BACKGROUND: Combining an immune checkpoint inhibitor with a tumor vaccine may modulate the immune system to leverage complementary mechanisms of action that lead to sustained T-cell activation and a potent prolonged immunotherapeutic response in metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).METHODS: Subjects with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic mCRPC were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either atezolizumab followed by sipuleucel-T (Arm 1) or sipuleucel-T followed by atezolizumab (Arm 2).The primary endpoint was safety, while secondary endpoints included preliminary clinical activity such as objective tumor response and systemic immune responses that could identify key molecular and immunological changes associated with sequential administration of atezolizumab and sipuleucel-T. RESULTS: A total of 37 subjects were enrolled.The median age was 75.0 years, median prostate specific antigen (PSA) was 21.9 ng/mL, and subjects had a median number of three prior treatments.Most subjects (83.8%) had at least one treatment-related adverse event.There were no grade 4 or 5 toxicities attributed to either study drug.Immune-related adverse events and infusion reactions occurred in 13.5% of subjects, and all of which were grade 1 or 2.Of 23 subjects with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors measurable disease, only one subject in Arm 2 had a partial response (PR) and four subjects overall had stable disease (SD) at 6 months reflecting an objective response rate of 4.3% and a disease control rate of 21.7%.T-cell receptor diversity was higher in subjects with a response, including SD.Immune response to three novel putative antigens (SIK3, KDM1A/LSD1, and PIK3R6) appeared to increase with treatment.CONCLUSIONS: Overall, regardless of the order in which they were administered, the combination of atezolizumab with sipuleucel-T appears to be safe and well tolerated with a comparable safety profile to each agent administered as monotherapy.Correlative immune studies may suggest the combination to be beneficial; however, further studies are needed.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT03024216.",0,0,0,0
34406839,"Targeting Depressive Symptoms in Younger Breast Cancer Survivors: The Pathways to Wellness Randomized Controlled Trial of Mindfulness Meditation and Survivorship Education.PURPOSE: Younger women are at risk for depression and related symptoms following breast cancer.The Pathways to Wellness study, a randomized, multi-institution, three-arm trial, tested the efficacy of two behavioral interventions for younger breast cancer survivors with elevated depressive symptoms: mindful awareness practices (MAPs) and survivorship education (SE) (Clincaltrials.gov identifier: NCT03025139).METHODS: Women diagnosed with breast cancer at or before 50 years of age who had completed treatment and had elevated depressive symptoms were randomly assigned to 6 weeks of MAPs, SE, or wait-list control (WLC).Assessments were conducted preintervention and postintervention and at 3-month and 6-month postintervention follow-ups.Analyses compared each intervention to WLC using linear mixed models.The primary outcome was change in depressive symptoms from preintervention to postintervention on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale; secondary outcomes included change in fatigue, insomnia, and vasomotor symptoms.RESULTS: Two hundred forty-seven women (median age = 46 years) were randomly assigned to MAPs (n = 85), SE (n = 81), or WLC (n = 81).MAPs and SE led to significant decreases in depressive symptoms from preintervention to postintervention relative to WLC (mean change relative to WLC [95% CI]: MAPs, -4.7 [-7.5 to -1.9]; SE, -4.0 [-6.9 to -1.1]), which persisted at 6-month follow-up for MAPs (mean change relative to WLC [95% CI]: MAPs, -3.7 [-6.6 to -0.8]; SE, -2.8 [-5.9 to 0.2]).MAPs, but not SE, also had beneficial effects on fatigue, insomnia, and vasomotor symptoms that persisted at 6-month follow-up (P < .05).CONCLUSION: Mindfulness meditation and SE reduced depressive symptoms in younger breast cancer survivors.These interventions can be widely disseminated over virtual platforms and have significant potential benefit for quality of life and overall survivorship in this vulnerable group.",0,0,0,0

34446053,"Durvalumab (MEDI 4736) in combination with extended neoadjuvant regimens in rectal cancer: a study protocol of a randomised phase II trial (PRIME-RT).BACKGROUND: Advances in multi-modality treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) have resulted in low local recurrence rates, but around 30% of patients will still die from distant metastatic disease.In parallel, there is increasing recognition that with radiotherapy and systemic treatment, some patients achieve a complete response and may avoid surgical resection, including in many cases, the need for a permanent stoma.Extended neoadjuvant regimes have emerged to address these concerns.The inclusion of immunotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting has the potential to further enhance this strategy by priming the local immune microenvironment and engaging the systemic immune response.METHODS: PRIME-RT is a multi-centre, open label, phase II, randomised trial for patients with newly diagnosed LARC.Eligible patients will be randomised to receive either: short course radiotherapy (25 Gray in 5 fractions over one week) with concomitant durvalumab (1500 mg administered intravenously every 4 weeks), followed by FOLFOX (85 mg/m(2) oxaliplatin, 350 mg folinic acid and 400 mg/m(2) bolus 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) given on day 1 followed by 2400 mg/m(2) 5-FU infusion over 46-48 h, all administered intravenously every 2 weeks), and durvalumab, or long course chemoradiotherapy (50 Gray to primary tumour in 25 fractions over 5 weeks with concomitant oral capecitabine 825 mg/m(2) twice per day on days of radiotherapy) with durvalumab followed by FOLFOX and durvalumab.The primary endpoint is complete response rate in each arm.Secondary endpoints include treatment compliance, toxicity, safety, overall recurrence, proportion of patients with a permanent stoma, and survival.The study is translationally rich with collection of bio-specimens prior to, during, and following treatment in order to understand the molecular and immunological factors underpinning treatment response.The trial opened and the first patient was recruited in January 2021.The main trial will recruit up to 42 patients with LARC and commence after completion of a safety run-in that will recruit at least six patients with LARC or metastatic disease.DISCUSSION: PRIME-RT will explore if adding immunotherapy to neoadjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy for patients with LARC can prime the tumour microenvironment to improve complete response rates and stoma free survival.Sequential biopsies are a key component within the trial design that will provide new knowledge on how the tumour microenvironment changes at different time-points in response to multi-modality treatment.This expectation is that the trial will provide information to test this treatment within a large phase clinical trial.Trial registration Clinicaltrials.gov NCT04621370 (Registered 9th Nov 2020) EudraCT number 2019-001471-36 (Registered 6th Nov 2020).",1,1,0,0

34461224,"Simvastatin modulates estrogen signaling in uterine leiomyoma via regulating receptor palmitoylation, trafficking and degradation.Uterine leiomyomas or fibroids are the most common tumors of the female reproductive tract.Estrogen (E2), a steroid-derived hormone, and its receptors (ERs), particularly ER-alpha, are important drivers for the development and growth of leiomyomas.We previously demonstrated that simvastatin, a drug used for hyperlipidemia, also possesses anti-leiomyoma properties.The aim of this work is to investigate the impact of simvastatin on ER-alpha signaling in leiomyoma cells, including its expression, downstream signaling, transcriptional activity, post-translational modification, trafficking and degradation.Primary and immortalized human uterine leiomyoma (HuLM) cells were used for in vitro experiments.Immunodeficient mice xenografted with human leiomyoma tissue explants were used for in vivo studies.Leiomyoma samples were obtained from patients enrolled in an ongoing double-blinded, phase II, randomized controlled trial.Here, we found that simvastatin significantly reduced E2-induced proliferation and PCNA expression.In addition, simvastatin reduced total ER-alpha expression in leiomyoma cells and altered its subcellular localization by inhibiting its trafficking to the plasma membrane and nucleus.Simvastatin also inhibited E2 downstream signaling, including ERK and AKT pathways, E2/ER transcriptional activity and E2-responsive genes.To explain simvastatin effects on ER-alpha level and trafficking, we examined its effects on ER-alpha post-translational processing.We noticed that simvastatin reduced ER-alpha palmitoylation; a required modification for its stability, trafficking to plasma membrane, and signaling.We also observed an increase in ubiquitin-mediated ER-alpha degradation.Importantly, we found that the effects of simvastatin on ER-alpha expression were recapitulated in the xenograft leiomyoma mouse model and human tissues.Thus, our data suggest that simvastatin modulates several E2/ER signaling targets with potential implications in leiomyoma therapy and beyond.",0,0,0,0
34463630,"Usefulness of Smartphone Apps for Improving Nutritional Status of Pancreatic Cancer Patients: Randomized Controlled Trial.BACKGROUND: Approximately 80% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients suffer from anorexia, weight loss, and asthenia.Most PDAC patients receive chemotherapy, which often worsens their nutritional status owing to the adverse effects of chemotherapy.Malnutrition of PDAC patients is known to be associated with poor prognosis; therefore, nutritional management during chemotherapy is a key factor influencing the outcome of the treatment.Mobile apps have the potential to provide readily accessible nutritional support for patients with PDAC.OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a mobile app-based program, Noom, in patients receiving chemotherapy for PDAC.METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 40 patients who were newly diagnosed with unresectable PDAC from a single university-affiliated hospital in South Korea, and randomly assigned them into a Noom user group (n=20) and a non-Noom user group (n=20).The 12-week in-app interventions included meal and physical activity logging as well as nutritional education feedback from dietitians.The non-Noom user group did not receive any nutrition intervention.The primary outcomes were the changes in the nutritional status and quality of life (QoL) from the baseline to 12 weeks.The secondary outcomes included the changes in the skeletal muscle index (SMI) from the baseline to 12 weeks.The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Core Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) and the Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA) were used as paper questionnaires to assess the QoL and nutritional status of the patients.Intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were conducted.Regarding the study data collection time points, we assessed the nutritional status and QoL at the baseline (T0), and at 4 (T1), 8 (T2), and 12 (T3) weeks.Abdominal computed tomography (CT) imaging was conducted at the baseline and after 8 weeks for tumor response and SMI evaluation.The skeletal muscle area (cm(2)) was calculated using routine CT images.The cross-sectional areas (cm(2)) of the L3 skeletal muscles were analyzed.RESULTS: Between February 2017 and January 2018, 48 patients were assessed for eligibility.Totally 40 patients with pancreatic cancer were included by random allocation.Only 17 participants in the Noom user group and 16 in the non-Noom user group completed all follow-ups.All the study participants showed a significant improvement in the nutritional status according to the PG-SGA score regardless of Noom app usage.Noom users showed statistically significant improvements on the global health status (GHS) and QoL scales compared to non-Noom users, based on the EORTC QLQ (P=.004).The SMI decreased in both groups during chemotherapy (Noom users, 49.08+/-12.27 cm(2)/m(2) to 46.08+/-10.55 cm(2)/m(2); non-Noom users, 50.60+/-9.05 cm(2)/m(2) to 42.97+/-8.12 cm(2)/m(2)).The decrement was higher in the non-Noom user group than in the Noom user group, but it was not statistically significant (-13.96% vs. -3.27%; P=.11).CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study demonstrates that a mobile app-based approach is beneficial for nutritional and psychological support for PDAC patients receiving chemotherapy.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04109495; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04109495.",0,0,0,0

34481017,"Adding Short-Term Androgen Deprivation Therapy to Radiation Therapy in Men With Localized Prostate Cancer: Long-Term Update of the NRG/RTOG 9408 Randomized Clinical Trial.PURPOSE: For men with localized prostate cancer, NRG Oncology/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 9408 demonstrated that adding short-term androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) to radiation therapy (RT) improved the primary endpoint of overall survival (OS) and improved disease-specific mortality (DSM), biochemical failure (BF), local progression, and freedom from distant metastases (DM).This study was performed to determine whether the short-term ADT continued to improve OS, DSM, BF, and freedom from DM with longer follow-up.METHODS AND MATERIALS: From 1994 to 2001, NRG/RTOG 9408 randomized 2028 men from 212 North American institutions with T1b-T2b, N0 prostate adenocarcinoma and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) </=20ng/mL to RT alone or RT plus short-term ADT.Patients were stratified by PSA, tumor grade, and surgical versus clinical nodal staging.ADT was flutamide with either goserelin or leuprolide for 4 months.Prostate RT (66.6 Gy) was started after 2 months.OS was calculated at the date of death from any cause or at last follow-up.Secondary endpoints were DSM, BF, local progression, and DM.Acute and late toxic effects were assessed using RTOG toxicity scales.RESULTS: Median follow-up in surviving patients was 14.8 years (range, 0.16-21.98).The 10-year and 18-year OS was 56% and 23%, respectively, with RT alone versus 63% and 23% with combined therapy (HR 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85-1.05; P = .94).The hazards were not proportional (P = .003).Estimated restricted mean survival time at 18 years was 11.8 years (95% CI, 11.4-12.1) with combined therapy versus 11.3 years with RT alone (95% CI, 10.9-11.6; P = .05).The 10-year and 18-year DSM was 7% and 14%, respectively, with RT alone versus 3% and 8% with combined therapy (HR 0.56; 95% CI, 0.41-0.75; P < .01).DM and BF favored combined therapy at 18 years.Rates of late grade >/=3 hepatic, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary toxicity were </=1%, 3%, and 8%, respectively, with combined therapy versus </=1%, 2%, and 5% with RT alone.CONCLUSIONS: Further follow-up demonstrates that OS converges at approximately 15 years, by which point the administration of 4 months of ADT had conferred an estimated additional 6 months of life.",0,0,0,0
34487222,"Short-term fasting in glioma patients: analysis of diet diaries and metabolic parameters of the ERGO2 trial.PURPOSE: The prospective, randomized ERGO2 trial investigated the effect of calorie-restricted ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting (KD-IF) on re-irradiation for recurrent brain tumors.The study did not meet its primary endpoint of improved progression-free survival in comparison to standard diet (SD).We here report the results of the quality of life/neurocognition and a detailed analysis of the diet diaries.METHODS: 50 patients were randomized 1:1 to re-irradiation combined with either SD or KD-IF.The KD-IF schedule included 3 days of ketogenic diet (KD: 21-23 kcal/kg/d, carbohydrate intake limited to 50 g/d), followed by 3 days of fasting and again 3 days of KD.Follow-up included examination of cognition, quality of life and serum samples.RESULTS: The 20 patients who completed KD-IF met the prespecified goals for calorie and carbohydrate restriction.Substantial decreases in leptin and insulin and an increase in uric acid were observed.The SD group, of note, had a lower calorie intake than expected (21 kcal/kg/d instead of 30 kcal/kg/d).Neither quality of life nor cognition were affected by the diet.Low glucose emerged as a significant prognostic parameter in a best responder analysis.CONCLUSION: The strict caloric goals of the ERGO2 trial were tolerated well by patients with recurrent brain cancer.The short diet schedule led to significant metabolic changes with low glucose emerging as a candidate marker of better prognosis.The unexpected lower calorie intake of the control group complicates the interpretation of the results.Clinicaltrials.gov number: NCT01754350; Registration: 21.12.2012.",1,1,0,0

34836131,"A Protective Role for Arachidonic Acid Metabolites against Advanced Colorectal Adenoma in a Phase III Trial of Selenium.Oxylipins derived from arachidonic acid (ARA) have been implicated in the development of colorectal adenomas and colorectal cancer.The primary purpose of this work was to determine the relationship between plasma levels of oxylipins and colorectal adenoma characteristics at study entry, as well as with the development of a new adenoma during follow-up within a Phase III adenoma prevention clinical trial with selenium (Sel).Secondarily, we sought to determine whether the selenium intervention influenced plasma oxylipin levels.Four oxylipins were quantified in stored plasma samples from a subset of Sel study subjects (n = 256) at baseline and at 12-months.There were significantly lower odds of an advanced adenoma at baseline with higher prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), with an OR (95% CI) of 0.55 (0.33-0.92), and with 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE) ((0.53 (0.33-0.94)); and of a large adenoma with higher PGE2 ((0.52 (0.31-0.87)).In contrast, no associations were observed between any oxylipin and the development of a new adenoma during follow-up.Selenium supplementation was associated with a significantly smaller increase in 5-HETE after 12 months compared to the placebo, though no other results were statistically significant.The ARA-derived oxylipins may have a role in the progression of non-advanced adenoma to advanced, but not with the development of a new adenoma.",0,0,0,0
34838115,"Impact of an enhanced screening program on the detection of non-AIDS neoplasias in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection.BACKGROUND: The incidence of non-AIDS defining cancer (NADC) is higher in people living with HIV (PLWH) than in the general population, and it is already one of the leading causes of death in the HIV-infected population.It is estimated that the situation will be aggravated by the progressive aging of PLWH.Early diagnosis through intensive cancer screening may improve the ability for therapeutic interventions and could be critical in reducing mortality, but it might also increase expenditure and harms associated with adverse events.The aim of this study is to evaluate an enhanced screening program for early diagnosis of cancer in PLWH compared to standard practice.The specific objectives are (1) to compare the frequency of cancer diagnosed at an early stage, (2) to analyze safety of the enhanced program: adverse events and unnecessary interventions, (3) to analyze the cost-utility of the program, and (4) to estimate the overall and site-specific incidence of NADC in PLWH.METHODS: We will conduct a multicenter, non-blinded, randomized, controlled trial, comparing two parallel arms: conventional vs enhanced screening.Data will be recorded in an electronic data collection notebook.Conventional intervention group will follow the standard of care screening in the participating centers, according to the European AIDS Clinical Society recommendations, and the enhanced intervention group will follow an expanded screening aimed to early detection of lung, liver, anal, cervical, breast, prostate, colorectal, and skin cancer.The trial will be conducted within the framework of the Spanish AIDS Research Network Cohort (CoRIS).DISCUSSION: The trial will evaluate the efficacy, safety, and efficiency of an enhanced screening program for the early diagnosis of cancer in HIV patients compared to standard of care practice.The information provided will be relevant since there are currently no studies on expanded cancer screening strategies in patients with HIV, and available data estimating cost effectiveness or cost-utility of such as programs are scarce.An enhanced program for NADC screening in patients with HIV could lead to early diagnosis and improve the prognosis of these patients, with an acceptable rate of unnecessary interventions, but it is critical to demonstrate that the benefits clearly outweigh the harms, before the strategy could be implemented.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04735445.Registered on 25 June 2019.",0,0,0,0
