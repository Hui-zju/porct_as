28687482,"Treatment Rationale and Design for J-SONIC: A Randomized Study of Carboplatin Plus Nab-paclitaxel With or Without Nintedanib for Advanced Non-Small-cell Lung Cancer With Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis.We describe the treatment rationale and procedure for a randomized study (J-SONIC; University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trials Registry identification no., UMIN000026799) of carboplatin plus nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) with or without nintedanib for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).The study was designed to examine the efficacy and safety of nintedanib administered with carboplatin plus nab-paclitaxel versus carboplatin plus nab-paclitaxel alone in chemotherapy-naive patients with advanced NSCLC associated with IPF.Eligible patients (enrollment target, n = 170) will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive 4 cycles of carboplatin (area under the curve, 6 on day 1) plus nab-paclitaxel (100 mg/m(2) on days 1, 8, and 15) administered every 3 weeks either without (arm A) or with (arm B) nintedanib (150 mg twice daily), to be followed in arm B by single-agent administration of nintedanib (150 mg twice daily).The present trial is the first randomized controlled study for the treatment of NSCLC associated with IPF.The goal of the study is to demonstrate that nintedanib combined with carboplatin plus nab-paclitaxel prolongs the interval to acute exacerbation of IPF compared with carboplatin plus nab-paclitaxel alone.",0,0,0,0
28459941,"German Adjuvant Intergroup Node-positive Study (GAIN): a phase III trial comparing two dose-dense regimens (iddEPC versus ddEC-PwX) in high-risk early breast cancer patients.BACKGROUND: Dose-dense (dd) regimens are one of the preferred options for the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer patients with intermediate to high risk.The German Adjuvant Intergroup Node-positive trial aimed at optimizing intense dd (idd) strategies by evaluating drug combinations and the addition of capecitabine.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Women (aged 18 years and biologically <65 years) with histologically involved axillary lymph nodes were randomly assigned to receive three courses each of epirubicin (E) 150 mg/m2, paclitaxel (P) 225 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide (C) 2500 mg/m2 (reduced to 2000 mg/m2 after recruitment of 1200 patients) q2w intravenously (i.v.) (iddEPC-regimen) or ddEC (E 112.5 mg/m2 + C 600 mg/m2, i.v.q2w for 4 cycles) followed by paclitaxel weekly (Pw 67.5 mg/m2 i.v.q8d for 10 weeks) plus capecitabine (X 2000 mg/m2 p.o.days 1-14, q22 for 4 cycles) (ddEC-PwX-regimen).Further randomization assigned patients to ibandronate for 2 years versus observation and to pegfilgrastim day 2 versus 4.RESULTS: From June 2004 to August 2008, 2994 patients were randomized to either iddEPC (N = 1498), or ddEC-PwX (N = 1496) and started treatment.Median age was 50 years; pN1 (37.8%), pN2 (35.3%); pN3 (26.9%); 46.4% were G3 tumors; 76.9% hormone receptor-positive and 22% HER2-positive.After a median follow-up of 74 months, 645 events and 383 deaths were recorded.Hematological adverse events grades 3-4 were more common with iddEPC (P < 0.001), nonhematological with ddEC-PwX (P = 0.04), even if the toxicity profile of the two regimens was different.At 5 years, estimated disease-free survival rates for ddEC-PwX and iddEPC were 81.7% [95% confidence interval (CI) 79.5-83.6] versus 80.2% (95% CI 78.0-82.2).Hazard ratio (HR)=0.95 (95% CI 0.81-1.11, log-rank P = 0.49).Five-year overall survival rates were 89.4% for ddEC-PwX (95% CI 87.7-91.0) and 89.0% for iddEPC (95% CI 87.2-90.6), HR = 0.85 (95% CI 0.69-1.04, log-rank P = 0.10).CONCLUSION: Adding capecitabine to ddEC-Pw did not improve outcome in comparison to iddEPC but increased toxicity and should not be recommended for further use.",1,1,1,0
32036471,"Cryotherapy for the prevention of weekly paclitaxel-induced peripheral adverse events in breast cancer patients.PURPOSE: This randomized phase II study was conducted to investigate the efficacy of cryotherapy in preventing peripheral neuropathy and dermatological adverse events in breast cancer patients treated with weekly paclitaxel.METHODS: Patients treated with 12 weekly doses of paclitaxel for breast cancer were randomized (1:1) into a cryotherapy or control group.The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients with a marked decrease in the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Neurotoxicity (FACT-NTX) score.The secondary endpoints were Patient Neurotoxicity Questionnaire (PNQ), Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event (CTCAE) for peripheral neuropathy, and FACT-Taxane score.RESULTS: Forty-four patients were randomly assigned to the cryotherapy (n = 22) or control groups (n = 22).The percentage of patients with a marked decrease in FACT-NTX scores was significantly lower in the cryotherapy group than in the control group (41 vs. 73%, p = 0.03).The incidence of CTCAE grade >/= 2 sensory (p = 0.001) and motor peripheral neuropathy (p = 0.01), and PNQ grade D or higher for sensory peripheral neuropathy (p = 0.02), and decrease in the FACT-Taxane score (p = 0.02) were also significantly lower in the cryotherapy group than in the control group.There were no serious side effects associated with cryotherapy.CONCLUSION: Cryotherapy is an effective approach for prevention of peripheral neuropathy and dermatological adverse events in breast cancer patients treated with weekly paclitaxel.",1,1,0,0
34768161,"A randomized, phase II trial of adjuvant immunotherapy with durable TKI-free survival in patients with chronic phase CML.PURPOSE: Chronic myeloid leukemia (CP-CML) patients can achieve undetectable minimal residual disease (UMRD) and discontinue tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).Cellular immunity plays an important role in CML disease control.We conducted a randomized, non-blinded phase II trial of adjuvant immunotherapy with TKIs to facilitate TKI discontinuation.METHODS: TKI-treated patients with CP-CML were randomized to receive the K562/GM-CSF vaccine (vaccine) OR Interferon-alpha + Sargramostim (IFN).If UMRD was achieved, then all treatment was stopped.Patients who did not achieve UMRD within one year, had a molecular relapse, or discontinued therapy for toxicity could crossover.RESULTS: Thirty-four patients were randomized to IFN (n = 18) or vaccine (n = 16), and 21 patients crossed over (IFNvaccine: n = 9, vaccineIFN, n = 12).TKIs at enrollment included imatinib (n = 31), nilotinib (n = 2), and dasatinib (n = 1).No patients discontinued vaccine due to side effects, while 33 % of IFN-treated patients discontinued treatment.More patients randomized to IFN (47.4 %, 95 % CI: 16.7-66.7 %) versus vaccine (25.0 %, 95 % CI: 0.5-43.5 %) achieved UMRD within one year.Seven patients randomized to IFN discontinued treatment with 28.6 % (95 % CI: 8.9-92.2 %) sustaining treatment-free remission (TFR) at 1 year, while three patients randomized to vaccine discontinued treatment with none sustaining TFR.Including crossover, there was a cumulative discontinuation success rate of 36.4 % (95 % CI: 16.6 %-79.5 %) after adjuvant IFN.Patients who sustained TFR received a median of 29 months of imatinib prior to discontinuation.CONCLUSION: Adjuvant IFN led to durable TFRs with limited prior TKI exposure with comparable success to prior discontinuation trials, but many patients stopped IFN early.",1,1,1,0
27603346,"S-1 plus cisplatin with concurrent radiotherapy versus cisplatin alone with concurrent radiotherapy in Chinese patients with nonsmall-cell lung cancer: A multicentre randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of S-1 plus cisplatin combined with concurrent radiotherapy (SCCCR) versus cisplatin alone combined with concurrent radiotherapy (CCCR) in Chinese patients with unresectable stage III nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).METHODS: Between January 2012 and December 2014, 72 eligible Chinese patients with NSCLC were included and randomly divided into 2 groups, each having 36 patients.Patients in the SCCCR group received S-1 plus cisplatin with concurrent, radiotherapy.The other 36 patients in the CCCR group were administered cisplatin with concurrent radiotherapy.The primary outcome was the overall response rate.The secondary outcomes were overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and adverse events.RESULTS: The 3-year overall response rates for the SCCCR and CCCR groups were 60.1% and 53.3%, respectively (P = 0.041).The median OS was 35.1 (range, 6.5-47.2) months and 24.6 (range, 2.8-24.3) months for the SCCCR and CCCR groups, respectively (P = 0.016).The median PFS for the SCCCR and CCCR groups was 31.4 (range, 5.6-39.3) months and 22.3 (range, 2.4-36.5) months, respectively (P = 0.023).The toxicity profiles were similar for both groups.CONCLUSION: The efficacy and safety of SCCCR was more encouraging compared to those of CCCR in Chinese NSCLC patients.In addition, the toxicities in both groups were tolerable.",1,1,1,0
34759002,"Exercise versus usual care after non-reconstructive breast cancer surgery (UK PROSPER): multicentre randomised controlled trial and economic evaluation.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether a structured exercise programme improved functional and health related quality of life outcomes compared with usual care for women at high risk of upper limb disability after breast cancer surgery.DESIGN: Multicentre, pragmatic, superiority, randomised controlled trial with economic evaluation.SETTING: 17 UK National Health Service cancer centres.PARTICIPANTS: 392 women undergoing breast cancer surgery, at risk of postoperative upper limb morbidity, randomised (1:1) to usual care with structured exercise (n=196) or usual care alone (n=196).INTERVENTIONS: Usual care (information leaflets) only or usual care plus a physiotherapy led exercise programme, incorporating stretching, strengthening, physical activity, and behavioural change techniques to support adherence to exercise, introduced at 7-10 days postoperatively, with two further appointments at one and three months.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Disability of Arm, Hand and Shoulder (DASH) questionnaire at 12 months, analysed by intention to treat.Secondary outcomes included DASH subscales, pain, complications, health related quality of life, and resource use, from a health and personal social services perspective.RESULTS: Between 26 January 2016 and 31 July 2017, 951 patients were screened and 392 (mean age 58.1 years) were randomly allocated, with 382 (97%) eligible for intention to treat analysis.181 (95%) of 191 participants allocated to exercise attended at least one appointment.Upper limb function improved after exercise compared with usual care (mean DASH 16.3 (SD 17.6) for exercise (n=132); 23.7 (22.9) usual care (n=138); adjusted mean difference 7.81, 95% confidence interval 3.17 to 12.44; P=0.001).Secondary outcomes favoured exercise over usual care, with lower pain intensity at 12 months (adjusted mean difference on numerical rating scale -0.68, -1.23 to -0.12; P=0.02) and fewer arm disability symptoms at 12 months (adjusted mean difference on Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast+4 (FACT-B+4) -2.02, -3.11 to -0.93; P=0.001).No increase in complications, lymphoedema, or adverse events was noted in participants allocated to exercise.Exercise accrued lower costs per patient (on average - pound387 (euro457; $533) (95% confidence interval - pound2491 to pound1718; 2015 pricing) and was cost effective compared with usual care.CONCLUSIONS: The PROSPER exercise programme was clinically effective and cost effective and reduced upper limb disability one year after breast cancer treatment in patients at risk of treatment related postoperative complications.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN Registry ISRCTN35358984.",1,1,0,0
24613543,"Nimotuzumab provides survival benefit to patients with inoperable advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck: a randomized, open-label, phase IIb, 5-year study in Indian patients.OBJECTIVE: Overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in many cancers makes it an attractive therapeutic target.This study evaluated the clinical utility of nimotuzumab, a monoclonal anti-EGFR antibody, used concurrently with radiotherapy (RT) and chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN).METHODS: This open-label study randomized 92 treatment-naive patients (1:1) with advanced SCCHN into chemoradiation (CRT +/- nimotuzumab) or radiation (RT +/- nimotuzumab) group by investigator's discretion; these were further randomized into CRT + nimotuzumab or CRT and RT + nimotuzumab or RT groups, respectively.Treatment included 6 cycles each of cisplatin (50 mg/week), nimotuzumab (200 mg/week), and RT (total dose, 60-66 Gy).Response (tumor size reduction) was assessed at Month 6 post-treatment and survival, at Month 60.RESULTS: Forty and 36 patients in the chemoradiation and radiation groups, respectively (intent-to-treat population) were evaluated.Overall response at Month 6 post-treatment was 100% with CRT + nimotuzumab, 70% with CRT, 76% with RT + nimotuzumab, and 37% with RT.At Month 60, overall survival was 57% with CRT + nimotuzumab, 26% with CRT (P = 0.03), 39% with RT + nimotuzumab, and 26% with RT (P > 0.05).Median overall survival was not reached for CRT + nimotuzumab; it was 21.94 months for CRT (P = 0.0078), 14.36 months for RT + nimotuzumab, and 12.78 months for RT (P = 0.45).Risk of death was 64% lower with CRT + nimotuzumab than with CRT (95%CI: 0.37, 1.56), and 24% lower with RT + nimotuzumab than with RT (95%CI: 0.16, 0.79).Thus nimotuzumab was safe and well tolerated with few mild to moderate self-limiting adverse events.CONCLUSION: Concurrent use of nimotuzumab with CRT/RT is safe and provides long-term survival benefit.",1,1,1,0

31567943,"Effect of physical fitness on colorectal tumor development in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis.Although accumulated epidemiological evidence indicates that a good physical fitness level may prevent the development of sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC), few studies have examined the effect of physical fitness level on familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP).This cross-sectional study aimed to examine the relationship between physical fitness and CRC development in patients with FAP.A total of 119 patients (54 male; 65 female) with FAP, aged 17 to 73 years, underwent a step test to induce exercise stress.Predicted maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) was calculated for each patient by using heart rate as an index of physical fitness.The association of VO2max with the presence or absence of CRC and polyp diameter was examined.Patients with FAP were divided into 3 categories according to their VO2max (high, medium, and low).The association between maximum polyp size and VO2max among the patients with FAP without a history of colectomy was examined.The risk of CRC was significantly higher in the low VO2max group than in the high VO2max group (odds ratio = 4.07; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-16.26).The maximum polyp diameter was significantly negatively correlated with the VO2max among the patients with FAP without a history of colectomy (r = -.44, P = .01).In the multiple linear regression analysis, maximum polyp diameter was independently correlated with VO2max.Our results suggest a preventive association between physical fitness and CRC development or colorectal adenoma growth exists in patients with FAP.",0,0,0,0
32065769,"Effects of Exercise Therapy Dosing Schedule on Impaired Cardiorespiratory Fitness in Patients With Primary Breast Cancer: A Randomized Controlled Trial.BACKGROUND: Current exercise guidelines for clinical populations recommend an exercise therapy (ET) prescription of fixed intensity (moderate), duration (40-50 minutes per session), and volume (120-160 min/wk).A critical overarching element of exercise programming that has received minimal attention is dose scheduling.We investigated the tolerability and efficacy of 2 exercise training dose regimens on cardiorespiratory fitness and patient-reported outcomes in patients with posttreatment primary breast cancer.METHODS: Using a parallel-group randomized trial, we randomly allocated 174 postmenopausal patients (2.8 years after adjuvant therapy) with impaired peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) to 1 of 2 supervised exercise training interventions delivered with a standard linear (LET) (fixed dose intensity per session for 160 min/wk) or nonlinear (NLET) (variable dose intensity per session for approximately 120 min/wk) schedule compared with a stretching attention control group for 16 consecutive weeks.Stretching was matched to exercise dosing arms on the basis of location, frequency, duration, and treatment length.The primary end point was change in VO2peak (mL O2.kg(-1).min(-1)) from baseline to after intervention.Secondary end points were patient-reported outcomes, tolerability, and safety.RESULTS: No serious adverse events were observed.Mean attendance was 64%, 75%, and 80% for attention control, LET, and NLET, respectively.In intention-to-treat analysis, VO2peak increased 0.6+/-1.7 mL O2.kg(-1).min(-1) (P=0.05) and 0.8+/-1.8 mL O2.kg(-1).min(-1) (P=0.07) in LET and NLET, respectively, compared with attention control.Change in VO2peak ranged from -2.7 to 4.1 mL O2.kg(-1).min(-1) and from -3.6 to 5.1 mL O2.kg(-1).min(-1) in LET and NLET, respectively.Approximately 40% of patients in both exercise dosing regimens were classified as VO2peak responders (ie, Delta >/=1.32 mL O2.kg(-1).min(-1)).NLET improved all patient-reported outcomes compared with attention control.CONCLUSIONS: Short-term exercise training, independently of dosing schedule, is associated with modest improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness in patients previously treated for early-stage breast cancer.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov.Unique identifier: NCT01186367.",1,1,0,0

28209746,"A Phase II Randomized Trial (GO27827) of First-Line FOLFOX Plus Bevacizumab with or Without the MET Inhibitor Onartuzumab in Patients with Metastatic Colorectal Cancer.BACKGROUND: Dysregulated hepatocyte growth factor/mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) signaling is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to vascular endothelial growth factor inhibition in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).We report outcomes from a double-blind, multicenter phase II trial of the MET inhibitor onartuzumab in combination with mFOLFOX-6 and bevacizumab for mCRC (GO27827; NCT01418222).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive onartuzumab (10 mg/kg intravenously [IV]) or placebo plus mFOLFOX-6 and bevacizumab (5 mg/kg IV).Oxaliplatin was given for 8-12 cycles; other agents were continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or death.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) in the intent-to-treat (ITT) and MET immunohistochemistry (IHC) expression-positive populations.RESULTS: Between September 2011 and November 2012, 194 patients were enrolled.In September 2013, an interim analysis recommended stopping onartuzumab treatment due to lack of efficacy.At the time of the final analysis in February 2014, no significant improvement in PFS was seen with onartuzumab versus placebo in either the ITT or MET IHC-positive populations.An improvement in PFS was noted in the MET IHC-negative population.Neither overall survival nor response rate was improved with onartuzumab.The incidence of fatigue, peripheral edema, and deep vein thrombosis was increased with onartuzumab relative to placebo.CONCLUSION: Onartuzumab combined with mFOLFOX-6 and bevacizumab did not significantly improve efficacy outcomes in either the ITT or MET IHC-positive populations.MET expression by IHC was not a predictive biomarker in this setting.The Oncologist 2017;22:264-271 IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The addition of onartuzumab to mFOLFOX-6 plus bevacizumab did not improve outcomes in patients with previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer in this randomized, phase II study.Although initial results with onartuzumab were promising, a number of phase II/III clinical trials have reported a lack of improvement in efficacy with onartuzumab combined with standard-of-care therapies in several tumor types.Furthermore, negative study data have been published for rilotumumab and ficlatuzumab, both of which block hepatocyte growth factor binding to the mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) receptor.MET immunohistochemistry was not a predictive biomarker.It remains to be seen if other biomarkers or small molecule inhibitors may be more appropriate for inhibiting this oncogenic pathway.",1,1,1,1
33539944,"A phase II randomized trial of cobimetinib plus chemotherapy, with or without atezolizumab, as first-line treatment for patients with locally advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (COLET): primary analysis.BACKGROUND: Resistance to standard chemotherapy in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) is associated with upregulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway.Cobimetinib, an MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK) inhibitor, may increase sensitivity to taxanes and programmed death-ligand 1 inhibitors.COLET is a three-cohort phase II study evaluating first-line cobimetinib plus chemotherapy, with or without atezolizumab, in patients with locally advanced or mTNBC.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were >/=18 years with locally advanced or mTNBC.Following a safety run-in, patients in cohort I were randomized 1:1 to cobimetinib (60 mg, D3-D23 of each 28-day cycle) or placebo, plus paclitaxel (80 mg/m(2), D1, 8, and 15).Additional patients were randomized (1:1) to cohort II or III to receive cobimetinib plus atezolizumab (840 mg, D1 and D15) and either paclitaxel (cohort II) or nab-paclitaxel [cohort III (100 mg/m(2), D1, D8, and D15)].Primary endpoints were investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) (cohort I) and confirmed objective response rate (ORR) (cohorts II/III).Safety and tolerability were also assessed.RESULTS: In the expansion stages, median PFS was 5.5 months for cobimetinib/paclitaxel versus 3.8 months for placebo/paclitaxel in cohort I [hazard ratio 0.73; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.43-1.24; P = 0.25].In cohort I, ORR was 38.3% (95% CI 24.40-52.20) for cobimetinib/paclitaxel and 20.9% (95% CI 8.77-33.09) for placebo/paclitaxel; ORRs in cohorts II and III were 34.4% (95% CI 18.57-53.19) and 29.0% (95% CI 14.22-48.04), respectively.Diarrhea was the most common grade >/=3 adverse events across all cohorts.CONCLUSIONS: Cobimetinib added to paclitaxel did not lead to a statistically significant increase in PFS or ORR, although a nonsignificant trend toward a numerical increase was observed.Cobimetinib plus atezolizumab and a taxane did not appear to increase ORR.This demonstrates the potential activity of a combinatorial MEK inhibitor, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy in this difficult-to-treat population.",1,1,1,1

22610788,"Sequential chemoradiotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin for locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma.We investigated a new chemoradiotherapy (CRT) regimen for locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).A total of 240 patients were randomly assigned to three different CRT regimens: sequential CRT [1 cycle chemotherapy + Phase I radiotherapy (RT) + 1 cycle chemotherapy + Phase II RT + 2 cycles chemotherapy] with a cisplatin-gemcitabine (GC) regimen (800 mg/m(2) gemcitabine on Days 1 and 8 and 20 mg/m(2) cisplatin on Days 1-5, every 4 weeks) (sGC-RT); sequential chemoradiotherapy with a cisplatin-fluorouracil (PF) regimen (20 mg/m(2) DDP and 500 mg/m(2) 5-FU on Days 1-5, every 4 weeks) (sPF-RT) and cisplatin-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy plus adjuvant PF chemotherapy (Con-RT + PF).The complete response rate was higher in the sGC + RT group than in the other two groups (98.75% vs. 92.50%, p < 0.01).The 3-year overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) rates in the sGC-RT group were significantly higher than those observed in the Con-RT group (OS, 95.0% vs. 76.3%, p < 0.001; DFS, 89.9% vs. 67.5%, p < 0.001; DMFS, 92.5% vs. 76.0%, p = 0.004) and in the sPF + RT group (OS, 95.0% vs. 73.6%, p < 0.001; DFS, 89.9% vs. 63.3%, p < 0.001; DMFS, 92.5% vs. 74.7%, p = 0.002).There were no significant differences in 3-year OS, DFS and MFS rates between the Con-RT and the sPF-RT groups.The GC-RT group experienced more hematologic toxicity, constipation and rash; however, there were no differences in late RT toxicity between the groups.These results demonstrate that a sGC-RT regimen is effective and well tolerated in patients with locoregionally advanced NPC.",1,1,1,0
27265347,"Adjuvant chemotherapy of S-1 versus gemcitabine for resected pancreatic cancer: a phase 3, open-label, randomised, non-inferiority trial (JASPAC 01).BACKGROUND: Although adjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine is standard care for resected pancreatic cancer, S-1 has shown non-inferiority to gemcitabine for advanced disease.We aimed to investigate the non-inferiority of S-1 to gemcitabine as adjuvant chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer in terms of overall survival.METHODS: We did a randomised, open-label, multicentre, non-inferiority phase 3 trial undertaken at 33 hospitals in Japan.Patients who had histologically proven invasive ductal carcinoma of the pancreas, pathologically documented stage I-III, and no local residual or microscopic residual tumour, and were aged 20 years or older were eligible.Patients with resected pancreatic cancer were randomly assigned (in a 1:1 ratio) to receive gemcitabine (1000 mg/m(2), intravenously administered on days 1, 8, and 15, every 4 weeks [one cycle], for up to six cycles) or S-1 (40 mg, 50 mg, or 60 mg according to body-surface area, orally administered twice a day for 28 days followed by a 14 day rest, every 6 weeks [one cycle], for up to four cycles) at the data centre by a modified minimisation method, balancing residual tumour status, nodal status, and institutions.The primary outcome was overall survival in the two treatment groups, assessed in the per-protocol population, excluding ineligible patients and those not receiving the allocated treatment.The protocol prespecified that the superiority of S-1 with respect to overall survival was also to be assessed in the per-protocol population by a log-rank test, if the non-inferiority of S-1 was verified.We estimated overall and relapse-free survival using the Kaplan-Meier methods, and assessed non-inferiority of S-1 to gemcitabine using the Cox proportional hazard model.The expected hazard ratio (HR) for mortality was 0.87 with a non-inferiority margin of 1.25 (power 80%; one-sided type I error 2.5%).This trial is registered at UMIN CTR (UMIN000000655).FINDINGS: 385 patients were randomly assigned to treatment between April 11, 2007, and June 29, 2010 (193 to the gemcitabine group and 192 to the S-1 group).Of these, three were exlcuded because of ineligibility and five did not receive chemotherapy.The per-protocol population therefore consisted of 190 patients in the gemcitabine group and 187 patients in the S-1 group.On Sept 15, 2012, following the recommendation from the independent data and safety monitoring committee, this study was discontinued because the prespecified criteria for early discontinuation were met at the interim analysis for efficacy, when all the protocol treatments had been finished.Analysis with the follow-up data on Jan 15, 2016, showed HR of mortality was 0.57 (95% CI 0.44-0.72, pnon-inferiority<0.0001, p<0.0001 for superiority), associated with 5-year overall survival of 24.4% (18.6-30.8) in the gemcitabine group and 44.1% (36.9-51.1) in the S-1 group.Grade 3 or 4 leucopenia, neutropenia, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase were observed more frequently in the gemcitabine group, whereas stomatitis and diarrhoea were more frequently experienced in the S-1 group.INTERPRETATION: Adjuvant chemotherapy with S-1 can be a new standard care for resected pancreatic cancer in Japanese patients.These results should be assessed in non-Asian patients.FUNDING: Pharma Valley Center, Shizuoka Industrial Foundation, Taiho Pharmaceutical.",1,1,1,0
34065997,"Effect of Elastic Abdominal Binder on Pain and Functional Recovery Following Gynecologic Cancer Surgery: A Randomized Controlled Trial.Background and Objectives: Clinicians have been using elastic abdominal binder for stabilizing incision site after major abdominal surgery.However, the benefits of that practice have never been formally assessed.The aim of this study was to examine the effects of the use of elastic abdominal binder on postoperative pain and recovery of gynecologic cancer patients.Materials and Methods: One-hundred and nine women diagnosed with cervical, endometrial, or ovarian cancer, who underwent open abdominal surgery were assigned randomly into two groups: intervention (56 patients) and control (53 patients).The women in the intervention group applied abdominal binder from postoperative day 1.For the control group, the women did not wear the binder or similar devices.The primary outcomes were pain and functional recovery.Subgroup analysis on participants age >/= 50 was also performed.Results: For the entire study cohort, the baseline, postoperative day 1, and postoperative day 2 pain scores in the intervention group were significantly lower than the control group.However, there was no significant difference between the groups for postoperative day 3 pain score and for the change in pain scores from the baseline value.Of note, the age >/= 50 subgroup represented a more balanced cohort with comparable baseline pain scores between the study groups.For this population, the pain scores for postoperative day 1-3 were significantly lower in the intervention group.The intervention group had a longer six-minute walking distance on postoperative day 3 with a trend toward a smaller difference in the day 3 distance from the baseline.Conclusions: The potential benefits of abdominal binder use in reducing postoperative pain and improving functional recovery after open gynecologic cancer surgery could be demonstrated only in those age >/= 50.",1,1,0,0

31520215,"Inverse association between changes in energetic cost of walking and vertical accelerations in non-metastatic breast cancer survivors.PURPOSE: With accelerometry, the utility to detect changes in physical activity are predicated on the assumption that walking energetics and gait mechanics do not change.The present work examined associations between changes () in walking energetics, exercise self-efficacy, and several accelerometer-derived metrics.METHODS: Secondary analyses were performed among a sub-sample (n = 29) of breast cancer survivors participating in a larger randomized trial.During 4 min of treadmill walking (0.89 m s(-1), 0% grade), indirect calorimetry quantified steady-state energy expenditure (EE), wherein, participants were fitted with a heart rate monitor and hip-worn triaxial accelerometer.Exercise self-efficacy was measured using a 9-item questionnaire, while vector magnitude (VM) and individual planes (e.g., mediolateral, vertical, and anteroposterior) of the movement were extracted for data analyses.Evaluations were made at baseline and after 3 months.RESULTS: From baseline to 3 months, the energetic cost of walking (kcals min(-1)) significantly decreased by an average of - 5.1% (p = 0.001; d = 0.46).Conversely, VM significantly increased (p = 0.007; d = 0.53), exclusively due to greater vertical accelerations (acc) (+ 5.7 +/- 7.8 acc; p = 0.001; d = 0.69).Changes in vertical accelerations were inversely and positively associated with walking EE (r = - 0.37; p = 0.047) and exercise self-efficacy (r = 0.39; p = 0.034), respectively.CONCLUSION: Hip-worn accelerometers do not appear well-suited to correctly detect changes in ease of walking as evidenced by reduced energetic cost.Further research should determine if a divergence between measured EE and vertical accelerations could contribute to erroneous inferences in free-living physical activity.",0,0,0,0

30094545,"Randomized phase III trial to evaluate radiopharmaceuticals and zoledronic acid in the palliation of osteoblastic metastases from lung, breast, and prostate cancer: report of the NRG Oncology RTOG 0517 trial.BACKGROUND: Skeletal-related events (SREs), common sequelae of metastatic cancer, are reduced by bisphosphonates.In this study, it was postulated that radiopharmaceuticals, added to bisphosphonates, could further decrease the incidence of SREs.METHODS: NRG Oncology RTOG 0517 randomized patients with breast, lung, and prostate cancer and blastic bone metastases to either zoledronic acid (ZA) alone or ZA plus radiopharmaceuticals (Sr-89 or Sm-153).The primary endpoint was time to development of SREs.Secondary objectives included quality of life (QOL), pain control, overall survival (OS), and toxicity.RESULTS: 261 patients (median age 68; 62% male; 55% prostate, 35% breast, 10% lung) were accrued between July 2006 and February 2011.The study closed early due to a lower than expected rate of SREs.52 (42%) patients in the ZA arm and 49 (40%) in the radiopharmaceutical arm experienced an SRE.Median time free of SREs was 29.9 and 27.4 months, respectively (p = 0.84).Median OS in the ZA arm and radiopharmaceutical arms was 32.1 and 26.9 months, respectively (p = 0.37).Cox proportional hazards regression model showed that primary disease site (lung) and number of bone metastases (> 2) had a negative impact on OS (p < 0.0001, p = 0.01, respectively).The addition of radiopharmaceuticals to ZA led to a significant reduction in pain at 1 month based on BPI worst score (p = 0.02).No other group differences were noted for QOL or toxicity.CONCLUSION: The addition of radiopharmaceuticals to bisphosphonates did not alter time to SREs or OS for patients with breast, lung, prostate cancers and blastic bone metastases, although it was associated with significant pain reduction at 1 month.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRY: This protocol (RTOG 0517) is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00365105), and may be viewed online at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00365105?term=RTOG+0517&rank=1 .",1,1,1,0
25975527,"Clip closure of defect after endoscopic resection in patients with larger colorectal tumors decreased the adverse events.BACKGROUND: Clip closure of large colorectal mucosal defects may reduce the rate of adverse events in a cost-effective manner.OBJECTIVE: To assess the adverse events and outcomes of clip closure of defects after endoscopic resection in patients with large colorectal tumors.DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, controlled study.SETTING: Single tertiary referral center.PATIENTS AND INTERVENTIONS: Patients with lesions measuring 1 to 4 cm who were scheduled for endoscopic resection between March 2012 and December 2014 were randomly assigned to a clip-closure group and a no-closure group.In the clip-closure group, the defect of the resection site was completely closed with an endoclip.In the no-closure group, the defect was left open.The following primary outcome measures were assessed: delayed postoperative bleeding, postpolypectomy coagulation syndrome, perforation, and abdominal pain.Secondary outcome measures of length of hospital stay, time required for procedure, and patient's satisfaction were also assessed.RESULTS: Patients and lesions had similar characteristics across both groups.For patients who underwent clip closure (n = 174), the rates of delayed postoperative bleeding (1.1% [2/174]) and postpolypectomy coagulation syndrome (0.6% [1/174]) were lower than those in the no-closure group (6.9% [12/174], P = .01 and 4.6% [8/174], P = .03).Two patients experienced perforation, 1 in each group.In the clip-closure group, 4 patients reported abdominal pain as opposed to 26 in the no-closure group (2.8% vs 16.7%, P < .01).The procedure took longer in the closure group (38.1 minutes vs 30.9 minutes, P = .04).The length of hospitalization was shorter in the closure group (3.1 days vs 4.7 days, P = .03).Total medical expense was similar between the 2 groups.Patients who underwent closure reported greater satisfaction.LIMITATION: This was a single-center analysis.CONCLUSIONS: Clip closure of endoscopic resection defects in patients with large colorectal tumors decreased the rate of procedure-related adverse events and did not increase the cost of hospitalization.",1,1,1,0
33616652,"Addition of lenalidomide to intensive treatment in younger and middle-aged adults with newly diagnosed AML: the HOVON-SAKK-132 trial.Lenalidomide, an antineoplastic and immunomodulatory drug, has therapeutic activity in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but definitive studies about its therapeutic utility have been lacking.In a phase 3 study, we compared 2 induction regimens in newly diagnosed patients age 18 to 65 years with AML: idarubicine-cytarabine (cycle 1) and daunorubicin and intermediate-dose cytarabine (cycle 2) without or with lenalidomide (15 mg orally on days 1-21).One final consolidation cycle of chemotherapy or autologous stem cell transplantation (auto-SCT) or allogeneic SCT (allo-SCT) was provided according to a prognostic risk and minimal residual disease (MRD)-adapted approach.Event-free survival (EFS; primary end point) and other clinical end points were assessed.A second random assignment in patients in complete response or in complete response with incomplete hematologic recovery after cycle 3 or auto-SCT involved 6 cycles of maintenance with lenalidomide (10 mg on days 1-21) or observation.In all, 392 patients were randomly assigned to the control group, and 388 patients were randomly assigned to lenalidomide induction.At a median follow-up of 41 months, the study revealed no differences in outcome between the treatments (EFS, 44% +/- 2% standard error and overall survival, 54% +/- 2% at 4 years for both arms) although in an exploratory post hoc analysis, a lenalidomide benefit was suggested in SRSF2-mutant AML.In relation to the previous Dutch-Belgian Hemato-Oncology Cooperative Group and Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research (HOVON-SAKK) studies that used a similar 3-cycle regimen but did not pursue an MRD-guided approach, these survival estimates compare markedly more favorably.MRD status after cycle 2 lost prognostic value in intermediate-risk AML in the risk-adjusted treatment context.Maintenance with lenalidomide showed no apparent effect on relapse probability in 88 patients randomly assigned for this part of the study.",1,1,1,0

31699709,"Combined Vaccination with NY-ESO-1 Protein, Poly-ICLC, and Montanide Improves Humoral and Cellular Immune Responses in Patients with High-Risk Melanoma.Given its ability to induce both humoral and cellular immune responses, NY-ESO-1 has been considered a suitable antigen for a cancer vaccine.Despite promising results from early-phase clinical studies in patients with melanoma, NY-ESO-1 vaccine immunotherapy has not been widely investigated in larger trials; consequently, many questions remain as to the optimal vaccine formulation, predictive biomarkers, and sequencing and timing of vaccines in melanoma treatment.We conducted an adjuvant phase I/II clinical trial in high-risk resected melanoma to optimize the delivery of poly-ICLC, a TLR-3/MDA-5 agonist, as a component of vaccine formulation.A phase I dose-escalation part was undertaken to identify the MTD of poly-ICLC administered in combination with NY-ESO-1 and montanide.This was followed by a randomized phase II part investigating the MTD of poly-ICLC with NY-ESO-1 with or without montanide.The vaccine regimens were generally well tolerated, with no treatment-related grade 3/4 adverse events.Both regimens induced integrated NY-ESO-1-specific CD4(+) T-cell and humoral responses.CD8(+) T-cell responses were mainly detected in patients receiving montanide.T-cell avidity toward NY-ESO-1 peptides was higher in patients vaccinated with montanide.In conclusion, NY-ESO-1 protein in combination with poly-ICLC is safe, well tolerated, and capable of inducing integrated antibody and CD4(+) T-cell responses in most patients.Combination with montanide enhances antigen-specific T-cell avidity and CD8(+) T-cell cross-priming in a fraction of patients, indicating that montanide contributes to the induction of specific CD8(+) T-cell responses to NY-ESO-1.",0,0,0,0
23871490,"2 years versus 1 year of adjuvant trastuzumab for HER2-positive breast cancer (HERA): an open-label, randomised controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Trastuzumab has established efficacy against breast cancer with overexpression or amplification of the HER2 oncogene.The standard of care is 1 year of adjuvant trastuzumab, but the optimum duration of treatment is unknown.We compared 2 years of treatment with trastuzumab with 1 year of treatment, and updated the comparison of 1 year of trastuzumab versus observation at a median follow-up of 8 years, for patients enrolled in the HERceptin Adjuvant (HERA) trial.METHODS: The HERA trial is an international, multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial comparing treatment with trastuzumab for 1 and 2 years with observation after standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy, adjuvant chemotherapy, or both in 5102 patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer.The primary endpoint was disease-free survival.The comparison of 2 years versus 1 year of trastuzumab treatment involved a landmark analysis of 3105 patients who were disease-free 12 months after randomisation to one of the trastuzumab groups, and was planned after observing at least 725 disease-free survival events.The updated intention-to-treat comparison of 1 year trastuzumab treatment versus observation alone in 3399 patients at a median follow-up of 8 years (range 0-10) is also reported.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00045032.FINDINGS: We recorded 367 events of disease-free survival in 1552 patients in the 1 year group and 367 events in 1553 patients in the 2 year group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.99, 95% CI 0.85-1.14, p=0.86).Grade 3-4 adverse events and decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction during treatment were reported more frequently in the 2 year treatment group than in the 1 year group (342 [20.4%] vs 275 [16.3%] grade 3-4 adverse events, and 120 [7.2%] vs 69 [4.1%] decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction, respectively).HRs for a comparison of 1 year of trastuzumab treatment versus observation were 0.76 (95% CI 0.67-0.86, p<0.0001) for disease-free survival and 0.76 (0.65-0.88, p=0.0005) for overall survival, despite crossover of 884 (52%) patients from the observation group to trastuzumab therapy.INTERPRETATION: 2 years of adjuvant trastuzumab is not more effective than is 1 year of treatment for patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer.1 year of treatment provides a significant disease-free and overall survival benefit compared with observation and remains the standard of care.FUNDING: F Hoffmann-La Roche (Roche).",1,1,1,1

32529467,"A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of B-cell lymphoma 2 homology 3 mimetic gossypol combined with docetaxel and cisplatin for advanced non-small cell lung cancer with high expression of apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1.Background Overexpression of apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) is an important cause of poor chemotherapeutic efficacy in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.Gossypol, a new inhibitor of APE1, in combination with docetaxel and cisplatin is believed to improve the efficacy of chemotherapy for advanced NSCLC with high APE1 expression.Methods Sixty-two patients were randomly assigned to two groups.Thirty-one patients in the experimental group received 75 mg/m(2) docetaxel and 75 mg/m(2) cisplatin on day 1 with gossypol administered at 20 mg once daily on days 1 to 14 every 21 days.The control group received placebo with the same docetaxel and cisplatin regimen.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS); secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), response rate, and toxicity.Results There were no significant differences in PFS and OS between the experimental group and the control group.The median PFS (mPFS) in the experimental and control groups was 7.43 and 4.9 months, respectively (HR = 0.54; p = 0.06), and the median OS (mOS) was 18.37 and 14.7 months, respectively (HR = 0.68; p = 0.27).No significant differences in response rate and serious adverse events were found between the groups.Conclusion The experimental group had a better mPFS and mOS than did the control group, though no significant difference was observed.Because the regimen of gossypol combined with docetaxel and cisplatin was well tolerated, future studies with larger sample sizes should be performed.",1,1,1,1
23093864,"Intrabone transplant of cord blood stem cells establishes a local engraftment store: a functional PET/FDG study.BACKGROUND: Despite advancements in comprehension of molecular mechanisms governing bone marrow (BM) homing of hematopoietic stem cells, cord blood transplant (CBT) suffers from a slow rate of hematopoietic recovery.Intrabone (i.b.)injection has been proposed as a method able to improve speed of BM engraftment with respect to conventional i.v.protocols.However, the mechanisms underlying this benefit are largely unknown.AIM: To verify whether i.b.-CBT determines a local engraftment able to predict the reconstitution of recipient hematopoiesis.DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty-one patients with hematologic malignancies received i.b. injection into both iliac crests of 3.2 +/-0.68 * 107/kg cord blood cells.One month following i.b.-CBT, PET-CT imaging was performed.Maximal standardized uptake values (SUVs) were assessed in BM of both iliac crests and in all lumbar vertebrae.RESULTS: Maximal SUV within iliac crests was higher than in lumbar vertebrae (4.1 +/- 1.7 versus 3.2 +/- 0.7, resp., P = 0.01).However, metabolic activity in these two different BM districts was significantly correlated (r = 0.7, P < 0.001).Moreover, FDG uptake values within the injection site closely predicted platelet recovery 100 days after i.b.-CBT (r = 0.72, P < 0.01).CONCLUSIONS: The metabolic activity of injected BM predicts the subsequent rate of hematopoietic recovery after i.b.-CBT, suggesting a pivotal role of the local engraftment in the reconstitution of recipient hematopoiesis.",0,0,0,0
24290734,"Bioequivalence of Liposome-Entrapped Paclitaxel Easy-To-Use (LEP-ETU) formulation and paclitaxel in polyethoxylated castor oil: a randomized, two-period crossover study in patients with advanced cancer.BACKGROUND: Preclinical studies comparing paclitaxel formulated with polyethoxylated castor oil with the sonicated formulation of liposome-entrapped paclitaxel (LEP) have demonstrated that LEP was associated with reduced toxicity while maintaining similar efficacy.Preliminary studies on the pharmacokinetics in patients support earlier preclinical data, which suggested that the LEP Easy-to-Use (LEP-ETU) formulation and paclitaxel formulated with castor oil may have comparable pharmacokinetic properties.OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were: (1) to determine bioequivalence of paclitaxel pharmaceutically formulated as LEP-ETU (test) and paclitaxel formulated with castor oil (reference); and (2) to assess the tolerability of LEP-ETU following intravenous administration.METHODS: Patients with advanced cancer were studied in a randomized, 2-period crossover bioequivalence study.Patients received paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2) administered as an intravenous infusion over 180 minutes, either as a single-treatment cycle of the test formulation followed by a single-treatment cycle of the reference formulation, or vice versa.RESULTS: Thirty-two of 58 patients were evaluable and were included in the analysis for bioequivalence.Mean total paclitaxel Cmax values for the test and reference formulations were 4955.0 and 5108.8 ng/mL, respectively.Corresponding AUC0-infinity values were 15,853.8 and 18,550.8 ng.h/mL, respectively.Treatment ratios of the geometric means were 97% (90% CI, 91%-103%) for Cmax and 84% (90% CI, 80%-90%) for AUC0-infinity.These results met the required 80% to 125% bioequivalence criteria.The most frequently reported adverse events after LEP-ETU administration were fatigue, alopecia, and myalgia.CONCLUSION: At the studied dose regimen, LEP-ETU showed bioequivalence with paclitaxel formulated with polyethoxylated castor oil.",1,1,0,0
26931369,"Immunobiological effects of gemcitabine and capecitabine combination chemotherapy in advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.BACKGROUND: Preclinical studies suggest that chemotherapy may enhance the immune response against pancreatic cancer.METHODS: The levels of granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) and the associated inflammatory marker C-reactive protein (CRP) were assessed in 38 patients receiving gemcitabine and capecitabine combination chemotherapy for advanced pancreatic cancer within the TeloVac trial.Apoptosis (M30) and total immune response (delayed-type hypersensitivity and/or T-cell response) were also assessed and levels of apoptosis induction correlated with immune response.The telomerase GV1001 vaccine was given either sequentially (n=18) or concomitantly (n=24) with the combination chemotherapy.RESULTS: There were no differences between baseline and post-treatment levels of CRP (P=0.19), IL-6 (P=0.19) and GM-CSF (P=0.71).There was a positive correlation between post-chemotherapy CRP and IL-6 levels (r=0.45, P=0.005) and between CRP with carbohydrate antigen-19-9 (CA19-9) levels at baseline (r=0.45, P=0.015) and post treatment (r=0.40, P=0.015).The change in CRP and IL-6 levels was positively correlated (r=0.40, P=0.012).Hazard ratios (95% CI) for baseline CA19-9 (1.30 (1.07-1.59), P=0.009) and CRP (1.55 (1.00-2.39), P=0.049) levels were each independently predictive of survival.The M30 mean matched differences between pre- and post-chemotherapy showed evidence of apoptosis in both the sequential (P=0.058) and concurrent (P=0.0018) chemoimmunotherapy arms.Respectively, 5 of 10 and 9 of 20 patients had a positive immune response but there was no association with apoptosis.CONCLUSIONS: Combination gemcitabine and capecitabine chemotherapy did not affect circulating levels of GM-CSF, IL-6 and CRP.Chemotherapy-induced apoptosis was not associated with the immunogenicity induced by the GV1001 vaccine in advanced pancreatic cancer.",0,0,0,0
28322759,"Validation and Refinement of Prediction Models to Estimate Exercise Capacity in Cancer Survivors Using the Steep Ramp Test.OBJECTIVE: To further test the validity and clinical usefulness of the steep ramp test (SRT) in estimating exercise tolerance in cancer survivors by external validation and extension of previously published prediction models for peak oxygen consumption (Vo2peak) and peak power output (Wpeak).DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.SETTING: Multicenter.PARTICIPANTS: Cancer survivors (N=283) in 2 randomized controlled exercise trials.INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prediction model accuracy was assessed by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and limits of agreement (LOA).Multiple linear regression was used for model extension.Clinical performance was judged by the percentage of accurate endurance exercise prescriptions.RESULTS: ICCs of SRT-predicted Vo2peak and Wpeak with these values as obtained by the cardiopulmonary exercise test were .61 and .73, respectively, using the previously published prediction models.95% LOA were +/-705mL/min with a bias of 190mL/min for Vo2peak and +/-59W with a bias of 5W for Wpeak.Modest improvements were obtained by adding body weight and sex to the regression equation for the prediction of Vo2peak (ICC, .73; 95% LOA, +/-608mL/min) and by adding age, height, and sex for the prediction of Wpeak (ICC, .81; 95% LOA, +/-48W).Accuracy of endurance exercise prescription improved from 57% accurate prescriptions to 68% accurate prescriptions with the new prediction model for Wpeak.CONCLUSIONS: Predictions of Vo2peak and Wpeak based on the SRT are adequate at the group level, but insufficiently accurate in individual patients.The multivariable prediction model for Wpeak can be used cautiously (eg, supplemented with a Borg score) to aid endurance exercise prescription.",0,0,0,0
26715229,"Long-Term Effects of Two Formats of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia Comorbid with Breast Cancer.STUDY OBJECTIVES: The goal of this randomized controlled trial, conducted in breast cancer patients, was to assess the long-term efficacy of a video-based cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (VCBT-I), as compared to a professionally administered intervention (PCBT-I) and to a no-treatment group (CTL).An earlier report revealed that, at posttreatment, VCBT-I patients showed significantly greater sleep improvements than CTL, but that PCBT-I produced superior effects than VCBT-I on some sleep and secondary outcomes.In this report, long-term effects are compared.METHODS: Two hundred forty-two women with breast cancer and with insomnia symptoms or using hypnotic medications participated to this three-arm randomized controlled trial: (1) PCBT-I (n = 81); (2) VCBT-I (n = 80); or (3) no treatment (CTL; n = 81) group.PCBT-I was composed of six weekly, individual sessions of approximately 50 min, whereas VCBT-I comprised a 60-min animated video and six booklets.RESULTS: Study measures (sleep and secondary variables) were administered at pretreatment and posttreatment, and at a 3-, 6-, and 12-mo follow-up.Treatment gains were well sustained at follow-up in both PCBT-I and VCBT-I. As at posttreatment, the remission rate of insomnia at follow-up was greater in PCBT-I than in VCBT-I, which was greater than in CTL.CONCLUSIONS: Although face-to-face therapy remains the optimal format to efficaciously administer CBT for insomnia in cancer patients, a minimal intervention, such as the video-based intervention tested in this study, produces significant and sustainable treatment effects.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00674830.",1,1,0,0

24924798,"Patient-reported genitourinary dysfunction after laparoscopic and open rectal cancer surgery in a randomized trial (COLOR II).BACKGROUND: This article reports on patient-reported sexual dysfunction and micturition symptoms following a randomized trial of laparoscopic and open surgery for rectal cancer.METHODS: Patients in the COLOR II randomized trial, comparing laparoscopic and open surgery for rectal cancer, completed the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-CR38 questionnaire before surgery, and after 4 weeks, 6, 12 and 24 months.Adjusted mean differences on a 100-point scale were calculated using changes from baseline value at the various time points in the domains of sexual functioning, sexual enjoyment, male and female sexual problems, and micturition symptoms.RESULTS: Of 617 randomized patients, 385 completed this phase of the trial.Their mean age was 67.1 years.Surgery caused an anticipated reduction in genitourinary function after 4 weeks, with no significant differences between laparoscopic and open approaches.An improvement in sexual dysfunction was seen in the first year, but some male sexual problems persisted.Before operation 64.5 per cent of men in the laparoscopic group and 55.6 per cent in the open group reported some degree of erectile dysfunction.This increased to 81.1 and 80.5 per cent respectively 4 weeks after surgery, and 76.3 versus 75.5 per cent at 12 months, with no significant differences between groups.Micturition symptoms were less affected than sexual function and gradually improved to preoperative levels by 6 months.Adjusting for confounders, including radiotherapy, did not change these results.CONCLUSION: Sexual dysfunction is common in patients with rectal cancer, and treatment (including surgery) increases the proportion of patients affected.A laparoscopic approach does not change this.REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT00297791 (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov).",0,0,0,0
28679552,"Randomized controlled trial of dietary fiber for the prevention of radiation-induced gastrointestinal toxicity during pelvic radiotherapy.Background: Therapeutic radiotherapy is an important treatment of pelvic cancers.Historically, low-fiber diets have been recommended despite a lack of evidence and potentially beneficial mechanisms of fiber.Objective: This randomized controlled trial compared low-, habitual-, and high-fiber diets for the prevention of gastrointestinal toxicity in patients undergoing pelvic radiotherapy.Design: Patients were randomly assigned to low-fiber [</=10 g nonstarch polysaccharide (NSP)/d], habitual-fiber (control), or high-fiber (>/=18 g NSP/d) diets and received individualized counseling at the start of radiotherapy to achieve these targets.The primary endpoint was the difference between groups in the change in the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire-Bowel Subset (IBDQ-B) score between the starting and nadir (worst) score during treatment.Other measures included macronutrient intake, stool diaries, and fecal short-chain fatty acid concentrations.Results: Patients were randomly assigned to low-fiber (n = 55), habitual-fiber (n = 55), or high-fiber (n = 56) dietary advice.Fiber intakes were significantly different between groups (P < 0.001).The difference between groups in the change in IBDQ-B scores between the start and nadir was not significant (P = 0.093).However, the change in score between the start and end of radiotherapy was smaller in the high-fiber group (mean +/- SD: -3.7 +/- 12.8) than in the habitual-fiber group (-10.8 +/-13.5; P = 0.011).At 1-y postradiotherapy (n = 126) the difference in IBDQ-B scores between the high-fiber (+0.1 +/- 14.5) and the habitual-fiber (-8.4 +/- 13.3) groups was significant (P = 0.004).No significant differences were observed in stool frequency or form or in short-chain fatty acid concentrations.Significant reductions in energy, protein, and fat intake occurred in the low- and habitual-fiber groups only.Conclusions: Dietary advice to follow a high-fiber diet during pelvic radiotherapy resulted in reduced gastrointestinal toxicity both acutely and at 1 y compared with habitual-fiber intake.Restrictive, non-evidence-based advice to reduce fiber intake in this setting should be abandoned.This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT 01170299.",1,1,0,0

33947608,"Time to Resolution of Axitinib-Related Adverse Events After Treatment Interruption in Patients With Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma.INTRODUCTION: Combined axitinib and immuno-oncology (IO) therapy is approved for first-line advanced renal cell carcinoma.Overlapping toxicities represent a clinical challenge.Calculating the time to resolution (TTR) of common axitinib-related adverse events (AEs) after treatment interruption may help to identify AE etiology and determine appropriate management strategies.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from 5 randomized or single-arm axitinib monotherapy or combination studies were analyzed.Patients with histologically confirmed clear cell advanced renal cell carcinoma were pooled into 3 cohorts based on treatment received: axitinib monotherapy, axitinib + IO, and other tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).Any grade and grade >/=3 treatment-emergent diarrhea, fatigue, hypertension, nausea, and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome were assessed.TTR was defined as the time from treatment interruption/discontinuation to resolution.RESULTS: The axitinib monotherapy cohort comprised 532 patients, the axitinib + IO cohort 541 patients, and the other TKI cohort 882 patients.Median TTR for all AEs (any grade) in the axitinib monotherapy cohort ranged from 1 to 3 days, except for fatigue (8 days).For diarrhea, hypertension, nausea, and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome, median TTRs were longer in the axitinib + IO (4-11 days) and other TKI (7-8 days) cohorts versus the monotherapy cohort.Results were similar when only AEs of grade >/=3 were considered.CONCLUSIONS: The TTR of monotherapeutic axitinib-related AEs is </=3 days, except for fatigue, and generally shorter than for other single-agent TKIs and axitinib + IO.This has important implications for identifying AE etiology with combined axitinib-IO therapy and implementation of appropriate management strategies.ClinicalTrials.org identifiers: NCT00678392, NCT00920816, NCT02493751, NCT02684006, NCT02853331.",0,0,0,0

30998694,"""Hey, that could be me"": The role of similarity in narrative persuasion.Stories are often used in health communication because of accumulating evidence of their potential to affect people's attitudes and health behavioral intentions.Similarity between the reader and the story's protagonist appears to positively influence narrative persuasion, but the exact role of similarity on persuasive outcomes is debated, as some research finds clear effects of similarity manipulations whereas others do not.Possibly, these mixed results were found because the similarity manipulations were not always relevant to the topic of the story.We conducted an experiment (N = 582) in which we varied the age and gender of the protagonist, features that were of central relevance to the story's topic, namely breast cancer versus testicular cancer.There were two groups of participants: 324 students (mean age: 21.46 years) and 258 older adults (mean age: 56.83 years).Age similarity (but not gender similarity) had an effect on identification with the protagonist, transportation (i.e. the experience of being absorbed into a story), and the intention to donate, but only for students.For older adults, age or gender of the protagonist did not seem to matter, as nearly no differences in persuasive measures were found.As far as the underlying mechanism is concerned, the results of structural equation modeling showed that the concept of 'perceived similarity' would be a relevant addition to models of narrative persuasion, as it was significantly related to the narrative processes of transportation and identification, which, in turn, predicted attitudes and behavioral intentions, both directly-in the case of transportation-or indirectly, via the emotion of compassion.We conclude that both manipulated and perceived similarity are important for narrative persuasion, and that it should be kept on the research agenda of health communication.",0,0,0,0
24670844,"Comparative effectiveness of sphincter-sparing surgery versus abdominoperineal resection in rectal cancer: patient-reported outcomes in National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project randomized trial R-04.OBJECTIVE: National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) R-04 was a randomized controlled trial of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in patients with resectable stage II-III rectal cancer.We hypothesized that patients who underwent abdominoperineal resection (APR) would have a poorer quality of life than those who underwent sphincter-sparing surgery (SSS).METHODS: To obtain patient-reported outcomes (PROs) we administered two symptom scales at baseline and 1 year postoperatively: the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Colorectal (FACT-C) and the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer module for patients with Colorectal Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-CR38).Scoring was stratified by nonrandomly assigned definitive surgery (APR vs SSS).Analyses controlled for baseline scores and stratification factors: age, sex, stage, intended surgery, and randomly assigned chemoradiotherapy.RESULTS: Of 1,608 randomly assigned patients, 987 had data for planned analyses; 62% underwent SSS; 38% underwent APR.FACT-C total and subscale scores were not statistically different by surgery at 1 year.For the EORTC QLQ-CR38 functional scales, APR patients reported worse body image (70.3 vs 77.0, P = 0.0005) at 1 year than did SSS patients.Males undergoing APR reported worse sexual enjoyment (43.7 vs 54.7, P = 0.02) at 1 year than did those undergoing SSS.For the EORTC QLQ-CR38 symptom scale scores, APR patients reported worse micturition symptoms than the SSS group at 1 year (26.9 vs 21.5, P = 0.03).SSS patients reported worse gastrointestinal tract symptoms than did the APR patients (18.9 vs 15.2, P < 0.0001), as well as weight loss (10.1 vs 6.0, P = 0.002).CONCLUSIONS: Symptoms and functional problems were detected at 1 year by EORTC QLQ-CR38, reflecting different symptom profiles in patients who underwent APR than those who underwent SSS.Information from these PROs may be useful in counseling patients anticipating surgery for rectal cancer.",0,0,0,0
31553661,"Adjuvant Whole-Brain Radiation Therapy Compared With Observation After Local Treatment of Melanoma Brain Metastases: A Multicenter, Randomized Phase III Trial.PURPOSE: The brain is a common site of metastasis for patients with high-risk melanoma.Although surgery or stereotactic radiosurgery are highly effective local treatments for a small number of metastases, there is a high risk of developing additional brain metastases.The role of adjuvant whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) in reducing new metastases is controversial, with a lack of high-level evidence specifically for melanoma.METHODS: In this randomized phase III trial, patients who had local treatment of one to three melanoma brain metastases were randomly assigned to WBRT or observation.The primary end point was distant intracranial failure within 12 months, and secondary end points included time to intracranial failure, survival, and time to deterioration in performance status.RESULTS: Between April 2009 and September 2017, 215 patients were randomly assigned from 24 centers.Median follow-up was 48.1 months (range, 39.6 to 68 months).Forty-two percent of patients in the WBRT group and 50.5% of those in the observation developed distant intracranial failure within 12 months (odds ratio, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.41 to 1.23; P = .22) and the rates over the entire follow-up period were 52.0% and 57.9%, respectively (odds ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.45 to 1.36; P = .39).Local failure rate was lower after WBRT (20.0% v 33.6%; P = .03).At 12 months, 41.5% of patients in the WBRT group and 51.4% of patients in the observation group had died (P = .28), with no difference in the rate of neurologic death.Median time to deterioration in performance status was 3.8 months after WBRT and 4.4 months with observation (P = .32).WBRT was associated with more grade 1 to 2 acute toxicity.CONCLUSION: After local treatment of one to three melanoma brain metastases, adjuvant WBRT does not provide clinical benefit in terms of distant intracranial control, survival, or preservation of performance status.",1,1,0,0

31720816,"Cost-effectiveness analysis of gemcitabine plus cisplatin versus fluorouracil plus cisplatin in the first-line setting for Chinese patients with metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma.PURPOSE: A randomized phase III trial demonstrated that gemcitabine plus cisplatin (GP) prolonged progression-free survival and overall survival compared with fluorouracil plus cisplatin (FP) as first-line chemotherapy in patients with metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).The cost-effectiveness analysis was designed to identify the economic option for metastatic NPC from a Chinese societal perspective.METHODS: We established a Markov model that involved three health states representing the stages of disease to simulate therapy.Survival data of clinical outcomes were derived from the trial and adjusted to quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).Transition probabilities and health utilities were obtained from the clinical trial and published literatures.The cost-effective strategy was estimated for these treatments using a willing-to-pay (WTP) threshold.A one-way sensitivity analysis was conducted to study the influences of parameters.RESULTS: GP treatment group produced a gain of 0.37 QALYs with an incremental cost of $2520.80, yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $6812.97 per QALY, compared with FP treatment ($15,530.96 versus $13,010.16).The ICER was lower than the accepted WTP threshold, which was 3 times gross domestic product per capita of China ($25,749 per QALY).CONCLUSION: GP regimen is more cost-effective compared with FP regimen as the first-line treatment for Chinese patients with metastatic NPC.",0,0,0,0
31036088,"A multicenter phase III study comparing Simultaneous Integrated Boost (SIB) radiotherapy concurrent and consolidated with S-1 versus SIB alone in elderly patients with esophageal and esophagogastric cancer - the 3JECROG P-01 study protocol.BACKGROUND: The importance of definitive radiotherapy for elderly patients with esophageal and esophagogastric-junction cancer is pronounced.However, little is known in terms of the best way to combine radiotherapy with other treatment options.This study aims to compare the efficiency of SIB radiotherapy alone with SIB radiotherapy concurrent and consolidated with S-1 for elderly patients.Comprehensive geriatric assessment is also incorporated in the procedure of treatment.METHODS/DESIGN: The study is a two arm, open, randomized multicenter Phase III trial with patients over 70 years old with stage IIA-IVB (UICC 2002, IVB only with metastasis to supraclavicular or celiac lymph nodes) squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma of esophagus or gastroesophageal junction.A total of 300 patients will be randomized using a 1:1 allocation ratio stratified by disease stage and study site.Patients allocated to the SIB arm will receive definitive SIB radiotherapy (95%PTV/PGTV 50.4Gy/59.92Gy/28f) while those randomized to SIB + S-1 arm will receive definitive SIB radiotherapy concurrent and consolidated with S-1.The primary endpoint of the trial is 1-year overall survival.Secondary objectives include progression-free survival, recurrence-free survival (local-regional and distant), disease failure pattern, toxicity profile as well as quality of life.Besides, detailed radiotherapy protocol and quality assurance procedure have been incorporated into this trial.DISCUSSION: The proportion of elderly patients in esophageal cancer is now growing, but there is a lack of evidence in term of treatment standard for this group of patients, which is what we aim to obtain through this prospective phase III study.TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov NCT02979691 .Registered November 22, 2016.",1,1,1,0
30807234,"Cyclin E1 Expression and Palbociclib Efficacy in Previously Treated Hormone Receptor-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer.PURPOSE: A large-panel gene expression analysis was conducted to identify biomarkers associated with the effectiveness of adding palbociclib to fulvestrant.METHODS: The PALOMA-3 ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01942135) trial randomly assigned 521 endocrine-pretreated patients with metastatic breast cancer to receive palbociclib plus fulvestrant or placebo plus fulvestrant.Primary analysis was first conducted on 10 genes on the basis of pathway biology and evidence from previous studies followed by a systematic panel-wide search among 2,534 cancer-related genes.The association of gene expression with the effect of palbociclib on progression-free survival (PFS) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, with gene expression as a continuous variable or dichotomized by median.An independent breast cancer cohort from the Preoperative Palbociclib (POP) Clinical Trial ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02008734) was used for validation, in 61 patients with primary breast cancer treated with 2 weeks of palbociclib.RESULTS: In the PALOMA-3 trial, 302 patients had tumor tissue analyzed (palbociclib arm, 194 patients; placebo arm, 108 patients).Palbociclib efficacy was lower in patients with high versus low cyclin E1 (CCNE1) mRNA expression (median PFS: palbociclib arm, 7.6 v 14.1 months; placebo arm, 4.0 v 4.8 months, respectively; interaction P unadjusted = .00238; false discovery rate-adjusted P = .0238).CCNE1 mRNA was more predictive in metastatic than in archival primary biopsy tissue samples.No significant interaction was found between treatment and expression levels of CDK4, CDK6, cyclin D1, and RB1.Palbociclib was efficacious in both luminal A and luminal B tumors.High CCNE1 mRNA expression was associated with poor antiproliferative activity of palbociclib in the POP trial (P = .005).CONCLUSION: Addition of palbociclib to fulvestrant demonstrated efficacy in all biomarker groups, although high CCNE1 mRNA expression was associated with relative resistance to palbociclib.",1,1,1,1
31573911,"Tailored Web-Based Information for Younger and Older Patients with Cancer: Randomized Controlled Trial of a Preparatory Educational Intervention on Patient Outcomes.BACKGROUND: Many patients with cancer, including older patients (aged >/=65 years), consult the Web to prepare for their doctor's visit.In particular, older patients have varying needs regarding the mode in which information is presented (eg, via textual, visual, or audiovisual modes) owing to age-related sensory (eg, impaired vision and hearing) and cognitive decline (eg, reduced processing speed).Therefore, Web-based information targeted at older patient populations is likely to be used and processed more effectively, and evaluated more positively, when tailored to age-related capabilities and preferences.This, in turn, may benefit patient outcomes.OBJECTIVE: This randomized controlled trial tested the effects of a Web-based tailored educational intervention among newly diagnosed younger (<65 years) and older (>/=65 years) patients with cancer.We compared the intervention group who viewed a mode-tailored website (ie, enabling patients to tailor information using textual, visual, and audiovisual modes) with 3 control groups view a nontailored website (ie, text only, text with images, and text with videos).We examined website experience outcomes (ie, website satisfaction, website involvement, knowledge, anxiety, and communication self-efficacy) and consultation experience outcomes (ie, question asking during consultation, anxiety, and information recall).METHODS: Patients from a multidisciplinary outpatient clinic (N=232) viewed a mode-tailored or nontailored website as preparation before their hospital consultations to discuss diagnosis and treatment.Data were collected before (T1), during (T2), and after (T3) visitation.Website experience outcomes were assessed with questionnaires (T1).Patients' question asking was coded from videotaped consultations, and anxiety was assessed through a questionnaire (T2).Telephone interviews were conducted to assess knowledge acquired from the website before (T1) and after consultation (T3), and information recall from the consultation (T3).RESULTS: The preparatory website was well used across all conditions (mean 34 min).Younger patients viewing the mode-tailored website were more satisfied before consultation (P=.02) and reported lower anxiety after consultation (P=.046; vs text only).This pattern was not found in older patients.Mode tailoring yielded no other significant differences in patient outcomes.Regression analyses showed that website involvement (beta=.15; P=.03) and, to a lesser extent, website satisfaction (beta=.15; P=.05) positively associated with knowledge before consultation (T1).In turn, higher knowledge before consultation (beta=.39; P<.001), together with time on the website (beta=.21; P=.002; T1), predicted information recall from consultations (T3).Patients with higher knowledge before consultation (T1) also reported higher knowledge from the website afterward (T3; beta=.22; P=.003).CONCLUSIONS: Offering preparatory online information before consultations benefits information processing and patient outcomes of both younger and older newly diagnosed patients with cancer.Younger patients benefit even more when information is offered in a mode-tailored manner.We discuss the theoretical, methodological, and practical implications for patient-provider communication research in an electronic health era.CLINICAL TRIAL: Netherlands Trial Register NTR5904; https://www.trialregister.nl/trial/5750.",1,1,0,0
23706168,"Difference in overall and age-specific prevalence of high-risk human papillomavirus infection in Italy: evidence from NTCC trial.BACKGROUND: Although among women a decreasing prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection with increasing age has been consistently observed in high-resource countries, different age profiles have been reported elsewhere.METHODS: We compared the age profile of high-risk (HR)-HPV prevalence in nine different areas of Northern and Central Italy by studying the women recruited in the intervention arm of the New Technologies in Cervical Cancer study and tested by Hybrid Capture 2.Differences in the age-distribution of HPV infection were investigated in each centre by the joinpoint approach in a logistic model.46,900 women aged 25 to 60 years were included in the analysis.RESULTS: The HR-HPV age-standardised (on Italian population) prevalence ranged from 5.7% (Trento) to 10.3% (Ravenna).HR-HPV prevalence decreased as a logistic function of increasing age in 6 of 9 centres (Trento, Verona, Florence, Bologna, Imola, and Viterbo).The effect of age on HR-HPV prevalence slopes did not differ significantly among these 6 centres, whereas significant heterogeneity in intercepts (p < 0.001) was found, reflecting different overall HR-HPV prevalence between centres.One significant joinpoint was observed in 2 centres (Padua and Ravenna), indicating that the decrease in HR-HPV prevalence by age was better described using a function composed with two logistic segments.In Padua HR-HPV prevalence decreased only slightly up to 39 years but showed a steep downturn thereafter.In Ravenna HR-HPV prevalence decreased steeply down to 45 years of age and then showed a plateau.Finally, in Turin two significant joinpoints were observed: prevalence decreased only after age 29 and showed a plateau after age 39.CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed substantial differences in overall and age-specific HR-HPV prevalence across Italian areas.These findings may be related to different timing of changes in sexual behaviours across regions.Age-specific HR-HPV prevalence in Italy does not support an influence of age per se.",0,0,0,0

24950280,"Chemotherapy or liver transplantation for nonresectable liver metastases from colorectal cancer?OBJECTIVE: The primary objective was to compare overall survival (OS) in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) with nonresectable liver-only metastases treated by liver transplantation or chemotherapy.BACKGROUND: CRC is the third most common cancer worldwide.About 50% of patients will develop metastatic disease primarily to the liver and the lung.The majority of patients with liver metastases receive palliative chemotherapy, with a median OS of trial patients of about 2 years, and less than 10% are alive at 5 years.METHODS: Patients with nonresectable liver-only CRC metastases underwent liver transplantation in the SECA study (n = 21).Disease-free survival (DFS) and OS of patients included in the SECA study were compared with progression-free survival (PFS) and OS in a similar cohort of CRC patients with liver-only disease included in a first-line chemotherapy study, the NORDIC VII study (n = 47).PFS/DFS and OS were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method.RESULTS: DFS/PFS in both groups were 8 to 10 months.However, a dramatic difference in OS was observed.The 5-year OS rate was 56% in patients undergoing liver transplantation compared with 9% in patients starting first-line chemotherapy.The reason for the large difference in OS despite similar DFS/PFS is likely different metastatic patterns at relapse/progression.Relapse in the liver transplantation group was often detected as small, slowly growing lung metastases, whereas progression of nonresectable liver metastases was observed in the chemotherapy group.CONCLUSIONS: Compared with chemotherapy, liver transplantation resulted in a marked increased OS in CRC patients with nonresectable liver-only metastases.",1,1,1,0

26643072,"A web-based intervention (RESTORE) to support self-management of cancer-related fatigue following primary cancer treatment: a multi-centre proof of concept randomised controlled trial.PURPOSE: Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is a frequent and distressing symptom experienced after cancer treatment.RESTORE is the first web-based resource designed to enhance self-efficacy to manage CRF following curative-intent treatment.The aim of this study is to test the proof of concept and inform the design of an effectiveness trial.METHODS: A multi-centre parallel-group two-armed (1:1) exploratory randomised controlled trial (RCT) with qualitative process evaluation was employed in the study.Participants (>/=18 years; </=5 years post treatment with moderate to severe fatigue) were recruited and randomly assigned to RESTORE or a leaflet.Feasibility and acceptability were measured by recruitment, attrition, intervention adherence, completion of outcome measures and process evaluation.Change in self-efficacy to manage CRF was also explored.Outcome measures were completed at baseline (T0), 6 weeks (T1) and 12 weeks (T2).Data were analysed using mixed-effects linear regression and directed content analysis.RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-three people participated in the trial and 19 in the process evaluation.The intervention was feasible (39 % of eligible patients consented) and acceptable (attrition rate 36 %).There was evidence of higher fatigue self-efficacy at T1 in the intervention group vs comparator (mean difference 0.51 [-0.08 to 1.11]), though the difference in groups decreased by 12 weeks.Time since diagnosis influenced perceived usefulness of the intervention.Modifications were suggested.CONCLUSION: Proof of concept was achieved.The RESTORE intervention should be subject to a definitive trial with some adjustments.Provision of an effective supportive resource would empower cancer survivors to manage CRF after treatment completion.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN67521059.",1,1,0,0
22669453,"Tumor budding is an independent predictor of outcome in AJCC/UICC stage II colorectal cancer.BACKGROUND: In colorectal cancer, the morphology of the invasive tumor margin may reflect aggressiveness of tumor growth, thus providing important prognostic information.The tumor growth pattern according to Jass and the extent of tumor budding were analyzed in patients with American Joint Committee on Cancer/Union for International Cancer Control (AJCC/UICC) stage II disease.METHODS: Tumors of 120 randomly selected patients with AJCC/UICC stage II disease were retrospectively reviewed for tumor growth pattern (expanding vs. infiltrating) and the extent of tumor budding, with high-grade budding reflecting presence of 10 or more budding foci scattered at the invasive tumor margin.Progression-free and cancer-specific survivals were determined by the Kaplan-Meier method.For multivariable analysis, Cox's proportional hazards regression models were performed.RESULTS: The infiltrating growth pattern was significantly associated with histological subtype and lymphovascular invasion, while high-grade budding was significantly associated with tumor grade and lymphovascular invasion.High-grade budding, but not the infiltrating growth pattern, was significantly associated with outcome in univariable analysis.Cox's proportional hazards regression models proved tumor budding to be an independent predictor of disease progression (hazard ratio 3.91, 95 % confidence interval 1.3-11.77; P = 0.02) and cancer-related death (hazard ratio 5.90, 95 % confidence interval 1.62-21.51; P = 0.007).The combination of infiltrating growth pattern and high-grade budding did not have a stronger prognostic significance than tumor budding alone.CONCLUSIONS: Tumor budding independently predicted patient outcome in patients with AJCC/UICC stage II colorectal cancer and may therefore be used for accurate prognostication, patient counseling, and design of clinical trials by using integrated multimodal therapy.",0,0,0,0

22575719,"Experiences with advanced cancer among Latinas in a public health care system.CONTEXT: Cultural dimensions related to illness are triggered at significant times in an illness trajectory, such as at illness onset or when death approaches.These factors influence views on how illness is understood and managed, which is likely more difficult for minority populations.Although Latinos experience barriers to high-quality health care, late-stage cancer diagnoses, and poor health outcomes, little is known about their experiences with advanced, life-threatening cancers.OBJECTIVES: We examined Latinas' experiences with advanced, metastatic cancers to identify sociocultural beliefs that influenced their care.METHODS: We interviewed 24 Latinas taking part in a randomized controlled trial focused on improving quality-of-life outcomes for co-occurring cancer and depression and explored their beliefs about the cause, course, and cure of cancer.This study used a phenomenological analytical approach to explore women's lived experiences of having advanced cancer.RESULTS: Themes revealed issues about experiencing advanced cancer that included the following: initial reactions to cancer, disbelief about the lack of pain, economic impact, beliefs about the cause, coping with cancer, beliefs about the cure, and confusion about cancer severity.Sociocultural factors influence misunderstanding and confusion about cancer care but also can be a source of strength.CONCLUSION: Providers need to become culturally sensitive to the needs of underserved Latinas.Denial or ignorance of these issues can create other problems, such as gaps in patient-centered decision making from diagnosis through the end of life.",0,0,0,0
23031619,"Breast density as indicator for the use of mammography or MRI to screen women with familial risk for breast cancer (FaMRIsc): a multicentre randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: To reduce mortality, women with a family history of breast cancer often start mammography screening at a younger age than the general population.Breast density is high in over 50% of women younger than 50 years.With high breast density, breast cancer incidence increases, but sensitivity of mammography decreases.Therefore, mammography might not be the optimal method for breast cancer screening in young women.Adding MRI increases sensitivity, but also the risk of false-positive results.The limitation of all previous MRI screening studies is that they do not contain a comparison group; all participants received both MRI and mammography.Therefore, we cannot empirically assess in which stage tumours would have been detected by either test.The aim of the Familial MRI Screening Study (FaMRIsc) is to compare the efficacy of MRI screening to mammography for women with a familial risk.Furthermore, we will assess the influence of breast density.METHODS/DESIGN: This Dutch multicentre, randomized controlled trial, with balanced randomisation (1:1) has a parallel grouped design.Women with a cumulative lifetime risk for breast cancer due to their family history of >/=20%, aged 30-55 years are eligible.Identified BRCA1/2 mutation carriers or women with 50% risk of carrying a mutation are excluded.Group 1 receives yearly mammography and clinical breast examination (n = 1000), and group 2 yearly MRI and clinical breast examination, and mammography biennially (n = 1000).Primary endpoints are the number and stage of the detected breast cancers in each arm.Secondary endpoints are the number of false-positive results in both screening arms.Furthermore, sensitivity and positive predictive value of both screening strategies will be assessed.Cost-effectiveness of both strategies will be assessed.Analyses will also be performed with mammographic density as stratification factor.DISCUSSION: Personalized breast cancer screening might optimize mortality reduction with less over diagnosis.Breast density may be a key discriminator for selecting the optimal screening strategy for women < 55 years with familial breast cancer risk; mammography or MRI.These issues are addressed in the FaMRIsc study including high risk women due to a familial predisposition.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Netherland Trial Register NTR2789.",1,1,0,0

23415048,"A prospective trial of real-time magnetic resonance-guided catheter placement in interstitial gynecologic brachytherapy.PURPOSE: To present outcome and toxicity results of the first real-time intraoperative MRI-guided interstitial approach to gynecologic cancer.METHODS AND MATERIALS: From February 2004 to December 2006, 25 patients with gynecologic malignancies were enrolled and treated in a prospective clinical trial of real-time MRI-guided interstitial brachytherapy.This was followed by a confirmatory CT imaging scan.Statistical analyses included Kaplan-Meier estimates for overall and relapse-free survival.RESULTS: MRI visualization of needles during placement permitted accurate placement with no inadvertent insertions.This prevented unnecessary normal-tissue perforation as confirmed by CT simulation.With a mean followup of 3.8 years (range, 2-6.8), 1-, 2-, and 3-year overall survival rates were 80%, 60% and 43%, respectively; corresponding relapse-free survival rates were 79%, 65%, and 59%, respectively.Actuarial acute toxicity rates for any grade were 0% at 0-14 days and 80% (all grade 1) at 14-90 days.Long-term (>180 days) actuarial toxicity rates were 8% gastrointestinal, 4% bladder and 4% vaginal.CONCLUSIONS: Real-time MRI guidance during insertion of interstitial needles followed by 3D-planning maximized opportunities for tumor targeting and sparing of normal tissues.Although image guidance requires additional anesthesia time, clinical outcomes indicate potential for a successful reduction in toxicity using 3D image-guided in addition to 3D image-planned brachytherapy.",0,0,0,0
32079739,"Evaluation of ultrasound-guided rhomboid intercostal nerve block for postoperative analgesia in breast cancer surgery: a prospective, randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Mastectomy has many potential sources of pain.Rhomboid intercostal block (RIB) is a recently described plane block.The primary hypothesis of the study is that ultrasound-guided RIB combined with general anesthesia would accelerate global quality of recovery scores of patients following mastectomy surgery.Secondary hypothesis is that RIB would reduce postoperative opioid consumption, pain scores, and the need for rescue analgesia.METHODS: Patients aged between 18 and 70 years, with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I-II and scheduled for an elective unilateral modified radical mastectomy surgery with axillary lymph node dissection were enrolled to the study.Following endotracheal intubation, patients were randomly allocated into two groups.Patients in the first group (group R) received ultrasound-guided RIB with 30 mL 0.25% bupivacaine.In the control group (group C), no block intervention was applied.All patients received intravenous dexamethasone 8 mg, dexketoprofen trometamol 50 mg intraoperatively and tramadol 1 mg/kg 30 min before the end of surgery for postoperative analgesia.All patients received intravenous morphine patient-controlled analgesia device at the arrival to the recovery room.RESULTS: The descriptive variables of the patients were comparable between group R and group C. Mean quality of recovery-40 score at 24 hours was 164.8+/-3.9 in group R and 153.5+/-5.2 in group C (mean difference 11.4 (95% CI 8.8 to 13.9; p<0.001).At 24th hour, median morphine consumption was 5 mg (IQR 4-7 mg) in group R and 10 mg (IQR 8-13 mg) in group C, p<0.001.Intraoperative fentanyl administration, pain scores and the need for rescue postoperative analgesia was similar between groups.CONCLUSIONS: In the current study, ultrasound-guided RIB promoted enhanced recovery and decreased opioid consumption after mastectomy surgery.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ACTRN12619000879167.",1,1,0,0

A Randomized Placebo-controlled Trial and Mechanistic Insights.Rationale: Effective cough treatments are a significant unmet need in patients with lung cancer.Aprepitant is a licensed treatment for nausea and vomiting, which blocks substance P activation of NK-1 (neurokinin 1) receptors, a mechanism also implicated in cough.Objectives: To assess aprepitant in patients with lung cancer with cough and evaluate mechanisms in vagal nerve tissue.Methods: Randomized double-blind crossover trial of patients with lung cancer and bothersome cough.They received 3 days of aprepitant or matched placebo; after a 3-day washout, patients crossed to the alternative treatment.The primary endpoint was awake cough frequency measured at screening and Day 3 of each treatment; secondary endpoints included patient-reported outcomes.In vitro, the depolarization of isolated guinea pig and human vagus nerve sections in grease-gap recording chambers, indicative of sensory nerve activation, was measured to evaluate the mechanism.Measurements and Main Results: Twenty patients with lung cancer enrolled, with a mean age 66 years (+/-7.7); 60% were female and 80% had non-small cell cancer, 50% had advanced stage, and 55% had World Health Organization performance status 1.Cough frequency improved with aprepitant, reducing by 22.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.8-37.7%) over placebo while awake (P = 0.03), 30.3% (95% CI, 12.7-44.3) over 24 hours (P = 0.002), and 59.8% (95% CI, 15.1-86.0) during sleep (P = 0.081).Patient-reported outcomes all significantly improved.Substance P depolarized both guinea pig and human vagus nerve.Aprepitant significantly inhibited substance P-induced depolarization by 78% in guinea pig (P = 0.0145) and 94% in human vagus (P = 0.0145).Conclusions: Substance P activation of NK-1 receptors appears to be an important mechanism driving cough in lung cancer, and NK-1 antagonists show promise as antitussive therapies.",1,1,0,0
26878247,"Dual-focus versus conventional magnification endoscopy for the diagnosis of superficial squamous neoplasms in the pharynx and esophagus: a randomized trial.BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Conventional magnification narrow-band imaging (CM-NBI) endoscopy has demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy for superficial squamous neoplasms in the pharynx and esophagus.This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic utility of the newly developed dual-focus NBI (DF-NBI) compared with that of CM-NBI.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We recruited patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in the head and neck, or esophagus, or with a history of SCC.The primary endpoint of this prospective controlled non-inferiority trial was the sensitivity of DF-NBI and CM-NBI for detecting superficial carcinoma in the pharynx and esophagus.Secondary endpoints included other diagnostic values and the resolving power of each endoscope.Superficial carcinoma was defined as high grade dysplasia and SCC invading up to the submucosal layer.RESULTS: The study included 93 patients.A total of 28 superficial carcinomas were detected in the pharynx and esophagus.The sensitivities of DF-NBI and CM-NBI for superficial carcinoma were 82 % and 71 %, respectively.The lower limit of the 90 % confidence interval for the difference between the sensitivities exceeded the non-inferiority threshold.The specificity and overall accuracy of DF-NBI vs. CM-NBI were 93 % vs. 90 % and 91 % vs. 86 %, respectively (both non-significant differences).The maximum resolving power of a conventional magnification endoscope was significantly higher than a dual-focus endoscope (7.2 microm vs. 11.6 microm: P < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate the non-inferiority of DF-NBI versus CM-NBI in detecting superficial carcinoma in the pharynx and esophagus.DF-NBI appears to have a resolving power that, although significantly lower, is sufficient to achieve high diagnostic accuracy, comparable to that of CM-NBI.University Hospital Medical Information Network (UMIN, No. 000007585).",0,0,0,0
29849515,"Effect of Community-Based Occupational Therapy on Health-Related Quality of Life and Engagement in Meaningful Activities of Women with Breast Cancer.We aimed to evaluate the short-term effects of community-based occupational therapy on health-related quality of life and engagement in meaningful activities among women with breast cancer.An open label randomized controlled trial study design was applied.The participants were members of various societies of women with cancer.In total, 22 women have participated in the study.Participants of the experimental group (n = 11) participated in a 6-week community-based occupational therapy program and the usual activities of various societies, whereas the control group (n = 11) women participated in the usual activities of the societies only.1 of the participants withdrew during the course; therefore 21 completed the study successfully.Participants of both groups were assessed for health-related quality of life and the participants of the experimental group were assessed for engagement in meaningful activities.The evaluation was carried out during the nonacute period of the disease-at the beginning of the study and after 6 weeks.Women of the experimental group demonstrated statistically significantly better scores in the global quality of life, role functions, physical, emotional, cognitive, and social functions, fatigue, insomnia, financial impact, systemic therapy side effects, and breast symptoms scales compared to the control group participants (p < 0.05) after the 6 weeks, as measured by the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire and its breast cancer module QLQ-BR23.Furthermore, women of the experimental group demonstrated significant greater engagement in meaningful activities when applying community-based occupational therapy (p < 0.05), as measured by using the Engagement in Meaningful Activities Survey (EMAS).The evaluation of the associations between the women's engagement in meaningful activities and changes in health-related quality of life showed that greater engagement in meaningful activities was associated with better emotional functions and a lower level of insomnia (p < 0.05).Based on the results of our study, we recommend applying occupational therapy in the field of community healthcare in order to maintain or improve breast cancer patients' health-related quality of life and suggest involving women into meaningful activities during community-based occupational therapy after clarifying which activities are important to them.",1,1,0,0

22614994,"Reach out to enhance wellness home-based diet-exercise intervention promotes reproducible and sustainable long-term improvements in health behaviors, body weight, and physical functioning in older, overweight/obese cancer survivors.PURPOSE: Diet and exercise interventions have been tested in cancer survivors as a means to reduce late effects and comorbidity, but few have assessed adherence and health outcomes long term.METHODS: Between July 2005 and May 2007, the Reach Out to Enhance Wellness (RENEW) trial accrued 641 locoregionally staged, long-term (>/= 5 years from diagnosis) colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer survivors in the United States (21 states), Canada, and the United Kingdom.All participants were sedentary (< 150 minutes of physical activity [PA] a week), overweight or obese (body mass index, 25 to 40 kg/m(2)), and over age 65 years.The trial tested a diet-exercise intervention delivered via mailed print materials and telephone counseling.RENEW used a wait-list control, cross-over design (ie, participants received the year-long intervention immediately or after a 1-year delay), which allowed the opportunity to assess program efficacy (previously reported primary outcome), durability, and reproducibility (reported herein).Measures included diet quality (DQ), PA, BMI, and physical function (PF).RESULTS: No significant relapse was observed in the immediate-intervention arm for DQ, PA, and BMI; however, rates of functional decline increased when the intervention ceased.From year 1 to year 2, significant improvements were observed in the delayed-intervention arm; mean change scores in behaviors and BMI and PF slopes were as follows: DQ score, 5.2 (95% CI, 3.4 to 7.0); PA, 45.8 min/wk (95% CI, 26.9 to 64.6 min/wk); BMI, -0.56 (95% CI, -0.75 to -0.36); and Short Form-36 PF, -1.02 versus -5.52 (P < .001 for all measures).Overall, both arms experienced significant improvements in DQ, PA, and BMI from baseline to 2-year follow-up (P < .001).CONCLUSION: Older cancer survivors respond favorably to lifestyle interventions and make durable changes in DQ and PA that contribute to sustained weight loss.These changes positively reorient functional decline trajectories during intervention delivery.",1,1,0,0
25968598,"Effect of Sulforaphane in Men with Biochemical Recurrence after Radical Prostatectomy.Increases in serum levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) occur commonly in prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy and are designated ""biochemical recurrence."" Because the phytochemical sulforaphane has been studied extensively as an anticancer agent, we performed a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter trial with sulforaphane in 78 patients (mean age, 69 +/- 6 years) with increasing PSA levels after radical prostatectomy.Treatment comprised daily oral administration of 60 mg of a stabilized free sulforaphane for 6 months (M0-M6) followed by 2 months without treatment (M6-M8).The study was designed to detect a 0.012 log (ng/mL)/month decrease in the log PSA slope in the sulforaphane group from M0 to M6.The primary endpoint was not reached.For secondary endpoints, median log PSA slopes were consistently lower in sulforaphane-treated men.Mean changes in PSA levels between M6 and M0 were significantly lower in the sulforaphane group (+0.099 +/- 0.341 ng/mL) than in placebo (+0.620 +/- 1.417 ng/mL; P = 0.0433).PSA doubling time was 86% longer in the sulforaphane than in the placebo group (28.9 and 15.5 months, respectively).PSA increases >20% at M6 were significantly greater in the placebo group (71.8%) than in the sulforaphane group (44.4%); P = 0.0163.Compliance and tolerance were very good.Sulforaphane effects were prominent after 3 months of intervention (M3-M6).After treatment, PSA slopes from M6 to M8 remained the same in the 2 arms.Daily administration of free sulforaphane shows promise in managing biochemical recurrences in prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.",1,1,1,0

A non-inferiority design with a 6% noninferiority margin and null hypothesis (H0) that the infection risk is at least 6% higher in the experimental (E) than in the control (C) group; H0: C (AMP-group) - E (no AMP-group) >/= Delta (6% noninferiority margin).A multivariable, logistic regression was performed for AMP and post-TURB fever with covariates: tumor size and (clot-) retention.The R Project((R)) for statistical computing was used for statistical analysis and a p value of 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.RESULTS: 459 Patients were included and 202/459 (44.1%) received AMP vs 257/459 (55.9%) without AMP.Fever occurred in 6/202 [2.9%; 95% CI (1.2-6.6%)] patients with AMP vs 8/257 [3.1%; 95% CI (1.5%-6.1%)] without AMP (p = 0.44).Multivariable, logistic regression showed no significant harm in omitting AMP when controlled for (clot-)retention and tumor size (p = 0.85) and an adjusted risk difference in developing post-TURB fever of 0.0016; 95% CI [- 0.029; 0.032].CONCLUSION: Our data suggest the safety of omitting AMP in patients undergoing TURB without an indwelling, pre-operative catheter/nephrostomy/DJ and a negative pre-operative urinary culture.",1,1,0,0
33549682,"Computer-tailored intervention increases colorectal cancer screening among low-income African Americans in primary care: Results of a randomized trial.INTRODUCTION: Although African Americans have the highest colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality rates of any racial group, their screening rates remain low.STUDY DESIGN/PURPOSE: This randomized controlled trial compared efficacy of two clinic-based interventions for increasing CRC screening among African American primary care patients.METHODS: African American patients from 11 clinics who were not current with CRC screening were randomized to receive a computer-tailored intervention (n = 335) or a non-tailored brochure (n = 358) designed to promote adherence to CRC screening.Interventions were delivered in clinic immediately prior to a provider visit.Univariate and multivariable logistic regression models analyzed predictors of screening test completion.Moderators and mediators were determined using multivariable linear and logistic regression analyses.RESULTS: Significant effects of the computer-tailored intervention were observed for completion of a stool blood test (SBT) and completion of any CRC screening test (SBT or colonoscopy).The colonoscopy screening rate was higher among those receiving the computer-tailored intervention group compared to the nontailored brochure but the difference was not significant.Predictors of SBT completion were: receipt of the computer-tailored intervention; being seen at a Veterans Affairs Medical Center clinic; baseline stage of adoption; and reason for visit.Mediators of intervention effects were changes in perceived SBT barriers, changes in perceived colonoscopy benefits, changes in CRC knowledge, and patient-provider discussion.Moderators of intervention effects were age, employment, and family/friend recommendation of screening.CONCLUSION: This one-time computer-tailored intervention significantly improved CRC screening rates among low-income African American patients.This finding was largely driven by increasing SBT but the impact of the intervention on colonoscopy screening was strong.Implementation of a CRC screening quality improvement program in the VA site that included provision of stool blood test kits and follow-up likely contributed to the strong intervention effect observed at that site.The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT00672828.",1,0,0,0
23173717,"Are mammographic changes in the tumor bed more pronounced after intraoperative radiotherapy for breast cancer? Subgroup analysis from a randomized trial (TARGIT-A).Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) with low-energy x-rays is increasingly used in breast-conserving therapy (BCT).Previous non-randomized studies have observed mammographic changes in the tumor bed to be more pronounced after IORT.The purpose of this study was to reassess the postoperative changes in a randomized single-center subgroup of patients from a multicenter trial (TARGIT-A).In this subgroup (n = 48) 27 patients received BCT with IORT, 21 patients had BCT with standard whole-breast radiotherapy serving as controls.Overall 258 postoperative mammograms (median follow-up 4.3 years, range 3-8) were retrospectively evaluated by two radiologists in consensus focusing on changes in the tumor bed.Fat necroses showed to be significantly more frequent (56% versus 24%) and larger (8.7 versus 1.6 sq cm, median) after IORT than those in controls.Scar calcifications were also significantly more frequent after IORT (63% versus 19%).The high incidence of large fat necroses in our study confirms previous study findings.However, the overall higher incidence of calcifications in the tumor bed after IORT represents a new finding, requiring further attention.",0,0,0,0
34367541,"Artificial Intelligence Algorithm-Based Ultrasound Image Segmentation Technology in the Diagnosis of Breast Cancer Axillary Lymph Node Metastasis.This paper aimed to investigate the application of ultrasound image segmentation technology based on the back propagation neural network (BPNN) artificial intelligence algorithm in the diagnosis of breast cancer axillary lymph node metastasis, thereby providing a theoretical basis for clinical diagnosis.In this study, 90 breast cancer patients with axillary lymph node metastasis were selected as the research objects and rolled randomly into an experimental group and a control group.Besides, all of them were examined by ultrasound.The BPNN algorithm for the ultrasound image segmentation diagnosis method was applied to the patiens from the experimental group, while the control group was given routine ultrasound diagnosis.Thus, the value of this algorithm in ultrasonic diagnosis was compared and explored.The results showed that when the number of hidden layer nodes based on the BPNN artificial intelligence algorithm was 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, the corresponding segmentation accuracy was 97.3%, 96.5%, 94.8%, 94.8%, and 94.1% in turn.Among them, the segmentation accuracy was the highest when the number of hidden layer nodes was 2.The correlation of independent variable bubble plot analysis showed that the presence or absence of capsules, the presence of crab feet or burrs in breast cancer lesions was critical influencing factors for the occurrence of axillary lymph node metastasis, and the standardized importance was 99.7% and 70.8%, respectively.Besides, the area under the two-dimensional receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the BPNN artificial intelligence algorithm model classification was always greater than the area under the curve of manual segmentation, and the segmentation accuracy was 90.31%, 94.88%, 95.48%, 95.44%, and 97.65% in sequence.In addition, the segmentation specificity of different running times was higher than that of manual segmentation.In conclusion, the BPNN artificial intelligence algorithm had high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for ultrasound image segmentation, with a better segmentation effect.Therefore, it had a better diagnostic effect for breast cancer axillary lymph node metastasis.",0,0,0,0
33429441,"Evaluation of the effects of an artificial intelligence system on endoscopy quality and preliminary testing of its performance in detecting early gastric cancer: a randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is a prerequisite for detecting upper gastrointestinal lesions especially early gastric cancer (EGC).An artificial intelligence system has been shown to monitor blind spots during EGD.In this study, we updated the system (ENDOANGEL), verified its effectiveness in improving endoscopy quality, and pretested its performance in detecting EGC in a multicenter randomized controlled trial.METHODS: ENDOANGEL was developed using deep convolutional neural networks and deep reinforcement learning.Patients undergoing EGD in five hospitals were randomly assigned to the ENDOANGEL-assisted group or to a control group without use of ENDOANGEL.The primary outcome was the number of blind spots.Secondary outcomes included performance of ENDOANGEL in predicting EGC in a clinical setting.RESULTS: 1050 patients were randomized, and 498 and 504 patients in the ENDOANGEL and control groups, respectively, were analyzed.Compared with the control group, the ENDOANGEL group had fewer blind spots (mean 5.38 [standard deviation (SD) 4.32] vs. 9.82 [SD 4.98]; P < 0.001) and longer inspection time (5.40 [SD 3.82] vs. 4.38 [SD 3.91] minutes; P < 0.001).In the ENDOANGEL group, 196 gastric lesions with pathological results were identified.ENDOANGEL correctly predicted all three EGCs (one mucosal carcinoma and two high grade neoplasias) and two advanced gastric cancers, with a per-lesion accuracy of 84.7 %, sensitivity of 100 %, and specificity of 84.3 % for detecting gastric cancer.CONCLUSIONS: In this multicenter study, ENDOANGEL was an effective and robust system to improve the quality of EGD and has the potential to detect EGC in real time.",1,0,0,0
25435541,"Population testing for cancer predisposing BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations in the Ashkenazi-Jewish community: a randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Technological advances raise the possibility of systematic population-based genetic testing for cancer-predisposing mutations, but it is uncertain whether benefits outweigh disadvantages.We directly compared the psychological/quality-of-life consequences of such an approach to family history (FH)-based testing.METHODS: In a randomized controlled trial of BRCA1/2 gene-mutation testing in the Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) population, we compared testing all participants in the population screening (PS) arm with testing those fulfilling standard FH-based clinical criteria (FH arm).Following a targeted community campaign, AJ participants older than 18 years were recruited by self-referral after pretest genetic counseling.The effects of BRCA1/2 genetic testing on acceptability, psychological impact, and quality-of-life measures were assessed by random effects regression analysis.All statistical tests were two-sided.RESULTS: One thousand, one hundred sixty-eight AJ individuals were counseled, 1042 consented, 1034 were randomly assigned (691 women, 343 men), and 1017 were eligible for analysis.Mean age was 54.3 (SD = 14.66) years.Thirteen BRCA1/2 carriers were identified in the PS arm, nine in the FH arm.Five more carriers were detected among FH-negative FH-arm participants following study completion.There were no statistically significant differences between the FH and PS arms at seven days or three months on measures of anxiety, depression, health anxiety, distress, uncertainty, and quality-of-life.Contrast tests indicated that overall anxiety (P = .0001) and uncertainty (P = .005) associated with genetic testing decreased; positive experience scores increased (P = .0001); quality-of-life and health anxiety did not change with time.Overall, 56% of carriers did not fulfill clinical criteria for genetic testing, and the BRCA1/2 prevalence was 2.45%.CONCLUSION: Compared with FH-based testing, population-based genetic testing in Ashkenazi Jews doesn't adversely affect short-term psychological/quality-of-life outcomes and may detect 56% additional BRCA carriers.",1,0,0,0
32409106,"Safety Analysis of Five Randomized Controlled Studies of Daratumumab in Patients With Multiple Myeloma.BACKGROUND: Multiple studies have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of daratumumab for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM) and primary treatment for transplant-eligible and -ineligible patients.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted an integrated safety analysis to characterize the frequency, severity, natural history, and outcomes of adverse events (AEs) with daratumumab versus comparators.Data were pooled from 5 completed phase III randomized controlled studies that had included 1798 daratumumab-treated and 1797 comparator-treated patients with MM as a first line in both transplant-eligible and transplant-ineligible patients and for relapsed/refractory disease.Safety analyses included reporting of AEs using crude and exposure-adjusted incidence rates.RESULTS: The median follow-up duration was 16.84 months (range, 7.4-28 months) for both daratumumab-treated and comparator-treated patients.Discontinuation for any reason occurred less often with daratumumab (22% vs. 33.9%), although discontinuation because of AEs occurred at similar rates (25% vs. 26%) as did deaths owing to AEs (2.25% vs. 1.84%).When adjusted for exposure, neutropenia, lymphopenia, diarrhea, fatigue, dyspnea, pneumonia, and hypertension were the only common grade 3/4 AEs reported more often with daratumumab than with the comparators.The prevalence of common grade 3/4 AEs with daratumumab were < 7% apart from neutropenia, lymphopenia, and pneumonia (45.9% vs. 32.3%, 13% vs. 7.5%, and 10.6% vs. 7.2%, respectively).Grade 3/4 daratumumab infusion-related reactions happened in 3.8% of patients.The majority of infusion-related reactions occurred after the first infusion.CONCLUSIONS: These results from an integrated analysis support a favorable benefit/risk profile of daratumumab in patients with MM.",0,0,0,0
24737199,"Associations between circulating 1,25(OH)(2)D concentration and odds of metachronous colorectal adenoma.Cellular-level studies demonstrate that the availability of the secosteroid hormone 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D] to colon cells promotes anti-carcinogenic activities.Although epidemiological data are relatively sparse, suggestive inverse trends have been reported between circulating 1,25(OH)2D concentration and colorectal neoplasia.We therefore sought to evaluate the relationship between circulating 1,25(OH)2D concentrations and odds for metachronous colorectal adenomas among 1,151 participants from a randomized trial of ursodeoxycholic acid for colorectal adenoma prevention.No relationship between 1,25(OH)2D and overall odds for metachronous lesions was observed, with ORs (95% CIs) of 0.80 (0.60-1.07) and 0.81 (0.60-1.10) for participants in the second and third tertiles, respectively, compared with those in the lowest (p-trend = 0.17).However, a statistically significant inverse association was observed between circulating 1,25(OH)2D concentration and odds of proximal metachronous adenoma, with an OR (95% CI) of 0.71 (0.52-0.98) for individuals in the highest tertile of 1,25(OH)2D compared with those in the lowest (p-trend = 0.04).While there was no relationship overall between 1,25(OH)2D and metachronous distal lesions, there was a significantly reduced odds for women, but not men, in the highest 1,25(OH)2D tertile compared with the lowest (OR 0.53; 95% CI 0.27-1.03; p-trend = 0.05; p-interaction = 0.08).The observed differences in associations with proximal and distal adenomas could indicate that delivery and activity of vitamin D metabolites in different anatomic sites in the colorectum varies, particularly by gender.These results identify novel associations between 1,25(OH)2D and metachronous proximal and distal colorectal adenoma, and suggest that future studies are needed to ascertain potential mechanistic differences in 1,25(OH)2D action in the colorectum.",0,0,0,0

RESULTS: The intervention was associated with increased physical activity (beta = 0.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.14;0.59), general self-efficacy (beta = 2.41, 95%CI = 0.35;4.73), and mastery (beta = 1.75, 95%CI = 0.36;2.78).Further, the intervention had both a direct effect on fatigue (beta = -1.09, 95%CI = -2.12;0.01), and an indirect effect (beta = -0.54, 95%CI = -1.00;-0.21) via physical activity (beta = -0.29, 95%CI = -0.64;-0.07) and general self-efficacy (beta = -0.25, 95%CI = -0.61;-0.05).The intervention had a borderline significant direct effect on reduced distress (beta = -1.32, 95%CI = -2.68;0.11), and a significant indirect effect via increased general self-efficacy and mastery (beta = -1.06, 95%CI = -1.89;-0.38).Reductions in fatigue (beta = -1.33, 95%CI =-1.85;-0.83) and distress (beta = -0.86, 95%CI = -1.25;-0.52) were associated with improved QoL. Further, increased physical activity was directly associated with improved QoL (beta = 3.37, 95%CI = 1.01;5.54).CONCLUSION: The beneficial effect of group-based physical exercise on QoL was mediated by increased physical activity, general self-efficacy and mastery, and subsequent reductions in fatigue and distress.In addition to physical activity, future interventions should target self-efficacy and mastery.This may lead to reduced distress and fatigue, and consequently improved QoL of cancer survivors.",1,1,0,0
29771337,"Randomized Trial of the Impact of Empowering Childhood Cancer Survivors With Survivorship Care Plans.Background: A survivorship care plan (SCP), that is, individualized treatment summary and schedule of off-therapy surveillance, will be mandated by January 2019.It is unclear whether SCPs improve adherence to recommended follow-up care in the community.In this trial, we evaluated the impact of randomly assigning childhood cancer survivors to 1) SCPs to be taken to their primary care physician (PCP) to implement or 2) survivorship clinic (SC) on health care quality measures.Methods: Eligibility included cancer diagnosis younger than age 18 years (2000-2012), cancer free, one or more years off therapy, and no prior survivorship clinic attendance.At 12 months, the random assignment groups were compared (SCP+PCP vs SC) by intent-to-treat analysis with two-sided statistical tests in terms of patient adherence to guideline-recommended surveillance tests (eg, echocardiogram) and number of newly identified late complications of therapy.Results: From 2011 to 2013, 96 participants (46.9% female, mean age = 15.9 +/- 6.1 years) were randomly assigned.Adherence to 14 evaluated guideline-recommended surveillance tests ranged from 0% to 46.9% in the SCP+PCP group (n = 47) and from 50.0% to 86.4% in the SC group (n = 47).Adherence to 10 tests was statistically significantly different between the groups (all P < .05).One mild new late complication was identified in the SCP+PCP group compared with 21 late complications, ranging from mild to severe, identified in 11 patients in the SC group (2.1% vs 23.4% of patients, respectively, P = .003).Conclusions: Our randomized trial suggests that empowering childhood cancer survivors with SCPs to be implemented by their PCPs is not sufficient to meet consensus follow-up recommendations.",1,1,0,0
26291768,"Docetaxel Alone or in Combination With a Therapeutic Cancer Vaccine (PANVAC) in Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer: A Randomized Clinical Trial.IMPORTANCE: Previous phase 1 and 2 trials of PANVAC, a poxviral-based cancer vaccine, have suggested clinical efficacy in some patients with breast, ovarian, and colorectal cancer and have shown evidence of immunologic activity.Preclinical data have shown that docetaxel can modify tumor phenotype, making tumor cells more amenable to T cell-mediated killing.OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to determine if the treatment combination of docetaxel and PANVAC improves clinical outcomes in patients with metastatic breast cancer compared with docetaxel treatment alone.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Between May 2006 and February 2012, this open-label, phase 2 randomized clinical trial enrolled 48 patients with metastatic breast cancer of all subtypes, without limitation on other lines of previous therapy, to receive treatment with either docetaxel with PANVAC (arm A) or docetaxel alone (arm B).Final clinical data were collected on September 16, 2013.All patients were treated at either the National Cancer Institute or the Department of Breast Medical Oncology, MD Anderson Cancer Center.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS), using a phase 2.5 statistical design, with the intent of identifying a trend toward benefit (defined as 1-sided P</=.10) to guide a larger trial design.Secondary end points included safety and immunologic correlative studies.RESULTS: Forty-eight participants were enrolled: 25 were randomized to the combination treatment arm A, and 23 to arm B. No patient remained in the study at the time of the final analysis.Patient and tumor characteristics were well matched.Analysis of adverse events in both treatment arms demonstrated very little difference between the 2 groups.In the combination treatment arm (arm A), statistically significant increases were noted in the frequency of grades 1 and 2 edema (P=.02, likely related to greater median number of docetaxel cycles) and injection-site reactions (P<.001).In the final data analysis, median PFS was 7.9 months in arm A vs 3.9 months in arm B (hazard ratio, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.34-1.14]; P=.09).CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results suggest that the combination of PANVAC with docetaxel in metastatic breast cancer may provide a clinical benefit.This study was hypothesis generating and provides both rationale and statistical assumptions for a larger definitive randomized study.TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00179309.",1,1,1,0
30305115,"Molecular profiling of hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancers from patients treated with neoadjuvant endocrine therapy in the CARMINA 02 trial (UCBG-0609).BACKGROUND: Postmenopausal women with large, hormone receptor (HR)-positive/HER2-negative and low-proliferative breast cancer derived a benefit from neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (NET) in the CARMINA02 trial.This study was designed to correlate gene expression and mutation profiles with both response to NET and prognosis.METHODS: Gene expression profiling using RNA sequencing was performed in 86 pre-NET and post-NET tumor samples.Targeted next-generation sequencing of 91 candidate breast cancer-associated genes was performed on DNA samples from 89 patients.Molecular data were correlated with radiological response and relapse-free survival.RESULTS: The transcriptional profile of tumors to NET in responders involved immune-associated genes enriched in activated Th1 pathway, which remained unchanged in non-responders.Immune response was confirmed by analysis of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs).The percentage of TILs was significantly increased post-NET compared to pre-NET samples in responders (p = 0.0071), but not in non-responders (p = 0.0938).Gene expression revealed that lipid metabolism was the main molecular function related to prognosis, while PPARgamma is the most important upstream regulator gene.The most frequently mutated genes were PIK3CA (48.3%), CDH1 (20.2%), PTEN (15.7%), TP53 (10.1%), LAMA2 (10.1%), BRCA2 (9.0%), MAP3K1 (7.9%), ALK (6.7%), INPP4B (6.7%), NCOR1 (6.7%), and NF1 (5.6%).Cell cycle and apoptosis pathway and PIK3CA/AKT/mTOR pathway were altered significantly more frequently in non-responders than in responders (p = 0.0017 and p = 0.0094, respectively).The average number of mutations per sample was significantly higher in endocrine-resistant tumors (2.88 vs. 1.64, p = 0.03), but no difference was observed in terms of prognosis.ESR1 hotspot mutations were detected in 3.4% of treatment-naive tumors.CONCLUSIONS: The Th1-related immune system and lipid metabolism appear to play key roles in the response to endocrine therapy and prognosis in HR-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer.Deleterious somatic mutations in the cell cycle and apoptosis pathway and PIK3CA/AKT/mTOR pathway may be relevant for clinical management.TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov ( NCT00629616 ) on March 6, 2008, retrospectively registered.",0,0,0,0
30408319,"The effect of preoperative chemotherapy on histological subtyping and staging of Wilms tumors: The United Kingdom Children's Cancer Study Group (UKCCSG) Wilms tumor trial 3 (UKW3) experience.BACKGROUND: Two principal approaches to Wilms tumor (WT) treatment are immediate surgery (IS) and preoperative chemotherapy (PCT), and both treatments use the risk-adapted approach that includes histological subclassification of the tumor, combined with additional prognostic factors.In the UKW3 trial, these two approaches were compared.The aim of the present study was to compare histological features between the two groups, to assess the impact of PCT on distribution of histological subtyping and staging and to evaluate whether PCT resulted in more staging discrepancies between local and central pathology review (CPR).MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cases were identified from the UKW3 trial database.The criteria for inclusion in the study were unilateral, nonmetastatic, nonanaplastic WTs, and submitted for CPR with an adequate number of slides.They were subclassified according to the NWTS and later the SIOP 9301 criteria.RESULTS: There were 244 WTs in the IS and 182 in the PCT group subclassified as follows: blastemal 86 (35%) vs 9 (5%), epithelial 34 (14%) vs 12 (7%), stromal 12 (5%) vs 25 (14%), mixed 112 (46%) vs 45 (25%), respectively, plus 40% regressive and 10% completely necrotic WTs in the PCT group.The differences between the two groups for blastemal and mixed types were statistically significant.In the PCT group, there was a significant decrease in stage III tumors.The discrepancies in staging between local and CPR were not significant.CONCLUSION: PCT significantly altered histological features and typing of WTs.It resulted in fewer stage III tumors, and staging discrepancies were equally represented in both groups.",0,0,0,0
32889876,"Assessment of Robotic Versus Laparoscopic Distal Gastrectomy for Gastric Cancer: A Randomized Controlled Trial.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the short-term outcomes of patients with GC who received RDG or LDG.SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Despite the increasing use of RDG in patients with GC, its safety and efficacy compared to those of LDG have not been elucidated in a randomized controlled trial.METHODS: Three hundred patients with cT1-4a and N0/+ between September 2017 and January 2020 were enrolled in this randomized controlled trial at a high-volume hospital in China.The short-term outcomes were compared between the groups.RESULTS: The modified intention-to-treat analysis included data from 283 patients (RDG group: n = 141) and (LDG group: n = 142).Patients in the RDG group exhibited faster postoperative recovery, milder inflammatory responses, and reduced postoperative morbidity (9.2% vs 17.6%, respectively, P = 0.039).Higher extraperigastric lymph nodes (LNs) were retrieved in the RDG group (17.6 +/- 5.8 vs 15.8 +/- 6.6, P = 0.018) with lower noncompliance rate (7.7% vs 16.9%, respectively, P = 0.006).Additionally, patients in the RDG group were more likely to initiate adjuvant chemotherapy earlier [median (interquartile range) postoperative days: 28 (24-32) vs 32 (26-42), P = 0.003].Although total hospital costs were higher in the robotic group than in the laparoscopic group, the direct cost was lower for RDG than for LDG (all P < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: RDG is associated with a lower morbidity rate, faster recovery, milder inflammatory responses, and improved lymphadenectomy.Additionally, faster postoperative recovery in the RDG group enables early initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy.Our results provide evidence for the application of RDG in patients with GC.",1,1,1,0
25556937,"Opportunistic testing versus organized prostate-specific antigen screening: outcome after 18 years in the Goteborg randomized population-based prostate cancer screening trial.BACKGROUND: It has been shown that organized screening decreases prostate cancer (PC) mortality, but the effect of opportunistic screening is largely unknown.OBJECTIVE: To compare the ability to reduce PC mortality and the risk of overdiagnosis between organized and opportunistic screening.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Goteborg screening study invited 10 000 randomly selected men for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing every 2 yr since 1995, with a prostate biopsy recommended for men with PSA >/=2.5 ng/ml.The control group of 10 000 men not invited has been exposed to a previously reported increased rate of opportunistic PSA testing.Both groups were followed until December 31, 2012.OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Observed cumulative PC incidence and mortality rates in both groups were calculated using the actuarial method.Using historical data from 1990-1994 (pre-PSA era), we calculated expected PC incidence and mortality rates in the absence of any PSA testing.The number needed to invite (NNI) and the number needed to diagnose (NND) were calculated by comparing the expected versus observed incidence and mortality rates.RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: At 18 yr, 1396 men were diagnosed with PC and 79 men died of PC in the screening group, compared to 962 and 122, respectively, in the control group.In the screening group, the observed cumulative PC incidence/mortality was 16%/0.98% compared to expected values of 6.8%/1.7%.The corresponding values for the control group were 11%/1.5% and 6.9%/1.7%.Organized screening was associated with an absolute PC-specific mortality reduction of 0.72% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.50-0.94%) and relative risk reduction of 42% (95% CI 28-54%).There was an absolute reduction in PC deaths of 0.20% (95% CI -0.06% to 0.47%) and a relative risk reduction of 12% (95% CI -5 to 26%) associated with opportunistic PSA testing.NNI and NND were 139 (95% CI 107-200) and 13 for organized biennial screening and 493 (95% CI 213- -1563) and 23 for opportunistic screening.The extent of opportunistic screening could not be measured; incidence trends were used as a proxy.CONCLUSIONS: Organized screening reduces PC mortality but is associated with overdiagnosis.Opportunistic PSA testing had little if any effect on PC mortality and resulted in more overdiagnosis, with almost twice the number of men needed to be diagnosed to save one man from dying from PC compared to men offered an organized biennial screening program.PATIENT SUMMARY: Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening within the framework of an organized program seems more effective than unorganized screening.",0,0,0,0
29346040,"Bevacizumab Maintenance Versus No Maintenance During Chemotherapy-Free Intervals in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer: A Randomized Phase III Trial (PRODIGE 9).Purpose Conflicting results are reported for maintenance treatment with bevacizumab during chemotherapy-free intervals (CFI) in metastatic colorectal cancer after induction chemotherapy.Patients and Methods In this open-label, phase III, randomized controlled trial, we compared the tumor control duration (TCD) observed with bevacizumab maintenance and with no treatment (observation) during CFI subsequent to induction chemotherapy with 12 cycles of fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan plus bevacizumab.After disease progression, the induction regimen was repeated for eight cycles, followed by a new CFI.Results From March 2010 to July 2013, 491 patients were randomly assigned.Disease progression or death occurred during induction chemotherapy in 85 patients (17%); 261 patients (53%) had at least one reinduction, 107 (22%) had two reinductions, and 56 (11%) had three or more reinductions.The median TCD was 15 months in both groups; the median progression-free survival (PFS) from randomization was 9.2 and 8.9 months in the maintenance group and observation groups, respectively.The TCD observed in both groups was higher compared with the TCD hypotheses of the trial.The median overall survival (OS) was 21.7 and 22.0 months in the maintenance and observation groups, respectively.In the per-protocol population, defined as patients with at least one reinduction after the first progression, the median duration of the first CFI was 4.3 months in both arms; the median TCD was 17.8 and 23.3 months ( P = .339), the median PFS was 9.9 and 9.5 months, and the median OS was 27.6 and 28.5 months in the maintenance and observation groups, respectively.Multivariable analysis revealed that female gender, WHO performance status >/= 2, and unresected primary tumors were associated with a shorter TCD.Conclusion Bevacizumab maintenance monotherapy did not improve TCD, CFI duration, PFS, or OS.",1,1,1,0

And the CTDIvol of group A (5.2 +/- 1.2 mGy) was obviously lower than that of group B (13.5 +/- 4.7 mGy) (P < 0.01).CONCLUSION: For patients of BMI </= 22 kg/m(2), low tube voltage and low contrast medium concentration scan condition with 50% ASiR algorithm is feasible for acquiring better quality image and ensuring significant reduction in effective dose.",1,1,0,0
34436521,"Effect of Cisplatin and Gemcitabine With or Without Berzosertib in Patients With Advanced Urothelial Carcinoma: A Phase 2 Randomized Clinical Trial.Importance: Preclinical studies suggest that inhibition of single-stranded DNA repair by ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 (ATR) may enhance the cytotoxicity of cisplatin, gemcitabine, and other chemotherapeutic agents.Cisplatin with gemcitabine remains the standard up-front therapy for treatment in patients with metastatic urothelial cancer.Objective: To determine whether the use of the selective ATR inhibitor, berzosertib, could augment the activity of cisplatin with gemcitabine.Design, Setting, and Participants: In a phase 2 randomized clinical trial, 87 patients across 23 centers in the National Cancer Institute Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network were randomized to receive either cisplatin with gemcitabine alone (control arm) or cisplatin with gemcitabine plus berzosertib (experimental arm).Key eligibility criteria included confirmed metastatic urothelial cancer, no prior cytotoxic therapy for metastatic disease, 12 months or more since perioperative therapy, and eligibility for cisplatin receipt based on standard criteria.The study was conducted from January 27, 2017, to December 15, 2020.Interventions: In the control arm, cisplatin, 70 mg/m2, was given on day 1 and gemcitabine, 1000 mg/m2, was given on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle.In the experimental arm, cisplatin, 60 mg/m2, was given on day 1; gemcitabine, 875 mg/m2, on days 1 and 8; and berzosertib, 90 mg/m2, on days 2 and 9 of a 21-day cycle.Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point of the study was progression-free survival.The analysis was on all patients who started therapy.Results: Of the total of 87 patients randomized, 41 patients received cisplatin with gemcitabine alone and 46 received cisplatin with gemcitabine plus berzosertib.Median age was 67 (range, 32-84) years, and 68 patients (78%) were men.Median progression-free survival was 8.0 months for both arms (Bajorin risk-adjusted hazard ratio, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.72-2.08).Median overall survival was shorter with cisplatin with gemcitabine plus berzosertib compared with cisplatin with gemcitabine alone (14.4 vs 19.8 months; Bajorin risk-adjusted hazard ratio, 1.42; 95% CI, 0.76-2.68).Higher rates of grade 3 vs grade 4 thrombocytopenia (59% vs 39%) and neutropenia (37% vs 27%) were observed with cisplatin with gemcitabine and berzosertib compared with cisplatin with gemcitabine alone; consequently, more dose reductions were needed in the experimental arm.Patients in the experimental arm received a median cisplatin dose of 250 mg/m2, which was significantly lower than the median dose of 370 mg/m2 in the control arm (P < .001).Conclusions and Relevance: The addition of berzosertib to cisplatin with gemcitabine did not prolong progression-free survival relative to cisplatin with gemcitabine alone in patients with metastatic urothelial cancer, and a trend toward inferior survival was observed with this combination.Berzosertib plus cisplatin with gemcitabine was associated with significantly higher hematologic toxicities despite attenuated dosing of cisplatin with gemcitabine.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02567409.",1,1,1,0
31400480,"Effect of a high-intensity interval training on serum microRNA levels in women with breast cancer undergoing hormone therapy. A single-blind randomized trial.BACKGROUND: The role of microRNAs (miRs) in hormone therapy (HT) is of keen interest in developing biomarkers and treatments for individuals with breast cancer.Although miRs are often moderate regulators under homeostatic conditions, their function is changed more in response to physical activity.OBJECTIVE: This single-blind randomized trial aimed to explore the effect of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on serum levels of miRs in individuals with early-stage breast cancer undergoing HT.METHODS: Hormone receptor-positive women with breast cancer and healthy women were randomly assigned to a healthy control group (n=15), healthy group with HIIT (n=15), breast cancer group with HT (HT, n=26), and breast cancer group with HT and HIIT (HT+HIIT, n=26).The exercise groups underwent interval uphill walking training on a treadmill 3 times a week for 12weeks.At the end of the study, we analyzed changes in levels of cancer-related miRs (oncomiRs) and tumour suppressor miRs (TSmiRs) in response to the HT and HIIT.RESULTS: In women with breast cancer versus healthy controls, the expression of some oncomiRs was significantly increased - miR-21 (P<0.001), miR-155 (P=0.001), miR-221 (P=0.008), miR-27a (P<0.001), and miR-10b (P=0.007) - and that of some TSmiRs was significantly decreased - miR-206 (P=0.048), miR-145 (P=0.011), miR-143 (P=0.008), miR-9 (P=0.020), and let-7a (P=0.005).Moreover, HT considerably downregulated oncomiRs and upregulated TSmiRs.HIIT for 12weeks with HT significantly decreased the expression of the oncomiRs and significantly increased that of the TSmiRs as compared with HT alone.CONCLUSIONS: HITT could amplify the decrease and/or increase in expression of miRs associated with HT in women with breast cancer.A prospective trial could determine whether the use of circulating miRs for monitoring treatment can be useful in therapy decisions.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (No.: IRCT201202289171N1).",1,1,0,0
23650416,"Randomized phase II, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of exemestane with or without entinostat in postmenopausal women with locally recurrent or metastatic estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer progressing on treatment with a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor.PURPOSE: Entinostat is an oral isoform selective histone deacetylase inhibitor that targets resistance to hormonal therapies in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer.This randomized, placebo-controlled, phase II study evaluated entinostat combined with the aromatase inhibitor exemestane versus exemestane alone.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Postmenopausal women with ER+ advanced breast cancer progressing on a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor were randomly assigned to exemestane 25 mg daily plus entinostat 5 mg once per week (EE) or exemestane plus placebo (EP).The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS).Blood was collected in a subset of patients for evaluation of protein lysine acetylation as a biomarker of entinostat activity.RESULTS: One hundred thirty patients were randomly assigned (EE group, n = 64; EP group, n = 66).Based on intent-to-treat analysis, treatment with EE improved median PFS to 4.3 months versus 2.3 months with EP (hazard ratio [HR], 0.73; 95% CI, 0.50 to 1.07; one-sided P = .055; two-sided P = .11 [predefined significance level of .10, one-sided]).Median overall survival was an exploratory end point and improved to 28.1 months with EE versus 19.8 months with EP (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.97; P = .036).Fatigue and neutropenia were the most frequent grade 3/4 toxicities.Treatment discontinuation because of adverse events was higher in the EE group versus the EP group (11% v 2%).Protein lysine hyperacetylation in the EE biomarker subset was associated with prolonged PFS.CONCLUSION: Entinostat added to exemestane is generally well tolerated and demonstrated activity in patients with ER+ advanced breast cancer in this signal-finding phase II study.Acetylation changes may provide an opportunity to maximize clinical benefit with entinostat.Plans for a confirmatory study are underway.",1,1,1,1
32719000,"Once, Twice, Three Times a Finding: Reproducibility of Dendritic Cell Vaccine Trials Targeting Cytomegalovirus in Glioblastoma.Despite standard of care for glioblastoma, including gross total resection, high-dose radiation, and dose-limited chemotherapy, this tumor remains one of the most aggressive and therapeutically challenging.The relatively small number of patients with this diagnosis compared with more common solid tumors in clinical trials commits new glioblastoma therapies to testing in small, underpowered, nonrandomized settings.Among approximately 200 registered glioblastoma trials identified between 2005 and 2015, nearly half were single-arm studies with sample sizes not exceeding 50 patients.These constraints have made demonstrating efficacy for novel therapies difficult in glioblastoma and other rare and aggressive cancers.Novel immunotherapies for glioblastoma such as vaccination with dendritic cells (DC) have yielded mixed results in clinical trials.To address limited numbers, we sequentially conducted three separate clinical trials utilizing cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific DC vaccines in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma whereby each follow-up study had nearly doubled in sample size.Follow-up data from the first blinded, randomized phase II clinical trial (NCT00639639) revealed that nearly one third of this cohort is without tumor recurrence at 5 years from diagnosis.A second clinical trial (NCT00639639) resulted in a 36% survival rate at 5 years from diagnosis.Results of the first two-arm trial (NCT00639639) showed increased migration of the DC vaccine to draining lymph nodes, and this increased migration has been recapitulated in our larger confirmatory clinical study (NCT02366728).We have now observed that nearly one third of the glioblastoma study patient population receiving CMV-specific DC vaccines results in exceptional long-term survivors.",0,0,0,0
32171426,"Pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and docetaxel for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (CLEOPATRA): end-of-study results from a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study.BACKGROUND: CLEOPATRA was a phase 3 study comparing the efficacy and safety of pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and docetaxel with placebo, trastuzumab, and docetaxel in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.In the primary analysis and subsequent reports, progression-free and overall survival were significantly improved in the pertuzumab group compared with the placebo group.Here, we report the end-of-study analysis of CLEOPATRA.METHODS: This was a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial that was done at 204 centres in 25 countries.Eligible patients were 18 years or older, had HER2-positive, metastatic breast cancer, had not received previous chemotherapy or biological treatment for their metastatic disease, and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1.All study drugs were given intravenously, every 3 weeks.Patients were assigned to receive either pertuzumab or placebo at a loading dose of 840 mg, and 420 mg thereafter; plus trastuzumab at 8 mg/kg loading dose and 6 mg/kg thereafter; and docetaxel at 75 mg/m(2), escalating to 100 mg/m(2) if tolerated.Pertuzumab or placebo and trastuzumab were given until disease progression; docetaxel was given for six cycles, or longer at the investigators' discretion.Randomisation (1:1) was done by use of an interactive voice-response system and was stratified by geographical region (Asia, Europe, North America, or South America) and previous treatment (previous adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy vs none).The primary endpoint was independent review facility-assessed progression-free survival, which has been reported previously.Since the confirmatory overall survival analysis had also occurred before this prespecified end-of-study analysis, analyses presented here are descriptive.Overall survival analyses were based on the intention-to-treat population with crossover patients analysed in the placebo group; analyses were not adjusted for crossover to the pertuzumab group and are likely to be conservative.Safety analyses were based on treatment received; crossover patients were counted in the placebo group up to the day before first pertuzumab dose.This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00567190.FINDINGS: Between Feb 12, 2008, and July 7, 2010, 1196 patients were assessed for eligibility, of whom 808 were enrolled and randomly assigned.402 patients were assigned to receive docetaxel plus trastuzumab plus pertuzumab, and 406 patients were assigned to receive docetaxel plus trastuzumab plus placebo.Clinical cutoff for this analysis was Nov 23, 2018.Between July 2012 and clinical cutoff, 50 patients crossed from the placebo to the pertuzumab group.Median follow-up was 99.9 months in the pertuzumab group (IQR 92.9-106.4) and 98.7 months (90.9-105.7) in the placebo group.Median overall survival was 57.1 months (95% CI 50-72) in the pertuzumab group and 40.8 months (36-48) in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0.69, 95% CI 0.58-0.82); 8-year landmark overall survival rates were 37% (95% CI 31-42) in the pertuzumab group and 23% (19-28) in the placebo group.The most common grade 3-4 adverse event was neutropenia (200 [49%] of 408 patients in the pertuzumab group, 183 [46%] of 396 patients in the placebo group).Five (1%) of 408 patients in the pertuzumab group and six (2%) of 396 patients in the placebo group had treatment-related deaths.One new serious adverse event suggestive of congestive heart failure (pertuzumab group) and one new symptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction (post-crossover) occurred since the previous analysis.INTERPRETATION: Our analysis shows that the previously observed improvements in overall survival with pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and docetaxel versus placebo, trastuzumab, and docetaxel were maintained after a median of more than 8 years of follow-up.The long-term safety and cardiac safety profiles of pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and docetaxel were maintained in the overall safety population and within crossover patients.HER2-targeted therapy has changed the natural history of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, with the dual blockade of pertuzumab and trastuzumab, with docetaxel, demonstrating an 8-year landmark overall survival rate of 37%.FUNDING: F Hoffmann-La Roche and Genentech.",1,1,1,1
21750964,"Pathological complete response rates following different neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens for operable breast cancer according to ER status, in two parallel, randomized phase II trials with an adaptive study design (ECTO II).Sequential doxorubicin/paclitaxel (AT) followed by CMF treatment was shown to be an active neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen in the first European Cooperative Trial in Operable Breast Cancer (ECTO I trial).The aim of the current study (ECTO II) is to assess the complete pathological response (pCR) rate following three different anthracycline and taxane-containing neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens, with or without capecitabine (X).Patients with operable, invasive breast cancer > 2.0 cm in diameter, were randomized to AT-->CMF, AT-->CMX or AC-->TX regimens in two parallel, randomized, open-label, phase II trials (within a single study) in patients with estrogen receptor negative (ER-) and estrogen receptor positive (ER+) diseases, respectively.Exemestane was delivered concomitantly with neoadjuvant chemotherapy in ER+ tumors.Achievement of pCR was more common in ER- than ER+ women (45.3 vs. 10.4%).Capecitabine was only associated with a higher frequency of pCR in ER+ patients receiving AT-->CMX.Overall response rates (ORR) ranged from 88 to 97%, and this translated into high rates of breast-conserving surgery (67% of ER- patients and 72% of ER+ patients).All three regimens were well tolerated.Febrile neutropenia and gastrointestinal effects were the most common grade >/= 3 adverse events.As expected, the ECTO II study showed higher pCR rates in patients with ER- disease.Substituting capecitabine for fluorouracil (+/- methotrexate) in anthracycline/taxane-containing regimens appeared to be beneficial only in ER+ tumors.Translational studies investigating interactions between therapeutic agents and tumor biology are warranted to refine patient selection and improve the results of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.",0,0,0,0
33479759,"Prognostic impact of geriatric assessment in elderly patients with non-small cell lung cancer: an integrated analysis of two randomized phase III trials (JCOG1115-A).OBJECTIVE: Patients' actual age and performance status do not always accurately identify the 'fit elderly' for chemotherapy.This study aimed to determine whether four geriatric assessment tools could predict prognosis.METHODS: This study were analyzed using the data of two randomized phase III trials (JCOG0207 and JCOG0803/WJOG4307L) for elderly patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer and included all eligible patients who were assessed before treatment with four geriatric assessment tools: the Barthel activities of daily living index, Lawton instrumental activities of daily living scale, Mini-Mental State Examination, and Geriatric Depression Scale-15.Univariable and multivariable analyses for overall survival, adjusted for baseline factors, were performed using a stratified Cox regression model with treatment regimen as strata.RESULTS: This analysis included 330 patients aged 70-74, 75-79 or 80 or more (n = 95/181/54), with a performance status of 0 or 1 (n = 119/211).Patients were divided into three groups based on Mini-Mental State Examination and two groups based on Geriatric Depression Scale, but over 80% of patients had perfect scores for both activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living.In overall survival subgroup analyses by GA tool, only Mini-Mental State Examination scores were associated with substantial outcome differences (median survival times: 21.2, 13.5 and 12.2 months for scores 30, 29-24 and </=23).After adjusting for baseline factors, the Mini-Mental State Examination, sex and performance status were tended to be worse overall survival.CONCLUSION: MMSE scores, performance status and sex, but not chronological age, effectively predicted the prognosis of elderly patients.Further studies should confirm that the Mini-Mental State Examination is useful for determining the indication of chemotherapy in elderly patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.",0,0,0,0
32780356,"A Randomized Controlled Trial on Evaluation of Plasma Epstein-Barr Virus Biomarker for Early Diagnosis in Patients With Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma.INTRODUCTION: Early diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) remains a major problem in Southern China.Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) biomarkers have been widely used in NPC screening.This study aims to evaluate the early diagnostic performances of individual EBV biomarkers in NPC.METHODS: The levels of EBV biomarkers-IgA antibodies against EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1-IgA), EBV capsid antigen (VCA-IgA), EBV early antigen (EA-IgA), EBV BZLF1 transcription activator protein (Zta-IgA) and IgG antibodies against EBV BRLF1 transcription activator protein (Rta-IgG)-from 106 NPC patients (stage I and II) and 150 normal subjects were measured.VCA-IgA and EA-IgA were detected by immunofluorescence assay (IFA), EBNA1-IgA, Rta-IgG and Zta-IgA were measure by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and EBV DNA was detected by qPCR.Statistical analyses of a single index were conducted to evaluate the significance of NPC early diagnosis and TNM classification.RESULTS: The level of EBNA1-IgA, EBV DNA, VCA-IgA, EA-IgA, Rta-IgG and Zta-IgA in early-stage NPC was significantly higher than in healthy controls (all P < 0.001).EBNA1-IgA yielded the biggest area under the curve (AUC) of 0.962 in distinguishing early-stage NPC patients from the normal subjects, with a sensitivity of 91.5% and a specificity of 98.7%.However, EBV biomarker levels were not associated with tumor size (all P > 0.050), whereas four biomarker levels (EBNA1-IgA, EBV DNA, VCA-IgA, EA-IgA) were related to lymph node metastasis (N0 and N1-2), among which EBNA1-IgA and EBV DNA showed good performance.Finally, high correlation was found between VCA-IgA and EA-IgA (r > 0.800).CONCLUSION: A single EBNA1-IgA exhibits excellent discrimination performance in early diagnosis of NPC and could become a promising marker for NPC screening.",1,1,0,0

27751846,"Safety and efficacy of regorafenib in patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma (REGOSARC): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial.BACKGROUND: Regorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor with proven activity in refractory gastrointestinal stromal tumours and chemotherapy-refractory advanced colorectal cancers.We assessed this agent's efficacy and safety in patients with metastatic soft tissue sarcomas previously treated with anthracycline.METHODS: In this randomised, double-blind, phase 2 trial undertaken in France and Austria, we enrolled patients aged 18 years and older with advanced soft tissue sarcomas who had received previous doxorubicin or other anthracycline treatment.These patients were randomly assigned (1:1) into one of the following four cohorts: liposarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, and other sarcomas.Participants were treated with oral regorafenib (160 mg per day 3 weeks on and 1 week off) or matched placebo.Patients receiving placebo were offered optional crossover in case of centrally confirmed disease progression.The random allocation schedule was computer-generated with permuted blocks of four patients, with two stratification factors: country (France or Austria) and previous exposure to pazopanib (yes or no).Eligibility criteria included patients with histologically proven advanced and inoperable soft tissue sarcomas with intolerance or failure to doxorubicin or other anthracycline-based chemotherapy and at least one unidimensionally or bidimensionally measurable lesion according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST; version 1.1).The primary endpoint was RECIST-based progression-free survival after central radiological review in the intention-to-treat population.Patients, physicians, and radiologists of the panel were masked to treatment allocation.This study is still open for recruitment for an additional stratum (patients previously treated with pazopanib) and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01900743.FINDINGS: From Aug 5, 2013, to Nov 26, 2014, 182 patients were randomly assigned to one of four cohorts and included in the final analysis.At the cutoff date (Jan 7, 2016), the number of required events was reached for the four cohorts.In the liposarcoma cohort, progression-free survival was 1.1 months (95% CI 0.9-2.3) with regorafenib versus 1.7 months (0.9-1.8) with placebo (HR 0.89 [95% CI 0.48-1.64] p=0.70).In the leiomyosarcoma cohort, progression-free survival was 3.7 months (95% CI 2.5-5.0) with regorafenib versus 1.8 (1.0-2.8) months with placebo (HR 0.46 [95% CI 0.46-0.80] p=0.0045).In the synovial sarcoma cohort, progression-free survival was 5.6 months (95% CI 1.4-11.6) with regorafenib versus 1.0 (0.8-1.4) with placebo (HR 0.10 [95% CI 0.03-0.35] p<0.0001).In the other sarcoma cohort, progression-free survival was 2.9 months (95% CI 1.0-7.8) with regorafenib versus 1.0 (0.9-1.9) with placebo (HR 0.46 [95% CI 0.25-0.81] p=0.0061).Before crossover, the most common clinically significant grade 3 or higher adverse events were arterial hypertension (17 [19%] events in the 89 patients in the regorafenib group vs two [2%] events in the 92 patients in the placebo group), hand and foot skin reaction (14 [15%] vs no events) and asthenia (12 [13%] vs six [6%]).One treatment-related death occurred in the regorafenib group due to liver failure.INTERPRETATION: Regorafenib has an important clinical antitumour effect in non-adipocytic soft tissue sarcomas, improving progression-free survival.Regorafenib should be further evaluated in this setting, and its therapeutic role has to be defined in the context of the growing therapeutic armamentarium, already including one approved multikinase inhibitor, pazopanib.FUNDING: Bayer HealthCare.",1,1,1,0
24608924,"Influence of interferon-alpha combined with chemo (radio) therapy on immunological parameters in pancreatic adenocarcinoma.Prognosis of patients with carcinoma of the exocrine pancreas is particularly poor.A combination of chemotherapy with immunotherapy could be an option for treatment of pancreatic cancer.The aim of this study was to perform an immunomonitoring of 17 patients with pancreatic cancer from the CapRI-2 study, and tumor-bearing mice treated with combination of chemo (radio) therapies with interferon-2alpha.Low doses of interferon-2alpha led to a decrease in total leukocyte and an increase in monocyte counts.Furthermore, we observed a positive effect of interferon-2alpha therapy on the dendritic cells and NK (natural killer) cell activation immediately after the first injection.In addition, we recorded an increased amount of interferon-gamma and IL-10 in the serum following the interferon-2alpha therapy.These data clearly demonstrate that pancreatic carcinoma patients also show an immunomodulatory response to interferon-2alpha therapy.Analysis of immunosuppressive cells in the Panc02 orthotopic mouse model of pancreatic cancer revealed an accumulation of the myeloid-derived suppressor cells in spleens and tumors of the mice treated with interferon-2alpha and 5-fluorouracil.The direct effect of the drugs on myeloid-derived suppressor cells was also registered in vitro.These data expose the importance of immunosuppressive mechanisms induced by combined chemo-immunotherapy.",0,0,0,0
27068497,"Efficacy and safety of S-1 (tegafur, gimeracil, and oteracil potassium) concurrent with 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy for newly diagnosed squamous cell carcinoma of the lung in elderly patients.PURPOSE: This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of the combination drug tegafur, gimeracil, and oteracil potassium (S-1) concurrent with 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy for newly diagnosed squamous cell carcinoma of the lung in elderly patients.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with pathologically or cytologically newly diagnosed lung squamous cell carcinoma (n=106) were randomly assigned to receive the combination of tegafur, gimeracil, and oteracil potassium (40mg/m(2), BID, d1-28, repeated every 6 weeks for 4 cycles) and concurrent 3D-conformal radiotherapy (60Gy; experimental group), or gemcitabine (800-1000mg/m(2), d1 and d8) repeated every 21 days for 4 cycles as well as 3D-conformal radiotherapy (control group).RESULTS: The overall response rate (complete and partial responses) of the experimental group was 68.6%, which was significantly higher than that of the control group (38.5%; P=0.002).The median progression-free survival rates of the experimental and control groups were 11.8 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.0-22.4) and 7.8 months (95% CI, 6.9-9.2), respectively (P=0.017).Adverse reactions included grade I/II radiation esophagitis and pneumonitis, with good tolerance.Grade III/IV adverse reactions of the experimental and control groups were leucopenia (20% cf.56.6%, respectively; P=0.027), thrombocytopenia (3.9% cf. 25%; P=0.037), and gastrointestinal reaction (1.9% cf. 3.5%; P=0.35).CONCLUSION: The efficacy of concurrent combination chemotherapy with tegafur, gimeracil, and oteracil potassium (S-1) and 3D-conformal radiotherapy for newly diagnosed squamous cell carcinoma of the lung in elderly patients was excellent, and all toxicities were well tolerated.This treatment might be considered a main regimen in the management of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung in elderly patients.",1,1,1,0
34528557,"A prospective randomized trial comparing accelerated concurrent chemoradiotherapy with conventional concurrent chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced carcinoma cervix (IIA-IVA).Introduction: Cervical cancer ranks fourth in women worldwide.The management requires a multidisciplinary approach.Concomitant chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin, followed by brachytherapy, is the standard approach.Accelerated radiotherapy (ART) can be used to decrease the treatment duration which can further lead to better outcomes.Materials and Methods: Stages II, III, and IVA of carcinoma cervix were studied for 1 year.Ninety patients were randomized in control and study arms, 45 patients in each arm.The total dose of radiation was 50 Gy/25#/5 weeks from Monday to Friday in the control arm and 50 Gy/25#/4 weeks from Monday to Saturday in the study arm, with injection cisplatin 40 mg/m (2) intravenous infusion weekly in both the arms.Results: The response was similar in both the arms at the first follow-up as well as at median follow-up.However, acute toxicities in the ART arm were more, but they were managed conservatively.Conclusion: ART can be used in patients of cervical cancers to decrease the total treatment time.The results were similar in both the groups but need to be studied over more number of patients.",1,1,1,0
31404106,"Improved detection of prostate cancer using a magneto-nanosensor assay for serum circulating autoantibodies.PURPOSE: To develop a magneto-nanosensor (MNS) based multiplex assay to measure protein and autoantibody biomarkers from human serum for prostate cancer (CaP) diagnosis.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 4-panel MNS autoantibody assay and a MNS protein assay were developed and optimized in our labs.Using these assays, serum concentration of six biomarkers including prostate-specific antigen (PSA) protein, free/total PSA ratio, as well as four autoantibodies against Parkinson disease 7 (PARK7), TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TARDBP), Talin 1 (TLN1), and Caldesmon 1 (CALD1) and were analyzed.Human serum samples from 99 patients (50 with non-cancer and 49 with clinically localized CaP) were evaluated.RESULTS: The MNS assay showed excellent performance characteristics and no cross-reactivity.All autoantibody assays showed a statistically significant difference between CaP and non-cancer samples except for PARK7.The most significant difference was the combination of the four autoantibodies as a panel in addition to the free/total PSA ratio.This combination had the highest area under the curve (AUC)- 0.916 in ROC analysis.CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that this autoantibody panel along with PSA and free PSA have potential to segregate patients without cancer from those with prostate cancer with higher sensitivity and specificity than PSA alone.",0,0,0,0
30637839,"Patient preferences for adjuvant radiotherapy in early breast cancer are strongly influenced by treatment received through random assignment.OBJECTIVE: TARGIT-A randomised women with early breast cancer to receive external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) or intraoperative radiotherapy (TARGIT-IORT).This study aimed to identify what extra risk of recurrence patients would accept for perceived benefits and risks of different radiotherapy treatments.METHODS: Patient preferences were determined by self-rated trade-off questionnaires in two studies: Stage (1) 209 TARGIT-A participants (TARGIT-IORTn = 108, EBRTn = 101); Stage (2) 123 non-trial patients yet to receive radiotherapy (pre-treatment group), with 85 also surveyed post-radiotherapy.Patients traded-off risks of local recurrence in preference selection between TARGIT-IORT and EBRT.RESULTS: TARGIT-IORT patients were more accepting of IORT than EBRT patients with 60% accepting the highest increased risk presented (4%-6%) compared to 12% of EBRT patients, and 2% not accepting IORT at all compared to 43% of EBRT patients.Pre-treatment patients were more accepting of IORT than post-treatment patients with 23% accepting the highest increased risk presented compared to 15% of post-treatment patients, and 15% not accepting IORT at all compared to 41% of pre-treatment patients.CONCLUSIONS: Breast cancer patients yet to receive radiotherapy accept a higher recurrence risk than the actual risk found in TARGIT-A. Measured patient preferences are highly influenced by experience of treatment received.This finding challenges the validity of post-treatment preference studies.",0,0,0,0
31574097,"Community-based football in men with prostate cancer: 1-year follow-up on a pragmatic, multicentre randomised controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Physical exercise has been shown to be effective in relation to fatigue, aerobic fitness, and lower body strength in men with prostate cancer.However, research into the clinically relevant effects of interventions conducted in heterogeneous patient populations and in real-life clinical practice settings is warranted.METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a pragmatic, multicentre, parallel randomised controlled trial in 5 Danish urological departments.Recruitment began in May 2015, the first participant was randomised in June 2015, and the last participant was included in February 2017.In total, 214 men with prostate cancer were randomly assigned to either 6 months of free-of-charge football training twice weekly at a local club (football group [FG]) (n = 109) or usual care (usual care group [UG]) (n = 105), including brief information on physical activity recommendations at randomisation.Participants were on average 68.4 (SD 6.2) years old, 157 (73%) were retired, 87 (41%) were on castration-based treatment, 19 (9%) had received chemotherapy, and 41 (19%) had skeletal metastases at baseline.In this 1-year follow-up study, we evaluated the effects of community-based football training on the following outcomes: primary outcome, quality of life; secondary outcomes: continuation of football after 6 months, hip and lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD), mental health score, fat and lean body mass, and safety outcomes, i.e., fractures, falls, and hospital admissions.Intention to treat (ITT) and per protocol (PP) analyses were conducted.No statistically significant between-group difference was observed in change in prostate-cancer-specific quality of life (ITT: 1.9 points [95% CI -1.9 to 5.8], p = 0.325; PP: 3.6 points [95% CI -0.9 to 8.2], p = 0.119).A statistically significant between-group difference was observed in change in total hip BMD, in favour of FG (0.007 g/cm2 [95% CI 0.004 to 0.013], p = 0.037).No differences were observed in change in lumbar spine BMD or lean body mass.Among patients allocated to football, 59% chose to continue playing football after the end of the 6-month intervention period.At 1-year follow-up in the PP population, FG participants had more improvement on the Mental Component Summary (2.9 [95% CI 0.0 to 5.7], p = 0.048 points higher) than UG participants, as well as a greater loss of fat mass (-0.9 kg [95% CI -1.7 to -0.1], p = 0.029).There were no differences between groups in relation to fractures or falls.Hospital admissions were more frequent in UG compared to FG (33 versus 20; the odds ratio based on PP analysis was 0.34 for FG compared to UG).There were 3 deaths in FG and 4 in UG.Main limitations of the study were the physically active control group and assessment of physical activity by means of self-report.CONCLUSIONS: In this trial, participants allocated to football appeared to have improved hip BMD and fewer hospital admissions.Men who played football more than once a week for 1 year lost fat mass and reported improved mental health.Community-based football proved to be acceptable, even when club membership was not subsidised.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02430792.",1,1,0,0
24214315,"Similar relationship between the time course of bone mineral density improvement and vertebral fracture risk reduction with denosumab treatment in postmenopausal osteoporosis and prostate cancer patients on androgen deprivation therapy.Denosumab has received approval in many countries and indications include treating women with postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO) at increased or high risk for fracture and men at high risk for fracture receiving androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for non-metastatic prostate cancer.Increases in total hip bone mineral density (BMD) with denosumab explained a large percentage of new vertebral fracture risk reduction in women with PMO; however, this effect has not been studied in men with prostate cancer receiving ADT.We compared the relationship between the time course of BMD changes and new vertebral fracture risk reduction with denosumab in women with PMO and men with prostate cancer.After adjusting for different baseline hazards, a significant and similar relationship between time course of total hip and lumbar spine BMD changes and new vertebral fracture risk was observed in both patient populations.Time course of total hip BMD changes with denosumab was the best predictor for changes in fracture risk and explained 88% of the new vertebral fracture risk reduction in women with PMO and 91% in men with prostate cancer.Therefore, total hip BMD is a useful surrogate to measure the clinical impact of denosumab on fracture risk reduction in both patient populations.",0,0,0,0
29574365,"Health-related quality of life from the FALCON phase III randomised trial of fulvestrant 500 mg versus anastrozole for hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer.BACKGROUND: The phase III randomised FALCON trial (NCT01602380) demonstrated improved progression-free survival with fulvestrant 500 mg versus anastrozole 1 mg in endocrine therapy-naive postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive (HR+) locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (LA/MBC).Furthermore, overall health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was maintained and comparable for fulvestrant and anastrozole.Here, we present additional analyses of patient-reported HRQoL outcomes from FALCON.METHODS: Women with endocrine therapy-naive HR+ LA/MBC were randomised 1:1 to fulvestrant (days 0, 14, 28, then every 28 d) or anastrozole (daily) until disease progression or discontinuation.HRQoL was assessed by FACT-B questionnaire (TOI and FACT-B total score) at randomisation and every 12 weeks during treatment.HRQoL data post-treatment (with or without progression) were also collected.RESULTS: In total, 462 patients were randomised (fulvestrant, n = 230; anastrozole, n = 232).Compliance to FACT-B overall ranged from 60.0 to 97.4%.Mean change from baseline in TOI and FACT-B total score remained broadly stable (approximately +/- 3 points to week 132) and was similar between arms during treatment.HRQoL was also maintained in FACT-B subscales.Approximately one-third of patients had improved TOI (>/=+6 points) and FACT-B (>/=+8 points) total scores from baseline up to week 120 and 132, respectively, of treatment with fulvestrant (ranges 26.4-45.0% and 22.4-35.8%, respectively) and anastrozole (ranges 18.6-32.9%, and 22.7-37.9%, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: Mean change from baseline in TOI and FACT-B total score was maintained for fulvestrant and anastrozole; similar proportions of patients in both arms had improved TOI and FACT-B total scores.CLINICALTRIALS.GOV IDENTIFIER: NCT01602380.",1,1,1,0
22374991,"Gastric cancer incidence among Hispanics in California: patterns by time, nativity, and neighborhood characteristics.BACKGROUND: Better understanding about gastric cancer incidence patterns among Hispanics by birthplace, socioeconomic status (SES), and acculturation can improve preventive strategies and disease models.METHODS: Incidence rates, rate ratios, and estimated annual percent change (EAPC) in rates of anatomic and histologic subtype-specific gastric cancer were calculated by age, sex, and nativity among Hispanics using California Cancer Registry data from 1988 through 2004.Incidence rates in 1998 to 2002 were compared by neighborhood SES and Hispanic enclave status according to 2000 US Census data.RESULTS: Incidence rates of diffuse gastric cancer increased from 1988 through 2004 among foreign-born Hispanic men (EAPC: 3.5%, 95% CI: 1.5%-5.5%) and U.S.-born Hispanic women (EAPC: 3.0%, 95% CI: 0.7%-5.3%).During the same time period, incidence rates of intestinal gastric cancer declined significantly and both cardia and noncardia gastric cancer were steady or declined among foreign-born and U.S.-born Hispanic men and women.Noncardia and both intestinal and diffuse gastric cancer were more common in foreign-born than U.S.-born Hispanic men and women, and in those from lower SES, higher enclave neighborhoods.By contrast, among younger and middle-aged Hispanic men, cardia tumors were more common in the U.S.-born than the foreign-born, and in higher SES, lower enclave neighborhoods.CONCLUSIONS: Varying gastric cancer risk factors among Hispanic subgroups and increasing rates of diffuse gastric cancer in foreign-born Hispanic men and U.S.-born Hispanic women merit further investigation to identify separate disease etiologies.IMPACT: Age, sex, birthplace, SES, and acculturation modify gastric cancer incidence in Hispanics and should be considered when examining disease risk and prevention.",0,0,0,0
30115593,"Bevacizumab and temozolomide in patients with first recurrence of WHO grade II and III glioma, without 1p/19q co-deletion (TAVAREC): a randomised controlled phase 2 EORTC trial.BACKGROUND: Bevacizumab is frequently used in the treatment of recurrent WHO grade II and III glioma, but without supporting evidence from randomised trials.Therefore, we assessed the use of bevacizumab in patients with first recurrence of grade II or III glioma who did not have 1p/19q co-deletion.METHODS: The TAVAREC trial was a randomised, open-label phase 2 trial done at 32 centres across Europe in patients with locally diagnosed grade II or III glioma without 1p/19q co-deletion, with a first and contrast-enhancing recurrence after initial radiotherapy or chemotherapy, or both.Previous chemotherapy must have been stopped at least 6 months before enrolment and radiotherapy must have been stopped at least 3 months before enrolment.Random group assignment was done electronically through the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer web-based system, stratified by a minimisation procedure using institution, initial histology (WHO grade II vs III), WHO performance status (0 or 1 vs 2), and previous treatment (radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or both).Patients were assigned to receive either temozolomide (150-200 mg/m(2), orally) monotherapy on days 1-5 every 4 weeks for a maximum of 12 cycles, or the same temozolomide regimen in combination with bevacizumab (10 mg/kg, intravenously) every 2 weeks until progression.The primary endpoint was overall survival at 12 months in the per-protocol population.Safety analyses were done in all patients who started their allocated treatment.The study is registered at EudraCT (2009-017422-39) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01164189), and is complete.FINDINGS: Between Feb 8, 2011, and July 31, 2015, 155 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive either monotherapy (n=77) or combination therapy (n=78).Overall survival in the per-protocol population at 12 months was achieved by 44 (61% [80% CI 53-69]) of 72 patients in the temozolomide group and 38 (55% [47-69]) of 69 in the combination group.The most frequent toxicity was haematological: 17 (23%) of 75 patients in the monotherapy group and 25 (33%) of 76 in the combination group developed grade 3 or 4 haematological toxicity.Other than haematological toxicities, the most common adverse events were nervous system disorders (59 [79%] of 75 patients in the monotherapy group vs 65 [86%] of 76 in the combination group), fatigue (53 [70%] vs 61 [80%]), and nausea (39 [52%] vs 43 [56%]).Infections were more frequently reported in the combination group (29 [38%] of 76 patients) than in the monotherapy group (17 [23%] of 75).One treatment-related death was reported in the combination group (infection after intratumoral haemorrhage during a treatment-related grade 4 thrombocytopenia).INTERPRETATION: We found no evidence of improved overall survival with bevacizumab and temozolomide combination treatment versus temozolomide monotherapy.The findings from this study provide no support for further phase 3 studies on the role of bevacizumab in this disease.FUNDING: Roche Pharmaceuticals.",1,1,1,1

24564888,"Wnt modulates MCL1 to control cell survival in triple negative breast cancer.BACKGROUND: Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) has higher rates of recurrence and distant metastasis, and poorer outcome as compared to non-TNBC.Aberrant activation of WNT signaling has been detected in TNBC, which might be important for triggering oncogenic conversion of breast epithelial cell.Therefore, we directed our focus on identifying the WNT ligand and its underlying mechanism in TNBC cells.METHODS: We performed large-scale analysis of public microarray data to screen the WNT ligands and the clinical significance of the responsible ligand in TNBC.WNT5B was identified and its overexpression in TNBC was confirmed by immunohistochemistry staining, Western blot and ELISA.ShRNA was used to knockdown WNT5B expression (shWNT5B).Cellular functional alteration with shWNT5B treatment was determined by using wound healing assay, mammosphere assay; while cell cycle and apoptosis were examined by flowcytometry.Mitochondrial morphology was photographed by electron microscope.Biological change of mitochondria was detected by RT-PCR and oxygen consumption assay.Activation of WNT pathway and its downstream targets were evaluated by liciferase assay, immunohistochemistry staining and immunoblot analysis.Statistical methods used in the experiments besides microarray analysis was two-tailed t-test.RESULTS: WNT5B was elevated both in the tumor and the patients' serum.Suppression of WNT5B remarkably impaired cell growth, migration and mammosphere formation.Additionally, G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and caspase-independent apoptosis was observed.Study of the possible mechanism indicated that these effects occurred through suppression of mitochondrial biogenesis, as evidenced by reduced mitochondrial DNA (MtDNA) and compromised oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS).In Vivo and in vitro data uncovered that WNT5B modulated mitochondrial physiology was mediated by MCL1, which was regulated by WNT/beta-catenin responsive gene, Myc.Clinic data analysis revealed that both WNT5B and MCL1 are associated with enhanced metastasis and decreased disease-free survival.CONCLUSIONS: All our findings suggested that WNT5B/MCL1 cascade is critical for TNBC and understanding its regulatory apparatus provided valuable insight into the pathogenesis of the tumor development and the guidance for targeting therapeutics.",0,0,0,0

A prospective randomized trial.BACKGROUND: The main problem in performing endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) of gastric neoplasms is that it is technically difficult, especially for beginners.METHODS: A total of 51 patients were randomly assigned to undergo transnasal endoscope-assisted or routine ESD performed by two endoscopists inexperienced in ESD while supervised by one expert.RESULTS: Total procedure time (p = 0.330), complete resection rate (p = 0.977), and complication rate (p = 0.157) were similar for the patients who underwent transnasal endoscope-assisted and routine ESD, but bleeding control time was significantly longer in the transnasal endoscope-assisted ESD group (p = 0.002).Three and six patients in the transnasal endoscope-assisted and routine ESD groups, respectively, were ""dropped out"" during the procedures (p = 0.291).The endoscopists tended to regard the traction with the transnasal endoscopeas more useful for large tumors (p = 0.062).Bleeding control in patients who underwent the transnasal endoscope-assisted ESD was significantly longer for patients with tumors located in the anterior wall, posterior wall, and lesser curvature of the stomach (p = 0.001).CONCLUSION: Transnasal endoscope-assisted ESD does not result in improved outcomes when performed by beginners, except for some large tumors.The traction method used by beginners was not superior to proper supervision and advice by an expert during ESD and allowing the expert to perform the procedure when the risk of complications is high or the procedure is delayed.",1,1,0,0
22453059,"Effects of vitamin D on cardiovascular disease risk factors in polycystic ovary syndrome women with vitamin D deficiency.BACKGROUND: Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent among women, including patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).Some studies have suggested that vitamin D may have a role in cardiovascular disease (CVD).There is very limited data on the vitamin D effect on CVD risk factors in women with PCOS and vitamin D deficiency.AIM: To investigate the effect of cholecalciferol on CVD risk factors in PCOS women with vitamin D deficiency.METHODS: The study was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double blinded trial.Fifty PCOS women with vitamin D deficiency (vitamin D, no. = 24; placebo, no. = 26) aged 20-40 yr, were randomly assigned to receive 3 oral capsules of 50,000 IU vitamin D3 or a placebo (one capsule every 20 days) for two months.Serum vitamin D, PTH, lipid profile, apolipoprotein AI (APO-AI), and high sensitive C- reactive protein (hs-CRP) were measured at baseline and after treatment.RESULTS: Vitamin D3 therapy in PCOS patients, increased serum vitamin D (7.00 +/- 2.80 to 22.9 +/- 6.14 ng/ml), decreased serum total cholesterol (196.6 +/- 32.8 to 179.1 +/- 34.1 mg/dl), triglyceride (156.8 +/- 73.0 to 130.5 +/- 56.5 mg/dl), and VLDL (31.4 +/- 14.6 to 26.1 +/- 11.3 mg/dl) levels significantly (p < 0.05), but it did not affect serum HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, APO-AI, and hs-CRP concentrations.There was no change in variables in the placebo group.CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that vitamin D3 therapy had beneficial effects on some CVD risk factors in PCOS patients with vitamin D deficiency.The trial was registered at IRCT.ir (IRCT138904113140N2).",1,0,0,0
22492244,"Occurrence of vaccine and non-vaccine human papillomavirus types in adolescent Finnish females 4 years post-vaccination.Control of human papillomavirus (HPV)-related cancers by inclusion of HPV vaccination into national vaccination programmes is likely.One open question is replacement of the vaccine types with other high-risk (hr) HPV types in the vaccination era.We studied occurrence of HPV types in adolescent females participating in a population-based vaccination trial.A total of 4,808 16- to 17-year-old females from Finland were enrolled in the 1:1 randomized phase III (PATRICIA) trial of the efficacy of vaccination with the AS04-adjuvanted HPV-16/18 virus-like particle vaccine as compared to hepatitis A virus (HAV) vaccine.HPV infection was assessed from cervical samples taken every 6 months for 4 years post-vaccination by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for genital oncogenic HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 58, 59, 66, 68, and 73 as well as low-risk types HPV-6 and HPV-11.The HPV-16/18 vaccine coverage ranged between 1 and 22% by age-cohort and study community.Odds ratios (ORs) for infections with different HPV types in baseline PCR negative HPV-16/18 vs. HAV vaccinated women, and Poisson regression derived HPV incidence rate ratios (IRRs) in baseline positive vs. negative women were calculated.The OR and IRR estimates for acquisition of any genital HPV types showed no excess risk neither in baseline HPV DNA-negative HPV-16/18-vaccinated women compared to baseline HPV DNA-negative HAV vaccinated women nor in HPV-16/18-vaccinated baseline HPV-16/18-positive women compared to baseline HPV-16/18-negative women.In the HAV-vaccinated, baseline HPV-18-positive women showed an increased risk of acquiring other clade A7 HPV types (39, 45, 59, 68) (IRR 1.8, 95% confidence interval = 1.01.-3.1).We found no increased occurrence of non-vaccine HPV types suggestive of type-replacement 1-4 years post-vaccination among HPV-16/18-vaccinated Finnish adolescents.",1,0,0,0
27197293,"Exercise-Induced Dose-Response Alterations in Adiponectin and Leptin Levels Are Dependent on Body Fat Changes in Women at Risk for Breast Cancer.BACKGROUND: Dysregulation of adipokines, such as adiponectin and leptin, is associated with a variety of chronic diseases, including cancer.Physical activity protects against breast cancer and one of the mechanisms which may underlie this association is exercise-induced changes in adipokine levels.The WISER Sister Trial was a three-armed randomized controlled trial in premenopausal women (n = 137) with an elevated risk for breast cancer.METHODS: A 5-menstrual-cycle-long dosed aerobic exercise intervention compared low-dose exercise (150 min/wk; n = 44) or high-dose exercise (300 min/wk; n = 48) with a control group asked to maintain usual activity levels (n = 45).Exercise intensity progressed to and was maintained at 70% to 80% of age predicted heart rate max.Body composition and adipokine levels were measured at baseline and follow-up.RESULTS: We observed significant linear trends for increased fitness capacity (Delta%: -2.0% control, 10.1% low dose, 13.1% high dose), decreased fat tissue-to-total tissue mass (Delta%: 0.7% control, -2.9% low dose, -3.7% high dose), increased body fat adjusted adiponectin (Delta%: -0.6% control, 0.6% low dose, 0.9% high dose), and decreased body fat adjusted leptin (Delta%: 0.7% control, -8.2% low dose, -10.2% high dose).CONCLUSIONS: In this randomized clinical trial of premenopausal women at risk for breast cancer, we demonstrate a dose-response effect of exercise on adiponectin and leptin and that dose response is dependent on changes in body fat.IMPACT: Improved adipokine levels, achieved by aerobic exercise training-induced decreases in body fat, may decrease breast cancer risk for high-risk premenopausal women.Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 25(8); 1195-200.(c)2016 AACR.",1,0,0,0
29917140,"Predictive Biomarkers for Endocrine Therapy: Retrospective Study in Tamoxifen and Exemestane Adjuvant Multinational (TEAM) Trial.Background: Aromatase inhibitors improve disease-free survival compared with tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.The Tamoxifen and Exemestane Adjuvant Multinational (TEAM) trial compared exemestane monotherapy with sequential therapy of tamoxifen followed by exemestane.The trial failed to show a statistically significant difference between treatment arms.A robust translational program was established to investigate predictive biomarkers.Methods: A tissue microarray was retrospectively constructed using a subset of patient tissues (n = 4631) from the TEAM trial (n = 9766).Immunohistochemistry was performed for biomarkers, classed into three groups: MAPK pathway, NF-kappa B pathway, and estrogen receptor (ER) phosphorylation.Expression was analyzed for association with relapse-free survival (RFS) at 2.5 and 10 years and treatment regimen using Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank analysis.All statistical tests were two-sided.Results: In univariate analysis, ER167 (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.59 to 0.85, P < .001), IKKalpha (HR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.60 to 0.92, P = .005), Raf-1338 (HR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.52 to 0.80, P < .001), and p44/42 MAPK202/204 (HR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.64 to 0.92, P = .004) were statistically significantly associated with improved RFS at 10 years in patients receiving sequential therapy.Associations were strengthened when IKKalpha, Raf-1338, and ER167 were combined into a cumulative prognostic score (HR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.52 to 0.77, P < .001).Patients with an all negative IKKalpha, Raf-1338, and ER167 score favored exemestane monotherapy (odds ratio = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.35 to 0.90).In multivariable analysis, the IKKalpha, Raf-1338, and ER167 score (P = .001) was an independent prognostic factor for RFS at 10 years in patients receiving sequential therapy.Conclusions: The IKKalpha, Raf-1338, and ER167 score is an independent predictive biomarker for lower recurrence on sequential therapy.Negative expression may further offer predictive value for exemestane monotherapy.",0,0,0,0
23017529,"Perioperative outcomes and oncologic efficacy from a pilot prospective randomized clinical trial of open versus robotic assisted radical cystectomy.PURPOSE: Robotic assisted laparoscopic radical cystectomy for bladder cancer has been reported with potential for improvement in perioperative morbidity compared to the open approach.However, most studies are retrospective with significant selection bias.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A pilot prospective randomized trial evaluating perioperative outcomes and oncologic efficacy of open vs robotic assisted laparoscopic radical cystectomy for consecutive patients was performed from July 2009 to June 2011.RESULTS: To date 47 patients have been randomized with data available on 40 patients for analysis.Each group was similar with regard to age, gender, race, body mass index and comorbidities, as well as previous surgeries, operative time, postoperative complications and final pathological stage.We observed no significant differences between oncologic outcomes of positive margins (5% each, p = 0.50) or number of lymph nodes removed for open radical cystectomy (23, IQR 15-28) vs robotic assisted laparoscopic radical cystectomy (11, IQR 8.75-21.5) groups (p = 0.135).The robotic assisted laparoscopic radical cystectomy group (400 ml, IQR 300-762.5) was noted to have decreased estimated blood loss compared to the open radical cystectomy group (800 ml, IQR 400-1,100) and trended toward a decreased rate of excessive length of stay (greater than 5 days) (65% vs 90%, p = 0.11) compared to the open radical cystectomy group.The robotic group also trended toward fewer transfusions (40% vs 50%, p = 0.26).CONCLUSIONS: Our study validates the concept of randomizing patients with bladder cancer undergoing radical cystectomy to an open or robotic approach.Our results suggest no significant differences in surrogates of oncologic efficacy.Robotic assisted laparoscopic radical cystectomy demonstrates potential benefits of decreased estimated blood loss and decreased hospital stay compared to open radical cystectomy.Our results need to be validated in a larger multicenter prospective randomized clinical trial.",1,1,0,0

The IOP at T13 in group S was approximately 5.7 mm Hg higher than in group E. The IOP at T13 was approximately 10.6 mm Hg higher than in T1 in group S, but only approximately 4.4 mm Hg higher than in group E.

23222000,"Obesity-related hormones and endometrial cancer among postmenopausal women: a nested case-control study within the B~FIT cohort.Endometrial cancer risk is strongly influenced by obesity, but the mechanisms of action remain unclear.Leptin and adiponectin, secreted from adipose tissue, reportedly play a role in such carcinogenic processes as cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and insulin regulation.In this case-control study, nested within the Breast and Bone Follow-up of the Fracture Intervention Trial (n=15,595), we assessed pre-diagnostic serum leptin, total adiponectin, and high-molecular-weight (HMW) adiponectin in relation to endometrial cancer among postmenopausal women.During the 10-year follow-up, 62 incident endometrial cases were identified and matched to 124 controls on age, geographical site, time of fasting blood draw at baseline (1992-1993), and trial participation status.Adipokines and C-peptide were measured by ELISA.Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated via conditional logistic regression, with exposures categorized in tertiles (T).Multivariable models considered C-peptide, BMI (kg/m(2)), and estradiol (E2) as potential confounders.Endometrial cancer risk was significantly associated with higher leptin levels, adjusted for E2 and C-peptide (OR(T3 vs T1)=2.96; 95% CI, 1.21-7.25; P trend <0.01).After further adjustment for BMI, the estimates were attenuated and the positive trend was no longer statistically significant (OR(T3 vs T1)=2.11; 95% CI, 0.69-6.44; P trend=0.18).No significant associations were observed with adiponectin or HMW adiponectin and endometrial cancer.Our findings with leptin suggest that the leptin-BMI axis might increase endometrial cancer risk through mechanisms other than estrogen-driven proliferation.Continued exploration of these pathways in larger prospective studies may help elucidate mechanisms underlying observed obesity-endometrial cancer associations.",0,0,0,0
30523756,"Randomized Phase II Trial of Cisplatin and Etoposide in Combination With Veliparib or Placebo for Extensive-Stage Small-Cell Lung Cancer: ECOG-ACRIN 2511 Study.PURPOSE: Veliparib, a poly (ADP ribose) polymerase inhibitor, potentiated standard chemotherapy against small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) in preclinical studies.We evaluated the combination of veliparib with cisplatin and etoposide (CE; CE+V) doublet in untreated, extensive-stage SCLC (ES-SCLC).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with ES-SCLC, stratified by sex and serum lactate dehydrogenase levels, were randomly assigned to receive four 3-week cycles of CE (75 mg/m(2) intravenously on day 1 and 100 mg/m(2) on days 1 through 3) along with veliparib (100 mg orally twice per day on days 1 through 7) or placebo (CE+P).The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS).Using an overall one-sided 0.10-level log-rank test, the study had 88% power to demonstrate a 37.5% reduction in the PFS hazard rate.RESULTS: A total of 128 eligible patients received treatment on protocol.The median age was 66 years, 52% of patients were men, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status was 0 for 29% of patients and 1 for 71%.The respective median PFS for the CE+V arm versus the CE+P arm was 6.1 versus 5.5 months (unstratified hazard ratio [HR], 0.75 [one-sided P = .06]; stratified HR, 0.63 [one-sided P = .01]), favoring CE+V. The median overall survival was 10.3 versus 8.9 months (stratified HR, 0.83; 80% CI, 0.64 to 1.07; one-sided P = .17) for the CE+V and CE+P arms, respectively.The overall response rate was 71.9% versus 65.6% (two-sided P = .57) for CE+V and CE+P, respectively.There was a significant treatment-by-strata interaction in PFS: Male patients with high lactate dehydrogenase levels derived significant benefit (PFS HR, 0.34; 80% CI, 0.22 to 0.51) but there was no evidence of benefit among patients in other strata (PFS HR, 0.81; 80% CI, 0.60 to 1.09).The following grade >/= 3 hematology toxicities were more frequent in the CE+V arm than the CE+P arm: CD4 lymphopenia (8% v 0%; P = .06) and neutropenia (49% v 32%; P = .08), but treatment delivery was comparable.CONCLUSION: The addition of veliparib to frontline chemotherapy showed signal of efficacy in patients with ES-SCLC and the study met its prespecified end point.",1,1,1,0
