30902613,"Updated Efficacy and Safety Data and Impact of the EML4-ALK Fusion Variant on the Efficacy of Alectinib in Untreated ALK-Positive Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer in the Global Phase III ALEX Study.INTRODUCTION: At the prior data cutoff (February 9, 2017) the ALEX trial showed superior investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) for alectinib versus crizotinib in untreated, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive, advanced NSCLC (hazard ratio = 0.47, 95% confidence interval: 0.34-0.65, p < 0.001).The median PFS in the alectinib arm was not reached versus 11.1 months with crizotinib.Retrospective analyses suggest that the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 gene-ALK variant (EML4-ALK) may influence ALK-inhibitor treatment benefit.We present updated analyses, including exploratory subgroup analysis by EML4-ALK variant, after an additional 10 months' follow-up (cutoff December 1, 2017).METHODS: Patients were randomized to receive twice-daily alectinib, 600 mg, or crizotinib, 250 mg, until disease progression, toxicity, death, or withdrawal.PFS was determined by the investigators.Baseline plasma and tissue biomarker samples were analyzed by using hybrid-capture, next-generation sequencing to determine EML4-ALK variant.RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were balanced.Investigator-assessed PFS was prolonged with alectinib (stratified hazard ratio = 0.43, 95% confidence interval: 0.32-0.58).The median PFS times were 34.8 months with alectinib and 10.9 months with crizotinib.EML4-ALK fusions were detectable in 129 patient plasma samples and 124 tissue samples; variants 1, 2, and 3/ab did not affect PFS, objective response rate, or duration of response.Investigator-assessed PFS was longer for alectinib than for crizotinib across EML4-ALK variants 1, 2, and 3a/b in plasma and tissue.Despite longer treatment duration (27.0 months in the case of alectinib versus 10.8 months in the case of crizotinib), the safety of alectinib compared favorably with that of crizotinib.CONCLUSION: Alectinib continues to demonstrate superior investigator-assessed PFS versus crizotinib in untreated ALK-positive NSCLC, irrespective of EML4-ALK variant.",1,1,1,1

26364885,"The influence of gastric filling instructions on dose delivery in patients with oesophageal cancer: A prospective study.PURPOSE: To evaluate whether adaptive radiotherapy for unaccounted stomach changes in patients with adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) is necessary and whether dose differences could be prevented by giving patients food and fluid instructions before treatment simulation and radiotherapy.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty patients were randomly assigned into two groups: patients with and without instructions about restricting food and fluid intake prior to radiotherapy simulation and treatment.Redelineation and offline recalculation of dose distributions based on cone-beam computed tomography (n=100) were performed.Dose-volume parameters were analysed for the clinical target volume extending into the stomach.RESULTS: Four patients who did not receive instructions had a geometric miss (0.7-12 cm(3)) in only one fraction.With instructions, 3 out of 10 patients had a geometric miss (0.1-1.9 cm(3)) in one (n=2) or two (n=1) fractions.The V95% was reduced by more than 5% for one patient, but this underdosage was in an in-air region without further clinical importance.CONCLUSIONS: Giving patients food and fluid instructions for the treatment of GEJ cancer offers no clinical benefit.Using a planning target volume margin of 1cm implies that there is no need for adaptive radiotherapy for GEJ tumours.",0,0,0,0

31507061,"Randomised trial of population-based BRCA testing in Ashkenazi Jews: long-term outcomes.OBJECTIVE: Unselected population-based BRCA testing provides the opportunity to apply genomics on a population-scale to maximise primary prevention for breast-and-ovarian cancer.We compare long-term outcomes of population-based and family-history (FH)/clinical-criteria-based BRCA testing on psychological health and quality of life.DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial (RCT) (ISRCTN73338115) GCaPPS, with two-arms: (i) population-screening (PS); (ii) FH/clinical-criteria-based testing.SETTING: North London Ashkenazi-Jewish (AJ) population.POPULATION/SAMPLE: AJ women/men.METHODS: Population-based RCT (1:1).Participants were recruited through self-referral, following pre-test genetic counselling from the North London AJ population.INCLUSION CRITERIA: AJ women/men >18 years old; exclusion-criteria: prior BRCA testing or first-degree relatives of BRCA-carriers.INTERVENTIONS: Genetic testing for three Jewish BRCA founder-mutations: 185delAG (c.68_69delAG), 5382insC (c.5266dupC) and 6174delT (c.5946delT), for (i) all participants in PS arm; (ii) those fulfilling FH/clinical criteria in FH arm.Linear mixed models and appropriate contrast tests were used to analyse the impact of BRCA testing on psychological and quality-of-life outcomes over 3 years.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Validated questionnaires (HADS/MICRA/HAI/SF12) used to analyse psychological wellbeing/quality-of-life outcomes at baseline/1-year/2-year/3-year follow up.RESULTS: In all, 1034 individuals (691 women, 343 men) were randomised to PS (n = 530) or FH (n = 504) arms.There was a statistically significant decrease in anxiety (P = 0.046) and total anxiety-&-depression scores (P = 0.0.012) in the PS arm compared with the FH arm over 3 years.No significant difference was observed between the FH and PS arms for depression, health-anxiety, distress, uncertainty, quality-of-life or experience scores associated with BRCA testing.Contrast tests showed a decrease in anxiety (P = 0.018), health-anxiety (P < 0.0005) and quality-of-life (P = 0.004) scores in both PS and FH groups over time.Eighteen of 30 (60%) BRCA carriers identified did not fulfil clinical criteria for BRCA testing.Total BRCA prevalence was 2.9% (95% CI 1.97-4.12%), BRCA1 prevalence was 1.55% (95% CI 0.89-2.5%) and BRCA2 prevalence was 1.35% (95% CI 0.74-2.26%).CONCLUSION: Population-based AJ BRCA testing does not adversely affect long-term psychological wellbeing or quality-of-life, decreases anxiety and could identify up to 150% additional BRCA carriers.TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: Population BRCA testing in Ashkenazi Jews reduces anxiety and does not adversely affect psychological health or quality of life.",0,0,0,0
30802304,"Randomized clinical trial of selective decontamination of the digestive tract in elective colorectal cancer surgery (SELECT trial).BACKGROUND: Infectious complications and anastomotic leakage affect approximately 30 per cent of patients after colorectal cancer surgery.The aim of this multicentre randomized trial was to investigate whether selective decontamination of the digestive tract (SDD) reduces these complications of elective colorectal cancer surgery.METHODS: The effectiveness of SDD was evaluated in a multicentre, open-label RCT in six centres in the Netherlands.Patients with colorectal cancer scheduled for elective curative surgery with a primary anastomosis were eligible.Oral colistin, tobramycin and amphotericin B were administered to patients in the SDD group to decontaminate the digestive tract.Both treatment and control group received intravenous cefazolin and metronidazole for perioperative prophylaxis.Mechanical bowel preparation was given for left-sided colectomies, sigmoid and anterior resections.Anastomotic leakage was the primary outcome; infectious complications and mortality were secondary outcomes.RESULTS: The outcomes for 228 patients randomized to the SDD group and 227 randomized to the control group were analysed.The trial was stopped after interim analysis demonstrated that superiority was no longer attainable.Effective SDD was confirmed by interspace DNA profiling analysis of rectal swabs.Anastomotic leakage was observed in 14 patients (6.1 per cent) in the SDD group and in 22 patients (9.7 per cent) in the control group (odds ratio (OR) 0.61, 95 per cent c.i.0.30 to 1.22).Fewer patients in the SDD group had one or more infectious complications than patients in the control group (14.9 versus 26.9 per cent respectively; OR 0.48, 0.30 to 0.76).Multivariable analysis indicated that SDD reduced the rate of infectious complications (OR 0.47, 0.29 to 0.76).CONCLUSION: SDD reduces infectious complications after colorectal cancer resection but did not significantly reduce anastomotic leakage in this trial.Registration number: NCT01740947 ( https://www.clinicaltrials.gov).",0,0,0,0
29070044,"Neoadjuvant everolimus plus letrozole versus fluorouracil, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide for ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer: study protocol for a randomized pilot trial.BACKGROUND: The response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) varies by estrogen receptor (ER) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) statuses, with responses being lower in ER-positive, HER2-negative tumors as compared with ER-negative, HER2-positive or triple-negative tumors.Neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (NET) is an attractive alternative to NAC for ER-positive, HER2-negative cancer.However, a prior trial comparing NET with standard NAC in ER-positive tumor showed that the difference of response was not significant.Studies demonstrated that the mTOR inhibitor everolimus could sensitize breast tumors to endocrine therapy.A pilot open-label, randomized trial has been designed to evaluate the feasibility, efficacy and tolerability of neoadjuvant everolimus plus letrozole versus NAC in treating postmenopausal women with ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer.METHODS: Forty postmenopausal women with non-metastatic ER-positive, HER2-negative invasive breast cancer with a primary tumor > 2 cm or positive axillary lymph node(s) proved by biopsy will be randomly (1:1) enrolled from Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital to receive neoadjuvant everolimus plus letrozole for 18 weeks or fluorouracil, epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide (FEC) for six cycles before surgery.Primary outcome is the feasibility of the trial.Secondary outcome measures include ultrasound response rate, pathological complete response rate, breast-conserving surgery rate, toxicities, and changes in the percentages of peripheral blood CD4(+) T cells, CD8(+) T cells, T helper cells, regulatory T cells, and NK cells.DISCUSSION: This is the first study to determine the feasibility, efficacy and tolerability of head-to-head neoadjuvant everolimus plus letrozole versus neoadjuvant FEC in treating postmenopausal women with ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer.The trial will provide evidence to assess the feasibility of a future multicenter, randomized controlled trial, and will provide valuable clinical data of the immunoregulatory effect of everolimus in breast cancer.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov registry, ID: NCT02742051 .Registered on 7 April 2016.",1,1,1,1
28468736,"Prevention of non-melanoma skin cancers with nicotinamide in transplant recipients: a case-control study.Nicotinamide is the precursor of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), an essential cofactor for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production.It has recently been reported to be effective in reducing the rates of new non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs) and actinic keratosis (AKs).We studied the efficacy of oral nicotinamide as treatment for AKs in transplant recipients.We recruited 38 transplant (eight liver and 30 kidney) patients with single or multiple AKs.Nineteen patients were randomly assigned to Group 1 and took nicotinamide 500 mg/daily (cases); the other 19 patients were randomly assigned to Group 2 without nicotinamide (controls).At baseline, AKs were identified, measured, and photographed for follow-up.Five patients underwent an AK biopsy for histopathology.Statistical analyses were performed using the Student t test.At baseline, no statistically significant differences were observed regarding AK size between the two groups.After six months, among the cases, AKs had significantly decreased in size in 18/19 patients (88%).Among these 18 patients, seven patients (42%) had shown complete clinical regression and no patient developed new AKs.Conversely, among the controls, 91% showed an increase in AK size and/or developed new AKs.Seven pre-existing AKs progressed to squamous-cell carcinoma.Nicotinamide appears to be effective in preventing and treating AKs, although the mechanisms are still unclear.Further studies with a larger sample of organ transplant recipients and a longer follow-up period are needed to further support our conclusions.",0,0,0,0
31699709,"Combined Vaccination with NY-ESO-1 Protein, Poly-ICLC, and Montanide Improves Humoral and Cellular Immune Responses in Patients with High-Risk Melanoma.Given its ability to induce both humoral and cellular immune responses, NY-ESO-1 has been considered a suitable antigen for a cancer vaccine.Despite promising results from early-phase clinical studies in patients with melanoma, NY-ESO-1 vaccine immunotherapy has not been widely investigated in larger trials; consequently, many questions remain as to the optimal vaccine formulation, predictive biomarkers, and sequencing and timing of vaccines in melanoma treatment.We conducted an adjuvant phase I/II clinical trial in high-risk resected melanoma to optimize the delivery of poly-ICLC, a TLR-3/MDA-5 agonist, as a component of vaccine formulation.A phase I dose-escalation part was undertaken to identify the MTD of poly-ICLC administered in combination with NY-ESO-1 and montanide.This was followed by a randomized phase II part investigating the MTD of poly-ICLC with NY-ESO-1 with or without montanide.The vaccine regimens were generally well tolerated, with no treatment-related grade 3/4 adverse events.Both regimens induced integrated NY-ESO-1-specific CD4(+) T-cell and humoral responses.CD8(+) T-cell responses were mainly detected in patients receiving montanide.T-cell avidity toward NY-ESO-1 peptides was higher in patients vaccinated with montanide.In conclusion, NY-ESO-1 protein in combination with poly-ICLC is safe, well tolerated, and capable of inducing integrated antibody and CD4(+) T-cell responses in most patients.Combination with montanide enhances antigen-specific T-cell avidity and CD8(+) T-cell cross-priming in a fraction of patients, indicating that montanide contributes to the induction of specific CD8(+) T-cell responses to NY-ESO-1.",0,0,0,0
28463161,"Feasibility of Patient Reporting of Symptomatic Adverse Events via the Patient-Reported Outcomes Version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE) in a Chemoradiotherapy Cooperative Group Multicenter Clinical Trial.PURPOSE: To assess the feasibility of measuring symptomatic adverse events (AEs) in a multicenter clinical trial using the National Cancer Institute's Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE).METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients enrolled in NRG Oncology's RTOG 1012 (Prophylactic Manuka Honey for Reduction of Chemoradiation Induced Esophagitis-Related Pain during Treatment of Lung Cancer) were asked to self-report 53 PRO-CTCAE items representing 30 symptomatic AEs at 6 time points (baseline; weekly x4 during treatment; 12 weeks after treatment).Reporting was conducted via wireless tablet computers in clinic waiting areas.Compliance was defined as the proportion of visits when an expected PRO-CTCAE assessment was completed.RESULTS: Among 226 study sites participating in RTOG 1012, 100% completed 35-minute PRO-CTCAE training for clinical research associates (CRAs); 80 sites enrolled patients, of which 34 (43%) required tablet computers to be provided.All 152 patients in RTOG 1012 agreed to self-report using the PRO-CTCAE (median age 66 years; 47% female; 84% white).Median time for CRAs to learn the system was 60 minutes (range, 30-240 minutes), and median time for CRAs to teach a patient to self-report was 10 minutes (range, 2-60 minutes).Compliance was high, particularly during active treatment, when patients self-reported at 86% of expected time points, although compliance was lower after treatment (72%).Common reasons for noncompliance were institutional errors, such as forgetting to provide computers to participants; patients missing clinic visits; Internet connectivity; and patients feeling ""too sick."" CONCLUSIONS: Most patients enrolled in a multicenter chemoradiotherapy trial were willing and able to self-report symptomatic AEs at visits using tablet computers.Minimal effort was required by local site staff to support this system.The observed causes of missing data may be obviated by allowing patients to self-report electronically between visits, and by using central compliance monitoring.These approaches are being incorporated into ongoing studies.",0,0,0,0
27498129,"Toxicity of dual HER2-blockade with pertuzumab added to anthracycline versus non-anthracycline containing chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment in HER2-positive breast cancer: The TRAIN-2 study.BACKGROUND: The addition of pertuzumab to neoadjuvant trastuzumab-based chemotherapy improves pathologic complete response rates in HER2-positive breast cancer.However, increased toxicity has been reported with the addition of pertuzumab, and this may differ between various chemotherapy backbone regimens.We evaluated toxicities of pertuzumab when added to either FEC-T (5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide, trastuzumab) or weekly paclitaxel, trastuzumab, carboplatin (PTC).METHODS: The TRAIN-2 study is a neoadjuvant randomized controlled trial in stage II and III HER2-positive breast cancer (NCT01996267).Patients are randomly assigned to receive either three cycles of FEC-T plus pertuzumab or three cycles of PTC plus pertuzumab, followed by six cycles of PTC plus pertuzumab in both arms.Toxicities are described per treatment arm according to the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03.RESULTS: This analysis includes 110 patients balanced over both treatment arms.Neutropenia was the most common hematologic toxicity, with grade 3-4 occurring in 53% in the FEC-T-arm and in 51% in the PTC-arm.Febrile neutropenia occurred in 9% in the FEC-T arm and did not occur in the PTC-arm.Secondary G-CSF prophylaxis was used in 35-40% of patients.Asymptomatic ejection fraction decrease grade 2 was observed in 24% in the FEC-T-arm and 11% in the PTC-arm.The most common grade 3-4 non-hematologic toxicity was diarrhea (5% in the FEC-T-arm and 18% in the PTC-arm).CONCLUSIONS: Pertuzumab in combination with FEC-T mostly causes neutropenia, and when added to PTC mostly causes diarrhea.Significant cardiac toxicity is rare with both regimens, and toxicity is overall well manageable.",1,1,1,1
32234755,"A Randomized, Open-label, Presurgical, Window-of-Opportunity Study Comparing the Pharmacodynamic Effects of the Novel Oral SERD AZD9496 with Fulvestrant in Patients with Newly Diagnosed ER(+) HER2(-) Primary Breast Cancer.PURPOSE: Fulvestrant, the first-in-class selective estrogen receptor (ER) degrader (SERD), is clinically effective in patients with ER(+) breast cancer, but it has administration and pharmacokinetic limitations.Pharmacodynamic data suggest complete ER degradation is not achieved at fulvestrant's clinically feasible dose.This presurgical study (NCT03236974) compared the pharmacodynamic effects of fulvestrant with AZD9496, a novel, orally bioavailable, nonsteroidal, potent SERD, in treatment-naive patients with ER(+) HER2(-) primary breast cancer awaiting curative intent surgery.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive AZD9496 250 mg twice daily from day 1 for 5-14 days, or fulvestrant 500 mg on day 1.On-treatment imaging-guided core tumor biopsies were taken between day 5 and 14 and compared with pretreatment diagnostic biopsies.The primary objective was to compare the effects of AZD9496 and fulvestrant on ER expression.Secondary objectives included changes in progesterone receptor (PR) and Ki-67 pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships and safety.RESULTS: Forty-six women received treatment (AZD9496 n = 22; fulvestrant n = 24); 35 paired biopsies were evaluable (AZD9496 n = 15; fulvestrant n = 20).The least square mean estimate for ER H-score reduction was 24% after AZD9496 versus 36% after fulvestrant treatment (P = 0.86).AZD9496 also reduced PR H-scores (-33.3%) and Ki-67 levels (-39.9%) from baseline, but was also not superior to fulvestrant (PR: -68.7%, P = 0.97; Ki-67: -75.4%, P = 0.98).No new safety findings were identified.CONCLUSIONS: This was the first presurgical study to demonstrate that an oral SERD affects its key biological targets.However, AZD9496 was not superior to fulvestrant at the dose tested.",1,1,1,1
29852043,"Effect of Adjuvant Trastuzumab for a Duration of 9 Weeks vs 1 Year With Concomitant Chemotherapy for Early Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2-Positive Breast Cancer: The SOLD Randomized Clinical Trial.Importance: Trastuzumab plus chemotherapy is the standard adjuvant treatment for patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive early breast cancer.While the standard duration of trastuzumab treatment is 12 months, the benefits and harms of trastuzumab continued beyond the chemotherapy are unclear.Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of adjuvant trastuzumab continued beyond chemotherapy in women treated with up-front chemotherapy containing a taxane and trastuzumab.Design, Setting, and Participants: Open-label, randomized (1:1) clinical trial including women with HER2-positive breast cancer.Chemotherapy was identical in the 2 groups, consisting of 3 cycles of 3-weekly docetaxel (either 80 or 100 mg/m2) plus trastuzumab for 9 weeks, followed by 3 cycles of fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide.Thereafter, no trastuzumab was administered in the 9-week group, whereas controls received trastuzumab to complete 1 year of administration.Disease-free survival (DFS) was compared between the groups using a Cox model and the noninferiority approach.The estimated sample size was 2168 patients (1-sided testing, with a relative noninferiority margin of 1.3).From January 3, 2008, to December 16, 2014, 2176 patients were accrued from 7 countries.Intervention: Docetaxel plus trastuzumab for 9 weeks, followed by 3 cycles of fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide in both groups.Controls continued trastuzumab to 1 year.Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary objective was DFS; secondary objectives included distant disease-free survival, overall survival, cardiac DFS, and safety.Results: In the 2174 women analyzed, median age was 56 (interquartile range [IQR], 48-64) years.The median follow-up was 5.2 (IQR, 3.8-6.7) years.Noninferiority of the 9-week treatment could not be demonstrated for DFS (hazard ratio, 1.39; 2-sided 90% CI, 1.12-1.72).Distant disease-free survival and overall survival did not differ substantially between the groups.Thirty-six (3%) and 21 (2%) patients in the 1-year and the 9-week groups, respectively, had cardiac failure; the left ventricle ejection fraction was better maintained in the 9-week group.An interaction was detected between the docetaxel dose and DFS; patients in the 9-week group treated with 80 mg/m2 had inferior and those treated with 100 mg/m2 had similar DFS as patients in the 1-year group.Conclusions and Relevance: Nine weeks of trastuzumab was not noninferior to 1 year of trastuzumab when given with similar chemotherapy.Cardiac safety was better in the 9-week group.The docetaxel dosing with trastuzumab requires further study.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00593697.",1,1,1,1
28352657,"Randomized, placebo-controlled window trial of EGFR, Src, or combined blockade in head and neck cancer.BACKGROUND.EGFR and Src family kinases are upregulated in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).EGFR interacts with Src to activate STAT3 signaling, and dual EGFR-Src targeting is synergistic in HNSCC preclinical models.pSrc overexpression predicted resistance to the EGFR inhibitor, erlotinib, in a prior window trial.We conducted a 4-arm window trial to identify biomarkers associated with response to EGFR and/or Src inhibition.METHODS.Patients with operable stage II-IVa HNSCC were randomized to 7-21 days of neoadjuvant erlotinib, the Src inhibitor dasatinib, the combination of both, or placebo.Paired tumor specimens were collected before and after treatment.Pharmacodynamic expression of EGFR and Src pathway components was evaluated by IHC of tissue microarrays and reverse-phase protein array of tissue lysates.Candidate biomarkers were assessed for correlation with change in tumor size.RESULTS.From April 2009 to December 2012, 58 patients were randomized and 55 were treated.There was a significant decrease in tumor size in both erlotinib arms (P = 0.0014); however, no effect was seen with dasatinib alone (P = 0.24).High baseline pMAPK expression was associated with response to erlotinib (P = 0.03).High baseline pSTAT3 was associated with resistance to dasatinib (P = 0.099).CONCLUSIONS.Brief exposure to erlotinib significantly decreased tumor size in operable HNSCC, with no additive effect from dasatinib.Baseline pMAPK expression warrants further study as a response biomarker for anti-EGFR therapy.Basal expression of pSTAT3 may be independent of Src, explain therapeutic resistance, and preclude development of dasatinib in biomarker-unselected cohorts.TRIAL REGISTRATION.NCT00779389.FUNDING.National Cancer Institute, American Cancer Society, Pennsylvania Department of Health, V Foundation for Cancer Research, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Astellas Pharma.",1,1,1,1

30807234,"Cyclin E1 Expression and Palbociclib Efficacy in Previously Treated Hormone Receptor-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer.PURPOSE: A large-panel gene expression analysis was conducted to identify biomarkers associated with the effectiveness of adding palbociclib to fulvestrant.METHODS: The PALOMA-3 ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01942135) trial randomly assigned 521 endocrine-pretreated patients with metastatic breast cancer to receive palbociclib plus fulvestrant or placebo plus fulvestrant.Primary analysis was first conducted on 10 genes on the basis of pathway biology and evidence from previous studies followed by a systematic panel-wide search among 2,534 cancer-related genes.The association of gene expression with the effect of palbociclib on progression-free survival (PFS) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, with gene expression as a continuous variable or dichotomized by median.An independent breast cancer cohort from the Preoperative Palbociclib (POP) Clinical Trial ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02008734) was used for validation, in 61 patients with primary breast cancer treated with 2 weeks of palbociclib.RESULTS: In the PALOMA-3 trial, 302 patients had tumor tissue analyzed (palbociclib arm, 194 patients; placebo arm, 108 patients).Palbociclib efficacy was lower in patients with high versus low cyclin E1 (CCNE1) mRNA expression (median PFS: palbociclib arm, 7.6 v 14.1 months; placebo arm, 4.0 v 4.8 months, respectively; interaction P unadjusted = .00238; false discovery rate-adjusted P = .0238).CCNE1 mRNA was more predictive in metastatic than in archival primary biopsy tissue samples.No significant interaction was found between treatment and expression levels of CDK4, CDK6, cyclin D1, and RB1.Palbociclib was efficacious in both luminal A and luminal B tumors.High CCNE1 mRNA expression was associated with poor antiproliferative activity of palbociclib in the POP trial (P = .005).CONCLUSION: Addition of palbociclib to fulvestrant demonstrated efficacy in all biomarker groups, although high CCNE1 mRNA expression was associated with relative resistance to palbociclib.",1,1,1,1
26659916,"Impact of renal impairment on outcomes with lenalidomide and dexamethasone treatment in the FIRST trial, a randomized, open-label phase 3 trial in transplant-ineligible patients with multiple myeloma.Renal impairment is associated with poor prognosis in myeloma.This analysis of the pivotal phase 3 FIRST trial examined the impact of renally adapted dosing of lenalidomide and dexamethasone on outcomes of patients with different degrees of renal impairment.Transplant-ineligible patients not requiring dialysis were randomized 1:1:1 to receive continuous lenalidomide and dexamethasone until disease progression (n=535) or for 18 cycles (72 weeks; n=541), or melphalan, prednisone, and thalidomide for 12 cycles (72 weeks; n=547).Follow-up is ongoing.Patients were grouped by baseline creatinine clearance into no (>/= 80 mL/min [n=389]), mild (>/= 50 to < 80 mL/min [n=715]), moderate (>/= 30 to < 50 mL/min [n=372]), and severe impairment (< 30 mL/min [n=147]) subgroups.Continuous lenalidomide and dexamethasone therapy reduced the risk of progression or death in no, mild, and moderate renal impairment subgroups vs. melphalan, prednisone, and thalidomide therapy (HR = 0.67, 0.70, and 0.65, respectively).Overall survival benefits were observed with continuous lenalidomide and dexamethasone treatment vs. melphalan, prednisone, and thalidomide treatment in no or mild renal impairment subgroups.Renal function improved from baseline in 52.6% of lenalidomide and dexamethasone-treated patients.The safety profile of continuous lenalidomide and dexamethasone was consistent across renal subgroups, except for grade 3/4 anemia and rash, which increased with increasing severity of renal impairment.Continuous lenalidomide and dexamethasone treatment, with renally adapted lenalidomide dosing, was effective for most transplant-ineligible patients with myeloma and renal impairment.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00689936); EudraCT (2007-004823-39).Funding: Intergroupe Francophone du Myelome and the Celgene Corporation.",0,0,0,0
32070401,"TBCRC 002: a phase II, randomized, open-label trial of preoperative letrozole with or without bevacizumab in postmenopausal women with newly diagnosed stage 2/3 hormone receptor-positive and HER2-negative breast cancer.BACKGROUND: In preclinical studies, the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer is associated with estrogen-independent tumor growth and resistance to endocrine therapies.This study investigated whether the addition of bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody against VEGF, to letrozole enhanced the antitumor activity of the letrozole in the preoperative setting.METHODS: Postmenopausal women with newly diagnosed stage 2 or 3 estrogen and/or progesterone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer were randomly assigned (2:1) between letrozole 2.5 mg PO daily plus bevacizumab 15 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks (Let/Bev) and letrozole 2.5 mg PO daily (Let) for 24 weeks prior to definitive surgery.Primary objective was within-arm pathologic complete remission (pCR) rate.Secondary objectives were safety, objective response, and downstaging rate.RESULTS: Seventy-five patients were randomized (Let/Bev n = 50, Let n = 25).Of the 45 patients evaluable for pathological response in the Let/Bev arm, 5 (11%; 95% CI, 3.7-24.1%) achieved pCR and 4 (9%; 95% CI, 2.5-21.2%) had microscopic residual disease; no pCRs or microscopic residual disease was seen in the Let arm (0%; 95% CI, 0-14.2%).The rates of downstaging were 44.4% (95% CI, 29.6-60.0%) and 37.5% (95% CI, 18.8-59.4%) in the Let/Bev and Let arms, respectively.Adverse events typically associated with letrozole (hot flashes, arthralgias, fatigue, myalgias) occurred in similar frequencies in the two arms.Hypertension, headache, and proteinuria were seen exclusively in the Let/Bev arm.The rates of grade 3 and 4 adverse events and discontinuation due to adverse events were 18% vs 8% and 16% vs none in the Let/Bev and Let arms, respectively.A small RNA-based classifier predictive of response to preoperative Let/Bev was developed and confirmed on an independent cohort.CONCLUSION: In the preoperative setting, the addition of bevacizumab to letrozole was associated with a pCR rate of 11%; no pCR was seen with letrozole alone.There was additive toxicity with the incorporation of bevacizumab.Responses to Let/Bev can be predicted from the levels of 5 small RNAs in a pretreatment biopsy.TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT00161291), first posted on September 12, 2005, and is completed.",1,1,1,1
27112319,"Protocol of a randomized controlled trial of the fear of recurrence therapy (FORT) intervention for women with breast or gynecological cancer.BACKGROUND: Clinically significant levels of fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) affect up to 49% of cancer survivors and are more prevalent among women.FCR is associated with psychological distress, lower quality of life, and increased use of medical resources.Despite its prevalence, FCR is poorly addressed in clinical care.To address this problem, we first developed, and pilot tested a 6-week, 2 h, Cognitive-existential group intervention therapy that targeted FCR in survivors of breast or gynecological cancer.Following the positive outcome of the pilot, we are now testing this approach in a randomized clinical trial (RCT).Goal and hypotheses: This multicenter, prospective RCT aims to test the efficacy of the intervention.The study hypotheses are that, compared to a control group, cancer survivors participating in the intervention (1) will have less FCR, (2) will show more favorable outcomes on the following measures: cancer-specific distress, quality of life, illness uncertainty, intolerance of uncertainty, perceived risk of cancer recurrence, and coping skills.We further postulate that the between-group differences will persist three and 6 months post-intervention.METHODS: Sixteen groups of seven to nine women are being allocated to the intervention or the control group.The control group receives a 6-week, 2 h, structurally equivalent support group.We are recruiting 144 cancer survivors from four hospital sites in three Canadian cities.The sample size was based on the moderate pre/post-test changes found in our pilot study and adjusted to the drop-out rates.MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome, FCR, is measured by the Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory.Secondary outcomes measured include cancer-specific distress, perceived risk of cancer recurrence, illness uncertainty, intolerance of uncertainty, coping, and quality of life.We use reliable and recognized valid scales.Participants are to complete the questionnaire package at four times: before the first group session (baseline), immediately after the sixth session, and 3 and 6 months post-intervention.ANALYSIS: In the descriptive analysis, comparison of group equivalent baseline variables, identification of confounding/intermediate variables and univariate analysis are planned.Each participant's trajectory is calculated using Generalized Estimating Equation models to determine the time and group effects, after considering the correlation structures of the groups.An intent-to-treat analysis approach may be adopted.DISCUSSION: Our Fear of Recurrence Therapy (FORT) intervention has direct implications for clinical service development to improve the quality of life for patients with breast (BC) and gynecological cancer (GC).Based on our pilot data, we are confident that the FORT intervention can guide the development of effective psychosocial cancer survivorship interventions to reduce FCR and improve psychological functioning among women with BC or GC.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Dr. Christine Maheu registered the trial with ISRCTN registry (Registration number: ISRCTN83539618, date assigned 03/09/2014).",0,0,0,0

26481741,"Does Early Postsurgical Temozolomide Plus Concomitant Radiochemotherapy Regimen Have Any Benefit in Newly-diagnosed Glioblastoma Patients? A Multi-center, Randomized, Parallel, Open-label, Phase II Clinical Trial.BACKGROUND: The radiochemotherapy regimen concomitantly employing temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy and radiotherapy (RT) 4 weeks after surgery, followed by 6 cycles of TMZ is a common treatment for glioblastoma (GBM).However, its median overall survival (OS) is only 14.6 months.This study was to explore the effectiveness and safety of early TMZ chemotherapy between surgery and chemoradiotherapy plus the standard concomitant radiochemotherapy regimen.METHODS: A randomized, parallel group, open-label study of 99 newly diagnosed GBM patients was conducted at 10 independent Chinese neurosurgical departments from June 2008 to June 2012.Patients were treated with concomitant radiochemotherapy regimen plus early postsurgical temozolomide (early TMZ group) or standard concomitant radiochemotherapy regimen (control group).Overall response was assessed based on objective tumor assessments, administration of corticosteroid and neurological status test.Hematological, biochemical, laboratory, adverse event (AE), and neurological condition were measured for 24 months of follow-up.The primary efficacy endpoint of this study was overall survival (OS).The secondary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS).RESULTS: The median OS time in the early TMZ group was 17.6 months, compared with 13.2 months in the control group (log-rank test P = 0.021).In addition, the OS rate in the early TMZ group was higher at 6, 12, and 18 months than in the control group, respectively (P < 0.05).The median PFS time was 8.7 months in the early TMZ group and 10.4 months in the control group (log-rank test P = 0.695).AEs occurred in 29 (55.8%) and 31(73.8%) patients respectively in early and control groups, including nausea (15.4% vs. 33.3%), vomiting (7.7% vs. 28.6%), fever (7.7% vs. 11.9%), and headache (3.8% vs. 23.8%).Only 30.8% and 33.3% were drug-related, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Addition of TMZ chemotherapy in the early break of the standard concomitant radiochemotherapy regimen was well tolerated and significantly improved the OS of the GBM patients, compared with standard concomitant radiochemotherapy regimen.However, a larger randomized trial is warranted to verify these results.",1,1,1,0
31382986,"Whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) after local treatment of brain metastases in melanoma patients: Statistical Analysis Plan.BACKGROUND: The WBRTMel trial is a multinational, open-label, phase III randomised controlled trial comparing whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) to observation following local treatment of one to three melanoma brain metastases with surgery and/or stereotactic irradiation.The primary trial endpoint was to determine the effect of adding WBRT to local treatment on distant intracranial control, and the secondary endpoints were neurocognitive function, quality of life (QoL), performance status, overall survival, death from intracranial causes, death from melanoma and cost-effectiveness.OBJECTIVE: The objective of this update is to outline and publish the pre-determined statistical analysis plan (SAP) before the database lock and the start of analysis.METHODS: The SAP describes basic analysis principles, methods for dealing with a range of commonly encountered data analysis issues and the specific statistical procedures for analysing efficacy and safety outcomes.The SAP was approved after closure of recruitment and before completion of patient follow-up.It outlines the planned primary analyses and a range of subgroup and sensitivity analyses regarding the clinical and QoL outcomes.Health economic outcomes are not included in this plan but will be analysed separately.The SAP will be adhered to for the final data analysis of this trial to avoid analysis bias arising from knowledge of the data.RESULTS: The resulting SAP is consistent with best practice and will allow open and transparent reporting.CONCLUSION: We have developed a SAP for the WBRTMel trial which will be followed to ensure high-quality standards of internal validity to minimise analysis bias.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ANZ Clinical Trials Registry, ACTRN12607000512426 .Registered on 9 October 2007.ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01503827 .Registered on 4 January 2012.Trial group reference numbers ANZMTG 01.07, TROG 08.05.",0,0,0,0
28701030,"Crizotinib versus Chemotherapy in Asian Patients with ALK-Positive Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.PURPOSE: Crizotinib has demonstrated superior progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rates (ORRs) versus chemotherapy in previously treated and untreated patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).We report the safety and efficacy of crizotinib in Asian subpopulations of two global phase III trials.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This analysis evaluated previously treated and untreated patients in two randomized, openlabel phase III trials of crizotinib versus chemotherapy in ALK-positive advanced NSCLC in second-line (PROFILE 1007) and first-line settings (PROFILE 1014).Efficacy and safety were analyzed by race in the intention-to-treat and ""as-treated"" populations for efficacy and safety endpoints, respectively.RESULTS: In previously treated (n=157) and untreated (n=157) Asian patients, PFS was statistically significantly longer with crizotinib versus chemotherapy (hazard ratio for PFS, 0.526; 95% confidence interval, 0.363 to 0.762; p &lt; 0.001 and hazard ratio, 0.442; 95% confidence interval, 0.302 to 0.648; p &lt; 0.001, respectively).Similar antitumor activity was seen in the non-Asian and overall populations.ORRs were statistically significantly higher with crizotinib versus chemotherapy in both Asian and non-Asian previously treated and untreated patients (p &lt; 0.05).The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (any grade)with crizotinib were vision disorder, diarrhea, and nausea, which were observed at a comparable incidence across Asian and non-Asian populations, irrespective of previous treatment status.Most adverse events were mild to moderate in severity.CONCLUSION: These data, currently the only analysis showing Asian and non-Asian populations in the same study, support the efficacy and safety of crizotinib in Asian patients with previously treated or untreated ALK-positive advanced NSCLC.",1,1,1,1
22565002,"Randomized phase II trial of everolimus in combination with tamoxifen in patients with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative metastatic breast cancer with prior exposure to aromatase inhibitors: a GINECO study.PURPOSE: Cross-talk between signal transduction pathways likely contributes to hormone resistance in metastatic breast cancer (mBC).Everolimus, an oral inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin, has restored sensitivity in endocrine-resistance models and shown anticancer activity in early-phase mBC clinical trials.This analysis evaluated efficacy and safety of everolimus in combination with tamoxifen in patients with mBC resistant to aromatase inhibitors (AIs).PATIENTS AND METHODS: This open-label, phase II study randomly assigned postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative, AI-resistant mBC to tamoxifen 20 mg/d plus everolimus 10 mg/d (n = 54) or tamoxifen 20 mg/d alone (n = 57).Randomization was stratified by primary and secondary hormone resistance.Primary end point was clinical benefit rate (CBR), defined as the percentage of all patients with a complete or partial response or stable disease at 6 months.No formal statistical comparison between groups was planned.RESULTS: The 6-month CBR was 61% (95% CI, 47 to 74) with tamoxifen plus everolimus and 42% (95% CI, 29 to 56) with tamoxifen alone.Time to progression (TTP) increased from 4.5 months with tamoxifen alone to 8.6 months with tamoxifen plus everolimus, corresponding to a 46% reduction in risk of progression with the combination (hazard ratio [HR], 0.54; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.81).Risk of death was reduced by 55% with tamoxifen plus everolimus versus tamoxifen alone (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.24 to 0.81).The main toxicities associated with tamoxifen plus everolimus were fatigue (72% v 53% with tamoxifen alone), stomatitis (56% v 7%), rash (44% v 7%), anorexia (43% v 18%), and diarrhea (39% v 11%).CONCLUSION: This study suggests that tamoxifen plus everolimus increased CBR, TTP, and overall survival compared with tamoxifen alone in postmenopausal women with AI-resistant mBC.",1,1,1,1
26324738,"Clinical and Translational Results of a Phase II, Randomized Trial of an Anti-IGF-1R (Cixutumumab) in Women with Breast Cancer That Progressed on Endocrine Therapy.PURPOSE: This phase II trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of cixutumumab, a human anti-insulin-like growth factor receptor 1 (IGF-1R) monoclonal IgG1 antibody, and explored potential biomarkers in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer that progressed on antiestrogen therapy received (2:1 randomization) cixutumumab 10 mg/kg and the same antiestrogen (arm A) or cixutumumab alone (arm B) every 2 weeks (q2w).Primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS); secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS) and safety.Correlative analyses of IGF-1R, total insulin receptor (IR), and IR isoforms A (IR-A) and B (IR-B) expression in tumor tissue were explored.RESULTS: Ninety-three patients were randomized (arm A, n = 62; arm B, n = 31).Median PFS was 2.0 and 3.1 months for arm A and arm B, respectively.Secondary efficacy measures were similar between the arms.Overall, cixutumumab was well tolerated.IGF-1R expression was not associated with clinical outcomes.Regardless of the treatment, lower IR-A, IR-B, and total IR mRNA expression in tumor tissue was significantly associated with longer PFS [IR-A: HR, 2.62 (P = 0.0062); IR-B: HR, 2.21 (P = 0.0202); and total IR: HR, 2.18 (P = 0.0230)] and OS [IR-A: HR, 2.94 (P = 0.0156); IR-B: HR, 2.69 (P = 0.0245); and total IR: HR, 2.72 (P = 0.0231)].CONCLUSIONS: Cixutumumab (10 mg/kg) with or without antiestrogen q2w had an acceptable safety profile, but no significant clinical efficacy.Patients with low total IR, IR-A, and IR-B mRNA expression levels had significantly longer PFS and OS, independent of the treatment.The prognostic or predictive value of IR as a biomarker for IGF-1R-targeted therapies requires further validation.",1,1,1,1
27589688,"Primary analysis of a prospective, randomized, single-blinded phase II trial evaluating the HER2 peptide GP2 vaccine in breast cancer patients to prevent recurrence.GP2 is a HER2-derived, HLA-A2+ restricted peptide.Phase I studies showed GP2 administered with GM-CSF to be safe and immunogenic.Here we report the primary analysis of a prospective, randomized, multicenter phase II adjuvant trial conducted to determine the vaccine's efficacy.The trial enrolled HLA-A2+, clinically disease-free, node-positive and high-risk node-negative breast cancer patients with tumors expressing HER2 (immunohistochemistry[IHC] 1+-3+).Patients were randomized to GP2+GM-CSF versus GM-CSF alone.Disease-free survival (DFS) was analyzed in intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-treatment cohorts; pre-specified subgroup analyses were performed for patients with IHC 3+ or FISH+ disease.The trial enrolled 180 patients; 89 received GP2+GM-CSF and 91 received GM-CSF alone.The groups were well-matched for clinicopathologic characteristics.Toxicities have been minimal.The Kaplan-Meier estimated 5-year DFS rate in the ITT analyses was 88% (95% CI:78-94%) in vaccinated vs. 81% (95% CI:69-89%) (P = 0.43) in control patients after a 34 month median follow-up.In the per-treatment analysis, the estimated 5-year DFS rates were 94% (95% CI:83-98%) and 85% (73-92%) (P = 0.17).In IHC 3+/FISH+ patients, the estimated 5-year DFS rate was 94% (82-98%) in vaccinated patients (n = 51) vs. 89% (71-96%) in control patients (n = 50), (P = 0.86) in the ITT analyses and 100% vs. 89% (71-96%) in vaccinated vs. control patients in the per-treatment analyses (P = 0.08).While the overall ITT analysis did not demonstrate benefit to vaccination, this trial confirmed that the GP2 vaccine is safe and suggests that vaccination may have clinical activity, particularly in patients with HER2 overexpression who received the full vaccine series (ie per-treatment group).",1,1,1,1
33667670,"Phase III, randomized trial of mirvetuximab soravtansine versus chemotherapy in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer: primary analysis of FORWARD I.BACKGROUND: Mirvetuximab soravtansine (MIRV) is an antibody-drug conjugate comprising a folate receptor alpha (FRalpha)-binding antibody, cleavable linker, and the maytansinoid DM4, a potent tubulin-targeting agent.The randomized, open-label, phase III study FORWARD I compared MIRV and investigator's choice chemotherapy in patients with platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC).PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients with 1-3 prior lines of therapy and whose tumors were positive for FRalpha expression were randomly assigned, in a 2 : 1 ratio, to receive MIRV (6 mg/kg, adjusted ideal body weight) or chemotherapy (paclitaxel, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, or topotecan).The primary endpoint was progression-free survival [PFS, Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, blinded independent central review] in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population and in the prespecified FRalpha high population.RESULTS: A total of 366 patients were randomized; 243 received MIRV and 109 received chemotherapy.The primary endpoint, PFS, did not reach statistical significance in either the ITT [hazard ratio (HR), 0.98, P = 0.897] or the FRalpha high population (HR, 0.69, P = 0.049).Superior outcomes for MIRV over chemotherapy were observed in all secondary endpoints in the FRalpha high population including improved objective response rate (24% versus 10%), CA-125 responses (53% versus 25%), and patient-reported outcomes (27% versus 13%).Fewer treatment-related grade 3 or higher adverse events (25.1% versus 44.0%), and fewer events leading to dose reduction (19.8% versus 30.3%) and treatment discontinuation (4.5% versus 8.3%) were seen with MIRV compared with chemotherapy.CONCLUSIONS: In patients with platinum-resistant EOC, MIRV did not result in a significant improvement in PFS compared with chemotherapy.Secondary endpoints consistently favored MIRV, particularly in patients with high FRalpha expression.MIRV showed a differentiated and more manageable safety profile than chemotherapy.",1,1,1,0
26634205,"Genetic Variations in ABCG2 Gene Predict Breast Carcinoma Susceptibility and Clinical Outcomes after Treatment with Anthracycline-Based Chemotherapy.The genetic variants of the ATP-binding cassette, subfamily G, member 2 (ABCG2) are known to be involved in developing cancer risk and interindividual differences in chemotherapeutic response.The polymorphisms in ABCG2 gene were genotyped by using PCR-RFLP assays.We found that ABCG2 G34A GA/AA genotype, C421A AA genotype, and haplotypes 34A-421C and 34G-421A were significantly associated with increased risk for developing breast carcinoma.Furthermore, ABCG2 C421A AA homozygote had a significant enhanced therapeutic response in patients with neoadjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy.Moreover, ABCG2 G34A AA genotype carriers displayed a longer OS in ER positive patients or PR positive patients after postoperative anthracycline-based chemotherapy.These results suggested that the ABCG2 polymorphisms might be a candidate pharmacogenomic factor to assess susceptibility and prognosis for breast carcinoma patients.",0,0,0,0

27825977,"Management of women with human papillomavirus persistence: long-term follow-up of a randomized clinical trial.BACKGROUND: Introduction of human papillomavirus-based screening is ongoing in many countries, given its higher sensitivity and longer-lasting protection compared with cytology-based screening.However, optimal clinical management of human papillomavirus-positive but cytology-negative women is unclear, and additional studies with clinical follow-up are warranted.OBJECTIVE: The aim of the current study was to investigate the long-term outcomes of the clinical management used in a double-blind, randomized clinical trial of human papillomavirus screening conducted in the context of the routine, organized screening program in Sweden.STUDY DESIGN: Among 12,527 women aged 32-38 years enrolled in the trial, we followed up the 195 women who attended the colposcopy screening who were cytologically normal but persistently human papillomavirus positive (at least 12 months later; median, 19 months) in the human papillomavirus testing arm (n = 100) or were randomly selected from the control arm (n = 95).Women in the human papillomavirus testing arm were followed up with repeated human papillomavirus testing, cytologies, and colposcopies if persistently human papillomavirus-positive without cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse.A similar number of random colposcopies and tests were carried out in the control arm.Women were followed up over 13 years for the main outcome measures: cumulative incidence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 or worse.RESULTS: Among women who continued to attend and had continuous human papillomavirus persistence, all (40 of 40, 100% [95% confidence interval, 91-100%]) developed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse.There were no cases among women who cleared their human papillomavirus persistence (0 of 35, 0% (95% confidence interval, 0-10%) (P < .001).Among women who had had human papillomavirus persistence but did not continue with repeated human papillomavirus tests (unknown persistence status), 56% (15 of 27 women) developed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse.Almost all cases occurred within 6 years.The intensive clinical management in the trial appeared to result in diagnoses of earlier cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse but apparently did not prevent cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse.CONCLUSION: Women with human papillomavirus persistence will, in general, either become human papillomavirus negative or develop cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse within 6 years, even with intensive clinical follow-up.",0,0,0,0
32492302,"Rituximab for High-Risk, Mature B-Cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma in Children.BACKGROUND: Rituximab added to chemotherapy prolongs survival among adults with B-cell cancer.Data on its efficacy and safety in children with high-grade, mature B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma are limited.METHODS: We conducted an open-label, international, randomized, phase 3 trial involving patients younger than 18 years of age with high-risk, mature B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (stage III with an elevated lactate dehydrogenase level or stage IV) or acute leukemia to compare the addition of six doses of rituximab to standard lymphomes malins B (LMB) chemotherapy with standard LMB chemotherapy alone.The primary end point was event-free survival.Overall survival and toxic effects were also assessed.RESULTS: Analyses were based on 328 patients who underwent randomization (164 patients per group); 85.7% of the patients had Burkitt's lymphoma.The median follow-up was 39.9 months.Events were observed in 10 patients in the rituximab-chemotherapy group and in 28 in the chemotherapy group.Event-free survival at 3 years was 93.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 89.1 to 96.7) in the rituximab-chemotherapy group and 82.3% (95% CI, 75.7 to 87.5) in the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio for primary refractory disease or first occurrence of progression, relapse after response, death from any cause, or second cancer, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.15 to 0.66; one-sided P = 0.00096, which reached the significance level required for this analysis).Eight patients in the rituximab-chemotherapy group died (4 deaths were disease-related, 3 were treatment-related, and 1 was from a second cancer), as did 20 in the chemotherapy group (17 deaths were disease-related, and 3 were treatment-related) (hazard ratio, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.16 to 0.82).The incidence of acute adverse events of grade 4 or higher after prephase treatment was 33.3% in the rituximab-chemotherapy group and 24.2% in the chemotherapy group (P = 0.07); events were related mainly to febrile neutropenia and infection.Approximately twice as many patients in the rituximab-chemotherapy group as in the chemotherapy group had a low IgG level 1 year after trial inclusion.CONCLUSIONS: Rituximab added to standard LMB chemotherapy markedly prolonged event-free survival and overall survival among children and adolescents with high-grade, high-risk, mature B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and was associated with a higher incidence of hypogammaglobulinemia and, potentially, more episodes of infection.(Funded by the Clinical Research Hospital Program of the French Ministry of Health and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01516580.).",1,1,1,1
26822397,"Gastrectomy plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone for advanced gastric cancer with a single non-curable factor (REGATTA): a phase 3, randomised controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy is the standard of care for incurable advanced gastric cancer.Whether the addition of gastrectomy to chemotherapy improves survival for patients with advanced gastric cancer with a single non-curable factor remains controversial.We aimed to investigate the superiority of gastrectomy followed by chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone with respect to overall survival in these patients.METHODS: We did an open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial at 44 centres or hospitals in Japan, South Korea, and Singapore.Patients aged 20-75 years with advanced gastric cancer with a single non-curable factor confined to either the liver (H1), peritoneum (P1), or para-aortic lymph nodes (16a1/b2) were randomly assigned (1:1) in each country to chemotherapy alone or gastrectomy followed by chemotherapy by a minimisation method with biased-coin assignment to balance the groups according to institution, clinical nodal status, and non-curable factor.Patients, treating physicians, and individuals who assessed outcomes and analysed data were not masked to treatment assignment.Chemotherapy consisted of oral S-1 80 mg/m(2) per day on days 1-21 and cisplatin 60 mg/m(2) on day 8 of every 5-week cycle.Gastrectomy was restricted to D1 lymphadenectomy without any resection of metastatic lesions.The primary endpoint was overall survival, analysed by intention to treat.This study is registered with UMIN-CTR, number UMIN000001012.FINDINGS: Between Feb 4, 2008, and Sept 17, 2013, 175 patients were randomly assigned to chemotherapy alone (86 patients) or gastrectomy followed by chemotherapy (89 patients).After the first interim analysis on Sept 14, 2013, the predictive probability of overall survival being significantly higher in the gastrectomy plus chemotherapy group than in the chemotherapy alone group at the final analysis was only 13.2%, so the study was closed on the basis of futility.Overall survival at 2 years for all randomly assigned patients was 31.7% (95% CI 21.7-42.2) for patients assigned to chemotherapy alone compared with 25.1% (16.2-34.9) for those assigned to gastrectomy plus chemotherapy.Median overall survival was 16.6 months (95% CI 13.7-19.8) for patients assigned to chemotherapy alone and 14.3 months (11.8-16.3) for those assigned to gastrectomy plus chemotherapy (hazard ratio 1.09, 95% CI 0.78-1.52; one-sided p=0.70).The incidence of the following grade 3 or 4 chemotherapy-associated adverse events was higher in patients assigned to gastrectomy plus chemotherapy than in those assigned to chemotherapy alone: leucopenia (14 patients [18%] vs two [3%]), anorexia (22 [29%] vs nine [12%]), nausea (11 [15%] vs four [5%]), and hyponatraemia (seven [9%] vs four [5%]).One treatment-related death occurred in a patient assigned to chemotherapy alone (sudden cardiopulmonary arrest of unknown cause during the second cycle of chemotherapy) and one occurred in a patient assigned to chemotherapy plus gastrectomy (rapid growth of peritoneal metastasis after discharge 12 days after surgery).INTERPRETATION: Since gastrectomy followed by chemotherapy did not show any survival benefit compared with chemotherapy alone in advanced gastric cancer with a single non-curable factor, gastrectomy cannot be justified for treatment of patients with these tumours.FUNDING: The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan and the Korean Gastric Cancer Association.",0,0,0,0

25038874,"HER2 screening data from ToGA: targeting HER2 in gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancer.BACKGROUND: In the Trastuzumab for GAstric cancer (ToGA) study, trastuzumab plus chemotherapy improved median overall survival by 2.7 months in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive [immunohistochemistry (IHC) 3+/fluorescence in situ hybridization-positive] gastric/gastroesophageal junction cancer compared with chemotherapy alone (hazard ratio 0.74).Post hoc exploratory analyses in patients expressing higher HER2 levels (IHC 2+/fluorescence in situ hybridization-positive or IHC 3+) demonstrated a 4.2-month improvement in median overall survival with trastuzumab (hazard ratio 0.65).The ToGA study provides the largest screening dataset available on HER2 overexpression/amplification in this indication.We further analyzed correlation(s) of HER2 overexpression/amplification with clinical and epidemiological factors.METHODS: HER2-positivity was analyzed by histological subtype, tumor location, geographic region, and specimen type.Exploratory efficacy analyses were performed.RESULTS: The HER2-positivity rate was 22.1 % across analyzed tumor samples.Rates were similar between European and Asian patients (23.6 % vs. 23.9 %), but higher in intestinal- vs. diffuse-type (31.8 % vs. 6.1 %), and gastroesophageal junction cancer versus gastric tumors (32.2 % vs. 21.4 %).Across all IHC scores, variability in HER2 staining (</=30 % stained cells) was observed in almost 50 % of cases, with increasing rates in lower IHC categories, and did not affect treatment outcome.The polysomy rate was 4 %.CONCLUSIONS: HER2 expression varies by tumor location and type.All patients with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer should be tested for HER2 status, preferably using IHC initially.Due to the unique characteristics of gastric cancer, specific testing/scoring guidelines should be adhered to.",0,0,0,0
33581820,"Transdermal oestradiol for androgen suppression in prostate cancer: long-term cardiovascular outcomes from the randomised Prostate Adenocarcinoma Transcutaneous Hormone (PATCH) trial programme.BACKGROUND: Androgen suppression is a central component of prostate cancer management but causes substantial long-term toxicity.Transdermal administration of oestradiol (tE2) circumvents first-pass hepatic metabolism and, therefore, should avoid the cardiovascular toxicity seen with oral oestrogen and the oestrogen-depletion effects seen with luteinising hormone releasing hormone agonists (LHRHa).We present long-term cardiovascular follow-up data from the Prostate Adenocarcinoma Transcutaneous Hormone (PATCH) trial programme.METHODS: PATCH is a seamless phase 2/3, randomised, multicentre trial programme at 52 study sites in the UK.Men with locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer were randomly allocated (1:2 from August, 2007 then 1:1 from February, 2011) to either LHRHa according to local practice or tE2 patches (four 100 mug patches per 24 h, changed twice weekly, reducing to three patches twice weekly if castrate at 4 weeks [defined as testosterone </=1.7 nmol/L]).Randomisation was done using a computer-based minimisation algorithm and was stratified by several factors, including disease stage, age, smoking status, and family history of cardiac disease.The primary outcome of this analysis was cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.Cardiovascular events, including heart failure, acute coronary syndrome, thromboembolic stroke, and other thromboembolic events, were confirmed using predefined criteria and source data.Sudden or unexpected deaths were attributed to a cardiovascular category if a confirmatory post-mortem report was available and as other relevant events if no post-mortem report was available.PATCH is registered with the ISRCTN registry, ISRCTN70406718; the study is ongoing and adaptive.FINDINGS: Between Aug 14, 2007, and July 30, 2019, 1694 men were randomly allocated either LHRHa (n=790) or tE2 patches (n=904).Overall, median follow-up was 3.9 (IQR 2.4-7.0) years.Respective castration rates at 1 month and 3 months were 65% and 93% among patients assigned LHRHa and 83% and 93% among those allocated tE2.157 events from 145 men met predefined cardiovascular criteria, with a further ten sudden deaths with no post-mortem report (total 167 events in 153 men).26 (2%) of 1694 patients had fatal cardiovascular events, 15 (2%) of 790 assigned LHRHa and 11 (1%) of 904 allocated tE2.The time to first cardiovascular event did not differ between treatments (hazard ratio 1.11, 95% CI 0.80-1.53; p=0.54 [including sudden deaths without post-mortem report]; 1.20, 0.86-1.68; p=0.29 [confirmed group only]).30 (34%) of 89 cardiovascular events in patients assigned tE2 occurred more than 3 months after tE2 was stopped or changed to LHRHa.The most frequent adverse events were gynaecomastia (all grades), with 279 (38%) events in 730 patients who received LHRHa versus 690 (86%) in 807 patients who received tE2 (p<0.0001) and hot flushes (all grades) in 628 (86%) of those who received LHRHa versus 280 (35%) who received tE2 (p<0.0001).INTERPRETATION: Long-term data comparing tE2 patches with LHRHa show no evidence of a difference between treatments in cardiovascular mortality or morbidity.Oestrogens administered transdermally should be reconsidered for androgen suppression in the management of prostate cancer.FUNDING: Cancer Research UK, and Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit at University College London.",0,0,0,0

24793078,"A randomized trial of the effectiveness of topical ""ABH Gel"" (Ativan((R)), Benadryl((R)), Haldol((R))) vs. placebo in cancer patients with nausea.CONTEXT: The topical gel known as ""ABH gel,"" comprising lorazepam (Ativan((R))), diphenhydramine (Benadryl((R))), and haloperidol (Haldol((R))), is frequently used to treat nausea because of its perceived efficacy, relatively low cost, and ease of use in the home setting.There are limited scientific data on this medication, however.Recent pilot studies showed no absorption of the active ingredients of the gel, prompting further prospective studies into the cause of the perceived efficacy in the clinical setting.OBJECTIVES: To determine any difference in the effectiveness of ABH gel compared with placebo in cancer patients with nausea.METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, noninferiority clinical trial was developed to test the hypothesis that there is no difference in the effectiveness of ABH gel compared with placebo in cancer patients with nausea.The primary outcome was the difference in nausea score (on a 0-10 scale) at baseline and at 60 minutes in each treatment group.The difference in the ABH gel-treated group compared with placebo was evaluated for noninferiority.Secondary outcomes included the number of vomiting episodes and side effects over time.RESULTS: The mean change in nausea score from baseline to 60 minutes after treatment in the ABH gel group was 1.7 +/- 2.05 and 0.9 +/- 2.45 for the placebo group (P = 0.42).The placebo group was found to be noninferior to the ABH gel group in reducing the nausea score.ABH gel also did not decrease vomiting events better than placebo (P = 0.34).Only one patient reported any side effects from the treatments in either arm of the study.CONCLUSION: ABH gel in its current formulation should not be used in cancer patients experiencing nausea.",0,0,0,0
23234763,"Adjuvant lapatinib for women with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer: a randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Worldwide, many patients with HER2-positive early stage breast cancer do not receive trastuzumab-the standard adjuvant treatment.We investigated the efficacy and safety of adjuvant lapatinib for patients with trastuzumab-naive HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer, started at any time after diagnosis.METHODS: This study was a placebo-controlled, multicentre, randomised phase 3 trial.Women outpatients from 405 [corrected] centres in 33 countries [corrected] with HER2-positive early-breast cancer who had previously received adjuvant chemotherapy but not trastuzumab were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive daily lapatinib (1500 mg) or daily placebo for 12 months.Randomisation was done with a computer-generated sequence, stratified by time since diagnosis, lymph node involvement at diagnosis, and tumour hormone-receptor status.Investigators, site staff, and patients were masked to treatment assignment.The primary endpoint was disease-free survival in the intention-to-treat population.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00374322.FINDINGS: Between August, 2006, and May, 2008, 3161 women were enrolled and 3147 were assigned to lapatinib (n=1571) or placebo (n=1576).After a median follow-up of 47.4 months (range 0.4-60.0) in the lapatinib group and 48.3 (0.7-61.3) in the placebo group, 210 (13%) disease-free survival events had occurred in the lapatinib group versus 264 (17%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.83, 95% CI 0.70-1.00; p=0.053).Central review of HER2 status showed that only 2490 (79%) of the randomised women were HER2-positive.157 (13%) of 1230 confirmed HER2-positive patients in the lapatinib group and in 208 (17%) of 1260 in the placebo group had a disease-free survival event (HR 0.82, 95% 0.67-1.00; p=0.04).Serious adverse events occurred in 99 (6%) of 1573 patients taking lapatinib and 77 (5%) of 1574 patients taking placebo, with higher incidences of grade 3-4 diarrhoea (97 [6%] vs nine [<1%]), rash (72 [5%] vs three [<1%]), and hepatobiliary disorders (36 [2%] vs one [<1%]).INTERPRETATION: Our data show that there was no significant difference in disease-free survival between groups when analysed in the intention-to-treat population.However, exploratory analyses restricted to patients who had HER2-positive disease confirmed by central fluorescence in-situ hybridisation review suggested marginal benefit with lapatinib in terms of disease-free survival.Thus lapatinib might be an option for women with HER2-positive breast cancer who do not or cannot receive adjuvant trastuzumab.FUNDING: GlaxoSmithKline.",1,1,1,1
27983774,"Cost-effectiveness of indwelling pleural catheter compared with talc in malignant pleural effusion.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Malignant pleural effusion is associated with morbidity and mortality.A randomized controlled trial previously compared clinical outcomes and resource use with indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) and talc pleurodesis in this population.Using unpublished quality of life data, we estimate the cost-effectiveness of IPC compared with talc pleurodesis.METHODS: Healthcare utilization and costs were captured during the trial.Utility weights produced by the EuroQol Group five-dimensional three-level questionnaire and survival were used to determine quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained.The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated over the 1-year trial period.Sensitivity analysis used patient survival data and modelled additional nursing time required per week for catheter drainage.RESULTS: Utility scores, cost and QALYs gained did not differ significantly between groups.The ICER for IPC compared with talc was favorable at $US10 870 per QALY gained.IPC was less costly with a probability exceeding 95% of being cost-effective when survival was <14 weeks, and was more costly when 2-h nursing time per week was assumed for catheter drainage.CONCLUSION: IPC is cost-effective when compared with talc, although substantial uncertainty exists around this estimate.IPC appears most cost-effective in patients with limited survival.If significant nursing time is required for catheter drainage, IPC becomes less likely to be cost-effective.Either therapy may be considered as a first-line option in treating malignant pleural effusion in patients without history of prior pleurodesis, with consideration for patient survival, support and preferences.",0,0,0,0

25399973,"[Efficacies of gefitinib versus paclitaxel/carboplatin for patients with advanced pulmonary adenocarcinoma].OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical efficacies of gefitinib versus paclitaxel/carboplatin in patients with advanced pulmonary adenocarcinoma.METHODS: A total of 51 advanced pulmonary adenocarcinoma patients were recruited from Guangdong General Hospital during October 2006 to September 2007.Eligible patients were >/= 18 years old, either non-smokers or former light smokers and receiving no prior chemotherapy or biological/immunological therapy.According to performance status, smoking status and gender, they were selected with dynamic equilibrium randomized method 1: 1 to receive first-line gefitinib (250 mg/d) in gefitinib arm or carboplatin/paclitaxel (carboplatin, area under the curve 5 mg x ml(-)(1) x min(-)(1), 21-day cycle; paclitaxel, 200 mg/m(2), 21-day cycle in chemotherapy arm.The primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS). And the secondary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR) and overall survival (OS).RESULTS: They were randomized into gefitinib arm (n = 25) and paclitaxel/carboplatin arm (n = 26).The median PFS was 4.2 months in gefitinib arm and 8.3 months in paclitaxel/carboplatin arm (P = 0.422); ORR 36.0% in gefitinib arm and 42.3% in paclitaxel/carboplatin arm (P = 0.645); Median OS 14.4 months in gefitinib arm and 15.0 months in paclitaxel/carboplatin arm (P = 0.290).Multifactorial Cox regression analysis showed that age (P = 0.004), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutation status (P = 0.012) and subsequent treatments (platinum-based chemotherapy, P = 0.001; EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), P = 0.005) were the significant predictors of OS.CONCLUSIONS: No significant differences exist in terms of efficacy and survival between first-line gefitinib and paclitaxel/carboplatin for Chinese patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma who are non-smokers or former light smokers.And age, EGFR gene mutation status and subsequent treatments are significant predictor of OS.However, first-line gefitinib should not be recommended for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients only based on clinical factors, due to a very small sample-size in our study.",1,1,1,1
28209746,"A Phase II Randomized Trial (GO27827) of First-Line FOLFOX Plus Bevacizumab with or Without the MET Inhibitor Onartuzumab in Patients with Metastatic Colorectal Cancer.BACKGROUND: Dysregulated hepatocyte growth factor/mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) signaling is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to vascular endothelial growth factor inhibition in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).We report outcomes from a double-blind, multicenter phase II trial of the MET inhibitor onartuzumab in combination with mFOLFOX-6 and bevacizumab for mCRC (GO27827; NCT01418222).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive onartuzumab (10 mg/kg intravenously [IV]) or placebo plus mFOLFOX-6 and bevacizumab (5 mg/kg IV).Oxaliplatin was given for 8-12 cycles; other agents were continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or death.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) in the intent-to-treat (ITT) and MET immunohistochemistry (IHC) expression-positive populations.RESULTS: Between September 2011 and November 2012, 194 patients were enrolled.In September 2013, an interim analysis recommended stopping onartuzumab treatment due to lack of efficacy.At the time of the final analysis in February 2014, no significant improvement in PFS was seen with onartuzumab versus placebo in either the ITT or MET IHC-positive populations.An improvement in PFS was noted in the MET IHC-negative population.Neither overall survival nor response rate was improved with onartuzumab.The incidence of fatigue, peripheral edema, and deep vein thrombosis was increased with onartuzumab relative to placebo.CONCLUSION: Onartuzumab combined with mFOLFOX-6 and bevacizumab did not significantly improve efficacy outcomes in either the ITT or MET IHC-positive populations.MET expression by IHC was not a predictive biomarker in this setting.The Oncologist 2017;22:264-271 IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The addition of onartuzumab to mFOLFOX-6 plus bevacizumab did not improve outcomes in patients with previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer in this randomized, phase II study.Although initial results with onartuzumab were promising, a number of phase II/III clinical trials have reported a lack of improvement in efficacy with onartuzumab combined with standard-of-care therapies in several tumor types.Furthermore, negative study data have been published for rilotumumab and ficlatuzumab, both of which block hepatocyte growth factor binding to the mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) receptor.MET immunohistochemistry was not a predictive biomarker.It remains to be seen if other biomarkers or small molecule inhibitors may be more appropriate for inhibiting this oncogenic pathway.",1,1,1,1

Patients received 7 treatment cycles in median (1-35) with a median treatment duration of 4.7 months (141 days, 8-765).PFS rate at 6 months was 54% in patients treated with cisplatin/gemcitabine and panitumumab but was 73% in patients treated with cisplatin/gemcitabine without antibody, respectively.Secondary end-points were an ORR of 45% in treatment arm A compared with 39% receiving treatment B and a median OS of 12.8 months (arm A) and of 20.1 months (arm B), respectively.In contrast to the p53-status, genetic alterations in IDH1/2 were linked to a high response after chemotherapy and prolonged survival.In accordance with our results, the meta-analysis of 12 trials did not reveal a survival advantage for patients treated with EGFR antibodies compared with chemotherapy alone.CONCLUSIONS: Panitumumab in combination with chemotherapy does not improve ORR, PFS and OS in patients with KRAS wild-type, advanced biliary cancer.Genetic profiling should be included in CCA trials to identify and validate predictive and prognostic biomarkers.CLINICAL TRIALS NUMBER: The trial was registered with NCT01320254.",1,1,1,1
27130929,"Comparing Breast Cancer Multiparameter Tests in the OPTIMA Prelim Trial: No Test Is More Equal Than the Others.BACKGROUND: Previous reports identifying discordance between multiparameter tests at the individual patient level have been largely attributed to methodological shortcomings of multiple in silico studies.Comparisons between tests, when performed using actual diagnostic assays, have been predicted to demonstrate high degrees of concordance.OPTIMA prelim compared predicted risk stratification and subtype classification of different multiparameter tests performed directly on the same population.METHODS: Three hundred thirteen women with early breast cancer were randomized to standard (chemotherapy and endocrine therapy) or test-directed (chemotherapy if Oncotype DX recurrence score >25) treatment.Risk stratification was also determined with Prosigna (PAM50), MammaPrint, MammaTyper, NexCourse Breast (IHC4-AQUA), and conventional IHC4 (IHC4).Subtype classification was provided by Blueprint, MammaTyper, and Prosigna.RESULTS: Oncotype DX predicted a higher proportion of tumors as low risk (82.1%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 77.8% to 86.4%) than were predicted low/intermediate risk using Prosigna (65.5%, 95% CI = 60.1% to 70.9%), IHC4 (72.0%, 95% CI = 66.5% to 77.5%), MammaPrint (61.4%, 95% CI = 55.9% to 66.9%), or NexCourse Breast (61.6%, 95% CI = 55.8% to 67.4%).Strikingly, the five tests showed only modest agreement when dichotomizing results between high vs low/intermediate risk.Only 119 (39.4%) tumors were classified uniformly as either low/intermediate risk or high risk, and 183 (60.6%) were assigned to different risk categories by different tests, although 94 (31.1%) showed agreement between four of five tests.All three subtype tests assigned 59.5% to 62.4% of tumors to luminal A subtype, but only 121 (40.1%) were classified as luminal A by all three tests and only 58 (19.2%) were uniformly assigned as nonluminal A. Discordant subtyping was observed in 123 (40.7%) tumors.CONCLUSIONS: Existing evidence on the comparative prognostic information provided by different tests suggests that current multiparameter tests provide broadly equivalent risk information for the population of women with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancers.However, for the individual patient, tests may provide differing risk categorization and subtype information.",0,0,0,0
26822398,"Afatinib plus vinorelbine versus trastuzumab plus vinorelbine in patients with HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer who had progressed on one previous trastuzumab treatment (LUX-Breast 1): an open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Trastuzumab resistance is a key therapeutic challenge in metastatic breast cancer.We postulated that broader inhibition of ErbB receptors with afatinib would improve clinical outcomes compared with HER2 inhibition alone in patients who had progressed on previous trastuzumab treatment.LUX-Breast 1 compared afatinib plus vinorelbine with trastuzumab plus vinorelbine for such patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.METHODS: We did this open-label trial at 350 hospitals in 41 countries worldwide.We enrolled female patients with HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer who had progressed on or following adjuvant trastuzumab or first-line treatment of metastatic disease with trastuzumab.Participants were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive oral afatinib (40 mg/day) plus intravenous vinorelbine (25 mg/m(2) per week) or intravenous trastuzumab (2 mg/kg per week after 4 mg/kg loading dose) plus vinorelbine.Randomisation was done centrally and stratified by previous trastuzumab treatment (adjuvant vs first-line treatment), hormone receptor status (oestrogen receptor and progesterone receptor positive vs others), and region.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, assessed in the intention-to-treat population.This trial is closed to enrolment and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01125566.FINDINGS: Between Aug 26, 2010, and April 26, 2013, we enrolled 508 patients: 339 assigned to the afatinib group and 169 assigned to the trastuzumab group.Recruitment was stopped on April 26, 2013, after a benefit-risk assessment by the independent data monitoring committee was unfavourable for the afatinib group.Patients on afatinib plus vinorelbine had to switch to trastuzumab plus vinorelbine, afatinib monotherapy, vinorelbine monotherapy, or receive treatment outside of the trial.Median follow-up was 9.3 months (IQR 3.7-16.0).Median progression-free survival was 5.5 months (95% CI 5.4-5.6) in the afatinib group and 5.6 months (5.3-7.3) in the trastuzumab group (hazard ratio 1.10 95% CI 0.86-1.41; p=0.43).The most common drug-related adverse events of grade 3 or higher were neutropenia (190 [56%] of 337 patients in the afatinib group vs 102 [60%] of 169 patients in the trastuzumab group), leucopenia (64 [19%] vs 34 [20%]), and diarrhoea (60 [18%] vs none).INTERPRETATION: Trastuzumab-based therapy remains the treatment of choice for patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who had progressed on trastuzumab.FUNDING: Boehringer Ingelheim.",1,1,1,1
23588130,"Increasing human papillomavirus vaccine acceptability by tailoring messages to young adult women's perceived barriers.BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination is a safe and effective primary prevention strategy for cervical cancer.Despite the need for effective HPV vaccination interventions, relatively few have been tested.Moreover, existing interventions have tended to use a one-size-fits-all educational approach.We investigated whether tailoring intervention materials to young adult women's perceived barriers to HPV vaccination-a known psychosocial predictor of vaccine uptake-would increase women's intentions to receive the HPV vaccine.METHODS: Young adult women (N = 94; aged 18-26 years) who had not been vaccinated against HPV were randomly assigned to read either a nontailored message about HPV vaccination or a message that was individually tailored to participants' perceived barriers to HPV vaccine uptake (e.g., safety concerns, cost, and not sexually active).Participants' intentions to receive the HPV vaccine in the next year were assessed before and after delivery of the intervention and served as the primary outcome variable.RESULTS: The most commonly selected barrier and primary reason for not getting vaccinated was concern about vaccine adverse effects (endorsed by 55%).Knowledge about HPV vaccination increased after exposure to the intervention but did not differ by experimental condition.Although HPV vaccination intentions increased from pretest to posttest in both conditions, participants in the tailored condition reported greater increases in intentions than did participants in the nontailored condition (F1,90 = 4.02, P = 0.048, partial eta = 0.043).CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that tailoring intervention materials to women's individual barriers is a potentially promising strategy for increasing HPV vaccination among young adult women.",0,0,0,0
28352657,"Randomized, placebo-controlled window trial of EGFR, Src, or combined blockade in head and neck cancer.BACKGROUND.EGFR and Src family kinases are upregulated in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).EGFR interacts with Src to activate STAT3 signaling, and dual EGFR-Src targeting is synergistic in HNSCC preclinical models.pSrc overexpression predicted resistance to the EGFR inhibitor, erlotinib, in a prior window trial.We conducted a 4-arm window trial to identify biomarkers associated with response to EGFR and/or Src inhibition.METHODS.Patients with operable stage II-IVa HNSCC were randomized to 7-21 days of neoadjuvant erlotinib, the Src inhibitor dasatinib, the combination of both, or placebo.Paired tumor specimens were collected before and after treatment.Pharmacodynamic expression of EGFR and Src pathway components was evaluated by IHC of tissue microarrays and reverse-phase protein array of tissue lysates.Candidate biomarkers were assessed for correlation with change in tumor size.RESULTS.From April 2009 to December 2012, 58 patients were randomized and 55 were treated.There was a significant decrease in tumor size in both erlotinib arms (P = 0.0014); however, no effect was seen with dasatinib alone (P = 0.24).High baseline pMAPK expression was associated with response to erlotinib (P = 0.03).High baseline pSTAT3 was associated with resistance to dasatinib (P = 0.099).CONCLUSIONS.Brief exposure to erlotinib significantly decreased tumor size in operable HNSCC, with no additive effect from dasatinib.Baseline pMAPK expression warrants further study as a response biomarker for anti-EGFR therapy.Basal expression of pSTAT3 may be independent of Src, explain therapeutic resistance, and preclude development of dasatinib in biomarker-unselected cohorts.TRIAL REGISTRATION.NCT00779389.FUNDING.National Cancer Institute, American Cancer Society, Pennsylvania Department of Health, V Foundation for Cancer Research, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Astellas Pharma.",1,1,1,1

28031424,"The DART Study: Results from the Dose-Escalation and Expansion Cohorts Evaluating the Combination of Dalantercept plus Axitinib in Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma.Purpose: Activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1) is a novel target in angiogenesis.Concurrent targeting of ALK1 and VEGF signaling results in augmented inhibition of tumor growth in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) xenograft models.Dalantercept is an ALK1-receptor fusion protein that acts as a ligand trap for bone morphogenetic proteins 9 and 10.The DART Study evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and antitumor activity of dalantercept plus axitinib in patients with advanced RCC and determined the optimal dose for further testing.Experimental Design: Patients received dalantercept 0.6, 0.9, or 1.2 mg/kg subcutaneously every 3 weeks plus axitinib 5 mg by mouth twice daily until disease progression or intolerance.Results: Twenty-nine patients were enrolled in the dose escalation (n = 15) and expansion (n = 14) cohorts.There were no dose-limiting toxicities or grade 4/5 treatment-related adverse events.In addition to common VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor effects, such as fatigue and diarrhea, commonly seen treatment-related adverse events were peripheral edema, epistaxis, pericardial effusion, and telangiectasia.The objective response rate by RECIST v1.1 was 25% with responses seen at all dose levels.The overall median progression-free survival was 8.3 months.Conclusions: The combination of dalantercept plus axitinib is well tolerated and associated with clinical activity.On the basis of safety and efficacy results, the 0.9 mg/kg dose level was chosen for further study in a randomized phase II trial of dalantercept plus axitinib versus placebo plus axitinib.Clin Cancer Res; 23(14); 3557-65.(c)2016 AACR.",0,0,0,0
28891398,"Geometric analysis of loco-regional recurrences in relation to pre-treatment hypoxia in patients with head and neck cancer.INTRODUCTION: A previous pattern-of-failure study has suggested that up to 50% of the loco-regional failures (LRF) in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) occur outside the initial hypoxic volume determined by [(18)F]-fluoromisonidazole-PET ([(18)F]-FMISO-PET).The aim of the present analysis was to correlate spatial patterns of failure with respect to the pretherapeutic dynamic [(18)F]-FMISO-PET/CT in HNSCC after radiochemotherapy (RCT).MATERIAL AND METHODS: Within a running phase 2 trial using [(18)F]-FMISO-PET imaging prior to RCT in HNSCC patients (n = 54), we have observed so far 11 LRF with a minimum follow-up of 12 months.For nine patients, LRF imaging (CT or [(18)F]-FDG-PET/CT) for pattern-of-failure analysis was available.Analysis included the static 4-h hypoxic subvolume (VH) as well as a M-parameter volume (VM), which is derived from modeling of dynamic PET.Deformable image registration of the CT scan with the recurrent tumor to the pre-treatment [(18)F]-FMISO-PET/CT and the planning CT was done to quantify the hypoxic subvolumes compared to the recurrent tumor volume.Moreover, a point-of-origin analysis was performed.RESULTS: A total of five local, two regional and two loco-regional recurrences were detected.After deformable image registration of the CT scan with the recurrent tumor to the pre-treatment [(18)F]-FMISO-PET/CT and the planning CT, a significant overlap of the recurrence volume with [(18)F]-FMISO-positive subvolumes in the initial gross tumor volume (GTV) was observed.Median overlap of 40.2%, range 9.4-100.0%, for VH and 49.0%, range 4.4-96.4%, for VM was calculated.The point-of-origin analysis showed median distances of 0.0 mm, range 0.0-11.3 mm to VH and 8.6 mm, range 0.0-15.5 mm to VM, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that loco-regional recurrences after RCT originate from the initial GTV (primary tumor and/or lymph node metastases) containing hypoxic subvolumes, which supports the concept of hypoxia imaging-based dose escalation.",0,0,0,0
26564483,"Anisotropy of Solid Breast Lesions in 2D Shear Wave Elastography is an Indicator of Malignancy.RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To investigate if anisotropy at two-dimensional shear wave elastography (SWE) suggests malignancy and whether it correlates with prognostic and predictive factors in breast cancer.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Study group A of 244 solid breast lesions was imaged with SWE between April 2013 and May 2014.Each lesion was imaged in radial and in antiradial planes, and the maximum elasticity, mean elasticity, and standard deviation were recorded and correlated with benign/malignant status, and if malignant, correlated with conventional predictive and prognostic factors.The results were compared to a study group B of 968 solid breast lesions, which were imaged in sagittal and in axial planes between 2010 and 2013.RESULTS: Neither benign nor malignant lesion anisotropy is plane dependent.However, malignant lesions are more anisotropic than benign lesions (P </= 0.001).Anisotropy correlates with increasing elasticity parameters, breast imaging-reporting and data system categories, core biopsy result, and tumor grade.Large cancers are significantly more anisotropic than small cancers (P </= 0.001).The optimal anisotropy cutoff threshold for benign/malignant differentiation of 150 kPa(2) achieves the best sensitivity (74%) with a reasonable specificity (63%).CONCLUSIONS: Anisotropy may be useful during benign/malignant differentiation of solid breast masses using SWE.Anisotropy also correlates with some prognostic factors in breast cancer.",0,0,0,0

26063890,"Effect of Primary Letrozole Treatment on Tumor Expression of mTOR and HIF-1alpha and Relation to Clinical Response.INTRODUCTION: Recently the combination of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor everolimus and the aromatase inhibitor exemestane has been shown to double the progression-free survival rate in advanced breast cancer.However, the effect of the interrelated pathways of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) and mTOR signaling, both of which are associated with a more aggressive breast cancer phenotype and endocrine resistance, on response in the neoadjuvant setting is unknown.We, therefore, have investigated the influence of these pathways with the aim of better defining those patients most likely to benefit from an endocrine-based therapy associated with/without mTOR inhibitors.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 107 women with T2-4 N0-1 and estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer were randomly assigned to 6 months of primary letrozole (2.5 mg/daily) (LET) or LET plus oral ""metronomic"" cyclophosphamide (50mg/daily) (LET-CYC).Phospo-mTOR and HIF-1alpha were evaluated in tumor specimens collected before and after treatment using a tissue microarray format.RESULTS: LET-based therapy induced a downregulation of phospho-mTOR and HIF-1alpha expression (P = .0001 and P < .004, respectively).The reduction of HIF-1alpha expression observed was positively correlated with phospho-mTOR reduction (P < .03); however, no treatment interaction between the two proteins was detected.HIF-1alpha expression was significantly modulated by the treatment (P < .004) with a reduction both in the LET arm (45%, n = 36/80) (P = .05) and LET-CYC arm (55%, n = 44/80) (P = .04).HIF-1alpha reduction showed a relationship with clinical response confined in LET arm only (P < .03).CONCLUSIONS: In this neoadjuvant population, LET was able to modulate the phospho-mTOR and HIF-1alpha pathways and may define a subpopulation of nonresponders who may be most likely to benefit from mTOR inhibitors.",0,0,0,0
33513313,"Pembrolizumab Plus Ipilimumab or Placebo for Metastatic Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer With PD-L1 Tumor Proportion Score >/= 50%: Randomized, Double-Blind Phase III KEYNOTE-598 Study.PURPOSE: Pembrolizumab monotherapy is standard first-line therapy for metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) tumor proportion score (TPS) >/= 50% without actionable driver mutations.It is not known whether adding ipilimumab to pembrolizumab improves efficacy over pembrolizumab alone in this population.METHODS: In the randomized, double-blind, phase III KEYNOTE-598 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03302234), eligible patients with previously untreated metastatic NSCLC with PD-L1 TPS >/= 50% and no sensitizing EGFR or ALK aberrations were randomly allocated 1:1 to ipilimumab 1 mg/kg or placebo every 6 weeks for up to 18 doses; all participants received pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks for up to 35 doses.Primary end points were overall survival and progression-free survival.RESULTS: Of the 568 participants, 284 were randomly allocated to each group.Median overall survival was 21.4 months for pembrolizumab-ipilimumab versus 21.9 months for pembrolizumab-placebo (hazard ratio, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.85 to 1.37; P = .74).Median progression-free survival was 8.2 months for pembrolizumab-ipilimumab versus 8.4 months for pembrolizumab-placebo (hazard ratio, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.86 to 1.30; P = .72).Grade 3-5 adverse events occurred in 62.4% of pembrolizumab-ipilimumab recipients versus 50.2% of pembrolizumab-placebo recipients and led to death in 13.1% versus 7.5%.The external data and safety monitoring committee recommended that the study be stopped for futility and that participants discontinue ipilimumab and placebo.CONCLUSION: Adding ipilimumab to pembrolizumab does not improve efficacy and is associated with greater toxicity than pembrolizumab monotherapy as first-line treatment for metastatic NSCLC with PD-L1 TPS >/= 50% and no targetable EGFR or ALK aberrations.These data do not support use of pembrolizumab-ipilimumab in place of pembrolizumab monotherapy in this population.",1,1,1,1
26070652,"Comparison of conventional L-thyroxine withdrawal and moderate hypothyroidism in preparation for whole-body 131-I scan and thyroglobulin testing.PURPOSE: After thyroidectomy for thyroid cancer, patients often withdraw L-T4 for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes, showing signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism.A slighter hypothyroidism (reducing L-T4 to one-half) has been proposed to limit these inconveniences.We evaluated half-dose L-T4 protocol, in comparison to conventional L-T4 withdrawal, in terms of effectiveness and improvement of clinical and biochemical disorders.METHODS: We randomized 55 thyroid cancer patients into two groups: 29 patients underwent 5 weeks of half-dose of previous L-T4 treatment (HD group); 26 patients replaced L-T4 with L-T3 for 3 weeks followed by 2 weeks of withdrawal (TW group).Clinical features (Zulewsky clinical score) and biochemical parameters (lipids, liver, and muscle enzymes) were evaluated in all patients at baseline and after 5 weeks.RESULTS: Total cholesterol, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase increased at 5 weeks in both groups, but significantly more in TW, but no difference was found by clinical score.Patients who achieved the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) target value (25 microU/ml) were 92.3% in TW group and 48.3% in HD group (p < 0.001).In the HD group, only basal TSH statistically correlated with the achievement of the TSH target.Receiver operating characteristic curves indicated that a basal TSH >/=0.52 muU/ml is required to reach an adequate TSH level.CONCLUSIONS: Half-dose L-T4 protocol, compared to conventional L-T4 withdrawal, is associated with less biochemical disorders but no significant clinical advantage.Therefore, the half-dose protocol reaches an adequate TSH target in 48.3% of patients and is not effective unless basal serum TSH is >/=0.52 muU/ml.",0,0,0,0

27325147,"Adrenal vein sampling versus CT scan to determine treatment in primary aldosteronism: an outcome-based randomised diagnostic trial.BACKGROUND: The distinction between unilateral aldosterone-producing adenoma or bilateral adrenal hyperplasia as causes of primary aldosteronism is usually made by adrenal CT or by adrenal vein sampling (AVS).Whether CT or AVS represents the best test for diagnosis remains unknown.We aimed to compare the outcome of CT-based management with AVS-based management for patients with primary aldosteronism.METHODS: In a randomised controlled trial, we randomly assigned patients with aldosteronism to undergo either adrenal CT or AVS to determine the presence of aldosterone-producing adenoma (with subsequent treatment consisting of adrenalectomy) or bilateral adrenal hyperplasia (subsequent treatment with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists).The primary endpoint was the intensity of drug treatment for obtaining target blood pressure after 1 year of follow-up, in the intention-to-diagnose population.Intensity of drug treatment was expressed as daily defined doses.Key secondary endpoints included biochemical outcome in patients who received adrenalectomy, health-related quality of life, cost-effectiveness, and adverse events.This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01096654.FINDINGS: We recruited 200 patients between July 6, 2010, and May 30, 2013.Of the 184 patients that completed follow-up, 92 received CT-based treatment (46 adrenalectomy and 46 mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist) and 92 received AVS-based treatment (46 adrenalectomy and 46 mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist).We found no differences in the intensity of antihypertensive medication required to control blood pressure between patients with CT-based treatment and those with AVS-based treatment (median daily defined doses 3.0 [IQR 1.0-5.0] vs 3.0 [1.1-5.9], p=0.52; median number of drugs 2 [IQR 1-3] vs 2 [1-3], p=0.87).Target blood pressure was reached in 39 (42%) patients and 41 (45%) patients, respectively (p=0.82).On secondary endpoints we found no differences in health-related quality of life (median RAND-36 physical scores 52.7 [IQR 43.9-56.8] vs 53.2 [44.0-56.8], p=0.83; RAND-36 mental scores 49.8 [43.1-54.6] vs 52.7 [44.9-55.5], p=0.17) for CT-based and AVS-based treatment.Biochemically, 37 (80%) of patients with CT-based adrenalectomy and 41 (89%) of those with AVS-based adrenalectomy had resolved hyperaldosteronism (p=0.25).A non-significant mean difference of 0.05 (95% CI -0.04 to 0.13) in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) was found to the advantage of the AVS group, associated with a significant increase in mean health-care costs of euro2285 per patient (95% CI 1323-3248).At a willingness-to-pay value of euro30 000 per QALY, the probability that AVS compared with CT constitutes an efficient use of health-care resources in the diagnostic work-up of patients with primary aldosteronism is less than 0.2.There was no difference in adverse events between groups (159 events of which nine were serious vs 187 events of which 12 were serious) for CT-based and AVS-based treatment.INTERPRETATION: Treatment of primary aldosteronism based on CT or AVS did not show significant differences in intensity of antihypertensive medication or clinical benefits for patients after 1 year of follow-up.This finding challenges the current recommendation to perform AVS in all patients with primary aldosteronism.FUNDING: Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development-Medical Sciences, Institute of Cardiology, Warsaw.",0,0,0,0
31591063,"Ramucirumab plus erlotinib in patients with untreated, EGFR-mutated, advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (RELAY): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Dual blockade of the EGFR and VEGF pathways in EGFR-mutated metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is supported by preclinical and clinical data, yet the approach is not widely implemented.RELAY assessed erlotinib, an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) standard of care, plus ramucirumab, a human IgG1 VEGFR2 antagonist, or placebo in patients with untreated EGFR-mutated metastatic NSCLC.METHODS: This is a worldwide, double-blind, phase 3 trial done in 100 hospitals, clinics, and medical centres in 13 countries.Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older (20 years or older in Japan and Taiwan) at the time of study entry, had stage IV NSCLC, with an EGFR exon 19 deletion (ex19del) or exon 21 substitution (Leu858Arg) mutation, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, and no CNS metastases.We randomly assigned eligible patients in a 1:1 ratio to receive oral erlotinib (150 mg/day) plus either intravenous ramucirumab (10 mg/kg) or matching placebo once every 2 weeks.Randomisation was done by an interactive web response system with a computer-generated sequence and stratified by sex, geographical region, EGFR mutation type, and EGFR testing method.The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population.Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment.This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02411448, and is ongoing for long-term survival follow-up.FINDINGS: Between Jan 28, 2016, and Feb 1, 2018, 449 eligible patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to treatment with ramucirumab plus erlotinib (n=224) or placebo plus erlotinib (n=225).Median duration of follow-up was 20.7 months (IQR 15.8-27.2).At the time of primary analysis, progression-free survival was significantly longer in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib group (19.4 months [95% CI 15.4-21.6]) than in the placebo plus erlotinib group (12.4 months [11.0-13.5]), with a stratified hazard ratio of 0.59 (95% CI 0.46-0.76; p<0.0001).Grade 3-4 treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 159 (72%) of 221 patients in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib group versus 121 (54%) of 225 in the placebo plus erlotinib group.The most common grade 3-4 treatment-emergent adverse events in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib group were hypertension (52 [24%]; grade 3 only) and dermatitis acneiform (33 [15%]), and in the placebo plus erlotinib group were dermatitis acneiform (20 [9%]) and increased alanine aminotransferase (17 [8%]).Treatment-emergent serious adverse events were reported in 65 (29%) of 221 patients in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib group and 47 (21%) of 225 in the placebo plus erlotinib group.The most common serious adverse events of any grade in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib group were pneumonia (seven [3%]) and cellulitis and pneumothorax (four [2%], each); the most common in the placebo plus erlotinib group were pyrexia (four [2%]) and pneumothorax (three [1%]).One on-study treatment-related death due to an adverse event occurred (haemothorax after a thoracic drainage procedure for a pleural empyema) in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib group.INTERPRETATION: Ramucirumab plus erlotinib demonstrated superior progression-free survival compared with placebo plus erlotinib in patients with untreated EGFR-mutated metastatic NSCLC.Safety was consistent with the safety profiles of the individual compounds in advanced lung cancer.The RELAY regimen is a viable new treatment option for the initial treatment of EGFR-mutated metastatic NSCLC.FUNDING: Eli Lilly.",1,1,1,1

30150014,"Erlotinib versus vinorelbine plus cisplatin as adjuvant therapy in Chinese patients with stage IIIA EGFR mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (EVAN): a randomised, open-label, phase 2 trial.BACKGROUND: Adjuvant chemotherapy after radical resection of stage IIIA non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has quite poor outcomes.We aimed to investigate whether adjuvant erlotinib therapy improves 2-year disease-free survival compared with chemotherapy in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation-positive stage IIIA NSCLC.METHODS: In this randomised, open-label, phase 2 trial, eligible patients aged 18-75 years who had undergone complete (R0) resection of histologically or pathologically confirmed stage IIIA EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC and had not received any previous anticancer therapies were enrolled.Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either adjuvant erlotinib (150 mg once daily administered orally) or vinorelbine and cisplatin chemotherapy (four cycles of vinorelbine [25 mg/m(2) intravenously on days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle] plus cisplatin [75 mg/m(2) intravenously on day 1 of each 21-day cycle]).Randomisation was done by Simon's minimisation with a random element and was stratified by EGFR activating mutation type (exon 19 vs 21), histology (adenocarcinoma vs non-adenocarcinoma), and smoking status (smoker vs non-smoker).The primary endpoint in the unblinded intention-to-treat analysis was 2-year disease-free survival.This ongoing study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01683175.FINDINGS: Between Sept 8, 2012, and May 21, 2015, 102 patients from 16 centres across China were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive erlotinib (n=51) or chemotherapy (n=51).Median follow-up was 33.0 months (IQR 17.8-43.1).2-year disease-free survival was 81.4% (95% CI 69.6-93.1) in the erlotinib group and 44.6% (26.9-62.4) in the chemotherapy group (relative risk 1.823 [95% CI 1.194-2.784; p=0.0054).The difference in 2-year disease-free survival between the groups was 36.7% (95% CI 15.5-58.0; p=0.0007).Adverse events of any grade occurred in 29 (58%) of 50 patients in the erlotinib group and 28 (65%) of 43 patients in the chemotherapy group.Grade 3 or worse adverse events occurred in six (12%) of 50 patients in the erlotinib group versus 11 (26%) of 43 in the chemotherapy group; the most common of these in the erlotinib group was rash (in two [4%] of 50 patients) and in the chemotherapy group were decreased neutrophil count (in seven [16%] of 43 patients) and myelosuppression (in four [9%]).No treatment-related deaths were reported.INTERPRETATION: Adjuvant erlotinib improved 2-year disease-free survival in patients with EGFR mutation-positive stage IIIA NSCLC compared with chemotherapy, with a better tolerability profile.This study suggests that tyrosine kinase inhibitors could have a potentially important role as adjuvant therapy in EGFR mutation-positive stage IIIA NSCLC.However, this trial was a phase 2 study.Mature overall survival data are also needed.Ongoing studies will hopefully confirm the role of adjuvant EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy in patients with NSCLC.FUNDING: National Key Research and Development Program of China and Shanghai Roche Pharmaceuticals Ltd.",1,1,1,1
25228971,"The need for second-look endoscopy to prevent delayed bleeding after endoscopic submucosal dissection for gastric neoplasms: a prospective randomized trial.BACKGROUND/AIMS: Many authors recommend performing a second-look endoscopy (SLE) to reduce the frequency of delayed bleeding after endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for gastric neoplasms, but these recommendations have been made despite a lack of reliable evidence supporting the effectiveness of SLE.METHODS: From January 2012 to May 2013, we investigated 441 gastric neoplasms treated by ESD to assess the risk factors for delayed bleeding.Delayed bleeding occurred in four of these lesions within 1 postoperation day.Therefore, we enrolled the patients with the remaining 437 lesions to determine the utility of SLE performed on the morning of postoperative day 2.All lesions were randomly assigned to SLE (220 lesions) groups or non-SLE (217 lesions) groups.RESULTS: Delayed bleeding occurred in 18 lesions (4.1%).A large tumor size (>20 mm) was the only independent risk factor for delayed bleeding (p=0.007).The chance of delayed bleeding was not significantly different between the patients receiving a SLE (eight cases) and those patients not receiving a SLE (six cases, p=0.787).Furthermore, SLE for lesions with a large tumor size did not significantly decrease delayed bleeding (p=0.670).CONCLUSIONS: SLE had little or no influence on the prevention of delayed bleeding, irrespective of the risk factors.",0,0,0,0

32975708,"Randomized phase II clinical trial and biomarker analysis of paclitaxel plus epirubicin versus vinorelbine plus epirubicin as neoadjuvant chemotherapy in locally advanced HER2-negative breast cancer with TEKT4 variations.PURPOSE: Resistance to paclitaxel remains a major challenge in treating breast cancer.Our preclinical study suggested that TEKT4 germline variations in breast cancer are associated with paclitaxel resistance and increase vinorelbine sensitivity.This clinical trial compared the efficacy of paclitaxel and vinorelbine in breast cancer neoadjuvant chemotherapy.METHODS: In this open-label, single-center, phase II trial, female patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, stage IIB-IIIC breast cancer harboring TEKT4 germline variations were randomly assigned to the paclitaxel plus epirubicin (PE) or vinorelbine plus epirubicin (NE).The primary endpoint was the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate, and the secondary endpoints were the objective response rate (ORR) and safety.Targeted sequencing of a panel comprising 484 breast-related genes was performed to identify pCR-associated somatic mutations in each group.RESULTS: 91 Patients were assigned to PE (46 patients) or NE (45 patients).NE numerically increased the pCR rate (22.2% versus 8.7%, P = 0.074).The ORRs for NE and PE were 82.2% and 76.1%, respectively.Interestingly, NE (15.4%) showed a significantly higher pCR rate than PE (0%) in the hormone receptor (HR)-positive subgroup (P = 0.044).Both regimens were well tolerated, with grade 3 and 4 toxicities reported at the expected levels.The biomarker analysis showed that UNC13D mutation predicted the pCR rate in NE (P = 0.011).CONCLUSIONS: Although the primary endpoint was not met, NE might bring clinical benefit to HR-positive patients or patients simultaneously carrying UNC13D mutations.",1,1,1,1
25213161,"Randomized phase III trial of regorafenib in metastatic colorectal cancer: analysis of the CORRECT Japanese and non-Japanese subpopulations.BACKGROUND: In the international, phase III, randomized, double-blind CORRECT trial, regorafenib significantly prolonged overall survival (OS) versus placebo in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) that had progressed on all standard therapies.This post hoc analysis evaluated the efficacy and safety of regorafenib in Japanese and non-Japanese subpopulations in the CORRECT trial.METHODS: Patients were randomized 2 : 1 to regorafenib 160 mg once daily or placebo for weeks 1-3 of each 4-week cycle.The primary endpoint was OS.Outcomes were assessed using descriptive statistics.RESULTS: One hundred Japanese and 660 non-Japanese patients were randomized to regorafenib (n = 67 and n = 438) or placebo (n = 33 and n = 222).Regorafenib had a consistent OS benefit in the Japanese and non-Japanese subpopulations, with hazard ratios of 0.81 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.43-1.51) and 0.77 (95 % CI 0.62-0.94), respectively.Regorafenib-associated hand-foot skin reaction, hypertension, proteinuria, thrombocytopenia, and lipase elevations occurred more frequently in the Japanese subpopulation than in the non-Japanese subpopulation, but were generally manageable.CONCLUSION: Regorafenib appears to have comparable efficacy in Japanese and non-Japanese subpopulations, with a manageable adverse-event profile, suggesting that this agent could potentially become a standard of care in patients with mCRC.",0,0,0,0
34543613,"Extended therapy with letrozole as adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal patients with early-stage breast cancer: a multicentre, open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: The benefit of extending aromatase inhibitor therapy beyond 5 years in the context of previous aromatase inhibitors remains controversial.We aimed to compare extended therapy with letrozole for 5 years versus the standard duration of 2-3 years of letrozole in postmenopausal patients with breast cancer who have already received 2-3 years of tamoxifen.METHODS: This multicentre, open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial was done at 69 hospitals in Italy.Women were eligible if they were postmenopausal at the time of study entry, had stage I-III histologically proven and operable invasive hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, had received adjuvant tamoxifen therapy for at least 2 years but no longer than 3 years and 3 months, had no signs of disease recurrence, and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 or lower.Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 2-3 years (control group) or 5 years (extended group) of letrozole (2.5 mg orally once a day).Randomisation, with stratification by centre, with permuted blocks of size 12, was done with a centralised, interactive, internet-based system that randomly generated the treatment allocation.Participants and investigators were not masked to treatment assignment.The primary endpoint was invasive disease-free survival in the intention-to-treat population.Safety analysis was done for patients who received at least 1 month of study treatment.This trial was registered with EudraCT, 2005-001212-44, and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01064635.FINDINGS: Between Aug 1, 2005, and Oct 24, 2010, 2056 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive letrozole for 2-3 years (n=1030; control group) or for 5 years (n=1026; extended group).After a median follow-up of 11.7 years (IQR 9.5-13.1), disease-free survival events occurred in 262 (25.4%) of 1030 patients in the control group and 212 (20.7%) of 1026 in the extended group.12-year disease-free survival was 62% (95% CI 57-66) in the control group and 67% (62-71) in the extended group (hazard ratio 0.78, 95% CI 0.65-0.93; p=0.0064).The most common grade 3 and 4 adverse events were arthralgia (22 [2.2%] of 983 patients in the control group vs 29 [3.0%] of 977 in the extended group) and myalgia (seven [0.7%] vs nine [0.9%]).There were three (0.3%) serious treatment-related adverse events in the control group and eight (0.8%) in the extended group.No deaths related to toxic effects were observed.INTERPRETATION: In postmenopausal patients with breast cancer who received 2-3 years of tamoxifen, extended treatment with 5 years of letrozole resulted in a significant improvement in disease-free survival compared with the standard 2-3 years of letrozole.Sequential endocrine therapy with tamoxifen for 2-3 years followed by letrozole for 5 years should be considered as one of the optimal standard endocrine treatments for postmenopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.FUNDING: Novartis and the Italian Ministry of Health.TRANSLATION: For the Italian translation of the abstract see Supplementary Materials section.",1,1,1,1
29346040,"Bevacizumab Maintenance Versus No Maintenance During Chemotherapy-Free Intervals in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer: A Randomized Phase III Trial (PRODIGE 9).Purpose Conflicting results are reported for maintenance treatment with bevacizumab during chemotherapy-free intervals (CFI) in metastatic colorectal cancer after induction chemotherapy.Patients and Methods In this open-label, phase III, randomized controlled trial, we compared the tumor control duration (TCD) observed with bevacizumab maintenance and with no treatment (observation) during CFI subsequent to induction chemotherapy with 12 cycles of fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan plus bevacizumab.After disease progression, the induction regimen was repeated for eight cycles, followed by a new CFI.Results From March 2010 to July 2013, 491 patients were randomly assigned.Disease progression or death occurred during induction chemotherapy in 85 patients (17%); 261 patients (53%) had at least one reinduction, 107 (22%) had two reinductions, and 56 (11%) had three or more reinductions.The median TCD was 15 months in both groups; the median progression-free survival (PFS) from randomization was 9.2 and 8.9 months in the maintenance group and observation groups, respectively.The TCD observed in both groups was higher compared with the TCD hypotheses of the trial.The median overall survival (OS) was 21.7 and 22.0 months in the maintenance and observation groups, respectively.In the per-protocol population, defined as patients with at least one reinduction after the first progression, the median duration of the first CFI was 4.3 months in both arms; the median TCD was 17.8 and 23.3 months ( P = .339), the median PFS was 9.9 and 9.5 months, and the median OS was 27.6 and 28.5 months in the maintenance and observation groups, respectively.Multivariable analysis revealed that female gender, WHO performance status >/= 2, and unresected primary tumors were associated with a shorter TCD.Conclusion Bevacizumab maintenance monotherapy did not improve TCD, CFI duration, PFS, or OS.",1,1,1,0
31924736,"Radiological Evaluation of Newly Diagnosed Non-Brainstem Pediatric High-Grade Glioma in the HERBY Phase II Trial.PURPOSE: The HERBY trial evaluated the benefit of the addition of the antiangiogenic agent Bevacizumab (BEV) to radiotherapy/temozolomide (RT/TMZ) in pediatric patients with newly diagnosed non-brainstem high-grade glioma (HGG).The work presented here aims to correlate imaging characteristics and outcome measures with pathologic and molecular data.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Radiological, pathologic, and molecular data were correlated with trial clinical information to retrospectively re-evaluate event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS).RESULTS: One-hundred thirteen patients were randomized to the RT/TMZ arm (n = 54) or the RT/TMZ+BEV (BEV arm; n = 59).The tumor arose in the cerebral hemispheres in 68 patients (Cerebral group) and a midline location in 45 cases (Midline group).Pathologic diagnosis was available in all cases and molecular data in 86 of 113.H3 K27M histone mutations were present in 23 of 32 Midline cases and H3 G34R/V mutations in 7 of 54 Cerebral cases.Total/near-total resection occurred in 44 of 68 (65%) Cerebral cases but in only 5 of 45 (11%) Midline cases (P < 0.05).Leptomeningeal metastases (27 cases, 13 with subependymal spread) at relapse were more frequent in Midline (17/45) than in Cerebral tumors (10/68, P < 0.05).Mean OS (14.1 months) and EFS (9.0 months) in Midline tumors were significantly lower than mean OS (20.7 months) and EFS (14.9 months) in Cerebral tumors (P < 0.05).Pseudoprogression occurred in 8 of 111 (6.2%) cases.CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown that the poor outcome of midline tumors (compared with cerebral) may be related to (1) lesser surgical resection, (2) H3 K27M histone mutations, and (3) higher leptomeningeal dissemination.",0,0,0,0

30753262,"Randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating oral glutamine on radiation-induced oral mucositis and dermatitis in head and neck cancer patients.BACKGROUND: Glutamine is the primary fuel for the gastrointestinal epithelium and maintains the mucosal structure.Oncologists frequently encounter oral mucositis, which can cause unplanned breaks in radiotherapy (RT).OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to explore the association between oral glutamine and acute toxicities in patients with head and neck cancer undergoing RT.METHODS: This was a parallel, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase III trial conducted in a university hospital.A central randomization center used computer-generated tables to allocate interventions to 71 patients with stages I-IV head and neck cancers.The patients, care providers, and investigators were blinded to the group assignment.Eligible patients received either oral glutamine (5 g glutamine and 10 g maltodextrin) or placebo (15 g maltodextrin) 3 times daily from 7 d before RT to 14 d after RT.The primary and secondary endpoints were radiation-induced oral mucositis and neck dermatitis, respectively.These were documented in agreement with the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.RESULTS: The study included 64 patients (placebo n = 33; glutamine n = 31) who completed RT for the completers' analysis.Based on multivariate analysis, glutamine had no significant effect on the severity of oral mucositis (OR: 0.3; 95% CI: 0.05, 1.67; P = 0.169).Only the change in body mass index (BMI) was significant in both multivariate completers (OR: 0.41; 95% CI: 0.20, 0.84; P = 0.015) and per-protocol analysis (OR: 0.40; 95% CI: 0.20, 0.83; P = 0.014).No difference was found in the incidence and severity of neck dermatitis between the two arms.CONCLUSIONS: The decrease in BMI was strongly related to the severity of oral mucositis in the head and neck cancer patients under RT, but not to the use of glutamine.This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03015077.",0,0,0,0
32469095,"Drug cost savings in phase III hematological oncology clinical trials in a university hospital.The rapid emergence of expensive anticancer therapies is leading to exponential growth in healthcare expenses.In clinical trials, most investigational drugs are provided free of charge by industrial and academic sponsors.This results in drug cost savings for healthcare payers, who are no longer charged with the cost of the standard-of-care treatment, which would have been administered outside the trial.This study aims to estimate drug cost savings resulting from patient enrolment in hematological oncology clinical trials, from a public payer perspective.Retrospective screening identified all patients with hematological malignancies included from 2011 to 2016 in a phase III trial and having received at least one sponsor-provided cycle.Drug cost savings were defined as the standard treatment costs not charged to the payer due to sponsor provision of treatment.For each patient, cost savings were determined by the number of cycles received in the trial and the cost of standard (control arm) treatment.Of the 345 patients included in eligible trials during study period, 272 received sponsor-provided drugs.Drug cost savings could be estimated for 177 patients (65.1%) included in 27 trials.Total cost savings were euro5218 million (US$ 6804 million) for 1720 sponsor-provided cycles.Mean cost saving per patient was euro19 182.7 +/-29 865.7 ($25 015.24 +/- 39 478.25).Most cost-saving trials were industry-sponsored (77.8%), although academic trials generated 40.15% of total cost savings.Enrolling patients in clinical trials, whether industry-sponsored or academic, leads to substantial drug cost savings for payers.Implications are significant for public payers facing increasing financial constraints, as savings can be reallocated to patient care.",0,0,0,0

30975219,"Re-endothelialisation after Synergy stent and Absorb bioresorbable vascular scaffold implantation in acute myocardial infarction: COVER-AMI study.BACKGROUND/AIMS: Drug eluting stent (DES) decrease the risk of restenosis by reducing the neointimal response.However, DES may impair strut coverage, and this has been associated with late stent/scaffold thrombosis.Bioresorbable vascular scaffold (BVS) may overcome the risk of stent/scaffold thrombosis when completely resorbed.The purpose of this randomised trial was to compare the arterial healing response in the short term, as a surrogate for safety and efficacy, between the metallic everolimus-eluting stent (Synergy; Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA, USA) and the everolimus BVS (Absorb; Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, CA, USA) in the particular setting of acute myocardial infarction (AMI).This pilot study sought to compare the neointimal response of metallic everolimus DES (Synergy) with polymeric everolimus BVS (Absorb) by optical coherence tomography (OCT) 3 months after an AMI.METHODS: COVER-AMI was a single-centre, single-blind, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial.Patients with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) who underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention were randomly allocated (1:1) to treatment with the Synergy DES or Absorb BVS.The primary endpoint was the 3-month neointimal response assessed as the percentage of uncovered struts, neointimal thickness, in-stent/scaffold area obstruction, and pattern of neointima.The main secondary endpoint included the device-oriented composite endpoint according to the Academic Research Consortium definition.RESULTS: Twenty patients without clinical and/or angiographic complications (Synergy (n = 10) or BVS (n = 10); mean age 59.0 years; 20% female) were enrolled in our centre.The stent diameter was higher in the Synergy group (3.7 +/- 0.4 mm vs 3.4 +/- 0.4 mm in the BVS group, p = 0.01).At 3 months, no significant differences in angiographic lumen loss were observed between the everolimus DES and everolimus BVS (0.04 mm (IQR 0.00-0.07) vs 0.11 mm (IQR 0.04-0.31), p = 0.165).OCT analysis of 420 cross-sections showed that the total neointimal area and in-stent obstruction were lower in the Synergy group, while OCT analysis at the strut level (n = 3942 struts) showed that the rate of uncovered struts was lower in the BVS group.CONCLUSIONS: Stenting of culprit lesions in the setting of STEMI resulted in a nearly complete arterial healing for both the Synergy and the BVS devices.Lower neointimal thickness and in-stent obstruction but a higher rate of uncovered struts were observed in the Synergy group.These findings provide the basis for further exploration in clinically oriented outcome trials.",0,0,0,0
29852043,"Effect of Adjuvant Trastuzumab for a Duration of 9 Weeks vs 1 Year With Concomitant Chemotherapy for Early Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2-Positive Breast Cancer: The SOLD Randomized Clinical Trial.Importance: Trastuzumab plus chemotherapy is the standard adjuvant treatment for patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive early breast cancer.While the standard duration of trastuzumab treatment is 12 months, the benefits and harms of trastuzumab continued beyond the chemotherapy are unclear.Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of adjuvant trastuzumab continued beyond chemotherapy in women treated with up-front chemotherapy containing a taxane and trastuzumab.Design, Setting, and Participants: Open-label, randomized (1:1) clinical trial including women with HER2-positive breast cancer.Chemotherapy was identical in the 2 groups, consisting of 3 cycles of 3-weekly docetaxel (either 80 or 100 mg/m2) plus trastuzumab for 9 weeks, followed by 3 cycles of fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide.Thereafter, no trastuzumab was administered in the 9-week group, whereas controls received trastuzumab to complete 1 year of administration.Disease-free survival (DFS) was compared between the groups using a Cox model and the noninferiority approach.The estimated sample size was 2168 patients (1-sided testing, with a relative noninferiority margin of 1.3).From January 3, 2008, to December 16, 2014, 2176 patients were accrued from 7 countries.Intervention: Docetaxel plus trastuzumab for 9 weeks, followed by 3 cycles of fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide in both groups.Controls continued trastuzumab to 1 year.Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary objective was DFS; secondary objectives included distant disease-free survival, overall survival, cardiac DFS, and safety.Results: In the 2174 women analyzed, median age was 56 (interquartile range [IQR], 48-64) years.The median follow-up was 5.2 (IQR, 3.8-6.7) years.Noninferiority of the 9-week treatment could not be demonstrated for DFS (hazard ratio, 1.39; 2-sided 90% CI, 1.12-1.72).Distant disease-free survival and overall survival did not differ substantially between the groups.Thirty-six (3%) and 21 (2%) patients in the 1-year and the 9-week groups, respectively, had cardiac failure; the left ventricle ejection fraction was better maintained in the 9-week group.An interaction was detected between the docetaxel dose and DFS; patients in the 9-week group treated with 80 mg/m2 had inferior and those treated with 100 mg/m2 had similar DFS as patients in the 1-year group.Conclusions and Relevance: Nine weeks of trastuzumab was not noninferior to 1 year of trastuzumab when given with similar chemotherapy.Cardiac safety was better in the 9-week group.The docetaxel dosing with trastuzumab requires further study.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00593697.",1,1,1,1
22503396,"Risk factors to predict the incidence of surgical adverse events following open or laparoscopic surgery for apparent early stage endometrial cancer: results from a randomised controlled trial.AIMS: To identify risk factors for major adverse events (AEs) and to develop a nomogram to predict the probability of such AEs in patients who have surgery for apparent early stage endometrial cancer.METHODS: We used data from 753 patients who were randomised to either total laparoscopic hysterectomy or total abdominal hysterectomy in the LACE trial.Serious adverse events that prolonged hospital stay or postoperative adverse events (using common terminology criteria 3+, CTCAE V3) were considered major AEs.We analysed pre-surgical characteristics that were associated with the risk of developing major AEs by multivariate logistic regression.We identified a parsimonious model by backward stepwise logistic regression.The six most significant or clinically important variables were included in the nomogram to predict the risk of major AEs within 6weeks of surgery and the nomogram was internally validated.RESULTS: Overall, 132 (17.5%) patients had at least one major AE.An open surgical approach (laparotomy), higher Charlson's medical co-morbidities score, moderately differentiated tumours on curettings, higher baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score, higher body mass index and low haemoglobin levels were associated with AE and were used in the nomogram.The bootstrap corrected concordance index of the nomogram was 0.63 and it showed good calibration.CONCLUSIONS: Six pre-surgical factors independently predicted the risk of major AEs.This research might form the basis to develop risk reduction strategies to minimise the risk of AEs among patients undergoing surgery for apparent early stage endometrial cancer.",0,0,0,0

23127215,"Associations of soluble fiber, whole fruits/vegetables, and juice with plasma Beta-carotene concentrations in a free-living population of breast cancer survivors.OBJECTIVE: Soluble fiber and the physical state of fruits/vegetables affect plasma ss-carotene concentrations; however, most of this research was conducted in laboratory-based settings.These analyses investigated the relationship between soluble fiber and juiced versus whole fruits/vegetables to plasma ss-carotene concentrations in a free-living population.METHOD: This cross-sectional analysis used 12-month follow-up data from the Women's Healthy Eating & Living Study (1995-2006), a study to improve diet in breast cancer survivors in the Western United States.The dietary nutrients considered in this analysis included intake of soluble fiber (g), ss-carotene from fruit/vegetable juice (mg), and ss-carotene from whole fruits/vegetables (mg).A linear regression model was used to assess the relationship of the variables to plasma ss-carotene concentrations.RESULTS: Out of 3,088 women enrolled in the Women's Healthy Eating & Living Study, 2,397 women had complete data (mean age = 54).The final model accounted for approximately 49% of the explained variance in plasma ss-carotene concentrations.Fruit/vegetable juice had the largest positive relation to plasma ss-carotene concentrations (standardized parameter estimate = 0.23, p < 0.01), followed by whole fruits/vegetables (standardized parameter estimate = 0.09, p < 0.01).CONCLUSION: Soluble fiber may inhibit ss-carotene absorption; therefore, consumption of juice may increase plasma ss-carotene concentrations more than whole fruits/vegetables in free-living populations.",0,0,0,0
22104618,"Does health-related quality of life improve for advanced pancreatic cancer patients who respond to gemcitabine? Analysis of a randomized phase III trial of the cancer and leukemia group B (CALGB 80303).CONTEXT: Gemcitabine for advanced pancreatic cancer (APC) is palliative and the prognosis is poor, making health-related quality of life (HRQOL) particularly important.OBJECTIVES: We evaluated HRQOL with the EuroQol (EQ-5D) in patients with APC participating in Cancer and Leukemia Group B 80303, a multicenter, double-blind, randomized trial comparing overall survival (OS) between two treatment arms: gemcitabine with bevacizumab or gemcitabine with placebo.METHODS: A consecutive subsample of patients was invited to complete the EQ-5D surveys.Because neither clinical nor HRQOL outcomes differed based on the study arm, analyses were pooled.Changes in mean scores from baseline to eight weeks and the prognostic value of the EQ-5D were evaluated.RESULTS: Mean index scores remained stable (0.78 at baseline [n=267], 0.79 at eight weeks [n=186], P=0.34, Wilcoxon signed rank test), attributable to a modest deterioration of physical function domain scores coincident with small improvements in pain and anxiety/depression scores.A small decline in visual analogue scale scores was observed (70.7 vs. 68.2, P=0.026).HRQOL changes within chemotherapy response strata revealed stable index scores but a trend of worsened physical function among patients with disease progression compared with those with stable or improved disease.Visual analogue scale scores trended downward over time irrespective of chemotherapy response status, with a statistically meaningful deterioration in patients who progressed (68.9 vs. 64.4, P=0.029).Baseline scores from both EQ-5D scales were significant predictors of OS in Cox proportional hazard models.CONCLUSION: Response to gemcitabine treatment in APC is not associated with appreciable improvement of global HRQOL.Small improvements in pain and mood are observed despite progressive functional decline.Those who respond to gemcitabine may experience a slight slowing of functional deterioration.",0,0,0,0

27085323,"nab-Paclitaxel Plus Gemcitabine Versus Gemcitabine in Patients with Metastatic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma: Canadian Subgroup Analysis of the Phase 3 MPACT Trial.INTRODUCTION: The phase III MPACT trial in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer (MPC) demonstrated superior efficacy of nab-paclitaxel (nab-P) plus gemcitabine (Gem) compared with Gem monotherapy, including the primary endpoint of overall survival (OS; median 8.7 vs. 6.6 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.72; P < 0.001).A significant treatment difference favoring nab-P + Gem over Gem was observed for OS in patients treated in North America.The majority of patients were from the US (88%) with only 12% from Canada.Healthcare systems and treatment patterns are different between the 2 countries, and there is limited published information on outcomes of Canadian patients treated with first-line nab-P + Gem.This analysis evaluated efficacy and safety outcomes in Canadian patients in the MPACT trial.METHODS: Treatment-naive patients with MPC (N = 861) received either nab-P 125 mg/m(2) + Gem 1000 mg/m(2) on days 1, 8, and 15 every 4 weeks or Gem 1000 mg/m(2) weekly for the first 7 of 8 weeks (cycle 1) and then on days 1, 8, and 15 every 4 weeks (cycle >/=2).RESULTS: The MPACT trial enrolled 63 patients in Canada.Baseline characteristics were well balanced and comparable with those of the intent-to-treat population.Both OS (median 11.9 vs. 7.1 months; HR 0.76; P = 0.373) and progression-free survival (median 7.2 vs. 5.2 months; HR 0.65; P = 0.224) were numerically longer and overall response rate (27% vs. 17%; P = 0.312)was numerically higher with nab-P + Gem vs. Gem.The most common grade >/=3 adverse events with nab-P + Gem vs. Gem were neutropenia (22% vs. 10%), fatigue (34% vs. 33%), and neuropathy (25% vs. 0%).CONCLUSION: This subanalysis confirmed that nab-P + Gem is an efficacious treatment option and has a manageable safety profile in patients with MPC treated in Canada.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT00844649.FUNDING: Celgene Corporation, Summit, NJ, USA.",0,0,0,0
34543613,"Extended therapy with letrozole as adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal patients with early-stage breast cancer: a multicentre, open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: The benefit of extending aromatase inhibitor therapy beyond 5 years in the context of previous aromatase inhibitors remains controversial.We aimed to compare extended therapy with letrozole for 5 years versus the standard duration of 2-3 years of letrozole in postmenopausal patients with breast cancer who have already received 2-3 years of tamoxifen.METHODS: This multicentre, open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial was done at 69 hospitals in Italy.Women were eligible if they were postmenopausal at the time of study entry, had stage I-III histologically proven and operable invasive hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, had received adjuvant tamoxifen therapy for at least 2 years but no longer than 3 years and 3 months, had no signs of disease recurrence, and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 or lower.Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 2-3 years (control group) or 5 years (extended group) of letrozole (2.5 mg orally once a day).Randomisation, with stratification by centre, with permuted blocks of size 12, was done with a centralised, interactive, internet-based system that randomly generated the treatment allocation.Participants and investigators were not masked to treatment assignment.The primary endpoint was invasive disease-free survival in the intention-to-treat population.Safety analysis was done for patients who received at least 1 month of study treatment.This trial was registered with EudraCT, 2005-001212-44, and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01064635.FINDINGS: Between Aug 1, 2005, and Oct 24, 2010, 2056 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive letrozole for 2-3 years (n=1030; control group) or for 5 years (n=1026; extended group).After a median follow-up of 11.7 years (IQR 9.5-13.1), disease-free survival events occurred in 262 (25.4%) of 1030 patients in the control group and 212 (20.7%) of 1026 in the extended group.12-year disease-free survival was 62% (95% CI 57-66) in the control group and 67% (62-71) in the extended group (hazard ratio 0.78, 95% CI 0.65-0.93; p=0.0064).The most common grade 3 and 4 adverse events were arthralgia (22 [2.2%] of 983 patients in the control group vs 29 [3.0%] of 977 in the extended group) and myalgia (seven [0.7%] vs nine [0.9%]).There were three (0.3%) serious treatment-related adverse events in the control group and eight (0.8%) in the extended group.No deaths related to toxic effects were observed.INTERPRETATION: In postmenopausal patients with breast cancer who received 2-3 years of tamoxifen, extended treatment with 5 years of letrozole resulted in a significant improvement in disease-free survival compared with the standard 2-3 years of letrozole.Sequential endocrine therapy with tamoxifen for 2-3 years followed by letrozole for 5 years should be considered as one of the optimal standard endocrine treatments for postmenopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.FUNDING: Novartis and the Italian Ministry of Health.TRANSLATION: For the Italian translation of the abstract see Supplementary Materials section.",1,1,1,1
33460574,"Palbociclib with adjuvant endocrine therapy in early breast cancer (PALLAS): interim analysis of a multicentre, open-label, randomised, phase 3 study.BACKGROUND: Palbociclib added to endocrine therapy improves progression-free survival in hormone-receptor-positive, HER2-negative, metastatic breast cancer.The PALLAS trial aimed to investigate whether the addition of 2 years of palbociclib to adjuvant endocrine therapy improves invasive disease-free survival over endocrine therapy alone in patients with hormone-receptor-positive, HER2-negative, early-stage breast cancer.METHODS: PALLAS is an ongoing multicentre, open-label, randomised, phase 3 study that enrolled patients at 406 cancer centres in 21 countries worldwide with stage II-III histologically confirmed hormone-receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer, within 12 months of initial diagnosis.Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score of 0 or 1.Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) in permuted blocks of random size (4 or 6), stratified by anatomic stage, previous chemotherapy, age, and geographical region, by use of central telephone-based and web-based interactive response technology, to receive either 2 years of palbociclib (125 mg orally once daily on days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle) with ongoing standard provider or patient-choice adjuvant endocrine therapy (tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitor, with or without concurrent luteinising hormone-releasing hormone agonist), or endocrine therapy alone, without masking.The primary endpoint of the study was invasive disease-free survival in the intention-to-treat population.Safety was assessed in all randomly assigned patients who started palbociclib or endocrine therapy.This report presents results from the second pre-planned interim analysis triggered on Jan 9, 2020, when 67% of the total number of expected invasive disease-free survival events had been observed.The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02513394) and EudraCT (2014-005181-30).FINDINGS: Between Sept 1, 2015, and Nov 30, 2018, 5760 patients were randomly assigned to receive palbociclib plus endocrine therapy (n=2883) or endocrine therapy alone (n=2877).At the time of the planned second interim analysis, at a median follow-up of 23.7 months (IQR 16.9-29.2), 170 of 2883 patients assigned to palbociclib plus endocrine therapy and 181 of 2877 assigned to endocrine therapy alone had invasive disease-free survival events.3-year invasive disease-free survival was 88.2% (95% CI 85.2-90.6) for palbociclib plus endocrine therapy and 88.5% (85.8-90.7) for endocrine therapy alone (hazard ratio 0.93 [95% CI 0.76-1.15]; log-rank p=0.51).As the test statistic comparing invasive disease-free survival between groups crossed the prespecified futility boundary, the independent data monitoring committee recommended discontinuation of palbociclib in patients still receiving palbociclib and endocrine therapy.The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were neutropenia (1742 [61.3%] of 2840 patients on palbociclib and endocrine therapy vs 11 [0.3%] of 2903 on endocrine therapy alone), leucopenia (857 [30.2%] vs three [0.1%]), and fatigue (60 [2.1%] vs ten [0.3%]).Serious adverse events occurred in 351 (12.4%) of 2840 patients on palbociclib plus endocrine therapy versus 220 (7.6%) of 2903 patients on endocrine therapy alone.There were no treatment-related deaths.INTERPRETATION: At the planned second interim analysis, addition of 2 years of adjuvant palbociclib to adjuvant endocrine therapy did not improve invasive disease-free survival compared with adjuvant endocrine therapy alone.On the basis of these findings, this regimen cannot be recommended in the adjuvant setting.Long-term follow-up of the PALLAS population and correlative studies are ongoing.FUNDING: Pfizer.",1,1,1,1

28109543,"The risk of cancer in kidney transplant recipients may be reduced in those maintained on everolimus and reduced cyclosporine.Kidney transplant recipients are at a high risk of developing cancers after transplantation.Switching from calcineurin inhibitors to sirolimus has been shown to prevent secondary nonmelanoma skin cancer but whether everolimus with reduced exposure to calcineurin inhibitors has similar anti-cancer effects remains unknown.Therefore, we compared the risk of incident cancer over seven years of follow-up among kidney transplant recipients randomized to everolimus plus reduced exposure cyclosporine versus mycophenolate sodium and standard exposure cyclosporine.Using the Australian and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry (ANZDATA), we assessed the seven-year risk of incident cancer and other graft outcomes among a subgroup of recipients who had participated in the A2309 study using adjusted Cox proportional hazard models.Of 95 recipients, 66 were randomized to everolimus (1.5 mg or 3 mg) with reduced cyclosporine and 29 received mycophenolate sodium and standard exposure cyclosporine.Compared to mycophenolate sodium and standard exposure cyclosporine, everolimus treatment was associated with unadjusted hazard ratios of 0.28 (95% confidence interval 0.11-0.74), 0.39 (0.16-0.98) and 0.41 (0.23-0.71), respectively for nonmelanoma skin cancer, non-skin cancers and any cancers.Interestingly, the adjusted hazard ratios were 0.34 (0.13-0.91), 0.35 (0.09-1.25) and 0.32 (0.15-0.71), respectively.There was no association between treatment groups and rejection, graft loss or death.Compared to standard-exposure cyclosporine, everolimus with reduced exposure to cyclosporine may be associated with a reduced risk of cancer, particularly for non-melanoma skin cancer.Thus, if confirmed in larger patient cohorts, de novo use of everolimus with reduced exposure to calcineurin inhibitors may enable a reduction in cancer burden after transplantation.",0,0,0,0
32234755,"A Randomized, Open-label, Presurgical, Window-of-Opportunity Study Comparing the Pharmacodynamic Effects of the Novel Oral SERD AZD9496 with Fulvestrant in Patients with Newly Diagnosed ER(+) HER2(-) Primary Breast Cancer.PURPOSE: Fulvestrant, the first-in-class selective estrogen receptor (ER) degrader (SERD), is clinically effective in patients with ER(+) breast cancer, but it has administration and pharmacokinetic limitations.Pharmacodynamic data suggest complete ER degradation is not achieved at fulvestrant's clinically feasible dose.This presurgical study (NCT03236974) compared the pharmacodynamic effects of fulvestrant with AZD9496, a novel, orally bioavailable, nonsteroidal, potent SERD, in treatment-naive patients with ER(+) HER2(-) primary breast cancer awaiting curative intent surgery.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive AZD9496 250 mg twice daily from day 1 for 5-14 days, or fulvestrant 500 mg on day 1.On-treatment imaging-guided core tumor biopsies were taken between day 5 and 14 and compared with pretreatment diagnostic biopsies.The primary objective was to compare the effects of AZD9496 and fulvestrant on ER expression.Secondary objectives included changes in progesterone receptor (PR) and Ki-67 pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships and safety.RESULTS: Forty-six women received treatment (AZD9496 n = 22; fulvestrant n = 24); 35 paired biopsies were evaluable (AZD9496 n = 15; fulvestrant n = 20).The least square mean estimate for ER H-score reduction was 24% after AZD9496 versus 36% after fulvestrant treatment (P = 0.86).AZD9496 also reduced PR H-scores (-33.3%) and Ki-67 levels (-39.9%) from baseline, but was also not superior to fulvestrant (PR: -68.7%, P = 0.97; Ki-67: -75.4%, P = 0.98).No new safety findings were identified.CONCLUSIONS: This was the first presurgical study to demonstrate that an oral SERD affects its key biological targets.However, AZD9496 was not superior to fulvestrant at the dose tested.",1,1,1,1
23234763,"Adjuvant lapatinib for women with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer: a randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Worldwide, many patients with HER2-positive early stage breast cancer do not receive trastuzumab-the standard adjuvant treatment.We investigated the efficacy and safety of adjuvant lapatinib for patients with trastuzumab-naive HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer, started at any time after diagnosis.METHODS: This study was a placebo-controlled, multicentre, randomised phase 3 trial.Women outpatients from 405 [corrected] centres in 33 countries [corrected] with HER2-positive early-breast cancer who had previously received adjuvant chemotherapy but not trastuzumab were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive daily lapatinib (1500 mg) or daily placebo for 12 months.Randomisation was done with a computer-generated sequence, stratified by time since diagnosis, lymph node involvement at diagnosis, and tumour hormone-receptor status.Investigators, site staff, and patients were masked to treatment assignment.The primary endpoint was disease-free survival in the intention-to-treat population.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00374322.FINDINGS: Between August, 2006, and May, 2008, 3161 women were enrolled and 3147 were assigned to lapatinib (n=1571) or placebo (n=1576).After a median follow-up of 47.4 months (range 0.4-60.0) in the lapatinib group and 48.3 (0.7-61.3) in the placebo group, 210 (13%) disease-free survival events had occurred in the lapatinib group versus 264 (17%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.83, 95% CI 0.70-1.00; p=0.053).Central review of HER2 status showed that only 2490 (79%) of the randomised women were HER2-positive.157 (13%) of 1230 confirmed HER2-positive patients in the lapatinib group and in 208 (17%) of 1260 in the placebo group had a disease-free survival event (HR 0.82, 95% 0.67-1.00; p=0.04).Serious adverse events occurred in 99 (6%) of 1573 patients taking lapatinib and 77 (5%) of 1574 patients taking placebo, with higher incidences of grade 3-4 diarrhoea (97 [6%] vs nine [<1%]), rash (72 [5%] vs three [<1%]), and hepatobiliary disorders (36 [2%] vs one [<1%]).INTERPRETATION: Our data show that there was no significant difference in disease-free survival between groups when analysed in the intention-to-treat population.However, exploratory analyses restricted to patients who had HER2-positive disease confirmed by central fluorescence in-situ hybridisation review suggested marginal benefit with lapatinib in terms of disease-free survival.Thus lapatinib might be an option for women with HER2-positive breast cancer who do not or cannot receive adjuvant trastuzumab.FUNDING: GlaxoSmithKline.",1,1,1,1
28796885,"Photodynamic therapy is more effective than imiquimod for actinic keratosis in organ transplant recipients: a randomized intraindividual controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Actinic keratoses (AKs) in solid organ transplant recipients (OTRs) are difficult-to-treat premalignancies and comparison of topical therapies is therefore warranted.OBJECTIVES: In an intraindividual study to compare the efficacy and safety of field treatment with methyl aminolaevulinate photodynamic therapy (MAL-PDT) and imiquimod (IMIQ) for AKs in OTRs.METHODS: OTRs (n = 35) with 572 AKs (grade I-III) in two similar areas on the face, scalp, dorsal hands or forearms were included.All patients received one MAL-PDT and one IMIQ session (three applications per week for 4 weeks) in each study area according to randomization.Treatments were repeated after 2 months (IMIQ) and 3 months (PDT) in skin with incomplete AK response.Outcome measures were complete lesion response (CR), skin reactions, laboratory results and treatment preference.RESULTS: The majority of study areas received two treatment sessions (PDT n = 25 patients; IMIQ n = 29 patients).At 3 months after two treatments, skin treated with PDT achieved a higher rate of CR (AK I-III median 78%; range 50-100) compared with IMIQ-treated skin areas (median 61%, range 33-100; P < 0.001).Fewer emergent AKs were seen in PDT-treated skin vs. IMIQ-treated skin (0.7 vs. 1.5 AKs, P = 0.04).Patients developed more intense inflammatory skin reactions following PDT, which resolved more rapidly compared with IMIQ (median 10 days vs. 18 days, P < 0.01).Patient preference (P = 0.47) and cosmesis (P > 0.30) were similar for PDT and IMIQ.CONCLUSIONS: Compared with IMIQ, PDT treatment obtained a higher rate of AK clearance at 3-month follow-up and achieved shorter-lasting, but more intense, short-term skin reactions.",0,0,0,0
26643072,"A web-based intervention (RESTORE) to support self-management of cancer-related fatigue following primary cancer treatment: a multi-centre proof of concept randomised controlled trial.PURPOSE: Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is a frequent and distressing symptom experienced after cancer treatment.RESTORE is the first web-based resource designed to enhance self-efficacy to manage CRF following curative-intent treatment.The aim of this study is to test the proof of concept and inform the design of an effectiveness trial.METHODS: A multi-centre parallel-group two-armed (1:1) exploratory randomised controlled trial (RCT) with qualitative process evaluation was employed in the study.Participants (>/=18 years; </=5 years post treatment with moderate to severe fatigue) were recruited and randomly assigned to RESTORE or a leaflet.Feasibility and acceptability were measured by recruitment, attrition, intervention adherence, completion of outcome measures and process evaluation.Change in self-efficacy to manage CRF was also explored.Outcome measures were completed at baseline (T0), 6 weeks (T1) and 12 weeks (T2).Data were analysed using mixed-effects linear regression and directed content analysis.RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-three people participated in the trial and 19 in the process evaluation.The intervention was feasible (39 % of eligible patients consented) and acceptable (attrition rate 36 %).There was evidence of higher fatigue self-efficacy at T1 in the intervention group vs comparator (mean difference 0.51 [-0.08 to 1.11]), though the difference in groups decreased by 12 weeks.Time since diagnosis influenced perceived usefulness of the intervention.Modifications were suggested.CONCLUSION: Proof of concept was achieved.The RESTORE intervention should be subject to a definitive trial with some adjustments.Provision of an effective supportive resource would empower cancer survivors to manage CRF after treatment completion.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN67521059.",1,1,0,0

32660748,"Concomitant Antibiotic Use and Survival in Urothelial Carcinoma Treated with Atezolizumab.Antibiotic effects on the gut microbiota may negatively impact survival with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs).However, there is minimal evidence regarding whether antibiotic impacts are specific to ICIs or impacts in urothelial carcinoma (UC).In a post hoc analysis of IMvigor210 (single-arm atezolizumab) and IMvigor211 (phase III randomised trial of atezolizumab vs chemotherapy), the association between antibiotic use and overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) was assessed via Cox proportional hazard analysis.Antibiotic use was defined as any antibiotic administration between 30 d prior to and 30 d after treatment initiation.Antibiotic use was associated with worse OS (n = 847, hazard ratio or HR [95% confidence interval {CI}] = 1.44 [1.19-1.73]) and PFS (1.24 [1.05-1.46]) with atezolizumab, but not chemotherapy (n = 415, 1.15 [0.91-1.46] and 1.09 [0.88-1.36], respectively).In the randomised cohort of IMvigor211, the OS treatment effect (HR [95% CI]) of atezolizumab versus chemotherapy was 0.95 (95% CI 0.71-1.25) for antibiotic users, compared with 0.73 (0.60-0.88) for nonusers (p[interaction] = 0.1).Similar associations were noted in the PD-L1 IC2/3 population.In conclusion, antibiotic use was associated with worse survival outcomes in UC patients treated with atezolizumab.The study does not justify a change in antibiotic selection for infections; however antibiotic overuse occurs in cancer care and this needs to be evaluated for ICIs.PATIENT SUMMARY: In this report from clinical trials IMvigor210 and IMvigor211, it was demonstrated that antibiotic use is consistently associated with worse survival in patients with urothelial carcinoma treated with atezolizumab.No antibiotic association was observed in patients treated with chemotherapy, suggesting that antibiotics may specifically reduce the effectiveness of cancer immunotherapies.Future research will continue to explore the effect of antibiotics on other immune checkpoint inhibitors and confirm whether immune checkpoint inhibitors remain the treatment of choice in cancer patients requiring antibiotics.",0,0,0,0

A 15- to 20-point change in global QoL and functional scale scores predicted change in tumour status as did change in fatigue, pain and appetite loss scores.Smaller QoL changes (5-15 points) predicted PS change.Results were similar in patients regardless of baseline disease measurability.CONCLUSIONS: Our study underscores the importance of disease control for maintaining or improving QoL. These data could improve future trial design and routine clinical care for patients receiving therapy for previously treated gastric cancer.NCT00917384, NCT01170663.",0,0,0,0

28958502,"Dacomitinib versus gefitinib as first-line treatment for patients with EGFR-mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (ARCHER 1050): a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Dacomitinib is a second-generation, irreversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor.We compared its efficacy and safety with that of the reversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib in the first-line treatment of patients with advanced EGFR-mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).METHODS: In this international, multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3 study (ARCHER 1050), we enrolled adults (aged >/=18 years or >/=20 years in Japan and South Korea) with newly diagnosed advanced NSCLC and one EGFR mutation (exon 19 deletion or Leu858Arg) at 71 academic medical centres and university hospitals in seven countries or special administrative regions.We randomly assigned participants (1:1) to receive oral dacomitinib 45 mg/day (in 28-day cycles) or oral gefitinib 250 mg/day (in 28-day cycles) until disease progression or another discontinuation criterion was met.Randomisation, stratified by race and EGFR mutation type, was done with a computer-generated random code assigned by a central interactive web response system.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival assessed by masked independent review in the intention-to-treat population.Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01774721, and is ongoing but no longer recruiting patients.FINDINGS: Between May 9, 2013, and March 20, 2015, 452 eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive dacomitinib (n=227) or gefitinib (n=225).Median duration of follow-up for progression-free survival was 22.1 months (95% CI 20.3-23.9).Median progression-free survival according to masked independent review was 14.7 months (95% CI 11.1-16.6) in the dacomitinib group and 9.2 months (9.1-11.0) in the gefitinib group (hazard ratio 0.59, 95% CI 0.47-0.74; p<0.0001).The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were dermatitis acneiform (31 [14%] of 227 patients given dacomitinib vs none of 224 patients given gefitinib), diarrhoea (19 [8%] vs two [1%]), and raised alanine aminotransferase levels (two [1%] vs 19 [8%]).Treatment-related serious adverse events were reported in 21 (9%) patients given dacomitinib and in ten (4%) patients given gefitinib.Two treatment-related deaths occurred in the dacomitinib group (one related to untreated diarrhoea and one to untreated cholelithases/liver disease) and one in the gefitinib group (related to sigmoid colon diverticulitis/rupture complicated by pneumonia).INTERPRETATION: Dacomitinib significantly improved progression-free survival over gefitinib in first-line treatment of patients with EGFR-mutation-positive NSCLC and should be considered as a new treatment option for this population.FUNDING: SFJ Pharmaceuticals Group and Pfizer.",1,1,1,1
32966755,"Aprepitant for Cough in Lung Cancer. A Randomized Placebo-controlled Trial and Mechanistic Insights.Rationale: Effective cough treatments are a significant unmet need in patients with lung cancer.Aprepitant is a licensed treatment for nausea and vomiting, which blocks substance P activation of NK-1 (neurokinin 1) receptors, a mechanism also implicated in cough.Objectives: To assess aprepitant in patients with lung cancer with cough and evaluate mechanisms in vagal nerve tissue.Methods: Randomized double-blind crossover trial of patients with lung cancer and bothersome cough.They received 3 days of aprepitant or matched placebo; after a 3-day washout, patients crossed to the alternative treatment.The primary endpoint was awake cough frequency measured at screening and Day 3 of each treatment; secondary endpoints included patient-reported outcomes.In vitro, the depolarization of isolated guinea pig and human vagus nerve sections in grease-gap recording chambers, indicative of sensory nerve activation, was measured to evaluate the mechanism.Measurements and Main Results: Twenty patients with lung cancer enrolled, with a mean age 66 years (+/-7.7); 60% were female and 80% had non-small cell cancer, 50% had advanced stage, and 55% had World Health Organization performance status 1.Cough frequency improved with aprepitant, reducing by 22.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.8-37.7%) over placebo while awake (P = 0.03), 30.3% (95% CI, 12.7-44.3) over 24 hours (P = 0.002), and 59.8% (95% CI, 15.1-86.0) during sleep (P = 0.081).Patient-reported outcomes all significantly improved.Substance P depolarized both guinea pig and human vagus nerve.Aprepitant significantly inhibited substance P-induced depolarization by 78% in guinea pig (P = 0.0145) and 94% in human vagus (P = 0.0145).Conclusions: Substance P activation of NK-1 receptors appears to be an important mechanism driving cough in lung cancer, and NK-1 antagonists show promise as antitussive therapies.",1,1,0,0
32975708,"Randomized phase II clinical trial and biomarker analysis of paclitaxel plus epirubicin versus vinorelbine plus epirubicin as neoadjuvant chemotherapy in locally advanced HER2-negative breast cancer with TEKT4 variations.PURPOSE: Resistance to paclitaxel remains a major challenge in treating breast cancer.Our preclinical study suggested that TEKT4 germline variations in breast cancer are associated with paclitaxel resistance and increase vinorelbine sensitivity.This clinical trial compared the efficacy of paclitaxel and vinorelbine in breast cancer neoadjuvant chemotherapy.METHODS: In this open-label, single-center, phase II trial, female patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, stage IIB-IIIC breast cancer harboring TEKT4 germline variations were randomly assigned to the paclitaxel plus epirubicin (PE) or vinorelbine plus epirubicin (NE).The primary endpoint was the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate, and the secondary endpoints were the objective response rate (ORR) and safety.Targeted sequencing of a panel comprising 484 breast-related genes was performed to identify pCR-associated somatic mutations in each group.RESULTS: 91 Patients were assigned to PE (46 patients) or NE (45 patients).NE numerically increased the pCR rate (22.2% versus 8.7%, P = 0.074).The ORRs for NE and PE were 82.2% and 76.1%, respectively.Interestingly, NE (15.4%) showed a significantly higher pCR rate than PE (0%) in the hormone receptor (HR)-positive subgroup (P = 0.044).Both regimens were well tolerated, with grade 3 and 4 toxicities reported at the expected levels.The biomarker analysis showed that UNC13D mutation predicted the pCR rate in NE (P = 0.011).CONCLUSIONS: Although the primary endpoint was not met, NE might bring clinical benefit to HR-positive patients or patients simultaneously carrying UNC13D mutations.",1,1,1,1

22473163,"Multicenter randomized phase II clinical trial comparing neoadjuvant oxaliplatin, capecitabine, and preoperative radiotherapy with or without cetuximab followed by total mesorectal excision in patients with high-risk rectal cancer (EXPERT-C).PURPOSE: To evaluate the addition of cetuximab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy before chemoradiotherapy in high-risk rectal cancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with operable magnetic resonance imaging-defined high-risk rectal cancer received four cycles of capecitabine/oxaliplatin (CAPOX) followed by capecitabine chemoradiotherapy, surgery, and adjuvant CAPOX (four cycles) or the same regimen plus weekly cetuximab (CAPOX+C).The primary end point was complete response (CR; pathologic CR or, in patients not undergoing surgery, radiologic CR) in patients with KRAS/BRAF wild-type tumors.Secondary end points were radiologic response (RR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety in the wild-type and overall populations and a molecular biomarker analysis.RESULTS: One hundred sixty-five eligible patients were randomly assigned.Ninety (60%) of 149 assessable tumors were KRAS or BRAF wild type (CAPOX, n = 44; CAPOX+C, n = 46), and in these patients, the addition of cetuximab did not improve the primary end point of CR (9% v 11%, respectively; P = 1.0; odds ratio, 1.22) or PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.65; P = .363).Cetuximab significantly improved RR (CAPOX v CAPOX+C: after chemotherapy, 51% v 71%, respectively; P = .038; after chemoradiation, 75% v 93%, respectively; P = .028) and OS (HR, 0.27; P = .034).Skin toxicity and diarrhea were more frequent in the CAPOX+C arm.CONCLUSION: Cetuximab led to a significant increase in RR and OS in patients with KRAS/BRAF wild-type rectal cancer, but the primary end point of improved CR was not met.",1,1,1,1
29534639,"Cytokeratin-18 fragments predict treatment response and overall survival in gastric cancer in a randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer is common malignancy and exhibits a poor prognosis.At the time of diagnosis, the majority of patients present with metastatic disease which precludes curative treatment.Non-invasive biomarkers which discriminate early from advanced stages or predict the response to treatment are urgently required.This study explored the cytokeratin-18 fragment M30 and full-length cytokeratin-18 M65 in predicting treatment response and survival in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of advanced gastric cancer.METHODS: Patients enrolled in the SUN-CASE study received sunitinib or placebo as an adjunct to standard therapy with leucovorin (Ca-folinate), 5-fluorouracil, and irinotecan in second or third line.Treatment response rates, progression-free survival and overall survival were assessed during a follow-up period of 12 months.Cytokeratin-18 fragments were analyzed in 52 patients at baseline and day 14 of therapy.RESULTS: Levels of M30 correlated with the presence of metastasis and lymph node involvement and decreased significantly during chemotherapy.Importantly, baseline levels of M30 were significantly higher in patients who failed therapy.In addition, patients who did not respond to treatment were also identifiable at day 14 based on elevated M30 levels.By stepwise regression analysis, M30 at day 14 was identified as independent predictor of treatment response.Likewise, serum levels of full-length cytokeratin-18 M65 at baseline also correlated with treatment failure and progression-free survival.The addition of sunitinib did not exert any effects on serum levels of M30 or M65.CONCLUSION: The cytokeratin-18 fragment M30 at day 14 identifies patients that fail to second- or third-line therapy for advanced gastric cancer.Validation of this non-invasive biomarker in gastric cancer is warranted.",1,1,1,0

32975708,"Randomized phase II clinical trial and biomarker analysis of paclitaxel plus epirubicin versus vinorelbine plus epirubicin as neoadjuvant chemotherapy in locally advanced HER2-negative breast cancer with TEKT4 variations.PURPOSE: Resistance to paclitaxel remains a major challenge in treating breast cancer.Our preclinical study suggested that TEKT4 germline variations in breast cancer are associated with paclitaxel resistance and increase vinorelbine sensitivity.This clinical trial compared the efficacy of paclitaxel and vinorelbine in breast cancer neoadjuvant chemotherapy.METHODS: In this open-label, single-center, phase II trial, female patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, stage IIB-IIIC breast cancer harboring TEKT4 germline variations were randomly assigned to the paclitaxel plus epirubicin (PE) or vinorelbine plus epirubicin (NE).The primary endpoint was the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate, and the secondary endpoints were the objective response rate (ORR) and safety.Targeted sequencing of a panel comprising 484 breast-related genes was performed to identify pCR-associated somatic mutations in each group.RESULTS: 91 Patients were assigned to PE (46 patients) or NE (45 patients).NE numerically increased the pCR rate (22.2% versus 8.7%, P = 0.074).The ORRs for NE and PE were 82.2% and 76.1%, respectively.Interestingly, NE (15.4%) showed a significantly higher pCR rate than PE (0%) in the hormone receptor (HR)-positive subgroup (P = 0.044).Both regimens were well tolerated, with grade 3 and 4 toxicities reported at the expected levels.The biomarker analysis showed that UNC13D mutation predicted the pCR rate in NE (P = 0.011).CONCLUSIONS: Although the primary endpoint was not met, NE might bring clinical benefit to HR-positive patients or patients simultaneously carrying UNC13D mutations.",1,1,1,1
27573561,"Subgroup analysis in RAISE: a randomized, double-blind phase III study of irinotecan, folinic acid, and 5-fluorouracil (FOLFIRI) plus ramucirumab or placebo in patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma progression.BACKGROUND: The RAISE phase III clinical trial demonstrated that ramucirumab + FOLFIRI improved overall survival (OS) [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.844, P = 0.0219] and progression-free survival (PFS) (HR = 0.793, P < 0.0005) compared with placebo + FOLFIRI for second-line metastatic colorectal carcinoma (mCRC) patients previously treated with first-line bevacizumab, oxaliplatin, and a fluoropyrimidine.Since some patient or disease characteristics could be associated with differential efficacy or safety, prespecified subgroup analyses were undertaken.This report focuses on three of the most relevant ones: KRAS status (wild-type versus mutant), age (<65 versus >/=65 years), and time to progression (TTP) on first-line therapy (<6 versus >/=6 months).PATIENTS AND METHODS: OS and PFS were evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier analysis, with HR determined by the Cox proportional hazards model.Treatment-by-subgroup interaction was tested to determine whether treatment effect was consistent between subgroup pairs.RESULTS: Patients with both wild-type and mutant KRAS benefited from ramucirumab + FOLFIRI treatment over placebo + FOLFIRI (interaction P = 0.526); although numerically, wild-type KRAS patients benefited more (wild-type KRAS: median OS = 14.4 versus 11.9 months, HR = 0.82, P = 0.049; mutant KRAS: median OS = 12.7 versus 11.3 months, HR = 0.89, P = 0.263).Patients with both longer and shorter first-line TTP benefited from ramucirumab (interaction P = 0.9434), although TTP <6 months was associated with poorer OS (TTP >/=6 months: median OS = 14.3 versus 12.5 months, HR = 0.86, P = 0.061; TTP <6 months: median OS = 10.4 versus 8.0 months, HR = 0.86, P = 0.276).The subgroups of patients >/=65 versus <65 years also derived a similar ramucirumab survival benefit (interaction P = 0.9521) (>/=65 years: median OS = 13.8 versus 11.7 months, HR = 0.85, P = 0.156; <65 years: median OS = 13.1 versus 11.9 months, HR = 0.86, P = 0.098).The safety profile of ramucirumab + FOLFIRI was similar across subgroups.CONCLUSIONS: These analyses revealed similar efficacy and safety among patient subgroups with differing KRAS mutation status, longer or shorter first-line TTP, and age.Ramucirumab is a beneficial addition to second-line FOLFIRI treatment for a wide range of patients with mCRC.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01183780.",1,1,1,1
34363558,"Gilteritinib versus chemotherapy in Japanese patients with FLT3-mutated relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia.BACKGROUND: Until recently, no effective targeted therapies for FLT3-mutated (FLT3(mut+)) relapsed/refractory (R/R) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were available in Japan.The FLT3 inhibitor, gilteritinib, was approved in Japan for patients with FLT3(mut+) R/R AML based on the phase 3 ADMIRAL trial, which demonstrated the superiority of gilteritinib over salvage chemotherapy (SC) with respect to overall survival (OS; median OS, 9.3 vs 5.6 months, respectively; hazard ratio, 0.64 [95% confidence interval 0.49, 0.83]; P < 0.001).METHODS: We evaluated the Japanese subgroup (n = 48) of the ADMIRAL trial, which included 33 patients randomized to 120-mg/day gilteritinib and 15 randomized to SC.RESULTS: Median OS was 14.3 months in the gilteritinib arm and 9.6 months in the SC arm.The complete remission/complete remission with partial hematologic recovery rate was higher in the gilteritinib arm (48.5%) than in the SC arm (13.3%).After adjustment for drug exposure, fewer adverse events (AEs) occurred in the gilteritinib arm than in the SC arm.Common grade >/= 3 AEs related to gilteritinib were febrile neutropenia (36%), decreased platelet count (27%), and anemia (24%).CONCLUSION: Findings in Japanese patients are consistent with those of the overall ADMIRAL study population.",1,1,1,1
25057173,"EGFR biomarkers predict benefit from vandetanib in combination with docetaxel in a randomized phase III study of second-line treatment of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.BACKGROUND: ZODIAC was a randomized phase III study of second-line treatment in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that evaluated the addition of vandetanib to docetaxel.The study showed a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival and objective response rate, but not in overall survival for unselected patients.This study evaluated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutation, copy number gain, and protein expression, and KRAS gene mutation, in pretreatment tumor samples as potential biomarkers predicting benefit from vandetanib as second-line treatment of NSCLC.PATIENTS AND METHODS: After progression following first-line chemotherapy, 1391 patients with locally advanced or metastatic (stage IIIB/IV) NSCLC were randomized 1 : 1 to receive vandetanib (100 mg/day) plus docetaxel (75 mg/m(2) every 21 days) or placebo plus docetaxel in the ZODIAC study.Archival tumor samples (n = 570) were collected from consenting patients (n = 958) for predefined, prospective biomarker analyses.RESULTS: Of evaluable samples, 14% were EGFR mutation positive, 35% were EGFR FISH positive, 88% were EGFR protein expression positive, and 13% were KRAS mutation positive.Compared with the overall study population, in which progression-free survival (PFS) [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.79] but not OS (HR = 0.91) were significantly improved with vandetanib, there was greater relative clinical benefit for patients with EGFR mutation-positive tumors [PFS HR 0.51, confidence interval (CI) 0.25-1.06 and OS HR 0.46, CI 0.14-1.57] and EGFR FISH-positive tumors (PFS HR 0.61, CI 0.39-0.94 and OS HR 0.48, CI 0.28-0.84).Similarly, patients with EGFR mutation or FISH-positive tumor samples who received vandetanib had an increased chance of objective tumor response (odds ratios 3.34, CI 0.8-13.89, and 3.90, CI 1.02-14.82, respectively).There did not appear to be benefit for vandetanib in patients with KRAS mutation-positive tumors.CONCLUSIONS: High EGFR gene copy number or activating EGFR mutations may identify patient subgroups who receive increased clinical benefit from vandetanib in combination with docetaxel in second-line NSCLC.CLINICALTRIALSGOV: NCT00312377.",1,1,1,1
22115704,"Comparison of pemetrexed plus cisplatin with other first-line doublets in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC): a combined analysis of three phase 3 trials.INTRODUCTION: In a first-line study of advanced NSCLC, pemetrexed-cisplatin was more effective among patients with adenocarcinoma and large-cell carcinoma compared with gemcitabine-cisplatin (median survival of 11.8 versus 10.4 months, P=.005), while survival with pemetrexed-cisplatin was shorter than with gemcitabine-cisplatin in patients with squamous cell carcinoma.The comparability of pemetrexed-cisplatin to other commonly used regimens within histology subgroups needs to be explored.METHODS: This retrospective analysis combined the patient-level data from three phase 3 randomized controlled trials that compared the efficacy of different third generation platinum- and non-platinum based doublets.Unadjusted median survival times and Cox covariate-adjusted treatment hazard ratio (HR) estimates were calculated.Overall results and subgroups by histological type were reported.RESULTS: This combined analysis consisted of 3467 patients.In the overall analysis, adjusted HRs favored pemetrexed (HR <1.0) to each of the other 5 regimens, though none of these HRs were statistically significant.Among patients with non-squamous histology, pemetrexed-cisplatin produced favorable HRs to each of the other regimens, achieving statistical significance when compared with vinorelbine-cisplatin (HR=0.67; 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 0.50, 0.91) and gemcitabine-cisplatin (HR=0.85; 95% CI: 0.75, 0.97).Among patients with squamous histology, 4 of the 5 comparison regimens produced favorable HRs (HR >1.0) when compared with pemetrexed-cisplatin, with only the comparison with gemcitabine-cisplatin achieving statistical significance (HR=1.23; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.51).CONCLUSION: In the absence of randomized clinical trial data comparing pemetrexed-cisplatin to commonly used doublets in advanced NSCLC other than gemcitabine-cisplatin, this combined analysis of multiple trials provides estimates for such comparisons.",0,0,0,0

29340815,"Comparison between submucosal tunneling endoscopic resection and video-assisted thoracoscopic enucleation for esophageal submucosal tumors originating from the muscularis propria layer: a randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Surgical resection is considered the first treatment option for submucosal tumors (SMTs) originating from the muscularis propria layer while submucosal tunneling endoscopic resection (STER) is proved to be a safe and effective method for treating SMTs.This study aimed to compare video-assisted thoracoscopic enucleation (VATE) with STER for treating esophageal SMTs.METHODS: Sixty-six patients with small esophageal SMTs were prospectively randomized from July 2014 to December 2015.After exclusion of 8 patients, 58 subjects scheduled for STER or VATE were enrolled.Clinicopathological, endoscopic, and adverse events (AEs) data were collected and analyzed between STER and VATE.RESULTS: Forty-six males and 12 females with a mean age of 46.1 +/- 9.4 years were randomized to the STER (n = 30) and VATE (n = 28) groups, respectively.Demographics and lesion features were similar between the two groups.Median procedure time was shorter in the STER group than the VATE group (44.5 vs. 106.5 min, P < 0.001); cost was lower in the STER group (4499.46 vs. 6137.32 USD, P = 0.010).Median decrease in hemoglobin levels post-procedure was - 1.6 g/L in the STER group and 14.7 g/L after VATE (P = 0.001).Lower postoperative pain scores were found in the STER group compared with the VATE group (2 vs. 4, P < 0.001).No recurrent or residual tumors were found in either group.En bloc resection rates, complete resection rates, hospital times, and post-procedure AEs were similar between two groups.The en bloc resection rates for SMTs < 20.0 mm were 100% in both groups while STER achieved only 71.4% en bloc resection rate for SMTs >/= 20.0 mm.CONCLUSION: STER and VATE are comparably effective for esophageal SMTs; however, STER is superior to VATE with shorter operation time and decreased cost, and seems safer than VATE.STER is recommended for SMTs < 20.0 mm while VATE is recommended for SMTs with a transverse diameter > 35.0 mm.Clinical trail registration statement: This study is registered at http://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.aspx?proj=4814 .The registration identification number is ChiCTR-TRC-14004759.The registration date is April 30, 2014.",0,0,0,0

And S-1 alone with the combination of radiotherapy treatment effect is good, and achieved good clinical remission rate.The purpose of this trial is compare the efficacy and toxicity of combining S-1 or S-1 plus cisplatin with radiotherapy for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.METHODS/DESIGN: The study is a randomized, controlled, multicenter trial, comparing S-1 versus S-1 plus cisplatin concurrent radiotherapy for patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.Eighty-eight patients with unresectable or medically unfit for surgery esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (clinical stage I to III), will randomly assigned to receive four cycles (2 concomitant and 2 postradiotherapy) S-1 or S-1 plus cisplatin along with radiotherapy 60-66 Gy/30 to 33 fractions.The primary outcome is complete response rate of primary tumor which will be measured by endoscopy and computer screen at 3 months after the completion of treatment.Secondary outcomes include survival and toxicity.DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this study protocol is the first to test the effect between S-1 versus S-1 plus cisplatin concurrent intensity modulated radiation therapy in the treatment of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.If the result will be the same effect and fewer side effects and less costly in S-1 plus radiotherapy.It will supply more treatment selection for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.",0,0,0,0
25688512,"Rationale and protocol of the MetNET-1 trial, a prospective, single center, phase II study to evaluate the activity and safety of everolimus in combination with octreotide LAR and metformin in patients with advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.Abnormal PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway signalling and autocrine activation of the mTOR pathway, mediated through insulin-like growth factor-1, have been implicated in the proliferation of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (pNET) cells.Everolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, has shown antitumor benefit in pNETs alone and in combination with octreotide LAR in RADIANT-1 and RADIANT-3 studies.Although everolimus-based phase II/III trials have improved progression-free survival for pNET, its use has not impacted on prolonging overall survival.Metformin has recently shown some anti-cancer activity in both in vitro and in vivo studies by its indirect properties to decrease insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels and by its antitumour effect to promote AMPK activation and consequently inhibition to TSC1-2/mTOR complex.In light of even more retrospective evidence of metformin's anticancer activity, a prospective evaluation is required to either confirm or discard these preliminary findings.With the aim to evaluate the antiproliferative effect of metformin in combination with everolimus and octreotide LAR in pancreatic well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor patients, a single arm, prospective, single center phase II study was designed (MetNET-1 trial, NCT 02294006).Forty-three patients are expected to be evaluated.The study is ongoing, and recruitment is estimated to be completed in August 2016.The results will be anticipated in 2017.",0,0,0,0

33422006,"Impact of time-varying cumulative bevacizumab exposures on survival: re-analysis of data from randomized clinical trial in patients with metastatic colo-rectal cancer.BACKGROUND: As cancer treatment, biotherapies can be as effective as chemotherapy while reducing the risk of secondary effects, so that they can be taken over longer periods than conventional chemotherapy.Thus, some trials aimed at assessing the benefit of maintaining biotherapies during chemotherapy-free intervals (CFI).For example, the recent PRODIGE9 trial assessed the effect of maintaining bevacizumab during CFI in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients.However, its analysis was hindered by a small difference of exposure to the treatment between the randomized groups and by a large proportion of early drop outs, leading to a potentially unbalanced distribution of confounding factors among the trial completers.To address these limitations, we re-analyzed the PRODIGE9 data to assess the effects of different exposure metrics on all-cause mortality of patients with mCRC using methods originally developed for observational studies.METHODS: To account for the actual patterns of drug use by individual patients and for possible cumulative effects, we used five alternative time-varying exposure metrics: (i) cumulative dose, (ii) quantiles of the cumulative dose, (iii) standardized cumulative dose, (iv) Theoretical Blood Concentration (TBC), and (v) Weighted Cumulative Exposure (WCE).The last two metrics account for the timing of drug use.Treatment effects were estimated using adjusted Hazard Ratio from multivariable Cox proportional hazards models.RESULTS: After excluding 112 patients who died during the induction period, we analyzed data on 382 patients, among whom 320 (83.8%) died.All time-varying exposures improved substantially the model's fit to data, relative to using only the time-invariant randomization group.All exposures indicated a protective effect for higher cumulative bevacizumab doses.The best-fitting WCE and TBC models accounted for both the cumulative effects and the different impact of doses taken at different times.CONCLUSIONS: All time-varying analyses, regardless of the exposure metric used, consistently suggested protective effects of higher cumulative bevacizumab doses.However, the results may partly reflect the presence of a confusion bias.Complementing the main ITT analysis of maintenance trials with an analysis of potential cumulative effects of treatment actually taken can provide new insights, but the results must be interpreted with caution because they do not benefit from the randomization.TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov, NCT00952029 .Registered 8 August 2009.",0,0,0,0
30762141,"Effects of live music during chemotherapy in lymphoma patients: a randomized, controlled, multi-center trial.PURPOSE: Chemotherapy is associated with both somatic and psychological side effects.Music might ease these problems.Several randomized controlled trials have investigated the effect of music, but the results are inconclusive.We aimed to examine whether live or pre-recorded music listening decreases anxiety during chemotherapy in newly diagnosed lymphoma patients.METHODS: A total of 143 patients with non-Hodgkin and Hodgkin lymphomas were randomly assigned into three groups receiving either 30 min of patient-preferred live music (n = 47), 30 min of patient-preferred pre-recorded music (n = 47), or standard care (n = 49) during up to five outpatient chemotherapy sessions.The primary endpoint was anxiety measured by the Spielberger's State Anxiety Inventory.Secondary endpoints included blood pressure, pulse rate, nausea and vomiting, serum catecholamine levels pre- and post-intervention to measure arousal levels, and health-related quality of life.The Musical Ability Test was used to link musical ability to the primary endpoint.RESULTS: When adjusting for age, sex, diagnosis, number of sessions, and baseline anxiety, the linear mixed model showed a borderline statistically significant reduction in the primary outcome anxiety in the live music group compared to standard care (7% (95% CI, - 14% to 0%, p = 0.05), while the effect of pre-recorded music was non-significant (5% (95% CI, - 12% to + 3%, p = 0.18).No intervention effects were seen in secondary outcomes.CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that patient-preferred live music reduces anxiety among patients with malignant lymphomas undergoing chemotherapy.Musical ability among this group of cancer patients seems not to be a determining factor for effect of music intervention.",0,0,0,0
32822287,"Phase III, Randomized Study of Dual Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) Blockade With Lapatinib Plus Trastuzumab in Combination With an Aromatase Inhibitor in Postmenopausal Women With HER2-Positive, Hormone Receptor-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer: Updated Results of ALTERNATIVE.PURPOSE: Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) targeting plus endocrine therapy (ET) improved clinical benefit in HER2-positive, hormone receptor (HR)-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) versus ET alone.Dual HER2 blockade enhances clinical benefit versus single HER2 blockade.The ALTERNATIVE study evaluated the efficacy and safety of dual HER2 blockade plus aromatase inhibitor (AI) in postmenopausal women with HER2-positive/HR-positive MBC who received prior ET and prior neo(adjuvant)/first-line trastuzumab (TRAS) plus chemotherapy.This updated article reflects minor numerical corrections in some secondary efficacy analyses that resulted from programming errors and that do not change the major conclusions of the study.METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive lapatinib (LAP) plus TRAS plus AI, TRAS plus AI, or LAP plus AI.Patients for whom chemotherapy was intended were excluded.The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS; investigator assessed) with LAP plus TRAS plus AI versus TRAS plus AI.Secondary end points were PFS (comparison of other arms), overall survival (OS), overall response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), and safety.RESULTS: Three hundred fifty-five patients were included in this analysis: LAP plus TRAS plus AI (n = 120), TRAS plus AI (n = 117), and LAP plus AI (n = 118).Baseline characteristics were balanced.The study met its primary end point; superior PFS was observed with LAP plus TRAS plus AI versus TRAS plus AI (median PFS, 11 v 5.6 months; hazard ratio, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.45 to 0.88]; P = .0063).A consistent PFS benefit was observed in predefined subgroups.ORR, CBR, and OS also favored LAP plus TRAS plus AI.The median PFS with LAP plus AI versus TRAS plus AI was 8.3 versus 5.6 months (hazard ratio, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.62 to 1.17]; P = .3159).Common adverse events (AEs; >/= 15%) with LAP plus TRAS plus AI, TRAS plus AI, and LAP plus AI were diarrhea (69%, 9%, and 51%, respectively), rash (36%, 2%, and 28%, respectively), nausea (22%, 9%, and 22%, respectively), and paronychia (30%, 0%, and 15%, respectively), mostly grade 1 or 2.Serious AEs were reported similarly across the 3 groups, and AEs leading to discontinuation were lower with LAP plus TRAS plus AI.CONCLUSION: Dual HER2 blockade with LAP plus TRAS plus AI showed superior PFS benefit versus TRAS plus AI in patients with HER2-positive/HR-positive MBC.This combination offers an effective and safe chemotherapy-sparing alternative treatment regimen for this patient population.",1,1,1,1
22918392,"Face-to-face vs telephone pre-colonoscopy consultation in colorectal cancer screening; a randomised trial.BACKGROUND: A pre-colonoscopy consultation in colorectal cancer (CRC) screening is necessary to assess a screenee's general health status and to explain benefits and risks of screening.The first option allows for personal attention, whereas a telephone consultation does not require travelling.We hypothesised that a telephone consultation would lead to higher response and participation in CRC screening compared with a face-to-face consultation.METHODS: A total of 6600 persons (50-75 years) were 1:1 randomised for primary colonoscopy screening with a pre-colonoscopy consultation either face-to-face or by telephone.In both arms, we counted the number of invitees who attended a pre-colonoscopy consultation (response) and the number of those who subsequently attended colonoscopy (participation), relative to the number invited for screening.A questionnaire regarding satisfaction with the consultation and expected burden of the colonoscopy (scored on five-point rating scales) was sent to invitees.Besides, a questionnaire to assess the perceived burden of colonoscopy was sent to participants, 14 days after the procedure.RESULTS: In all, 3302 invitees were allocated to the telephone group and 3298 to the face-to-face group, of which 794 (24%) attended a telephone consultation and 822 (25%) a face-to-face consultation (P=0.41).Subsequently, 674 (20%) participants in the telephone group and 752 (23%) in the face-to-face group attended colonoscopy (P=0.018).Invitees and responders in the telephone group expected the bowel preparation to be more painful than those in the face-to-face group while perceived burden scores for the full screening procedure were comparable.More subjects in the face-to-face group than in the telephone group were satisfied by the consultation in general: (99.8% vs 98.5%, P=0.014).CONCLUSION: Using a telephone rather than a face-to-face consultation in a population-based CRC colonoscopy screening programme leads to similar response rates but significantly lower colonoscopy participation.",0,0,0,0
28166812,"Efficacy of high-intensity focused ultrasound-assisted hepatic resection (HIFU-AR) on blood loss reduction in patients with liver metastases requiring hepatectomy: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Liver resection is the only potentially curative treatment for colorectal liver metastases (LM).It is considered a safe procedure, but is often associated with blood loss during liver transection.Blood transfusions are frequently needed, but they are associated with increased morbidity and risk of recurrence.Many surgical devices have been developed to decrease blood loss.However, none of them has proven superior to the standard crushing technique.We developed a new, powerful intra-operative high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) transducer which destroys tissue by coagulative necrosis.We aim to evaluate whether HIFU-assisted liver resection (HIFU-AR) results in reduced blood loss.METHODS: This is a prospective, single-centre, randomized (1:1 ratio), comparative, open-label phase II study.Patients with LM requiring a hepatectomy for >/= 2 segments will be included.Patients with cirrhosis or sinusoidal obstruction syndrome with portal hypertension will be excluded.The primary endpoint is normalized blood loss in millilitres per square centimetre of liver section plane.Secondary endpoints are: total blood loss, transection time, transection time per square centimetre of liver area, haemostasis time, clip density on the liver section area, rate and duration of the Pringle manoeuvre, rate of patients needing a blood transfusion, length of hospital stay, morbidity, patients with positive resection margin, and local recurrence.Assuming a blood loss of 7.6 +/- 3.7 mL/cm(2) among controls, the study will have 85% power to detect a twofold decrease of blood loss in the experimental arm, using a Wilcoxon (Mann-Whitney) rank-sum test with a 0.05 two-sided significance level.Twenty-one randomized patients per arm are required.Considering the risk of contraindications at surgery, up to eight patients may be enrolled in addition to the 42 planned, with an enrolment period of 24 months.Randomization will be stratified by surgeon.DISCUSSION: We previously demonstrated the safety and efficacy of intra-operative HIFU in patients operated on for LM.We also demonstrated the efficacy of HIFU-AR in a preclinical study.Participants in the HIFU-AR group of this randomized trial can expect to benefit from reduced blood loss and decreased ischemia of liver parenchyma.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrial.gov, NCT02728167 .Registered on 22 March 2016.",0,0,0,0
26686313,"Anastrozole versus tamoxifen for the prevention of locoregional and contralateral breast cancer in postmenopausal women with locally excised ductal carcinoma in situ (IBIS-II DCIS): a double-blind, randomised controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Third-generation aromatase inhibitors are more effective than tamoxifen for preventing recurrence in postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive invasive breast cancer.However, it is not known whether anastrozole is more effective than tamoxifen for women with hormone-receptor-positive ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).Here, we compare the efficacy of anastrozole with that of tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive DCIS.METHODS: In a double-blind, multicentre, randomised placebo-controlled trial, we recruited women who had been diagnosed with locally excised, hormone-receptor-positive DCIS.Eligible women were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio by central computer allocation to receive 1 mg oral anastrozole or 20 mg oral tamoxifen every day for 5 years.Randomisation was stratified by major centre or hub and was done in blocks (six, eight, or ten).All trial personnel, participants, and clinicians were masked to treatment allocation and only the trial statistician had access to treatment allocation.The primary endpoint was all recurrence, including recurrent DCIS and new contralateral tumours.All analyses were done on a modified intention-to-treat basis (in all women who were randomised and did not revoke consent for their data to be included) and proportional hazard models were used to compute hazard ratios and corresponding confidence intervals.This trial is registered at the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN37546358.RESULTS: Between March 3, 2003, and Feb 8, 2012, we enrolled 2980 postmenopausal women from 236 centres in 14 countries and randomly assigned them to receive anastrozole (1449 analysed) or tamoxifen (1489 analysed).Median follow-up was 7.2 years (IQR 5.6-8.9), and 144 breast cancer recurrences were recorded.We noted no statistically significant difference in overall recurrence (67 recurrences for anastrozole vs 77 for tamoxifen; HR 0.89 [95% CI 0.64-1.23]).The non-inferiority of anastrozole was established (upper 95% CI <1.25), but its superiority to tamoxifen was not (p=0.49).A total of 69 deaths were recorded (33 for anastrozole vs 36 for tamoxifen; HR 0.93 [95% CI 0.58-1.50], p=0.78), and no specific cause was more common in one group than the other.The number of women reporting any adverse event was similar between anastrozole (1323 women, 91%) and tamoxifen (1379 women, 93%); the side-effect profiles of the two drugs differed, with more fractures, musculoskeletal events, hypercholesterolaemia, and strokes with anastrozole and more muscle spasm, gynaecological cancers and symptoms, vasomotor symptoms, and deep vein thromboses with tamoxifen.CONCLUSIONS: No clear efficacy differences were seen between the two treatments.Anastrozole offers another treatment option for postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive DCIS, which may be be more appropriate for some women with contraindications for tamoxifen.Longer follow-up will be necessary to fully evaluate treatment differences.FUNDING: Cancer Research UK, National Health and Medical Research Council Australia, Breast Cancer Research Fund, AstraZeneca, Sanofi Aventis.",1,1,1,1
23497452,"A randomized trial to assess the biological activity of short-term (pre-surgical) fulvestrant 500 mg plus anastrozole versus fulvestrant 500 mg alone or anastrozole alone on primary breast cancer.INTRODUCTION: Fulvestrant shows dose-dependent biological activity.Greater estrogen-receptor (ER) blockade may feasibly be achieved by combining fulvestrant with anastrozole.This pre-surgical study compared fulvestrant plus anastrozole versus either agent alone in patients with ER-positive breast cancer.METHODS: In this double-blind, multicenter trial, 121 patients received fulvestrant 500 mg on Day 1 plus anastrozole 1 mg/day for 14 to 21 days (F + A); fulvestrant plus anastrozole placebo (F); or fulvestrant placebo plus anastrozole (A), 2 to 3 weeks before surgery.ER, progesterone-receptor (PgR) and Ki67 expression were determined from tumor biopsies before treatment and at surgery.RESULTS: A total of 103 paired samples were available (F, n = 35; F+A, n = 31; A, n = 37).All treatments significantly reduced mean ER expression from baseline (F: -41%, P = 0.0001; F + A: -39%, P = 0.0001; A: -13%, P = 0.0034).F and F + A led to greater reductions in ER versus A (both P = 0.0001); F + A did not lead to additional reductions versus F. PgR and Ki67 expression were significantly reduced with all treatments (means were -34% to -45%, and -75% to -85%, respectively; all P = 0.0001), with no differences between groups.CONCLUSIONS: In this short-term study, all treatments reduced ER expression, although F and F + A showed greater reductions than A. No significant differences were detected between the treatment groups in terms of PgR and Ki67 expression.No additional reduction in tumor biomarkers with combination treatment was observed, suggesting that F + A is unlikely to have further clinical benefit over F alone.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00259090.",1,1,1,1

Investigator-assessed median progression-free survival was 9.2 months (95% CI, 7.4 to 15.6) and 12.9 months (95% CI, 11.1 to not reached) in arms A and B, respectively.Independent review committee-assessed intracranial ORR in patients with measurable brain metastases at baseline was 42% (11 of 26 patients) in arm A and 67% (12 of 18 patients) in arm B. Common treatment-emergent adverse events were nausea (arm A/B, 33%/40%), diarrhea (arm A/B, 19%/38%), headache (arm A/B, 28%/27%), and cough (arm A/B, 18%/34%), and were mainly grades 1 to 2.A subset of pulmonary adverse events with early onset (median onset: day 2) occurred in 14 of 219 treated patients (all grades, 6%; grade >/= 3, 3%); none occurred after escalation to 180 mg in arm B. Seven of 14 patients were successfully retreated with brigatinib.Conclusion Brigatinib yielded substantial whole-body and intracranial responses as well as robust progression-free survival; 180 mg (with lead-in) showed consistently better efficacy than 90 mg, with acceptable safety.",1,1,1,1
27091469,"Voice Range Profile and Health-related Quality of Life Measurements Following Voice Rehabilitation After Radiotherapy; a Randomized Controlled Study.PURPOSE: The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of voice rehabilitation in patients treated with radiotherapy for laryngeal cancer.METHOD: A total of 42 patients with laryngeal cancer who are treated with radiotherapy with curative intent participated in a randomized controlled study.The collected data were voice range profiles (VPRs) and patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments for measurement of self-perceived communication function (Swedish Self-Evaluation for Communication Experiences after Laryngeal cancer (S-SECEL)) and health related quality of life (HRQL) (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30/Head and Neck module).Data were collected 1 month (pre voice rehabilitation), 6 months, and 12 months postradiotherapy.Of the patients, 19 received voice rehabilitation, whereas 23 constituted a control group.RESULTS: There were several statistically significant improvements in the study group concerning the HRQL and self-perceived communication function.The largest improvements occurred between occasions 1 (prevoice rehabilitation) and 2 (6-month postradiotherapy) and then remained constant.VRP area demonstrated a statistically significant difference when comparing changes over time, where the study group improved more than the control group.CONCLUSION: HRQL and self-perceived communication function showed improvement in the study group and trends of impairment in the control group.This result might suggest that it would be beneficial for the patients as well as in a health economic perspecitve, to receive voice rehabilitatiom to make a faster improvement of the HRQL and self-perceived communication function.",0,0,0,0

32822287,"Phase III, Randomized Study of Dual Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) Blockade With Lapatinib Plus Trastuzumab in Combination With an Aromatase Inhibitor in Postmenopausal Women With HER2-Positive, Hormone Receptor-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer: Updated Results of ALTERNATIVE.PURPOSE: Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) targeting plus endocrine therapy (ET) improved clinical benefit in HER2-positive, hormone receptor (HR)-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) versus ET alone.Dual HER2 blockade enhances clinical benefit versus single HER2 blockade.The ALTERNATIVE study evaluated the efficacy and safety of dual HER2 blockade plus aromatase inhibitor (AI) in postmenopausal women with HER2-positive/HR-positive MBC who received prior ET and prior neo(adjuvant)/first-line trastuzumab (TRAS) plus chemotherapy.This updated article reflects minor numerical corrections in some secondary efficacy analyses that resulted from programming errors and that do not change the major conclusions of the study.METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive lapatinib (LAP) plus TRAS plus AI, TRAS plus AI, or LAP plus AI.Patients for whom chemotherapy was intended were excluded.The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS; investigator assessed) with LAP plus TRAS plus AI versus TRAS plus AI.Secondary end points were PFS (comparison of other arms), overall survival (OS), overall response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), and safety.RESULTS: Three hundred fifty-five patients were included in this analysis: LAP plus TRAS plus AI (n = 120), TRAS plus AI (n = 117), and LAP plus AI (n = 118).Baseline characteristics were balanced.The study met its primary end point; superior PFS was observed with LAP plus TRAS plus AI versus TRAS plus AI (median PFS, 11 v 5.6 months; hazard ratio, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.45 to 0.88]; P = .0063).A consistent PFS benefit was observed in predefined subgroups.ORR, CBR, and OS also favored LAP plus TRAS plus AI.The median PFS with LAP plus AI versus TRAS plus AI was 8.3 versus 5.6 months (hazard ratio, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.62 to 1.17]; P = .3159).Common adverse events (AEs; >/= 15%) with LAP plus TRAS plus AI, TRAS plus AI, and LAP plus AI were diarrhea (69%, 9%, and 51%, respectively), rash (36%, 2%, and 28%, respectively), nausea (22%, 9%, and 22%, respectively), and paronychia (30%, 0%, and 15%, respectively), mostly grade 1 or 2.Serious AEs were reported similarly across the 3 groups, and AEs leading to discontinuation were lower with LAP plus TRAS plus AI.CONCLUSION: Dual HER2 blockade with LAP plus TRAS plus AI showed superior PFS benefit versus TRAS plus AI in patients with HER2-positive/HR-positive MBC.This combination offers an effective and safe chemotherapy-sparing alternative treatment regimen for this patient population.",1,1,1,1
32889876,"Assessment of Robotic Versus Laparoscopic Distal Gastrectomy for Gastric Cancer: A Randomized Controlled Trial.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the short-term outcomes of patients with GC who received RDG or LDG.SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Despite the increasing use of RDG in patients with GC, its safety and efficacy compared to those of LDG have not been elucidated in a randomized controlled trial.METHODS: Three hundred patients with cT1-4a and N0/+ between September 2017 and January 2020 were enrolled in this randomized controlled trial at a high-volume hospital in China.The short-term outcomes were compared between the groups.RESULTS: The modified intention-to-treat analysis included data from 283 patients (RDG group: n = 141) and (LDG group: n = 142).Patients in the RDG group exhibited faster postoperative recovery, milder inflammatory responses, and reduced postoperative morbidity (9.2% vs 17.6%, respectively, P = 0.039).Higher extraperigastric lymph nodes (LNs) were retrieved in the RDG group (17.6 +/- 5.8 vs 15.8 +/- 6.6, P = 0.018) with lower noncompliance rate (7.7% vs 16.9%, respectively, P = 0.006).Additionally, patients in the RDG group were more likely to initiate adjuvant chemotherapy earlier [median (interquartile range) postoperative days: 28 (24-32) vs 32 (26-42), P = 0.003].Although total hospital costs were higher in the robotic group than in the laparoscopic group, the direct cost was lower for RDG than for LDG (all P < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: RDG is associated with a lower morbidity rate, faster recovery, milder inflammatory responses, and improved lymphadenectomy.Additionally, faster postoperative recovery in the RDG group enables early initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy.Our results provide evidence for the application of RDG in patients with GC.",1,1,1,0
33476595,"Cytoreductive surgery plus hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy versus cytoreductive surgery alone for colorectal peritoneal metastases (PRODIGE 7): a multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: The addition of hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) to cytoreductive surgery has been associated with encouraging survival results in some patients with colorectal peritoneal metastases who were eligible for complete macroscopic resection.We aimed to assess the specific benefit of adding HIPEC to cytoreductive surgery compared with receiving cytoreductive surgery alone.METHODS: We did a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial at 17 cancer centres in France.Eligible patients were aged 18-70 years and had histologically proven colorectal cancer with peritoneal metastases, WHO performance status of 0 or 1, a Peritoneal Cancer Index of 25 or less, and were eligible to receive systemic chemotherapy for 6 months (ie, they had adequate organ function and life expectancy of at least 12 weeks).Patients in whom complete macroscopic resection or surgical resection with less than 1 mm residual tumour tissue was completed were randomly assigned (1:1) to cytoreductive surgery with or without oxaliplatin-based HIPEC.Randomisation was done centrally using minimisation, and stratified by centre, completeness of cytoreduction, number of previous systemic chemotherapy lines, and timing of protocol-mandated systemic chemotherapy.Oxaliplatin HIPEC was administered by the closed (360 mg/m(2)) or open (460 mg/m(2)) abdomen techniques, and systemic chemotherapy (400 mg/m(2) fluorouracil and 20 mg/m(2) folinic acid) was delivered intravenously 20 min before HIPEC.All individuals received systemic chemotherapy (of investigators' choosing) with or without targeted therapy before or after surgery, or both.The primary endpoint was overall survival, which was analysed in the intention-to-treat population.Safety was assessed in all patients who received surgery.This trial is registed with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00769405, and is now completed.FINDINGS: Between Feb 11, 2008, and Jan 6, 2014, 265 patients were included and randomly assigned, 133 to the cytoreductive surgery plus HIPEC group and 132 to the cytoreductive surgery alone group.After median follow-up of 63.8 months (IQR 53.0-77.1), median overall survival was 41.7 months (95% CI 36.2-53.8) in the cytoreductive surgery plus HIPEC group and 41.2 months (35.1-49.7) in the cytoreductive surgery group (hazard ratio 1.00 [95.37% CI 0.63-1.58]; stratified log-rank p=0.99).At 30 days, two (2%) treatment-related deaths had occurred in each group.. Grade 3 or worse adverse events at 30 days were similar in frequency between groups (56 [42%] of 133 patients in the cytoreductive surgery plus HIPEC group vs 42 [32%] of 132 patients in the cytoreductive surgery group; p=0.083); however, at 60 days, grade 3 or worse adverse events were more common in the cytoreductive surgery plus HIPEC group (34 [26%] of 131 vs 20 [15%] of 130; p=0.035).INTERPRETATION: Considering the absence of an overall survival benefit after adding HIPEC to cytoreductive surgery and more frequent postoperative late complications with this combination, our data suggest that cytoreductive surgery alone should be the cornerstone of therapeutic strategies with curative intent for colorectal peritoneal metastases.FUNDING: Institut National du Cancer, Programme Hospitalier de Recherche Clinique du Cancer, Ligue Contre le Cancer.",0,0,0,0
29117336,"Clinical and genetic predictors of paclitaxel neurotoxicity based on patient- versus clinician-reported incidence and severity of neurotoxicity in the ICON7 trial.Background: Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a dose-limiting toxicity of paclitaxel, with no reliable method to identify at-risk patients.We investigated the incidence and risk factors including genetic polymorphisms associated with the development of CIPN based on clinician and patient reporting of neuropathic symptoms.Patients and methods: Risk factors for the development of CIPN were examined in 454 patients treated with paclitaxel/carboplatin from the International Collaboration on Ovarian Neoplasms 7 (ICON7) trial.Neuropathy was graded by clinicians by standard adverse event reporting and by patients utilising OV28 questionnaire.Genetic risk factors were examined by selecting six single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes associated with microtubule function.Risk factors were assessed via dose-to-event cox regression models.Results: Grade >2 neuropathy was reported by clinicians in 28% of patients, while 67% of patients reported 'quite a bit' or 'very much' tingling or numbness.Agreement between clinicians and patients was poor (kappa = 0.236, 95% confidence interval, 0.177-0.296, P < 0.001).Older age, bevacizumab treatment and bowel resection were associated with clinician reported CIPN, while older age and volume of residual disease were associated with patient-reported neuropathy.There were no significant associations between clinician-reported neuropathy or patient-reported neuropathy and TUBB2, CEP72 or individual MAPT or GSK3B SNPs, however MAPT additive polymorphisms were associated with patient-reported neuropathy and GSK3B additive polymorphisms were associated with clinician reported CIPN.Conclusions: There was significant discordance between patient- and clinician-reported neurotoxicity.The lack of consensus regarding optimal outcome measures and whose opinion with regard to CIPN takes precedence is a limitation in the investigation of risk factors for CIPN.Care must be taken to select and include patient-reported outcome measures in CIPN assessment to enable accurate identification of genetic and other risk factors for neuropathy.",0,0,0,0
22321061,"Effects of exemestane and tamoxifen on hormone levels within the Tamoxifen Exemestane Adjuvant Multicentre (TEAM) trial: results of a German substudy.AIM: The aim of this study was to compare the effects of exemestane and tamoxifen on hormone levels in postmenopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer within a Germany substudy of the Tamoxifen Exemestane Adjuvant Multinational (TEAM) trial.METHODS: Within the TEAM trial, patients were randomized to receive adjuvant treatment with exemestane for 5 years or tamoxifen for 2.5-3 years followed by exemestane for 2-2.5 years.Serum levels of testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and parathyroid hormone (PTH)-intact were measured at screening and after 3, 6 and 12 months of treatment.RESULTS: Data on hormone levels were available from 63 patients in the tamoxifen arm and 68 patients in the exemestane arm.Treatment with exemestane resulted in decreases from baseline in SHBG and PTH-intact levels, and increases from baseline in testosterone, DHEAS and FSH levels.Tamoxifen treatment resulted in increases from baseline in SHBG and PTH-intact, whereas levels of testosterone and FSH decreased and DHEAS levels did not change.At all time points assessed, the absolute change from baseline was significantly different between tamoxifen and exemestane for testosterone, SHBG, FSH and PTH-intact (all p < 0.0001).CONCLUSIONS: Exemestane and tamoxifen had statistically significantly different effects on hormone levels, including testosterone, SHBG, FSH and PTH-intact.",1,1,1,1
33880833,"Development and validation of a nomogram to predict intraoperative blood transfusion for gastric cancer surgery.OBJECTIVE: To construct and validate a nomogram composed of preoperative variables to predict intraoperative blood transfusion for gastric cancer surgery.BACKGROUND: Intraoperative transfusion for gastric cancer surgery is a common medical procedure that is associated with increased postoperative complications.METHODS: A total of 999 patients who underwent gastrectomy between January 2010 and June 2019 were randomly allocated into the primary and validation cohorts in a 2:1 ratio.In the primary cohort, logistic analyses were performed to identify independent predictors for transfusion.Using the Akaike information criterion, selected variables were incorporated to construct a nomogram.Validations of the nomogram were performed in the primary and validation cohorts.The discrimination ability of the nomogram was assessed by the concordance index (C-index), and calibration was assessed by calibration curves and the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test.RESULTS: The following risk factors for transfusion were identified and used to construct the nomogram: ASA status (III-IV vs I-II: odds ratio [OR] 1.74), comorbidities (yes vs no: OR 1.57), tumour location (diffuse vs lower: OR 4.05), cTNM stage (III vs I: OR 1.95), and a preoperative haemoglobin level less than 80 g/L (vs over 120 g/L: OR 35.30).The C-index was 0.859 and 0.850 in the primary and validation cohorts, respectively, which both indicated good discrimination of the nomogram.Additionally, both calibration curves and Hosmer-Lemeshow tests (p-value 0.184 and 0.887, respectively) demonstrated high agreement between the predictions and actual outcomes.CONCLUSION: A nomogram composed of preoperative variables to predict blood transfusion for gastric cancer surgery was effectively developed and validated.This nomogram could be used to improve the utilisation of red blood cells for gastrectomy.",0,0,0,0
33539944,"A phase II randomized trial of cobimetinib plus chemotherapy, with or without atezolizumab, as first-line treatment for patients with locally advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (COLET): primary analysis.BACKGROUND: Resistance to standard chemotherapy in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) is associated with upregulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway.Cobimetinib, an MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK) inhibitor, may increase sensitivity to taxanes and programmed death-ligand 1 inhibitors.COLET is a three-cohort phase II study evaluating first-line cobimetinib plus chemotherapy, with or without atezolizumab, in patients with locally advanced or mTNBC.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were >/=18 years with locally advanced or mTNBC.Following a safety run-in, patients in cohort I were randomized 1:1 to cobimetinib (60 mg, D3-D23 of each 28-day cycle) or placebo, plus paclitaxel (80 mg/m(2), D1, 8, and 15).Additional patients were randomized (1:1) to cohort II or III to receive cobimetinib plus atezolizumab (840 mg, D1 and D15) and either paclitaxel (cohort II) or nab-paclitaxel [cohort III (100 mg/m(2), D1, D8, and D15)].Primary endpoints were investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) (cohort I) and confirmed objective response rate (ORR) (cohorts II/III).Safety and tolerability were also assessed.RESULTS: In the expansion stages, median PFS was 5.5 months for cobimetinib/paclitaxel versus 3.8 months for placebo/paclitaxel in cohort I [hazard ratio 0.73; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.43-1.24; P = 0.25].In cohort I, ORR was 38.3% (95% CI 24.40-52.20) for cobimetinib/paclitaxel and 20.9% (95% CI 8.77-33.09) for placebo/paclitaxel; ORRs in cohorts II and III were 34.4% (95% CI 18.57-53.19) and 29.0% (95% CI 14.22-48.04), respectively.Diarrhea was the most common grade >/=3 adverse events across all cohorts.CONCLUSIONS: Cobimetinib added to paclitaxel did not lead to a statistically significant increase in PFS or ORR, although a nonsignificant trend toward a numerical increase was observed.Cobimetinib plus atezolizumab and a taxane did not appear to increase ORR.This demonstrates the potential activity of a combinatorial MEK inhibitor, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy in this difficult-to-treat population.",1,1,1,1

PgR and Ki67 expression were significantly reduced with all treatments (means were -34% to -45%, and -75% to -85%, respectively; all P = 0.0001), with no differences between groups.CONCLUSIONS: In this short-term study, all treatments reduced ER expression, although F and F + A showed greater reductions than A. No significant differences were detected between the treatment groups in terms of PgR and Ki67 expression.No additional reduction in tumor biomarkers with combination treatment was observed, suggesting that F + A is unlikely to have further clinical benefit over F alone.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00259090.",1,1,1,1
22565002,"Randomized phase II trial of everolimus in combination with tamoxifen in patients with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative metastatic breast cancer with prior exposure to aromatase inhibitors: a GINECO study.PURPOSE: Cross-talk between signal transduction pathways likely contributes to hormone resistance in metastatic breast cancer (mBC).Everolimus, an oral inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin, has restored sensitivity in endocrine-resistance models and shown anticancer activity in early-phase mBC clinical trials.This analysis evaluated efficacy and safety of everolimus in combination with tamoxifen in patients with mBC resistant to aromatase inhibitors (AIs).PATIENTS AND METHODS: This open-label, phase II study randomly assigned postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative, AI-resistant mBC to tamoxifen 20 mg/d plus everolimus 10 mg/d (n = 54) or tamoxifen 20 mg/d alone (n = 57).Randomization was stratified by primary and secondary hormone resistance.Primary end point was clinical benefit rate (CBR), defined as the percentage of all patients with a complete or partial response or stable disease at 6 months.No formal statistical comparison between groups was planned.RESULTS: The 6-month CBR was 61% (95% CI, 47 to 74) with tamoxifen plus everolimus and 42% (95% CI, 29 to 56) with tamoxifen alone.Time to progression (TTP) increased from 4.5 months with tamoxifen alone to 8.6 months with tamoxifen plus everolimus, corresponding to a 46% reduction in risk of progression with the combination (hazard ratio [HR], 0.54; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.81).Risk of death was reduced by 55% with tamoxifen plus everolimus versus tamoxifen alone (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.24 to 0.81).The main toxicities associated with tamoxifen plus everolimus were fatigue (72% v 53% with tamoxifen alone), stomatitis (56% v 7%), rash (44% v 7%), anorexia (43% v 18%), and diarrhea (39% v 11%).CONCLUSION: This study suggests that tamoxifen plus everolimus increased CBR, TTP, and overall survival compared with tamoxifen alone in postmenopausal women with AI-resistant mBC.",1,1,1,1
29768118,"Final Overall Survival Analysis From a Study Comparing First-Line Crizotinib Versus Chemotherapy in ALK-Mutation-Positive Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.Purpose The phase III PROFILE 1014 trial compared crizotinib with chemotherapy as first-line treatment in patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) -positive advanced nonsquamous non-small-cell lung cancer.Here, we report the final overall survival (OS) results.Patients and Methods Patients were randomly assigned to receive oral crizotinib 250 mg twice daily (n = 172) or intravenous pemetrexed 500 mg/m(2) plus cisplatin 75 mg/m(2) or carboplatin (area under the concentration-time curve of 5 to 6 mg.mL/min) every 3 weeks for a maximum of six cycles (n = 171).Crossover to crizotinib was permitted after disease progression.OS was analyzed using a stratified log-rank test and a prespecified rank-preserving structural failure time model to account for crossover.Results Median follow-up duration for OS was approximately 46 months for both arms.In the chemotherapy arm, 144 patients (84.2%) received crizotinib in subsequent lines.Hazard ratio for OS was 0.760 (95% CI, 0.548 to 1.053; two-sided P = .0978).Median OS was not reached (NR) with crizotinib (95% CI, 45.8 months to NR) and 47.5 months with chemotherapy (95% CI, 32.2 months to NR).Survival probability at 4 years was 56.6% (95% CI, 48.3% to 64.1%) with crizotinib and 49.1% (95% CI, 40.5% to 57.1%) with chemotherapy.After crossover adjustment, there was an improvement in OS that favored crizotinib (hazard ratio, 0.346; 95% bootstrap CI, 0.081 to 0.718).The longest OS was observed in crizotinib-treated patients who received a subsequent ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor.No new safety signals were identified.Conclusion The final analysis of the PROFILE 1014 study provides a new benchmark for OS in patients with ALK-rearranged non-small-cell lung cancer and highlights the benefit of crizotinib for prolonging survival in this patient population.",1,1,1,1
30345906,"Atezolizumab and Nab-Paclitaxel in Advanced Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.BACKGROUND: Unresectable locally advanced or metastatic triple-negative (hormone-receptor-negative and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [HER2]-negative) breast cancer is an aggressive disease with poor outcomes.Nanoparticle albumin-bound (nab)-paclitaxel may enhance the anticancer activity of atezolizumab.METHODS: In this phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned (in a 1:1 ratio) patients with untreated metastatic triple-negative breast cancer to receive atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel or placebo plus nab-paclitaxel; patients continued the intervention until disease progression or an unacceptable level of toxic effects occurred.Stratification factors were the receipt or nonreceipt of neoadjuvant or adjuvant taxane therapy, the presence or absence of liver metastases at baseline, and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression at baseline (positive vs. negative).The two primary end points were progression-free survival (in the intention-to-treat population and PD-L1-positive subgroup) and overall survival (tested in the intention-to-treat population; if the finding was significant, then it would be tested in the PD-L1-positive subgroup).RESULTS: Each group included 451 patients (median follow-up, 12.9 months).In the intention-to-treat analysis, the median progression-free survival was 7.2 months with atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel, as compared with 5.5 months with placebo plus nab-paclitaxel (hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.69 to 0.92; P=0.002); among patients with PD-L1-positive tumors, the median progression-free survival was 7.5 months and 5.0 months, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.49 to 0.78; P<0.001).In the intention-to-treat analysis, the median overall survival was 21.3 months with atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel and 17.6 months with placebo plus nab-paclitaxel (hazard ratio for death, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.69 to 1.02; P=0.08); among patients with PD-L1-positive tumors, the median overall survival was 25.0 months and 15.5 months, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.86).No new adverse effects were identified.Adverse events that led to the discontinuation of any agent occurred in 15.9% of the patients who received atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel and in 8.2% of those who received placebo plus nab-paclitaxel.CONCLUSIONS: Atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel prolonged progression-free survival among patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer in both the intention-to-treat population and the PD-L1-positive subgroup.Adverse events were consistent with the known safety profiles of each agent.(Funded by F.

26971190,"Comparison of prostate cancer detection at 3-T MRI with and without an endorectal coil: A prospective, paired-patient study.OBJECTIVES: To compare the sensitivity of 2 different non-endorectal coil strategies vs. endorectal coil (ERC) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for detection of prostate cancer (PCa).METHODS: In this prospective, single-center, paired-patient, paired-reader study, 49 men with a clinical indication for MRI underwent non-ERC (phased-array coil only) T2-weighted imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging followed by the same sequences using both ERC and phased-array coils (ERC Protocol).Patients were randomized into 1 of 2 arms: standard non-ERC protocol and augmented non-ERC protocol.Lesions with Likert score>/=3 were defined as suspicious for cancer.Radical prostatectomy specimen or combined systematic plus targeted biopsies served as the standard of reference.Cancers were stratified into risk groups according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines.Generalized estimating equations with Bonferroni correction were used for comparisons.The level of reader confidence was inferred by the Likert scores assigned to index lesions.RESULTS: The ERC protocol provided sensitivity (78%) superior to MRI without ERC for PCa detection, both with a standard (43%) (P<0.0001) or augmented (60%) (P<0.01) protocol.The ERC MRI missed less-intermediate or high-risk index lesions (4%) than standard non-ERC (42%) (P = 0.02) and augmented non-ERC MRI (25%), although the latter did not reach significance (P = 0.09).The ERC improved radiologist confidence for the detection of PCa (average Likert score = 4.2+/-1.4) compared to standard (2.3+/-2.3) and augmented (2.9+/-2.1) non-ERC (P = 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: The use of combined ERC and pelvic phased-array coil for T2-weighted imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging provides superior sensitivity for the detection of PCa compared to an examination performed without the ERC.",0,0,0,0
26447153,"Prospective associations between vitamin D status, vitamin D-related gene polymorphisms, and risk of tobacco-related cancers.BACKGROUND: Experimental evidence has suggested that vitamin D may be protective against tobacco-related cancers through the inhibition of the formation of tumors induced by tobacco carcinogens.To our knowledge, only one previous epidemiologic study investigated the association between vitamin D status and tobacco-related cancer risk, and no study has focused on vitamin D-related gene polymorphisms.OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to prospectively study the association between plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations, vitamin D-related gene polymorphisms, and risk of tobacco-related cancers.DESIGN: A total of 209 tobacco-related cancers were diagnosed within the SU.VI.MAX (Supplementation en vitamines et mineraux antioxydants) cohort (1994-2007) and were matched with 418 controls as part of a nested case-control study.Tobacco-related cancers (i.e., cancers for which tobacco is one of the risk factors) included several sites in the respiratory, digestive, reproductive, and urinary systems.Total plasma 25(OH)D was assessed with the use of an electrochemoluminescent assay.Polymorphisms were determined with the use of a TaqMan assay.Conditional logistic regression models were computed.RESULTS: A 25(OH)D concentration >/=30 ng/mL was associated with reduced risk of tobacco-related cancers (OR for >/=30 compared with <30 ng/mL: 0.59; 95% CI 0.35, 0.99; P = 0.046).This association was observed in former and current smokers (OR for >/=30 compared with <30 ng/mL: 0.43; 95% CI: 0.23, 0.84; P = 0.01) but not in never smokers (P = 0.8).The vitamin D receptor (VDR) FokI AA genotype and retinoid X receptor (RXR) rs7861779 TT genotype were associated with increased risk of tobacco-related cancers [OR for homozygous mutant type (MT) compared with wild type (WT): 1.87; 95% CI: 1.08, 3.23; P-trend = 0.02; OR for heterozygous type (HT) plus MT compared with WT: 1.60; 95% CI: 1.07, 2.38; P = 0.02].CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective study, high vitamin D status [25(OH)D concentration >/=30 ng/mL] was associated with decreased risk of tobacco-related cancers, especially in smokers.These results, which are supported by mechanistic plausibility, suggest that vitamin D may contribute to the prevention of tobacco-induced cancers in smokers and deserve additional investigation.The SU.VI.MAX trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00272428.",0,0,0,0
33002438,"Adjuvant radiotherapy versus early salvage radiotherapy plus short-term androgen deprivation therapy in men with localised prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy (GETUG-AFU 17): a randomised, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Adjuvant radiotherapy reduces the risk of biochemical progression in prostate cancer patients after radical prostatectomy.We aimed to compare adjuvant versus early salvage radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy, combined with short-term hormonal therapy, in terms of oncological outcomes and tolerance.METHODS: GETUG-AFU 17 was a randomised, open-label, multicentre, phase 3 trial done at 46 French hospitals.Men aged at least 18 years who had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 1 or less, localised adenocarcinoma of the prostate treated with radical prostatectomy, who had pathologically-staged pT3a, pT3b, or pT4a (with bladder neck invasion), pNx (without pelvic lymph nodes dissection), or pN0 (with negative lymph nodes dissection) disease, and who had positive surgical margins were eligible for inclusion in the study.Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to either immediate adjuvant radiotherapy or delayed salvage radiotherapy at the time of biochemical relapse.Random assignment, by minimisation, was done using web-based software and stratified by Gleason score, pT stage, and centre.All patients received 6 months of triptorelin (intramuscular injection every 3 months).The primary endpoint was event-free survival.Efficacy and safety analyses were done on the intention-to-treat population.The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00667069.FINDINGS: Between March 7, 2008, and June 23, 2016, 424 patients were enrolled.We planned to enrol 718 patients, with 359 in each study group.However, on May 20, 2016, the independent data monitoring committee recommended early termination of enrolment because of unexpectedly low event rates.At database lock on Dec 19, 2019, the overall median follow-up time from random assignment was 75 months (IQR 50-100), 74 months (47-100) in the adjuvant radiotherapy group and 78 months (52-101) in the salvage radiotherapy group.In the salvage radiotherapy group, 115 (54%) of 212 patients initiated study treatment after biochemical relapse.205 (97%) of 212 patients started treatment in the adjuvant group.5-year event-free survival was 92% (95% CI 86-95) in the adjuvant radiotherapy group and 90% (85-94) in the salvage radiotherapy group (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.48-1.36; log-rank p=0.42).Acute grade 3 or worse toxic effects occurred in six (3%) of 212 patients in the adjuvant radiotherapy group and in four (2%) of 212 patients in the salvage radiotherapy group.Late grade 2 or worse genitourinary toxicities were reported in 125 (59%) of 212 patients in the adjuvant radiotherapy group and 46 (22%) of 212 patients in the salvage radiotherapy group.Late genitourinary adverse events of grade 2 or worse were reported in 58 (27%) of 212 patients in the adjuvant radiotherapy group versus 14 (7%) of 212 patients in the salvage radiotherapy group (p<0.0001).Late erectile dysfunction was grade 2 or worse in 60 (28%) of 212 in the adjuvant radiotherapy group and 17 (8%) of 212 in the salvage radiotherapy group (p<0.0001).INTERPRETATION: Although our analysis lacked statistical power, we found no benefit for event-free survival in patients assigned to adjuvant radiotherapy compared with patients assigned to salvage radiotherapy.Adjuvant radiotherapy increased the risk of genitourinary toxicity and erectile dysfunction.A policy of early salvage radiotherapy could spare men from overtreatment with radiotherapy and the associated adverse events.FUNDING: French Health Ministry and Ipsen.",0,0,0,0
24141698,"Pooled analysis of phase III clinical studies of palonosetron versus ondansetron, dolasetron, and granisetron in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV).PURPOSE: Preventing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is integral to treatment success in patients with cancer.This analysis was undertaken to assess the relative efficacy and safety of palonosetron versus older 5HT3 RAs in preventing CINV associated with moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy.METHODS: Patient-level data from four randomized, double-blind, phase III trials comparing palonosetron 0.25 or 0.75 mg with ondansetron 32 mg, dolasetron 100 mg, or granisetron 40 mug/kg were analyzed.Endpoints included complete response (CR: no emesis and no rescue antiemetics) in the acute (0-24 h), delayed (>24-120 h), and overall (0-120 h) postchemotherapy periods (primary), complete control (CC: no emesis, no rescue antiemetics, and no more than mild nausea), number of emetic episodes, and nausea severity.RESULTS: CR rates were significantly higher for palonosetron (n = 1,787) versus older 5HT3 RAs (n = 1,175) in the delayed (57 vs 45 %, P < 0.0001) and overall periods (51 vs 40 %, P < 0.0001); odds ratios (95 % CI) in the acute, delayed, and overall periods were 1.15 (0.98-1.34), 1.62 (1.40-1.88), and 1.56 (1.34-1.81), respectively.Significant differences in CC rates and nausea severity were observed for the delayed and overall periods and in emetic episodes for all three periods.The incidence of treatment-related adverse events was similar with palonosetron (0.25 mg, 20.0 %; 0.75 mg, 26.5 %) and older 5HT3 RAs (27.5 %).CONCLUSIONS: Palonosetron is more effective than older 5HT3 RAs for controlling CINV in the delayed and overall postchemotherapy periods.",0,0,0,0
24158787,"Everolimus plus exemestane in postmenopausal patients with HR(+) breast cancer: BOLERO-2 final progression-free survival analysis.INTRODUCTION: Effective treatments for hormone-receptor-positive (HR(+)) breast cancer (BC) following relapse/progression on nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI) therapy are needed.Initial Breast Cancer Trials of OraL EveROlimus-2 (BOLERO-2) trial data demonstrated that everolimus and exemestane significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) versus placebo plus exemestane alone in this patient population.METHODS: BOLERO-2 is a phase 3, double-blind, randomized, international trial comparing everolimus (10 mg/day) plus exemestane (25 mg/day) versus placebo plus exemestane in postmenopausal women with HR(+) advanced BC with recurrence/progression during or after NSAIs.The primary endpoint was PFS by local investigator review, and was confirmed by independent central radiology review.Overall survival, response rate, and clinical benefit rate were secondary endpoints.RESULTS: Final study results with median 18-month follow-up show that median PFS remained significantly longer with everolimus plus exemestane versus placebo plus exemestane [investigator review: 7.8 versus 3.2 months, respectively; hazard ratio = 0.45 (95% confidence interval 0.38-0.54); log-rank P < 0.0001; central review: 11.0 versus 4.1 months, respectively; hazard ratio = 0.38 (95% confidence interval 0.31-0.48); log-rank P < 0.0001] in the overall population and in all prospectively defined subgroups, including patients with visceral metastases, [corrected] and irrespective of age.The incidence and severity of adverse events were consistent with those reported at the interim analysis and in other everolimus trials.CONCLUSION: The addition of everolimus to exemestane markedly prolonged PFS in patients with HR(+) advanced BC with disease recurrence/progression following prior NSAIs.These results further support the use of everolimus plus exemestane in this patient population.ClinicalTrials.gov #NCT00863655.",1,1,1,1

25795410,"Nivolumab versus chemotherapy in patients with advanced melanoma who progressed after anti-CTLA-4 treatment (CheckMate 037): a randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Nivolumab, a fully human IgG4 PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor antibody, can result in durable responses in patients with melanoma who have progressed after ipilimumab and BRAF inhibitors.We assessed the efficacy and safety of nivolumab compared with investigator's choice of chemotherapy (ICC) as a second-line or later-line treatment in patients with advanced melanoma.METHODS: In this randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 3 trial, we recruited patients at 90 sites in 14 countries.Eligible patients were 18 years or older, had unresectable or metastatic melanoma, and progressed after ipilimumab, or ipilimumab and a BRAF inhibitor if they were BRAF(V 600) mutation-positive.Participating investigators randomly assigned (with an interactive voice response system) patients 2:1 to receive an intravenous infusion of nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks or ICC (dacarbazine 1000 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks or paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2) combined with carboplatin area under the curve 6 every 3 weeks) until progression or unacceptable toxic effects.We stratified randomisation by BRAF mutation status, tumour expression of PD-L1, and previous best overall response to ipilimumab.We used permuted blocks (block size of six) within each stratum.Primary endpoints were the proportion of patients who had an objective response and overall survival.Treatment was given open-label, but those doing tumour assessments were masked to treatment assignment.We assessed objective responses per-protocol after 120 patients had been treated with nivolumab and had a minimum follow-up of 24 weeks, and safety in all patients who had had at least one dose of treatment.The trial is closed and this is the first interim analysis, reporting the objective response primary endpoint.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01721746.FINDINGS: Between Dec 21, 2012, and Jan 10, 2014, we screened 631 patients, randomly allocating 272 patients to nivolumab and 133 to ICC.Confirmed objective responses were reported in 38 (31.7%, 95% CI 23.5-40.8) of the first 120 patients in the nivolumab group versus five (10.6%, 3.5-23.1) of 47 patients in the ICC group.Grade 3-4 adverse events related to nivolumab included increased lipase (three [1%] of 268 patients), increased alanine aminotransferase, anaemia, and fatigue (two [1%] each); for ICC, these included neutropenia (14 [14%] of 102), thrombocytopenia (six [6%]), and anaemia (five [5%]).We noted grade 3-4 drug-related serious adverse events in 12 (5%) nivolumab-treated patients and nine (9%) patients in the ICC group.No treatment-related deaths occurred.INTERPRETATION: Nivolumab led to a greater proportion of patients achieving an objective response and fewer toxic effects than with alternative available chemotherapy regimens for patients with advanced melanoma that has progressed after ipilimumab or ipilimumab and a BRAF inhibitor.Nivolumab represents a new treatment option with clinically meaningful durable objective responses in a population of high unmet need.FUNDING: Bristol-Myers Squibb.",1,1,1,1
34863145,"A sexual rehabilitation intervention for women with gynaecological cancer receiving radiotherapy (SPARC study): design of a multicentre randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Sexual problems are frequently reported after treatment with radiotherapy (RT) for gynaecological cancer (GC), in particular after combined external beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy (EBRT+BT).Studies demonstrate that psychosexual support should include cognitive behavioural interventions and involvement of the patient's partner, if available.Therefore, we developed a nurse-led sexual rehabilitation intervention, including these key components.The intervention was previously pilot-tested and results demonstrated that this intervention improves women's sexual functioning and increases dilator compliance.The objective of the current study is to investigate the (cost-)effectiveness of the intervention compared to optimal care as usual (CAU).We expect that women who receive the intervention will report a statistically significant greater improvement in sexual functioning and - for women who receive EBRT+BT - higher compliance with dilator use, from baseline to 12 months post-RT than women who receive optimal care as usual (CAU).METHODS/DESIGN: The intervention is evaluated in the SPARC (Sexual rehabilitation Programme After Radiotherapy for gynaecological Cancer) study, a multicentre, randomized controlled trial (RCT).The primary endpoint is sexual functioning.Secondary outcomes include body image, fear of sexual activity, sexual-, treatment-related- and psychological distress, health-related quality of life and relationship satisfaction.A cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) will be conducted in which the costs of the intervention will be related to shifts in other health care costs and the impact on patient outcome.The study sample will consist of 220 women with GC treated with RT in specialized GC treatment centres (N = 10).Participants are randomized to either the intervention- or CAU control group (1:1), and within each centre stratified by type of radiotherapy (EBRT+BT vs. EBRT only) and having a partner (yes/no).All women complete questionnaires at baseline (T1) and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-RT (T2, T3, T4 and T5, respectively).DISCUSSION: There is a need to improve sexual functioning after RT for GC.This RCT will provide evidence about the (cost-)effectiveness of a nurse-led sexual rehabilitation intervention.If proven effective, the intervention will be a much needed addition to care offered to GC survivors and will result in improved quality of life.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03611517 .Registered 2 August 2018.",0,0,0,0
28958502,"Dacomitinib versus gefitinib as first-line treatment for patients with EGFR-mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (ARCHER 1050): a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Dacomitinib is a second-generation, irreversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor.We compared its efficacy and safety with that of the reversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib in the first-line treatment of patients with advanced EGFR-mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).METHODS: In this international, multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3 study (ARCHER 1050), we enrolled adults (aged >/=18 years or >/=20 years in Japan and South Korea) with newly diagnosed advanced NSCLC and one EGFR mutation (exon 19 deletion or Leu858Arg) at 71 academic medical centres and university hospitals in seven countries or special administrative regions.We randomly assigned participants (1:1) to receive oral dacomitinib 45 mg/day (in 28-day cycles) or oral gefitinib 250 mg/day (in 28-day cycles) until disease progression or another discontinuation criterion was met.Randomisation, stratified by race and EGFR mutation type, was done with a computer-generated random code assigned by a central interactive web response system.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival assessed by masked independent review in the intention-to-treat population.Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01774721, and is ongoing but no longer recruiting patients.FINDINGS: Between May 9, 2013, and March 20, 2015, 452 eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive dacomitinib (n=227) or gefitinib (n=225).Median duration of follow-up for progression-free survival was 22.1 months (95% CI 20.3-23.9).Median progression-free survival according to masked independent review was 14.7 months (95% CI 11.1-16.6) in the dacomitinib group and 9.2 months (9.1-11.0) in the gefitinib group (hazard ratio 0.59, 95% CI 0.47-0.74; p<0.0001).The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were dermatitis acneiform (31 [14%] of 227 patients given dacomitinib vs none of 224 patients given gefitinib), diarrhoea (19 [8%] vs two [1%]), and raised alanine aminotransferase levels (two [1%] vs 19 [8%]).Treatment-related serious adverse events were reported in 21 (9%) patients given dacomitinib and in ten (4%) patients given gefitinib.Two treatment-related deaths occurred in the dacomitinib group (one related to untreated diarrhoea and one to untreated cholelithases/liver disease) and one in the gefitinib group (related to sigmoid colon diverticulitis/rupture complicated by pneumonia).INTERPRETATION: Dacomitinib significantly improved progression-free survival over gefitinib in first-line treatment of patients with EGFR-mutation-positive NSCLC and should be considered as a new treatment option for this population.FUNDING: SFJ Pharmaceuticals Group and Pfizer.",1,1,1,1
23643177,"Randomized phase III trial of gemcitabine and cisplatin vs. gemcitabine alone in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer and a performance status of 2: the CAPPA-2 study.Platinum-based chemotherapy is the standard treatment for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but the evidence of its efficacy among ECOG performance status (PS)2 patients is weak because these patients are usually excluded from clinical trials; concern exists about tolerability and feasibility of standard chemotherapy in these patients.No prospective randomized trial has tested the addition of cisplatin to single-agent chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC and PS2.CAPPA-2 was a multicenter, randomized phase 3 study for first-line treatment of PS2 patients with advanced NSCLC.Patients, aged 18-70, were eligible if they had stage IV or IIIB with malignant pleural effusion or metastatic supraclavicular nodes (TNM VI edition) and adequate organ function.Patients in standard arm received gemcitabine 1200 mg/m(2) days 1 and 8.Patients in experimental arm received cisplatin 60 mg/m(2) day 1 plus gemcitabine 1000 mg/m(2) days 1 and 8.All treatments were repeated every 3 weeks, up to 4 cycles, unless disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.Primary endpoint was overall survival (OS).To have 80% power of detecting hazard ratio (HR) 0.71, corresponding to an increase in median OS from 4.8 to 6.8 months, 285 deaths were required.The study was stopped in June 2012 after the enrolment of 57 patients, due to the slow accrual and the report of positive results from a similar study.Median OS was 3.0 months with single-agent gemcitabine and 5.9 months with cisplatin plus gemcitabine (HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.28-0.98, p = 0.039).Combination chemotherapy produced longer PFS (median 1.7 vs. 3.3 months, HR 0.49, 95% CI 0.27-0.89, p = 0.017) and higher response rate (4% vs. 18%, p = 0.19), without substantial increase in toxicity.The addition of cisplatin to single-agent gemcitabine improves survival as first-line treatment of PS2 patients with advanced NSCLC.",1,1,1,0
28352657,"Randomized, placebo-controlled window trial of EGFR, Src, or combined blockade in head and neck cancer.BACKGROUND.EGFR and Src family kinases are upregulated in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).EGFR interacts with Src to activate STAT3 signaling, and dual EGFR-Src targeting is synergistic in HNSCC preclinical models.pSrc overexpression predicted resistance to the EGFR inhibitor, erlotinib, in a prior window trial.We conducted a 4-arm window trial to identify biomarkers associated with response to EGFR and/or Src inhibition.METHODS.Patients with operable stage II-IVa HNSCC were randomized to 7-21 days of neoadjuvant erlotinib, the Src inhibitor dasatinib, the combination of both, or placebo.Paired tumor specimens were collected before and after treatment.Pharmacodynamic expression of EGFR and Src pathway components was evaluated by IHC of tissue microarrays and reverse-phase protein array of tissue lysates.Candidate biomarkers were assessed for correlation with change in tumor size.RESULTS.From April 2009 to December 2012, 58 patients were randomized and 55 were treated.There was a significant decrease in tumor size in both erlotinib arms (P = 0.0014); however, no effect was seen with dasatinib alone (P = 0.24).High baseline pMAPK expression was associated with response to erlotinib (P = 0.03).High baseline pSTAT3 was associated with resistance to dasatinib (P = 0.099).CONCLUSIONS.Brief exposure to erlotinib significantly decreased tumor size in operable HNSCC, with no additive effect from dasatinib.Baseline pMAPK expression warrants further study as a response biomarker for anti-EGFR therapy.Basal expression of pSTAT3 may be independent of Src, explain therapeutic resistance, and preclude development of dasatinib in biomarker-unselected cohorts.TRIAL REGISTRATION.NCT00779389.FUNDING.National Cancer Institute, American Cancer Society, Pennsylvania Department of Health, V Foundation for Cancer Research, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Astellas Pharma.",1,1,1,1

23425564,"Effect of everolimus on bone marker levels and progressive disease in bone in BOLERO-2.BACKGROUND: Breast Cancer Trials of Oral Everolimus 2 (BOLERO-2), a phase III study in postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer progressing despite nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor therapy, showed statistically significant benefits with adding everolimus to exemestane.Moreover, in preclinical studies, mammalian target of rapamycin inhibition was associated with decreased osteoclast survival and activity.Exploratory analyses in BOLERO-2 evaluated the effect of everolimus on bone marker levels and progressive disease in bone.METHODS: Patients were treated with exemestane (25mg/day) and randomized (2:1) to everolimus (10mg/day; combination) or placebo (exemestane only).Exploratory endpoints included changes in bone turnover marker levels vs baseline and progressive disease in bone, defined as unequivocal progression of a preexisting bone lesion or the appearance of a new bone lesion.RESULTS: Baseline disease characteristics were well balanced between arms (N = 724); baseline bisphosphonate use was not (43.9% combination vs 54.0% exemestane only).At a median of 18 months of follow-up, median progression-free survival (primary endpoint) was statistically significantly longer with the combination vs exemestane only (Cox proportional hazard ratio = 0.45, 95% confidence interval = 0.38 to 0.54; log-rank, 1-sided P < .0001).Bone marker levels at 6 and 12 weeks increased with exemestane only, as expected, but decreased with the combination.The cumulative incidence rate of progressive disease in bone was lower in the combination arm.Bone-related adverse events occurred with similar frequency in both arms (3.3% combination vs 4.2% exemestane only).CONCLUSION: These exploratory analyses suggest that everolimus has beneficial effects on bone turnover and progressive disease in bone in patients receiving exemestane for hormone receptor-positive breast cancer progressing during/after nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor therapy.",0,0,0,0
25525672,"Comparing effects in regular practice of e-communication and Web-based self-management support among breast cancer patients: preliminary results from a randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: While Web-based interventions have been shown to assist a wide range of patients successfully in managing their illness, few studies have examined the relative contribution of different Web-based components to improve outcomes.Further efficacy trials are needed to test the effects of Web support when offered as a part of routine care.OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to compare in regular care the effects of (1) an Internet-based patient provider communication service (IPPC), (2) WebChoice, a Web-based illness management system for breast cancer patients (IPPC included), and (3) usual care on symptom distress, anxiety, depression, (primary outcomes), and self-efficacy (secondary outcome).This study reports preliminary findings from 6 months' follow-up data in a 12-month trial.METHODS: We recruited 167 patients recently diagnosed with breast cancer and undergoing treatment from three Norwegian hospitals.The nurse-administered IPPC allowed patients to send secure e-messages to and receive e-messages from health care personnel at the hospital where they were treated.In addition to the IPPC, WebChoice contains components for symptom monitoring, tailored information and self-management support, a diary, and communication with other patients.A total of 20 care providers (11 nurses, 6 physicians, and 3 social workers) were trained to answer questions from patients.Outcomes were measured with questionnaires at study entry and at study months 2, 4, and 6.Linear mixed models for repeated measures were fitted to compare effects on outcomes over time.RESULTS: Patients were randomly assigned to the WebChoice group (n=64), the IPPC group (n=45), or the usual care group (n=58).Response rates to questionnaires were 73.7% (123/167) at 2 months, 65.9 (110/167) at 4 months, and 62.3% (104/167) at 6 months.Attrition was similar in all study groups.Among those with access to WebChoice, 64% (41/64) logged on more than once and 39% (25/64) sent e-messages to care providers.In the IPPC group, 40% (18/45) sent e-messages.Linear mixed models analyses revealed that the WebChoice group reported significantly lower symptom distress (mean difference 0.16, 95% CI 0.06-0.25, P=.001), anxiety (mean difference 0.79, 95% CI 0.09-1.49, P=.03), and depression (mean difference 0.79, 95% CI 0.09-1.49, P=.03) compared with the usual care group.The IPPC group reported significant lower depression scores compared with the usual care group (mean difference 0.69, 95% CI 0.05-1.32, P=.03), but no differences were observed for symptom distress or anxiety.No significant differences in self-efficacy were found among the study groups.CONCLUSIONS: In spite of practice variations and moderate use of the interventions, our results suggest that offering Web support as part of regular care can be a powerful tool to help patients manage their illness.Our finding that a nurse-administered IPPC alone can significantly reduce depression is particularly promising.However, the multicomponent intervention WebChoice had additional positive effects.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov:NCT00971009; http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00971009 (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/6USKezP0Y).",0,0,0,0
31005246,"[Osteopathy for chronic pain after breast cancer surgery: A monocentric randomised study].Twenty-five to 65% of patients suffer from chronic pain after breast cancer.The treatment combines analgesic drugs and psychophysical techniques.HYPOTHESIS: Osteopathy improves the control of pain and the quality of life of patients.METHODS: This randomized prospective single center study allocated patients to the initiation of a standard analgesic treatment exclusively (arm A) or associated to osteopathy (arm B) between from 1 to 12months after surgery.MAIN OBJECTIVE: Intensity of pain (VAS at three months [j90]).SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: Pain (VAS) at 6 and 12 months, analgesic consumption, anxiety/depression (HADS), and Quality of life (QLQ-C30).Eighty patients were planned to observe a 2-point difference in VAS (5% bilateral alpha, 90% power).RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients (A: 14; B: 14, median age 50 years) were included from April 2011 to February 2014; the study was stopped due to a too slow recruitment.No difference in the VAS pain score between arms was observed at j90 (P=0.258), nor at 6 and 12 months.At j90, the HADS depression score was reduced in arm B (P=0.049).Improvement in the overall score of quality of life (P=0.015), and reduced pain sub-score (P=0.021) were observed at j90 in arm B. DISCUSSION: Patients are strongly seeking complementary therapies.Few studies exist.Our study has encountered major recruitment difficulties therefore limiting the interpretation of the results.Despite the absence of difference in the main objective, some other scores (QOL, depression) are noteworthy in favor of osteopathy.Further multicentric studies are needed.",0,0,0,0
24903230,"Effect of inspiration on airway dimensions measured in maximal inspiration CT images of subjects without airflow limitation.OBJECTIVES: To study the effect of inspiration on airway dimensions measured in voluntary inspiration breath-hold examinations.METHODS: 961 subjects with normal spirometry were selected from the Danish Lung Cancer Screening Trial.Subjects were examined annually for five years with low-dose CT.Automated software was utilized to segment lungs and airways, identify segmental bronchi, and match airway branches in all images of the same subject.Inspiration level was defined as segmented total lung volume (TLV) divided by predicted total lung capacity (pTLC).Mixed-effects models were used to predict relative change in lumen diameter (ALD) and wall thickness (AWT) in airways of generation 0 (trachea) to 7 and segmental bronchi (R1-R10 and L1-L10) from relative changes in inspiration level.RESULTS: Relative changes in ALD were related to relative changes in TLV/pTLC, and this distensibility increased with generation (p < 0.001).Relative changes in AWT were inversely related to relative changes in TLV/pTLC in generation 3--7 (p < 0.001).Segmental bronchi were widely dispersed in terms of ALD (5.7 +/- 0.7 mm), AWT (0.86 +/- 0.07 mm), and distensibility (23.5 +/- 7.7%).CONCLUSIONS: Subjects who inspire more deeply prior to imaging have larger ALD and smaller AWT.This effect is more pronounced in higher-generation airways.Therefore, adjustment of inspiration level is necessary to accurately assess airway dimensions.KEY POINTS: Airway lumen diameter increases and wall thickness decreases with inspiration.The effect of inspiration is greater in higher-generation (more peripheral) airways.Airways of generation 5 and beyond are as distensible as lung parenchyma.Airway dimensions measured from CT should be adjusted for inspiration level.",0,0,0,0
33207094,"First-Line Lorlatinib or Crizotinib in Advanced ALK-Positive Lung Cancer.BACKGROUND: Lorlatinib, a third-generation inhibitor of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), has antitumor activity in previously treated patients with ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).The efficacy of lorlatinib, as compared with that of crizotinib, as first-line treatment for advanced ALK-positive NSCLC is unclear.METHODS: We conducted a global, randomized, phase 3 trial comparing lorlatinib with crizotinib in 296 patients with advanced ALK-positive NSCLC who had received no previous systemic treatment for metastatic disease.The primary end point was progression-free survival as assessed by blinded independent central review.Secondary end points included independently assessed objective response and intracranial response.An interim analysis of efficacy was planned after approximately 133 of 177 (75%) expected events of disease progression or death had occurred.RESULTS: The percentage of patients who were alive without disease progression at 12 months was 78% (95% confidence interval [CI], 70 to 84) in the lorlatinib group and 39% (95% CI, 30 to 48) in the crizotinib group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.19 to 0.41; P<0.001).An objective response occurred in 76% (95% CI, 68 to 83) of the patients in the lorlatinib group and 58% (95% CI, 49 to 66) of those in the crizotinib group; among those with measurable brain metastases, 82% (95% CI, 57 to 96) and 23% (95% CI, 5 to 54), respectively, had an intracranial response, and 71% of the patients who received lorlatinib had an intracranial complete response.The most common adverse events with lorlatinib were hyperlipidemia, edema, increased weight, peripheral neuropathy, and cognitive effects.Lorlatinib was associated with more grade 3 or 4 adverse events (mainly altered lipid levels) than crizotinib (in 72% vs. 56%).Discontinuation of treatment because of adverse events occurred in 7% and 9% of the patients, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: In an interim analysis of results among patients with previously untreated advanced ALK-positive NSCLC, those who received lorlatinib had significantly longer progression-free survival and a higher frequency of intracranial response than those who received crizotinib.The incidence of grade 3 or 4 adverse events was higher with lorlatinib than with crizotinib because of the frequent occurrence of altered lipid levels.(Funded by Pfizer; CROWN ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03052608.).",1,1,1,1

22633317,"Prostate-specific antigen kinetics and outcomes in patients with bone metastases from castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with or without zoledronic acid.BACKGROUND: Zoledronic acid (ZOL) is a standard therapy for the prevention of skeletal-related events (SREs) in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).Although prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is an established marker for monitoring prostate cancer patients, correlations between PSA and disease outcomes during ZOL therapy are unclear.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationships among PSA kinetics, bone-directed therapy with ZOL, and clinical outcomes in men with bone metastases from CRPC using a ZOL phase 3 trial database.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Exploratory analyses from a phase 3 trial in men with bone metastases from CRPC (n=643) randomized to ZOL or placebo every 3 wk.OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: PSA levels during the first 3 mo of the study were evaluated in linear and logarithmic (log) models stratified using prognostic factors established in a ZOL phase 3 trial and a CRPC nomogram.Relative risks of SREs, bone disease progression (BDP), and death were calculated per 1 log (nanograms per milliliter) PSA increase.Baseline PSA models used the study median (PSA: 77.3 ng/ml) as the high/low cut-off point.RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: A total of 202 placebo- and 434 ZOL-treated patients were assessable.In both groups, PSA increases correlated with significantly increased risks of death, BDP, and first SRE.In the placebo and ZOL groups, associated increases in risk per 1 log (nanograms per milliliter) PSA increase were 29% (p<0.0001) and 10% (p<0.0074), respectively, for BDP, and 24% (p=0.0010) and 13% (p=0.0079), respectively, for first SRE.Limitations include the retrospective nature of these analyses and the potential confounding effects of concurrent antineoplastic therapies.CONCLUSIONS: PSA is an important prognostic tool for survival in patients with bone metastases from CRPC, and these analyses show that PSA is also prognostic for BDP and SREs regardless of bone-targeted therapy.",1,1,1,0
34688374,"Neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade with toripalimab, with or without celecoxib, in mismatch repair-deficient or microsatellite instability-high, locally advanced, colorectal cancer (PICC): a single-centre, parallel-group, non-comparative, randomised, phase 2 trial.BACKGROUND: PD-1 blockade is highly effective in patients with mismatch repair-deficient or microsatellite instability-high metastatic colorectal cancer.The role of single-agent PD-1 blockade in the neoadjuvant setting for resectable mismatch repair-deficient or microsatellite instability-high colorectal cancer remains unclear.We investigated the efficacy and safety of PD-1 blockade with toripalimab, with or without the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib, as neoadjuvant treatment for mismatch repair-deficient or microsatellite instability-high, locally advanced, colorectal cancers.METHODS: The PD-1 Inhibitor in Microsatellite Instability Colorectal Cancer (PICC) trial was a single-centre, open-label, parallel-group, non-comparative, randomised, phase 2 study undertaken at the Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University (Guangzhou, China).Eligible patients were aged 18-75 years, had histologically confirmed mismatch repair-deficient or microsatellite instability-high colorectal cancer, had clinical stage T3-T4 or any T with lymph node positivity (N+), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score of 0 or 1, and adequate haematological, hepatic, and renal function.Participants were randomly assigned (1:1), without any stratification or balanced blocking, to receive toripalimab 3 mg/kg intravenously on day 1, with or without celecoxib 200 mg orally twice daily from day 1 to 14 of each 14-day cycle, for six cycles before surgical resection.Adjuvant treatment with toripalimab with or without celecoxib was permitted at the investigators' discretion.The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with pathological complete response, defined as tumours without any viable tumour cells in the resected primary tumour sample and all sampled regional lymph nodes.All efficacy and safety analyses were assessed in the modified intention-to-treat population, which included all patients who were randomly assigned to treatment and who received at least one dose of toripalimab.This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03926338, and is ongoing.FINDINGS: Between May 1, 2019, and April 1, 2021, 53 patients were screened, of whom 34 were randomly assigned to either the toripalimab plus celecoxib group (n=17) or the toripalimab monotherapy group (n=17).As of data cutoff (Aug 10, 2021), median follow-up was 14.9 months (IQR 8.8-17.0).All patients received study treatment and underwent surgical resection; there were no treatment-related surgical delays.All 34 patients had an R0 resection (>1 mm resection margin).15 of 17 patients (88% [95% CI 64-99]) in the toripalimab plus celecoxib group and 11 of 17 patients (65% [38-86]) in the toripalimab monotherapy group had a pathological complete response.All patients continued to receive adjuvant toripalimab with or without celecoxib for a total perioperative duration of 6 months and were alive and free of recurrence at data cutoff.During neoadjuvant treatment, ten (59%) patients in the toripalimab plus celecoxib group and ten (59%) in the toripalimab monotherapy group had grade 1-2 treatment-related adverse events.Only one (3%) of 34 patients, who was in the toripalimab plus celecoxib group, had a grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse event during the neoadjuvant phase, which was grade 3 increased aspartate aminotransferase levels.In the adjuvant phase, only one (3%) of 34 patients, who was in the toripalimab monotherapy group, had a grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events, which was grade 3 increased aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels.INTERPRETATION: Neoadjuvant toripalimab with or without celecoxib could be a potential therapeutic option for patients with mismatch repair deficient or microsatellite instability-high, locally advanced, colorectal cancer.This treatment was associated with a high pathological complete response rate and an acceptable safety profile, which did not compromise surgery.Longer term follow-up is needed to assess effects on survival-related endpoints.FUNDING: The National Key R&D Program of China, the National Natural Science Foundation of China, and the Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology-Junshi Biosciences Oncology Immunity Research.TRANSLATION: For the Chinese translation of the abstract see Supplementary Materials section.",1,1,1,1
30479292,"Assessing the Psychological Impact of Daily Bowel Preparation on Prostate Patients Who Receive Radiation Therapy.PURPOSE: Evidence has shown that the prostate moves depending on filling of the rectum and, to a lesser extent, the bladder; many radiation therapy departments have adopted standardized bladder filling/rectal emptying protocols for radiotherapy treatment.Daily treatments may be delayed until appropriate volumes are attained; the resultant psychological impact of these delays on patients is unknown.The purpose of this study was to determine levels of anxiety, depression, distress, and bother related to bowel preparation for prostate cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy treatment.METHODS: A prospective cohort analysis of prostate cancer patients undergoing external beam radiation therapy was completed.Patients were assigned to one of three groups; Group A was standard of care, Group B was standard of care plus increased educational information regarding bowel preparation, Group C was standard of care plus increased educational information regarding bowel preparation plus an anti-flatulent medication.Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Distress Thermometer, and a Bowel Status Bother survey were completed by participants at the start of theircourse of radiation treatment, mid-way through, and at the end.Analysis of variance testing was completed to determine differences in mean scores between the three groups.RESULTS: Mean age of patients (N = 30) was 66 years; 50% of the participants had a university education; 80% were married.Anxiety levels decreased over time in all groups (P = .039) with no difference between groups (P = 0.447).Depression levels across time for each group remained low (P = .577).Overall distress levels associated with bowel preparation were low among each group, and no significant differences were reported (P = .978).All groups reported high rates of quality of life.CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study indicate that collectively across three groups and over time, there were low levels of anxiety, depression, and distress from bowel preparation.Amount, timing, quality, and approach to educational information are important factors to ensure patients feel prepared for their radiation therapy treatments.",0,0,0,0

27184721,"Independent radiologic review of AURELIA, a phase 3 trial of bevacizumab plus chemotherapy for platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer.OBJECTIVE: The randomized, open-label, phase 3 Avastin(R) Use in Platinum-Resistant Epithelial Ovarian Cancer (AURELIA) trial achieved its primary efficacy end point of significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) in patients treated with bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy (CT) compared with CT alone for platinum-resistant, recurrent ovarian cancer.Primary analyses were conducted via investigator assessment of PFS; to confirm primary results, an independent review committee (IRC) retrospectively assessed radiographic data.METHODS: Per an amendment to the original study protocol, the IRC reviewed radiographic data from 298 (82.5%) patients in a blinded manner using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (modified version 1.0).IRC-assessed PFS and concordance between the two assessments were evaluated.RESULTS: IRC assessment demonstrated that PFS was significantly prolonged for patients treated with CT+bevacizumab compared with CT alone (median, 8.1 vs. 3.9months; hazard ratio, 0.484; 95% confidence interval, 0.370-0.632; P<0.0001).Results were similar to the primary PFS analysis from investigator assessment (median, 6.8 vs. 3.4months; hazard ratio, 0.384; 95% confidence interval, 0.300-0.491; P<0.0001).Concordance rates for progressive disease status (CT+bevacizumab, 68.2%; CT, 69.9%) and date (CT+bevacizumab, 67.2%; CT, 69.1%) were similar across treatment arms.Among 161 IRC-evaluable patients declared to have progressive disease by investigator and IRC assessment, 68.3% progressed on the same date as determined by both investigator and IRC.CONCLUSIONS: IRC assessment of PFS confirmed the investigator-assessed PFS improvement for patients treated with CT+bevacizumab compared with CT alone in the AURELIA study.",0,0,0,0
31628954,"Underwater versus conventional endoscopic resection of nondiminutive nonpedunculated colorectal lesions: a prospective randomized controlled trial (with video).BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Incomplete resection of colorectal neoplasia decreases the efficacy of colonoscopy.Conventional resection (CR) of polyps, performed in a gas-distended colon, is the current standard, but incomplete resection rates of approximately 2% to 30% for nondiminutive (>5 mm), nonpedunculated lesions are reported.Underwater resection (UR) is a novel technique.The aim of this study was to determine the incomplete resection rates of colorectal lesions removed by UR versus CR.METHODS: In a randomized controlled trial, patients with small (6-9 mm) and large (>/=10 mm) nonpedunculated lesions were assigned to CR (gas-distended lumen) or UR (water-filled, gas-excluded lumen).Small lesions in both arms were removed with a dedicated cold snare.For CR, large lesions were removed with a hot snare after submucosal injection.For UR, large lesions were removed with a hot snare without submucosal injection.Four-quadrant biopsy samples around the resection sites were used to evaluate for incomplete resection.RESULTS: Four hundred sixty-two eligible polyps (248 UR vs 214 CR) from 255 patients were removed.Incomplete resection rates for UR and CR were low and did not differ (2% vs 1.9%, P = .91).UR was performed significantly faster for lesions >/=10mm in size (10-19 mm, 2.9 minutes vs 5.6 minutes, P < .0001); >/=20 mm, 7.3 minutes vs 9.5 minutes, P = .015).CONCLUSIONS: Low incomplete resection rates are achievable with UR and CR.UR is effective and safe with the advantage of faster resection and potential cost savings for removal of larger (>/=10 mm) lesions by avoiding submucosal injection.As an added approach, UR has potential to improve the cost-effectiveness of colonoscopy by increasing efficiency and reducing cost while maintaining quality.(Clinical trial registration number: NCT02889679.).",0,0,0,0
27573561,"Subgroup analysis in RAISE: a randomized, double-blind phase III study of irinotecan, folinic acid, and 5-fluorouracil (FOLFIRI) plus ramucirumab or placebo in patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma progression.BACKGROUND: The RAISE phase III clinical trial demonstrated that ramucirumab + FOLFIRI improved overall survival (OS) [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.844, P = 0.0219] and progression-free survival (PFS) (HR = 0.793, P < 0.0005) compared with placebo + FOLFIRI for second-line metastatic colorectal carcinoma (mCRC) patients previously treated with first-line bevacizumab, oxaliplatin, and a fluoropyrimidine.Since some patient or disease characteristics could be associated with differential efficacy or safety, prespecified subgroup analyses were undertaken.This report focuses on three of the most relevant ones: KRAS status (wild-type versus mutant), age (<65 versus >/=65 years), and time to progression (TTP) on first-line therapy (<6 versus >/=6 months).PATIENTS AND METHODS: OS and PFS were evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier analysis, with HR determined by the Cox proportional hazards model.Treatment-by-subgroup interaction was tested to determine whether treatment effect was consistent between subgroup pairs.RESULTS: Patients with both wild-type and mutant KRAS benefited from ramucirumab + FOLFIRI treatment over placebo + FOLFIRI (interaction P = 0.526); although numerically, wild-type KRAS patients benefited more (wild-type KRAS: median OS = 14.4 versus 11.9 months, HR = 0.82, P = 0.049; mutant KRAS: median OS = 12.7 versus 11.3 months, HR = 0.89, P = 0.263).Patients with both longer and shorter first-line TTP benefited from ramucirumab (interaction P = 0.9434), although TTP <6 months was associated with poorer OS (TTP >/=6 months: median OS = 14.3 versus 12.5 months, HR = 0.86, P = 0.061; TTP <6 months: median OS = 10.4 versus 8.0 months, HR = 0.86, P = 0.276).The subgroups of patients >/=65 versus <65 years also derived a similar ramucirumab survival benefit (interaction P = 0.9521) (>/=65 years: median OS = 13.8 versus 11.7 months, HR = 0.85, P = 0.156; <65 years: median OS = 13.1 versus 11.9 months, HR = 0.86, P = 0.098).The safety profile of ramucirumab + FOLFIRI was similar across subgroups.CONCLUSIONS: These analyses revealed similar efficacy and safety among patient subgroups with differing KRAS mutation status, longer or shorter first-line TTP, and age.Ramucirumab is a beneficial addition to second-line FOLFIRI treatment for a wide range of patients with mCRC.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01183780.",1,1,1,1

32975708,"Randomized phase II clinical trial and biomarker analysis of paclitaxel plus epirubicin versus vinorelbine plus epirubicin as neoadjuvant chemotherapy in locally advanced HER2-negative breast cancer with TEKT4 variations.PURPOSE: Resistance to paclitaxel remains a major challenge in treating breast cancer.Our preclinical study suggested that TEKT4 germline variations in breast cancer are associated with paclitaxel resistance and increase vinorelbine sensitivity.This clinical trial compared the efficacy of paclitaxel and vinorelbine in breast cancer neoadjuvant chemotherapy.METHODS: In this open-label, single-center, phase II trial, female patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, stage IIB-IIIC breast cancer harboring TEKT4 germline variations were randomly assigned to the paclitaxel plus epirubicin (PE) or vinorelbine plus epirubicin (NE).The primary endpoint was the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate, and the secondary endpoints were the objective response rate (ORR) and safety.Targeted sequencing of a panel comprising 484 breast-related genes was performed to identify pCR-associated somatic mutations in each group.RESULTS: 91 Patients were assigned to PE (46 patients) or NE (45 patients).NE numerically increased the pCR rate (22.2% versus 8.7%, P = 0.074).The ORRs for NE and PE were 82.2% and 76.1%, respectively.Interestingly, NE (15.4%) showed a significantly higher pCR rate than PE (0%) in the hormone receptor (HR)-positive subgroup (P = 0.044).Both regimens were well tolerated, with grade 3 and 4 toxicities reported at the expected levels.The biomarker analysis showed that UNC13D mutation predicted the pCR rate in NE (P = 0.011).CONCLUSIONS: Although the primary endpoint was not met, NE might bring clinical benefit to HR-positive patients or patients simultaneously carrying UNC13D mutations.",1,1,1,1
28800861,"Ipatasertib plus paclitaxel versus placebo plus paclitaxel as first-line therapy for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (LOTUS): a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial.BACKGROUND: The oral AKT inhibitor ipatasertib is being investigated in cancers with a high prevalence of PI3K/AKT pathway activation, including triple-negative breast cancer.The LOTUS trial investigated the addition of ipatasertib to paclitaxel as first-line therapy for triple-negative breast cancer.METHODS: In this randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase 2 trial, women aged 18 years or older with measurable, inoperable, locally advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer previously untreated with systemic therapy were recruited from 44 hospitals in South Korea, the USA, France, Spain, Taiwan, Singapore, Italy, and Belgium.Enrolled patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive intravenous paclitaxel 80 mg/m(2) (days 1, 8, 15) with either ipatasertib 400 mg or placebo once per day (days 1-21) every 28 days until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.Randomisation was by stratified permuted blocks (block size of four) using an interactive web-response system with three stratification criteria: previous (neo)adjuvant therapy, chemotherapy-free interval, and tumour PTEN status.The co-primary endpoints were progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population and progression-free survival in the PTEN-low (by immunohistochemistry) population.This ongoing trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02162719).FINDINGS: Between Sept 2, 2014, and Feb 4, 2016, 166 patients were assessed for eligibility and 124 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to paclitaxel plus ipatasertib (n=62) or paclitaxel plus placebo (n=62).Median follow-up was 10.4 months (IQR 6.5-14.1) in the ipatasertib group and 10.2 months (6.0-13.6) in the placebo group.Median progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population was 6.2 months (95% CI 3.8-9.0) with ipatasertib versus 4.9 months (3.6-5.4) with placebo (stratified hazard ratio [HR] 0.60, 95% CI 0.37-0.98; p=0.037) and in the 48 patients with PTEN-low tumours, median progression-free survival was 6.2 months (95% CI 3.6-9.1) with ipatasertib versus 3.7 months (1.9-7.3) with placebo (stratified HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.26-1.32, p=0.18).The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events were diarrhoea (14 [23%] of 61 ipatasertib-treated patients vs none of 62 placebo-treated patients), neutrophil count decreased (five [8%] vs four [6%]), and neutropenia (six [10%] vs one [2%]).No colitis, grade 4 diarrhoea, or treatment-related deaths were reported with ipatasertib.One treatment-related death occurred in the placebo group.Serious adverse events were reported in 17 (28%) of 61 patients in the ipatasertib group and nine (15%) of 62 patients in the placebo group.INTERPRETATION: Progression-free survival was longer in patients who received ipatasertib than in those who received placebo.To our knowledge, these are the first results supporting AKT-targeted therapy for triple-negative breast cancer.Ipatasertib warrants further investigation for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer.FUNDING: F Hoffmann-La Roche.",1,1,1,1
29413685,"PICCA study: panitumumab in combination with cisplatin/gemcitabine chemotherapy in KRAS wild-type patients with biliary cancer-a randomised biomarker-driven clinical phase II AIO study.BACKGROUND: Combination chemotherapy has shown benefit in the treatment of biliary cancer and further improvements might be achieved by the addition of a biological agent.We report here the effect of chemotherapy with the monoclonal EGFR antibody panitumumab as therapy for KRAS wild-type biliary cancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with advanced biliary tract cancer were randomised (2:1) to receive cisplatin 25 mg/m(2) and gemcitabine 1000 mg/m(2) on day 1 and day 8/q3w with (arm A) or without panitumumab (arm B; 9 mg/kg BW, i.v q3w).The primary end-point was the evaluation of progression-free survival (PFS) at 6 months.Secondary end-points included objective response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), and toxicity.In addition, a post hoc assessment of genetic alterations was performed.Finally, we performed a meta-analysis of trials with chemotherapy with and without EGFR antibodies.RESULTS: Sixty-two patients were randomised in arm A and 28 patients in arm B. Patients received 7 treatment cycles in median (1-35) with a median treatment duration of 4.7 months (141 days, 8-765).PFS rate at 6 months was 54% in patients treated with cisplatin/gemcitabine and panitumumab but was 73% in patients treated with cisplatin/gemcitabine without antibody, respectively.Secondary end-points were an ORR of 45% in treatment arm A compared with 39% receiving treatment B and a median OS of 12.8 months (arm A) and of 20.1 months (arm B), respectively.In contrast to the p53-status, genetic alterations in IDH1/2 were linked to a high response after chemotherapy and prolonged survival.In accordance with our results, the meta-analysis of 12 trials did not reveal a survival advantage for patients treated with EGFR antibodies compared with chemotherapy alone.CONCLUSIONS: Panitumumab in combination with chemotherapy does not improve ORR, PFS and OS in patients with KRAS wild-type, advanced biliary cancer.Genetic profiling should be included in CCA trials to identify and validate predictive and prognostic biomarkers.CLINICAL TRIALS NUMBER: The trial was registered with NCT01320254.",1,1,1,1
28743247,"A randomized phase II study of paclitaxel alone versus paclitaxel plus sorafenib in second- and third-line treatment of patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer (PASO).BACKGROUND: We conducted an open-label, randomized, two-arm multi-center study to assess the efficacy and safety of paclitaxel versus paclitaxel + sorafenib in patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer.METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive either paclitaxel monotherapy (80 mg/m(2)) weekly (3 weeks on, 1 week off) plus sorafenib 400 mg orally, twice a day taken continuously throughout 28 day cycles.Sorafenib dose was gradually escalated from a starting dose of 200 mg twice a day.The primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS).RESULTS: A pre-planned efficacy interim analysis was performed on the data of 60 patients, 30 patients in each treatment arm.Median PFS was estimated at 6.6 months (95% CI: 5.1 to 9.0) in patients randomized to single-agent paclitaxel (Arm A) and 5.6 months (95% CI: 3.8 to 6.5) in patients randomized to paclitaxel-sorafenib combination (Arm B) therapy.Contrary to the hypothesis, the treatment effect was statistically significant in favor of paclitaxel monotherapy (hazard ratio 1.80, 95% CI: 1.02 to 3.20; log-rank test P = 0.0409).It was decided to stop the trial early for futility.Median OS was also in favor of Arm A (20.7 months (95% CI: 16.4 to 26.7) versus 12.1 months (95% CI: 5.8 to 20.4) in Arm B. Clinical control was achieved in 28 patients (93.3%) in Arm A and in 21 patients 70.0% in Arm B. Overall response rate was met in 43.3% of patients in Arm A and in 40.0% in Arm B. Toxicities were increased in Arm B with higher rates of diarrhea, nausea, neutropenia, hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) and anorexia, Grad 3 and 4 toxicities were rare.CONCLUSIONS: In this pre-planned interim analysis, paclitaxel-sorafenib combination therapy was not found to be superior to paclitaxel monotherapy with regard to the primary end point, progression-free survival.The trial was therefore discontinued early.There was no indication of more favorable outcomes for combination therapy in secondary efficacy end points.As expected, the safety and toxicity profile of the combination therapy was less favorable compared to monotherapy.Overall, this trial did not demonstrate that adding sorafenib to second- or third-line paclitaxel provides any clinical benefit to patients with HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer.Cautious dosing using a sorafenib ramp up schedule might have contributed to negative results.TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered at EudraCT (No 2009-018025-73) and retrospectively registered at Clinical trials.gov on March 17, 2011 ( NCT01320111 ).",1,1,1,1

25366707,"The impact of radiologists' expertise on screen results decisions in a CT lung cancer screening trial.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of radiological expertise on screen result decisions in a CT lung cancer screening trial.METHODS: In the NELSON lung cancer screening trial, the baseline CT result was based on the largest lung nodule's volume.The protocol allowed radiologists to manually adjust screen results in cases of high suspicion of benign or malignant nodule nature.Participants whose baseline CT result was based on a solid or part-solid nodule were included in this study.Adjustments by radiologists at baseline were evaluated.Histology was the reference for diagnosis or to confirm benignity and stability on subsequent CT examinations.RESULTS: A total of 3,318 participants (2,796 male, median age 58.0 years) were included.In 195 participants (5.9 %) the initial baseline screen result was adjusted by the radiologist.Adjustment was downwards from positive or indeterminate to negative in two and 119 participants, respectively, and from positive to indeterminate in 65 participants.None of these nodules turned out to be malignant.In 9/195 participants (4.6 %) the screen result was adjusted upwards from negative to indeterminate or indeterminate to positive; two nodules were malignant.CONCLUSION: In one in 20 cases of baseline lung cancer screening, nodules were reclassified by the radiologist, leading to a reduction of false-positive screen results.",0,0,0,0
31526892,"Impact of choice of volumetry software and nodule management guidelines on recall rates in lung cancer screening.PURPOSE: Appropriate lung nodule management is essential to minimizing unnecessary patient recall in lung cancer screening.Two European guidelines provide differing recommendations in that participants with nodules >/=100 mm(3) or >/=80 mm(3) respectively should be recalled, at baseline.Nodule size estimation is known to vary between volumetry software packages (VSPs).The aim of this study was to examine the impact of choice of VSP on participant recall rates, when applying different European nodule management guidelines.An additional aim was to compare recall rates between 7 VSPs and manual diameter measurements.METHODS: 156 small-sized lung nodules (50-150 mm(3)) from the UK Lung Screening trial were measured using 7 different VSPs (VSP1-7) and also using manual diameter.The type of VSP used in the NELSON study (VSP1), on which European nodule management guidelines are based, provided the reference standard.Nodule size was compared using Bland Altman, and recall rates by Mcnemar's test.RESULTS: Compared to the reference standard, a 100 mm(3) threshold for recall, resulted in no difference in recall rates only for VSP 5 & 7.Using an 80mm(3) threshold resulted in no difference in recall rates for VSP2 & 6.Recall rates were significantly higher for VSP 4 regardless of threshold and when using manual diameter measurements.CONCLUSIONS: Appropriate nodule size thresholds for recall in screening depend on the type of volumetry software used.The results highlight the importance of benchmarking of volumetry packages.",0,0,0,0

22146893,"An immune-active tumor microenvironment favors clinical response to ipilimumab.PURPOSE: Ipilimumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody specific to CTLA-4, has been shown to improve overall survival in metastatic melanoma patients.As a consequence of CTLA-4 blockade, ipilimumab treatment is associated with proliferation and activation of peripheral T cells.To better understand various tumor-associated components that may influence the clinical outcome of ipilimumab treatment, gene expression profiles of tumors from patients treated with ipilimumab were characterized.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Gene expression profiling was performed on tumor biopsies collected from 45 melanoma patients before and 3 weeks after the start of treatment in a phase II clinical trial.RESULTS: Analysis of pre-treatment tumors indicated that patients with high baseline expression levels of immune-related genes were more likely to respond favorably to ipilimumab.Furthermore, ipilimumab appeared to induce two major changes in tumors from patients who exhibited clinical activity: genes involved in immune response showed increased expression, whereas expression of genes for melanoma-specific antigens and genes involved in cell proliferation decreased.These changes were associated with the total lymphocyte infiltrate in tumors, and there was a suggestion of association with prolonged overall survival in these patients.Many IFN-gamma-inducible genes and Th1-associated markers showed increased expression after ipilimumab treatment, suggesting an accumulation of this particular type of T cell at the tumor sites, which might play an important role in mediating the antitumor activity of ipilimumab.CONCLUSIONS: These results support the proposed mechanism of action of ipilimumab, suggesting that cell-mediated immune responses play an important role in the antitumor activity of ipilimumab.",0,0,0,0

24906586,"Effectiveness of energy healing on Quality of Life: a pragmatic intervention trial in colorectal cancer patients.PURPOSE: Our aim was to explore the effectiveness of energy healing, a commonly used complementary and alternative therapy, on well-being in cancer patients while assessing the possible influence on the results of participating in a randomized controlled trial.METHODS: 247 patients treated for colorectal cancer (response rate: 31.5%) were either (a) randomized to healing (RH) or control (RC) or (b) had self selected the healing (SH) or control condition (SC), and completed questionnaires assessing well-being (QoL, depressive symptoms, mood, and sleep quality), attitude toward complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), and faith/spirituality at baseline, 1 week, and 2 months post-intervention.They also indicated, at baseline, whether they considered QoL, depressive symptoms, mood, and sleep quality as important outcomes to them.RESULTS: Multilevel linear models revealed no overall effect of healing on QoL (p = 0.156), depressive symptoms (p = 0.063), mood (p = 0.079), or sleep quality (p = 0.346) in the intervention groups (RH, SH) compared with control (SC).Effects of healing on mood were only found for patients who had a positive attitude toward CAM and considered the outcome in question as important (SH: Regression coefficient: -8.78; SE: 2.64; CI: -13.96 to -3.61; p = 0.001, and RH: Regression coefficient -7.45; SE: 2.76; CI: -12.86 to -2.04; p = 0.007).CONCLUSION: Whereas it is generally assumed that CAMs such as healing have beneficial effects on well-being, our results indicated no overall effectiveness of energy healing on QoL, depressive symptoms, mood, and sleep quality in colorectal cancer patients.Effectiveness of healing on well-being was, however, related to factors such as self-selection and a positive attitude toward the treatment.",0,0,0,0
31473189,"Accrual of older adults to cancer clinical trials led by the Canadian cancer trials group - Is trial design a barrier?BACKGROUND: Older adults (OA), aged 65years and over, are under-represented in studies.Strict exclusion criteria have been identified as a potential barrier to accrual of OA.This study aims to determine: 1) whether accrual of OA to trials led by the Canadian Cancer Trials Group (CCTG) has increased since 2003; 2) whether exclusion criteria have broadened over time; 3) whether exclusion criteria are associated with lower accrual of OA.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Phase III and randomized phase II CCTG-led trials initiated from 1990 onwards were included.Trial protocols were reviewed for exclusion criteria.Associations between trial characteristics and percentage of OA accrued were compared using multivariate linear regression modelling.The frequency of exclusion criteria in trials initiated pre- and post-2003 was compared using the Chi-Square test or Fisher exact test.RESULTS: Sixty-nine trials involving 34,957 patients were included.Accrual of OA to trials remained low compared to OA diagnosed with cancer in Canada (40.8% vs. 56.1%, p<.001).There was a small increase in the accrual of OA since 2003 (42.8% vs. 39.3%, p=.04).There was no relaxation of exclusion criteria over time.Studies initiated prior to 2003, breast cancer studies and studies with exclusion criteria based on renal dysfunction were associated with lower accrual of OA (p<.05).Central nervous system studies were associated with higher accrual of OA (p=.03).CONCLUSION: OA remain under-represented in trials.While there has been minimal change in exclusion criteria over time, renal dysfunction was the only exclusion criteria associated with lower accrual of OA.",0,0,0,0
25722381,"A randomized phase II study of the MEK1/MEK2 inhibitor trametinib (GSK1120212) compared with docetaxel in KRAS-mutant advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)dagger.BACKGROUND: KRAS mutations are detected in 25% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and no targeted therapies are approved for this subset population.Trametinib, a selective allosteric inhibitor of MEK1/MEK2, demonstrated preclinical and clinical activity in KRAS-mutant NSCLC.We report a phase II trial comparing trametinib with docetaxel in patients with advanced KRAS-mutant NSCLC.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients with histologically confirmed KRAS-mutant NSCLC previously treated with one prior platinum-based chemotherapy were randomly assigned in a ratio of 2 : 1 to trametinib (2 mg orally once daily) or docetaxel (75 mg/m(2) i.v.every 3 weeks).Crossover to the other arm after disease progression was allowed.Primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS).The study was prematurely terminated after the interim analysis of 92 PFS events, which showed the comparison of trametinib versus docetaxel for PFS crossed the futility boundary.RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-nine patients with KRAS-mutant NSCLC were randomized; of which, 86 patients received trametinib and 43 received docetaxel.Median PFS was 12 weeks in the trametinib arm and 11 weeks in the docetaxel arm (hazard ratio [HR] 1.14; 95% CI 0.75-1.75; P = 0.5197).Median overall survival, while the data are immature, was 8 months in the trametinib arm and was not reached in the docetaxel arm (HR 0.97; 95% CI 0.52-1.83; P = 0.934).There were 10 (12%) partial responses (PRs) in the trametinib arm and 5 (12%) PRs in the docetaxel arm (P = 1.0000).The most frequent adverse events (AEs) in >/=20% of trametinib patients were rash, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue.The most frequent grade 3 treatment-related AEs in the trametinib arm were hypertension, rash, diarrhea, and asthenia.CONCLUSION: Trametinib showed similar PFS and a response rate as docetaxel in patients with previously treated KRAS-mutant-positive NSCLC.CLINICALTRIALSGOV REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT01362296.",1,1,1,1
32975708,"Randomized phase II clinical trial and biomarker analysis of paclitaxel plus epirubicin versus vinorelbine plus epirubicin as neoadjuvant chemotherapy in locally advanced HER2-negative breast cancer with TEKT4 variations.PURPOSE: Resistance to paclitaxel remains a major challenge in treating breast cancer.Our preclinical study suggested that TEKT4 germline variations in breast cancer are associated with paclitaxel resistance and increase vinorelbine sensitivity.This clinical trial compared the efficacy of paclitaxel and vinorelbine in breast cancer neoadjuvant chemotherapy.METHODS: In this open-label, single-center, phase II trial, female patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, stage IIB-IIIC breast cancer harboring TEKT4 germline variations were randomly assigned to the paclitaxel plus epirubicin (PE) or vinorelbine plus epirubicin (NE).The primary endpoint was the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate, and the secondary endpoints were the objective response rate (ORR) and safety.Targeted sequencing of a panel comprising 484 breast-related genes was performed to identify pCR-associated somatic mutations in each group.RESULTS: 91 Patients were assigned to PE (46 patients) or NE (45 patients).NE numerically increased the pCR rate (22.2% versus 8.7%, P = 0.074).The ORRs for NE and PE were 82.2% and 76.1%, respectively.Interestingly, NE (15.4%) showed a significantly higher pCR rate than PE (0%) in the hormone receptor (HR)-positive subgroup (P = 0.044).Both regimens were well tolerated, with grade 3 and 4 toxicities reported at the expected levels.The biomarker analysis showed that UNC13D mutation predicted the pCR rate in NE (P = 0.011).CONCLUSIONS: Although the primary endpoint was not met, NE might bring clinical benefit to HR-positive patients or patients simultaneously carrying UNC13D mutations.",1,1,1,1
25015740,"A cohort analysis to identify eligible patients for intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) of early breast cancer.BACKGROUND: Since the results from the randomized TARGIT A trial were published, intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) is used more often.IORT can be provided as accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) or as a boost.The definition of suitable patients for IORT as APBI differs between different national societies (e.g. ESTRO and ASTRO) and different inclusion criteria of trials and so does the eligibility of patients.This analysis identifies eligible patients for IORT according to available consensus statements and inclusion criteria of the ongoing TARGIT trials.METHODS: Between 01/03 - 12/09, 1505 breast cancer cases were treated at the breast cancer center at the University Medical Center Mannheim.Complete data sets for age, stage (T, N, and M), histology and hormone receptor status were available in 1108 cases.Parameters to identify eligible patients are as follows: ESTRO: >50 years, invasive ductal carcinoma/other favorable histology (IDC), T1-2 (</=3 cm), N0, any hormone receptor status, M0; ASTRO: >/=60 years, IDC, T1, N0, positive estrogen hormone receptor status, M0; TARGIT E ""elderly"", risk adapted radiotherapy with IORT followed by external beam radiotherapy in case of risk factors in final histopathology, phase II: >/=70 years, IDC, T1, N0, any hormone receptor status, M0; TARGIT C ""consolidation"", risk adapted radiotherapy, phase IV: >/=50 years, IDC, T1, N0, positive hormone receptor status, M0; TARGIT BQR ""boost quality registry"": every age, every histology, T1-2 (max.3.5 cm), any hormone receptor status, N0/+, M0/+.RESULTS: Out of the 1108 cases, 379 cases (34.2%) were suitable for IORT as APBI regarding the ESTRO and 175 (15.8%) regarding the ASTRO consensus statements.82 (7.4%) patients were eligible for the TARGIT E trial, 258 (23.3%) for the TARGIT C trial and 671 (60.6%) for the TARGIT BQR registry.According to the consensus statements of ASTRO (45.1%) and ESTRO (41.4%) about half of the eligible patients were treated with IORT as APBI.From the eligible patients fulfilling the criteria for IORT boost (35%) about one third was eventually treated.CONCLUSIONS: Patient selection for IORT should be restrictive.For IORT as APBI the TARGIT trials are even more restrictive including patients than the ESTRO and ASTRO consensus statements.",0,0,0,0

28743247,"A randomized phase II study of paclitaxel alone versus paclitaxel plus sorafenib in second- and third-line treatment of patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer (PASO).BACKGROUND: We conducted an open-label, randomized, two-arm multi-center study to assess the efficacy and safety of paclitaxel versus paclitaxel + sorafenib in patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer.METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive either paclitaxel monotherapy (80 mg/m(2)) weekly (3 weeks on, 1 week off) plus sorafenib 400 mg orally, twice a day taken continuously throughout 28 day cycles.Sorafenib dose was gradually escalated from a starting dose of 200 mg twice a day.The primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS).RESULTS: A pre-planned efficacy interim analysis was performed on the data of 60 patients, 30 patients in each treatment arm.Median PFS was estimated at 6.6 months (95% CI: 5.1 to 9.0) in patients randomized to single-agent paclitaxel (Arm A) and 5.6 months (95% CI: 3.8 to 6.5) in patients randomized to paclitaxel-sorafenib combination (Arm B) therapy.Contrary to the hypothesis, the treatment effect was statistically significant in favor of paclitaxel monotherapy (hazard ratio 1.80, 95% CI: 1.02 to 3.20; log-rank test P = 0.0409).It was decided to stop the trial early for futility.Median OS was also in favor of Arm A (20.7 months (95% CI: 16.4 to 26.7) versus 12.1 months (95% CI: 5.8 to 20.4) in Arm B. Clinical control was achieved in 28 patients (93.3%) in Arm A and in 21 patients 70.0% in Arm B. Overall response rate was met in 43.3% of patients in Arm A and in 40.0% in Arm B. Toxicities were increased in Arm B with higher rates of diarrhea, nausea, neutropenia, hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) and anorexia, Grad 3 and 4 toxicities were rare.CONCLUSIONS: In this pre-planned interim analysis, paclitaxel-sorafenib combination therapy was not found to be superior to paclitaxel monotherapy with regard to the primary end point, progression-free survival.The trial was therefore discontinued early.There was no indication of more favorable outcomes for combination therapy in secondary efficacy end points.As expected, the safety and toxicity profile of the combination therapy was less favorable compared to monotherapy.Overall, this trial did not demonstrate that adding sorafenib to second- or third-line paclitaxel provides any clinical benefit to patients with HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer.Cautious dosing using a sorafenib ramp up schedule might have contributed to negative results.TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered at EudraCT (No 2009-018025-73) and retrospectively registered at Clinical trials.gov on March 17, 2011 ( NCT01320111 ).",1,1,1,1

25556937,"Opportunistic testing versus organized prostate-specific antigen screening: outcome after 18 years in the Goteborg randomized population-based prostate cancer screening trial.BACKGROUND: It has been shown that organized screening decreases prostate cancer (PC) mortality, but the effect of opportunistic screening is largely unknown.OBJECTIVE: To compare the ability to reduce PC mortality and the risk of overdiagnosis between organized and opportunistic screening.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Goteborg screening study invited 10 000 randomly selected men for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing every 2 yr since 1995, with a prostate biopsy recommended for men with PSA >/=2.5 ng/ml.The control group of 10 000 men not invited has been exposed to a previously reported increased rate of opportunistic PSA testing.Both groups were followed until December 31, 2012.OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Observed cumulative PC incidence and mortality rates in both groups were calculated using the actuarial method.Using historical data from 1990-1994 (pre-PSA era), we calculated expected PC incidence and mortality rates in the absence of any PSA testing.The number needed to invite (NNI) and the number needed to diagnose (NND) were calculated by comparing the expected versus observed incidence and mortality rates.RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: At 18 yr, 1396 men were diagnosed with PC and 79 men died of PC in the screening group, compared to 962 and 122, respectively, in the control group.In the screening group, the observed cumulative PC incidence/mortality was 16%/0.98% compared to expected values of 6.8%/1.7%.The corresponding values for the control group were 11%/1.5% and 6.9%/1.7%.Organized screening was associated with an absolute PC-specific mortality reduction of 0.72% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.50-0.94%) and relative risk reduction of 42% (95% CI 28-54%).There was an absolute reduction in PC deaths of 0.20% (95% CI -0.06% to 0.47%) and a relative risk reduction of 12% (95% CI -5 to 26%) associated with opportunistic PSA testing.NNI and NND were 139 (95% CI 107-200) and 13 for organized biennial screening and 493 (95% CI 213- -1563) and 23 for opportunistic screening.The extent of opportunistic screening could not be measured; incidence trends were used as a proxy.CONCLUSIONS: Organized screening reduces PC mortality but is associated with overdiagnosis.Opportunistic PSA testing had little if any effect on PC mortality and resulted in more overdiagnosis, with almost twice the number of men needed to be diagnosed to save one man from dying from PC compared to men offered an organized biennial screening program.PATIENT SUMMARY: Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening within the framework of an organized program seems more effective than unorganized screening.",0,0,0,0

29097444,"RAZOR: A Phase II Open Randomized Trial of Screening Plus Goserelin and Raloxifene Versus Screening Alone in Premenopausal Women at Increased Risk of Breast Cancer.Background: Ovarian suppression in premenopausal women is known to reduce breast cancer risk.This study aimed to assess uptake and compliance with ovarian suppression using the luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) analogue, goserelin, with add-back raloxifene, as a potential regimen for breast cancer prevention.Methods: Women at >/=30% lifetime risk breast cancer were approached and randomized to mammographic screening alone (C-Control) or screening in addition to monthly subcutaneous injections of 3.6 mg goserelin and continuous 60 mg raloxifene daily orally (T-Treated) for 2 years.The primary endpoint was therapy adherence.Secondary endpoints were toxicity/quality of life, change in bone density, and mammographic density.Results: A total of 75/950 (7.9%) women approached agreed to randomization.In the T-arm, 20 of 38 (52%) of women completed the 2-year period of study compared with the C-arm (27/37, 73.0%).Dropouts were related to toxicity but also the wish to have established risk-reducing procedures and proven chemoprevention.As relatively few women completed the study, data are limited, but those in the T-arm reported significant increases in toxicity and sexual problems, no change in anxiety, and less cancer worry.Lumbar spine bone density declined by 7.0% and visually assessed mammographic density by 4.7% over the 2-year treatment period.Conclusions: Uptake is somewhat lower than comparable studies with tamoxifen for prevention with higher dropout rates.Raloxifene may preserve bone density, but reduction in mammographic density reversed after treatment was completed.Impact: This study indicates that breast cancer risk reduction may be possible using LHRH agonists, but reducing toxicity and preventing bone changes would make this a more attractive option.Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 27(1); 58-66.(c)2017 AACR.",0,0,0,0

PgR and Ki67 expression were significantly reduced with all treatments (means were -34% to -45%, and -75% to -85%, respectively; all P = 0.0001), with no differences between groups.CONCLUSIONS: In this short-term study, all treatments reduced ER expression, although F and F + A showed greater reductions than A.

29648580,"Bevacizumab plus hypofractionated radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone in elderly patients with glioblastoma: the randomized, open-label, phase II ARTE trial.Background: The addition of bevacizumab to temozolomide-based chemoradiotherapy (TMZ/RT --> TMZ) did not prolong overall survival (OS) in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma in phase III trials.Elderly and frail patients are underrepresented in clinical trials, but early reports suggested preferential benefit in this population.Patients and methods: ARTE was a 2 : 1 randomized, multi-center, open-label, non-comparative phase II trial of hypofractionated RT (40 Gy in 15 fractions) with bevacizumab (10 mg/kgx14 days) (arm A, N = 50) or without bevacizumab (arm B, N = 25) in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma aged >/=65 years.The primary objective was to obtain evidence for prolongation of median OS by the addition of bevacizumab to RT.Response was assessed by RANO criteria.Quality of life (QoL) was monitored by the EORTC QLQ-C30/BN20 modules.Exploratory studies included molecular subtyping by 450k whole methylome and gene expression analyses.Results: Median PFS was longer in arm A than in arm B (7.6 and 4.8 months, P = 0.003), but OS was similar (12.1 and 12.2 months, P = 0.77).Clinical deterioration was delayed and more patients came off steroids in arm A. Prolonged PFS in arm A was confined to tumors with the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) I methylation subtype (HR 0.25, P = 0.014) and proneural gene expression (HR 0.29, P = 0.025).In a Cox model of OS controlling for established prognostic factors, associations with more favorable outcome were identified for age <70 years (HR 0.52, P = 0.018) and Karnofsky performance score 90%-100% (HR 0.51, P = 0.026).Including molecular subtypes into that model identified an association of the RTK II gene methylation subtype with inferior OS (HR 1.73, P = 0.076).Conclusion: Efficacy outcomes and exploratory analyses of ARTE do not support the hypothesis that the addition of bevacizumab to RT generally prolongs survival in elderly glioblastoma patients.Molecular biomarkers may identify patients with preferential benefit from bevacizumab.Clinical trial registration number: NCT01443676.",1,1,1,0
34551229,"Overall Survival Benefit with Tebentafusp in Metastatic Uveal Melanoma.BACKGROUND: Uveal melanoma is a disease that is distinct from cutaneous melanoma, with a low tumor mutational burden and a 1-year overall survival of approximately 50% in patients with metastatic uveal melanoma.Data showing a proven overall survival benefit with a systemic treatment are lacking.Tebentafusp is a bispecific protein consisting of an affinity-enhanced T-cell receptor fused to an anti-CD3 effector that can redirect T cells to target glycoprotein 100-positive cells.METHODS: In this open-label, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned previously untreated HLA-A*02:01-positive patients with metastatic uveal melanoma in a 2:1 ratio to receive tebentafusp (tebentafusp group) or the investigator's choice of therapy with single-agent pembrolizumab, ipilimumab, or dacarbazine (control group), stratified according to the lactate dehydrogenase level.The primary end point was overall survival.RESULTS: A total of 378 patients were randomly assigned to either the tebentafusp group (252 patients) or the control group (126 patients).Overall survival at 1 year was 73% in the tebentafusp group and 59% in the control group (hazard ratio for death, 0.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.37 to 0.71; P<0.001) in the intention-to-treat population.Progression-free survival was also significantly higher in the tebentafusp group than in the control group (31% vs. 19% at 6 months; hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.94; P = 0.01).The most common treatment-related adverse events in the tebentafusp group were cytokine-mediated events (due to T-cell activation) and skin-related events (due to glycoprotein 100-positive melanocytes), including rash (83%), pyrexia (76%), and pruritus (69%).These adverse events decreased in incidence and severity after the first three or four doses and infrequently led to discontinuation of the trial treatment (2%).No treatment-related deaths were reported.CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with tebentafusp resulted in longer overall survival than the control therapy among previously untreated patients with metastatic uveal melanoma.(Funded by Immunocore; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03070392; EudraCT number, 2015-003153-18.).",1,1,1,1

27382257,"Fondaparinux vs warfarin for the treatment of unsuspected pulmonary embolism in cancer patients.INTRODUCTION: In cancer patients, the chest computer tomography (CT) can be used to identify asymptomatic pulmonary embolism (APE).In most cases, these patients are treated with anticoagulant drugs for at least 3 months.The American College of Physicians recommend treatment of these patients as patients with symptomatic pulmonary embolism.In this study, we evaluated and compared the efficacy and safety of fondaparinux vs warfarin in the prevention of unsuspected pulmonary embolism in patients with active cancer.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective and parallel group study was performed on 64 cancer patients (29 males and 35 females) with APE.A multidetector CT angiography with high spatial and temporal resolution and quality of arterial opacification was used to make the diagnosis.Lung scintigraphy was reserved to selected patients only.Patients were randomized to either the warfarin (Group A) or the fondaparinux (Group B) for 90 days.The first end point of efficacy was the persistence, reduction, or disappearance of thrombosis after 90 days.The second end point was the reappearance of thrombosis after 1 year.The first end point of safety was the development of major bleeding.RESULTS: We enrolled 32 patients into each treatment group.We reached the first end point of efficacy and safety in Group B which showed that fondaparinux was able to induce the disappearance of thrombotic pulmonary with a lower incidence of major bleeding events compared with warfarin.No difference in the secondary end point was recorded.CONCLUSION: We suggest that the treatment of cancer patients with APE can be oriented with the administration of a standard dose of fondaparinux until the next CT lung control (3 months).However, the lack of a randomized clinical trial, including a larger patient cohort, does not allow formulation of final recommendations in these patients.A broader study would be desirable, involving a larger number of patients and a longer follow-up period.",0,0,0,0

30150014,"Erlotinib versus vinorelbine plus cisplatin as adjuvant therapy in Chinese patients with stage IIIA EGFR mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (EVAN): a randomised, open-label, phase 2 trial.BACKGROUND: Adjuvant chemotherapy after radical resection of stage IIIA non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has quite poor outcomes.We aimed to investigate whether adjuvant erlotinib therapy improves 2-year disease-free survival compared with chemotherapy in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation-positive stage IIIA NSCLC.METHODS: In this randomised, open-label, phase 2 trial, eligible patients aged 18-75 years who had undergone complete (R0) resection of histologically or pathologically confirmed stage IIIA EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC and had not received any previous anticancer therapies were enrolled.Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either adjuvant erlotinib (150 mg once daily administered orally) or vinorelbine and cisplatin chemotherapy (four cycles of vinorelbine [25 mg/m(2) intravenously on days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle] plus cisplatin [75 mg/m(2) intravenously on day 1 of each 21-day cycle]).Randomisation was done by Simon's minimisation with a random element and was stratified by EGFR activating mutation type (exon 19 vs 21), histology (adenocarcinoma vs non-adenocarcinoma), and smoking status (smoker vs non-smoker).The primary endpoint in the unblinded intention-to-treat analysis was 2-year disease-free survival.This ongoing study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01683175.FINDINGS: Between Sept 8, 2012, and May 21, 2015, 102 patients from 16 centres across China were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive erlotinib (n=51) or chemotherapy (n=51).Median follow-up was 33.0 months (IQR 17.8-43.1).2-year disease-free survival was 81.4% (95% CI 69.6-93.1) in the erlotinib group and 44.6% (26.9-62.4) in the chemotherapy group (relative risk 1.823 [95% CI 1.194-2.784; p=0.0054).The difference in 2-year disease-free survival between the groups was 36.7% (95% CI 15.5-58.0; p=0.0007).Adverse events of any grade occurred in 29 (58%) of 50 patients in the erlotinib group and 28 (65%) of 43 patients in the chemotherapy group.Grade 3 or worse adverse events occurred in six (12%) of 50 patients in the erlotinib group versus 11 (26%) of 43 in the chemotherapy group; the most common of these in the erlotinib group was rash (in two [4%] of 50 patients) and in the chemotherapy group were decreased neutrophil count (in seven [16%] of 43 patients) and myelosuppression (in four [9%]).No treatment-related deaths were reported.INTERPRETATION: Adjuvant erlotinib improved 2-year disease-free survival in patients with EGFR mutation-positive stage IIIA NSCLC compared with chemotherapy, with a better tolerability profile.This study suggests that tyrosine kinase inhibitors could have a potentially important role as adjuvant therapy in EGFR mutation-positive stage IIIA NSCLC.However, this trial was a phase 2 study.Mature overall survival data are also needed.Ongoing studies will hopefully confirm the role of adjuvant EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy in patients with NSCLC.FUNDING: National Key Research and Development Program of China and Shanghai Roche Pharmaceuticals Ltd.",1,1,1,1
29696328,"Does Intermittent Pringle Maneuver Increase Postoperative Complications After Hepatectomy for Hepatocellular Carcinoma? A Randomized Controlled Trial.BACKGROUND: In a previous study, we have shown that intermittent Pringle maneuver (IPM) might increase postoperative complications after hepatectomy for various indications.Complications which thought to be related to IPM were ascites, pleural effusion, wound infection and intra-abdominal collection.The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that applying IPM during hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) could increase postoperative complications.METHODS: Between January 2013 and October 2016, eligible patients who received elective open hepatectomy for HCC were randomized to have IPM or no Pringle maneuver (NPM).Occurrence of various types of postoperative complications was specifically looked for.A routine postoperative day 5 abdominal ultrasound examination and chest X-ray were done to detect and grade any radiological ascites, pleural effusion and intra-abdominal collection.RESULTS: Fifty IPM and 50 NPM patients with histological proven HCC were recruited for final analysis.Demographics and operative parameters were comparable between the two groups.The postoperative complication rates were similar (IPM 36.0 vs. NPM 28.0%, P = 0.391).However, in the IPM group, more patients developed radiological posthepatectomy ascites (42.0 vs. 22.0%, P = 0.032) and pleural effusion (66.0 vs. 38.0%, P = 0.005).In patients with histologically proven cirrhosis, there were 28 IPM and 25 NPM patients.Again, there was no difference in postoperative complication rate but more radiological posthepatectomy ascites and pleural effusion in the IPM group.CONCLUSION: This trial was not able to detect a difference in postoperative complications whether IPM was applied or not, but use of IPM was associated with more subclinical ascites and pleural effusion.(ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01759901).TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01759901.",0,0,0,0

23374147,"Immunomodulatory effects of total intravenous and balanced inhalation anesthesia in patients with bladder cancer undergoing elective radical cystectomy: preliminary results.BACKGROUND: Although surgery and anesthesia induce immunesuppression, remains largely unknown whether various anesthetic techniques have different immunosuppressive effects on cancer patients.Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the influence of total intravenous anesthesia with target-controlled infusion (TIVA-TCI) and balanced inhalation anesthesia (BAL) on the peri-operative levels of inflammatory cytokines and regulatory T cells (Tregs) in patients with bladder cancer undergoing surgery.METHODS: Twenty eight consecutive patients with bladder cancer who underwent radical cystectomy were prospectively randomized into two groups to receive TIVA-TCI (n = 14) or BAL (n = 14).Before the induction of anesthesia (T0), 6-8 hours (T1) post-surgery, and 5 days post-surgery (T2), Tregs and serum levels of interleukin -1beta (IL-1beta), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin -2 (IL-2), interleukin -6 (IL-6), and interleukin -10 (IL-10) were measured.RESULTS: In the peri-operative period all cancer patients showed a marked and significant increase in IL-6.Moreover, TIVA-TCI patients also showed a higher increase in IFN-gamma, whereas in BAL patients Tregs were reduced by approximately 30% during surgery.The incidence of infections, metastases, and death was similar in both groups.CONCLUSIONS: The increase in the Th1 response in the TIVA-TCI group and the reduction in Tregs in the BAL group seem to balance the immunosuppressive effect induced by IL-6.Therefore TIVA-TCI and BAL can be both used in major surgery in patients with bladder cancer without worsening the outcome.",0,0,0,0

23146280,"The prognostic and predictive value of mRNA expression of vascular endothelial growth factor family members in breast cancer: a study in primary tumors of high-risk early breast cancer patients participating in a randomized Hellenic Cooperative Oncology Group trial.INTRODUCTION: The main prognostic variables in early breast cancer are tumor size, histological grade, estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor (ER/PgR) status, number of positive nodes and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status.The present study evaluated the prognostic and/or predictive value of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family members in high-risk early breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant chemo-hormonotherapy.METHODS: RNA was isolated from 308 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded primary tumor samples from breast cancer patients enrolled in the HE10/97 trial, evaluating adjuvant dose-dense sequential chemotherapy with epirubicin followed by cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil (CMF) with or without paclitaxel (E-T-CMF versus E-CMF).A fully automated method based on magnetic beads was applied for RNA extraction, followed by one-step quantitative RT-PCR for mRNA analysis of VEGF-A, -B, -C and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) 1, 2, 3.RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 8 years, 109 patients (35%) developed a relapse and 80 patients (26%) died.In high VEGF-C and VEGFR1 mRNA expressing tumors, ER/PgR-negative tumors (Fisher's exact test, P = 0.001 and P = 0.021, respectively) and HER2-positive tumors (P <0.001 and P = 0.028, respectively) were more frequent than in low VEGF-C and VEGFR1 expressing tumors, respectively.From the VEGF family members evaluated, high VEGFR1 mRNA expression (above the 75th percentile) emerged as a significant negative prognostic factor for overall survival (OS; hazard ratio (HR) = 1.60, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01 to 2.55, Wald's P = 0.047) and disease-free survival (DFS; HR = 1.67, 95% CI: 1.13 to 2.48, P = 0.010), when adjusting for treatment group.High VEGF-C mRNA expression was predictive for benefit from adjuvant treatment with paclitaxel (E-T-CMF arm) for OS (test for interaction, Wald's P = 0.038), while in multivariate analysis the interaction of VEGF-C with taxane treatment was significant for both OS (Wald's P = 0.019) and DFS (P = 0.041) and continuous VEGF-B mRNA expression values for OS (P = 0.019).CONCLUSIONS: The present study reports, for the first time, that VEGF-C mRNA overexpression, as assessed by qRT-PCR, has a strong predictive value in high-risk early breast cancer patients undergoing adjuvant paclitaxel-containing treatment.Further studies are warranted to validate the prognostic and/or predictive value of VEGF-B, VEGF-C and VEGFR1 in patients treated with adjuvant therapies and to reveal which members of the VEGF family could possibly be useful markers in identifying patients who will benefit most from anti-VEGF strategies.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR) ACTRN12611000506998.",0,0,0,0

28352657,"Randomized, placebo-controlled window trial of EGFR, Src, or combined blockade in head and neck cancer.BACKGROUND.EGFR and Src family kinases are upregulated in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).EGFR interacts with Src to activate STAT3 signaling, and dual EGFR-Src targeting is synergistic in HNSCC preclinical models.pSrc overexpression predicted resistance to the EGFR inhibitor, erlotinib, in a prior window trial.We conducted a 4-arm window trial to identify biomarkers associated with response to EGFR and/or Src inhibition.METHODS.Patients with operable stage II-IVa HNSCC were randomized to 7-21 days of neoadjuvant erlotinib, the Src inhibitor dasatinib, the combination of both, or placebo.Paired tumor specimens were collected before and after treatment.Pharmacodynamic expression of EGFR and Src pathway components was evaluated by IHC of tissue microarrays and reverse-phase protein array of tissue lysates.Candidate biomarkers were assessed for correlation with change in tumor size.RESULTS.From April 2009 to December 2012, 58 patients were randomized and 55 were treated.There was a significant decrease in tumor size in both erlotinib arms (P = 0.0014); however, no effect was seen with dasatinib alone (P = 0.24).High baseline pMAPK expression was associated with response to erlotinib (P = 0.03).High baseline pSTAT3 was associated with resistance to dasatinib (P = 0.099).CONCLUSIONS.Brief exposure to erlotinib significantly decreased tumor size in operable HNSCC, with no additive effect from dasatinib.Baseline pMAPK expression warrants further study as a response biomarker for anti-EGFR therapy.Basal expression of pSTAT3 may be independent of Src, explain therapeutic resistance, and preclude development of dasatinib in biomarker-unselected cohorts.TRIAL REGISTRATION.NCT00779389.FUNDING.National Cancer Institute, American Cancer Society, Pennsylvania Department of Health, V Foundation for Cancer Research, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Astellas Pharma.",1,1,1,1

26291768,"Docetaxel Alone or in Combination With a Therapeutic Cancer Vaccine (PANVAC) in Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer: A Randomized Clinical Trial.IMPORTANCE: Previous phase 1 and 2 trials of PANVAC, a poxviral-based cancer vaccine, have suggested clinical efficacy in some patients with breast, ovarian, and colorectal cancer and have shown evidence of immunologic activity.Preclinical data have shown that docetaxel can modify tumor phenotype, making tumor cells more amenable to T cell-mediated killing.OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to determine if the treatment combination of docetaxel and PANVAC improves clinical outcomes in patients with metastatic breast cancer compared with docetaxel treatment alone.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Between May 2006 and February 2012, this open-label, phase 2 randomized clinical trial enrolled 48 patients with metastatic breast cancer of all subtypes, without limitation on other lines of previous therapy, to receive treatment with either docetaxel with PANVAC (arm A) or docetaxel alone (arm B).Final clinical data were collected on September 16, 2013.All patients were treated at either the National Cancer Institute or the Department of Breast Medical Oncology, MD Anderson Cancer Center.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS), using a phase 2.5 statistical design, with the intent of identifying a trend toward benefit (defined as 1-sided P</=.10) to guide a larger trial design.Secondary end points included safety and immunologic correlative studies.RESULTS: Forty-eight participants were enrolled: 25 were randomized to the combination treatment arm A, and 23 to arm B. No patient remained in the study at the time of the final analysis.Patient and tumor characteristics were well matched.Analysis of adverse events in both treatment arms demonstrated very little difference between the 2 groups.In the combination treatment arm (arm A), statistically significant increases were noted in the frequency of grades 1 and 2 edema (P=.02, likely related to greater median number of docetaxel cycles) and injection-site reactions (P<.001).In the final data analysis, median PFS was 7.9 months in arm A vs 3.9 months in arm B (hazard ratio, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.34-1.14]; P=.09).CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results suggest that the combination of PANVAC with docetaxel in metastatic breast cancer may provide a clinical benefit.This study was hypothesis generating and provides both rationale and statistical assumptions for a larger definitive randomized study.TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00179309.",1,1,1,0
26110667,"MR Imaging as an Additional Screening Modality for the Detection of Breast Cancer in Women Aged 50-75 Years with Extremely Dense Breasts: The DENSE Trial Study Design.Women with extremely dense breasts have an increased risk of breast cancer and lower mammographic tumor detectability.Nevertheless, in most countries, these women are currently screened with mammography only.Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has the potential to improve breast cancer detection at an early stage because of its higher sensitivity.However, MR imaging is more expensive and is expected to be accompanied by an increase in the number of false-positive results and, possibly, an increase in overdiagnosis.To study the additional value of MR imaging, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design is needed in which one group undergoes mammography and the other group undergoes mammography and MR imaging.With this design, it is possible to determine the proportion of interval cancers within each study arm.For this to be an effective screening strategy, the additional cancers detected at MR imaging screening must be accompanied by a subsequent reduction in interval cancers.The Dense Tissue and Early Breast Neoplasm Screening, or DENSE, trial is a multicenter RCT performed in the Dutch biennial population-based screening program (subject age range, 50-75 years).The study was approved by the Dutch Minister of Health, Welfare and Sport.In this study, mammographic density is measured by using a fully automated volumetric method.Participants with extremely dense breasts (American College of Radiology breast density category 4) and a negative result at mammography (Breast Imaging Recording and Data System category 1 or 2) are randomly assigned to undergo additional MR imaging (n = 7237) or to be treated according to current practice (n = 28 948).Participants provide written informed consent before the MR imaging examination, which consists of dynamic breast MR imaging with gadolinium-based contrast medium and is intended to be performed for three consecutive screening rounds.The primary outcome is the difference in the proportions of interval cancers between the study arms.Secondary outcomes are the number of MR imaging screening-detected cancers, proportions of false-positive results, diagnostic yield of MR imaging, tumor characteristics, quality of life, and cost effectiveness.",0,0,0,0

28743247,"A randomized phase II study of paclitaxel alone versus paclitaxel plus sorafenib in second- and third-line treatment of patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer (PASO).BACKGROUND: We conducted an open-label, randomized, two-arm multi-center study to assess the efficacy and safety of paclitaxel versus paclitaxel + sorafenib in patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer.METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive either paclitaxel monotherapy (80 mg/m(2)) weekly (3 weeks on, 1 week off) plus sorafenib 400 mg orally, twice a day taken continuously throughout 28 day cycles.Sorafenib dose was gradually escalated from a starting dose of 200 mg twice a day.The primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS).RESULTS: A pre-planned efficacy interim analysis was performed on the data of 60 patients, 30 patients in each treatment arm.Median PFS was estimated at 6.6 months (95% CI: 5.1 to 9.0) in patients randomized to single-agent paclitaxel (Arm A) and 5.6 months (95% CI: 3.8 to 6.5) in patients randomized to paclitaxel-sorafenib combination (Arm B) therapy.Contrary to the hypothesis, the treatment effect was statistically significant in favor of paclitaxel monotherapy (hazard ratio 1.80, 95% CI: 1.02 to 3.20; log-rank test P = 0.0409).It was decided to stop the trial early for futility.Median OS was also in favor of Arm A (20.7 months (95% CI: 16.4 to 26.7) versus 12.1 months (95% CI: 5.8 to 20.4) in Arm B. Clinical control was achieved in 28 patients (93.3%) in Arm A and in 21 patients 70.0% in Arm B. Overall response rate was met in 43.3% of patients in Arm A and in 40.0% in Arm B. Toxicities were increased in Arm B with higher rates of diarrhea, nausea, neutropenia, hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) and anorexia, Grad 3 and 4 toxicities were rare.CONCLUSIONS: In this pre-planned interim analysis, paclitaxel-sorafenib combination therapy was not found to be superior to paclitaxel monotherapy with regard to the primary end point, progression-free survival.The trial was therefore discontinued early.There was no indication of more favorable outcomes for combination therapy in secondary efficacy end points.As expected, the safety and toxicity profile of the combination therapy was less favorable compared to monotherapy.Overall, this trial did not demonstrate that adding sorafenib to second- or third-line paclitaxel provides any clinical benefit to patients with HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer.Cautious dosing using a sorafenib ramp up schedule might have contributed to negative results.TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered at EudraCT (No 2009-018025-73) and retrospectively registered at Clinical trials.gov on March 17, 2011 ( NCT01320111 ).",1,1,1,1

33161336,"Accelerated partial breast irradiation with 3-dimensional conformal and image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy following breast conserving surgery - 7-Year results of a phase II trial.PURPOSE: To present the 7-year results of accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) using three-dimensional conformal (3D-CRT) and image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IG-IMRT) following breast-conserving surgery (BCS).PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2006 and 2014, 104 patients were treated with APBI given by means of 3D-CRT using 3-5 non-coplanar, isocentric wedged fields, or IG-IMRT using kV-CBCT.The total dose of APBI was 36.9 Gy (9 x 4.1 Gy) using twice-a-day fractionation.Survival results, side effects and cosmetic results were assessed.RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 90 months three (2.9%) local recurrences, one (0.9%) regional recurrence and two (1.9%) distant metastases were observed.The 7-year local (LRFS), recurrence free survival was 98.9%.The 7-year disease-free (DFS), metastases free (MFS) and overall survival (OS) was 94.8%, 97.9% and 94.8%, respectively.Late side effects included G1 skin toxicity in 15 (14.4%), G1, G2, and G3 fibrosis in 26 (25%), 3 (2.9%) and 1 (0.9%) patients respectively.Asymptomatic (G1) fat necrosis occurred in 10 (9.6%) patients.No >/= G2 or higher late side effects occurred with IMRT.The rate of excellent/good and fair/poor cosmetic results was 93.2% and 6.8%, respectively.CONCLUSION: 7-year results of APBI with 3D-CRT and IG-IMRT are encouraging.Toxicity profile and local tumor control are comparable to other series using multicatheter interstitial brachytherapy.Therefore, these external beam APBI techniques are valid alternatives to whole breast irradiation and brachytherapy based APBI.",0,0,0,0
28579538,"Late Recurrence of Barrett's Esophagus After Complete Eradication of Intestinal Metaplasia is Rare: Final Report From Ablation in Intestinal Metaplasia Containing Dysplasia Trial.BACKGROUND & AIMS: The goal of treatment for Barrett's esophagus (BE) with dysplasia is complete eradication of intestinal metaplasia (CEIM).The long-term durability of CEIM has not been well characterized, so the frequency and duration of surveillance are unclear.We report results from a 5-year follow-up analysis of patients with BE and dysplasia treated by radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in the randomized controlled Ablation of Intestinal Metaplasia Containing Dysplasia (AIM) trial.METHODS: Participants for the AIM Dysplasia trial (18-80 years old) were recruited from 19 sites in the United States and had endoscopic evidence of non-nodular dysplastic BE </=8 cm in length.Subjects (n = 127) were randomly assigned (2:1 ratio) to receive either RFA (entire BE segment ablated circumferentially) or a sham endoscopic procedure; patients in the sham group were offered RFA treatment 1 year later, and all patients were followed for 5 years.We collected data on BE recurrence (defined as intestinal metaplasia in the tubular esophagus) and dysplastic BE recurrence among patients who achieved CEIM.We constructed Kaplan-Meier estimates and applied parametric survival analysis to examine proportions of patients without any recurrence and without dysplastic recurrence.RESULTS: Of 127 patients in the AIM Dysplasia trial, 119 received RFA and met inclusion criteria.Of those 119, 110 (92%) achieved CEIM.Over 401 person-years of follow-up (mean, 3.6 years per patient; range, 0.2-5.8 years), 35 of 110 (32%) patients had recurrence of BE or dysplasia, and 19 (17%) had dysplasia recurrence.The incidence rate of BE recurrence was 10.8 per 100 person-years overall (95% CI, 7.8-15.0); 8.3 per 100 person-years among patients with baseline low-grade dysplasia (95% CI, 4.9-14.0), and 13.5 per 100 person-years among patients with baseline high-grade dysplasia (95% CI 8.8-20.7).The incidence rate of dysplasia recurrence was 5.2 per 100 person-years overall (95% CI 3.3-8.2); 3.3 per 100 person-years among patients with baseline low-grade dysplasia (95% CI 1.5-7.2), and 7.3 per 100 person-years among patients with baseline high-grade dysplasia (95% CI 4.2-12.5).Neither BE nor dysplasia recurred at a constant rate.There was a greater probability of recurrence in the first year following CEIM than in the following 4 years combined.CONCLUSIONS: In this analysis of prospective cohort data from the AIM Dysplasia trial, we found BE to recur after CEIM by RFA in almost one third of patients with baseline dysplastic disease; most recurrences occurred during the first year after CEIM.However, patients who achieved CEIM and remained BE free at 1 year after RFA had a low risk of BE recurrence.Studies are needed to determine when surveillance can be decreased or discontinued; our study did not identify any BE or dysplasia recurrence after 4 years of surveillance.",0,0,0,0
34597975,"Population-adjusted indirect treatment comparison of the SOLO1 and PAOLA-1/ENGOT-ov25 trials evaluating maintenance olaparib or bevacizumab or the combination of both in newly diagnosed, advanced BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer.BACKGROUND: In the absence of randomised head-to-head trials, we conducted a population-adjusted indirect treatment comparison (PA-ITC) of phase III trial data to evaluate the relative efficacy and safety of maintenance olaparib and bevacizumab alone and in combination in patients with newly diagnosed, advanced ovarian cancer and a BRCA mutation (BRCAm).METHODS: An unanchored PA-ITC was performed on investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) data.Individual patient data from SOLO1 (olaparib versus placebo) and from BRCA-mutated patients in PAOLA-1/ENGOT-ov25 (olaparib plus bevacizumab versus placebo plus bevacizumab) were pooled.Each arm of PAOLA-1 was weighted so that key baseline patient characteristics were similar to the SOLO1 cohort.Analyses were performed in patients with complete baseline data.Weighted Cox regression analysis was used to estimate the comparative efficacy of different maintenance therapy strategies, supplemented by weighted Kaplan-Meier analyses.RESULTS: Data from SOLO1 patients (olaparib, n = 254; placebo, n = 126) were compared with data from BRCA-mutated PAOLA-1 patients (olaparib plus bevacizumab, n = 151; placebo plus bevacizumab, n = 71).Adding bevacizumab to olaparib was associated with a numerical improvement in PFS compared with olaparib alone (hazard ratio [HR] 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.45-1.09).Statistically significant improvements in PFS were seen with olaparib alone versus placebo plus bevacizumab (HR 0.48; 95% CI 0.30-0.75), olaparib plus bevacizumab versus placebo (0.23; 0.14-0.34), and placebo plus bevacizumab versus placebo (0.65; 0.43-0.95).CONCLUSIONS: Results of this hypothesis-generating PA-ITC analysis support the use of maintenance olaparib alone or with bevacizumab in patients with newly diagnosed, advanced ovarian cancer and a BRCAm.",0,0,0,0
33891194,"Clinical usefulness of eribulin as first- or second-line chemotherapy for recurrent HER2-negative breast cancer: a randomized phase II study (JBCRG-19).BACKGROUND: Anthracycline (A) or taxane T-based regimens are the standard early-line chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer (BC).A previous study has shown a survival benefit of eribulin in heavily pretreated advanced/recurrent BC patients.The present study aimed to compare the benefit of eribulin with treatment of physician's choice (TPC) as first- or second-line chemotherapy for recurrent HER2-negative BC.METHODS: Patients with recurrent HER2-negative BC previously receiving anthracycline and taxane AT-based chemotherapy in the adjuvant or first-line setting were eligible for this open-label, randomized, parallel-group study.Patients were randomized 1:1 by the minimization method to receive either eribulin (1.4 mg/m(2) on day one and eight of each 21-day cycle) or TPC (paclitaxel, docetaxel, nab-paclitaxel or vinorelbine) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS).Secondary endpoints included time to treatment failure (TTF), overall response rate (ORR), duration of response, and safety (UMIN000009886).RESULTS: Between May 2013 and January 2017, 58 patients were randomized, 57 of whom (26 eribulin and 31 TPC) were analyzed for efficacy.The median PFS was 6.6 months with eribulin versus 4.2 months with TPC (hazard ratio: 0.72 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.40-1.30], p = 0.276).Median TTF was 6.0 months with eribulin versus 3.6 months with TPC (hazard ratio: 0.66 [95% CI, 0.39-1.14], p = 0.136).Other endpoints were also similar between groups.The most common grade >/= 3 adverse event was neutropenia (22.2% with eribulin versus 16.1% with TPC).CONCLUSIONS: Eribulin seemed to improve PFS or TTF compared with TPC without statistical significance.Further validation studies are needed.",1,1,1,1
25041849,"Randomized trial of narrow-band versus white-light cystoscopy for restaging (second-look) transurethral resection of bladder tumors.UNLABELLED: Narrow-band imaging (NBI) cystoscopy detects more bladder tumors than standard white-light imaging (WLI) cystoscopy, but it is unclear whether NBI improves transurethral resection (TUR) of bladder tumors.This study compares 2-yr recurrence-free survival (RFS) of patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder tumors following restaging TUR using NBI or WLI cystoscopy.Patients were randomized 1:1 to undergo NBI-assisted TUR (NBI-TUR) or WLI-assisted TUR (WLI-TUR).The main outcome was number of patients free of tumor recurrence after 2-yr follow-up and 2-yr RFS times.Of 254 patients, 127 underwent NBI-TUR and 127 had WLI-TUR.Within 2 yr, 22% of the patients in the NBI-TUR group recurred compared with 33% after WLI-TUR (p=0.05).The mean RFS time was 22 mo (95% confidence interval [CI], 20-23) for the NBI-TUR group versus 19 mo (95% CI, 18-21) for the WLI-TUR group (p=0.02).Limitations are that this was a single-surgeon study and that a 20% difference in the number of patients free of recurrence was not achieved, suggesting the study was underpowered.In addition, observer bias may have contributed to results because NBI-TUR was performed after both WLI and NBI cystoscopy was used to inspect the bladder.Although the results suggest reduced recurrence rates and improved RFS times after restaging NBI-TUR compared with WLI-TUR, a larger study is needed.PATIENT SUMMARY: Narrow-band imaging enhances visibility of bladder tumors over conventional white-light cystoscopy.This report compares transurethral resection of bladder tumors using narrow-band cystoscopy with white-light cystoscopy.The results show that narrow-band cystoscopy improves surgical removal of bladder tumors, which reduces the frequency of early and later tumor recurrences.",1,1,0,0
33410564,"Covered self-expandable metal stents versus plastic stents for preoperative biliary drainage in patient receiving neo-adjuvant chemotherapy for borderline resectable pancreatic cancer: Prospective randomized study.OBJECTIVES: This single-center comparative randomized superiority study compared biliary stenting using fully covered self-expandable metal stents (FCSEMS) and biliary stenting using plastic stents (PS) in preoperative biliary drainage of patients with borderline resectable pancreatic cancer (BRPC) who are planned to undergo a single regimen of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NAC).METHODS: Twenty-two patients with BRPC who required preoperative biliary drainage before NAC (Gemcitabine plus Nab-paclitaxel) were randomly assigned 1:1 to the FCSEMS or PS group.The primary endpoint was the rate of stent dysfunction until surgery or tumor progression.Secondary endpoints were stent patency, number of re-interventions, adverse events of endoscopic retrograde biliary drainage (EBD), operation time, volume of intraoperative bleeding, postoperative hospitalization, postoperative adverse events and medical costs.RESULTS: Eleven patients in each of the groups reached the primary endpoint.The FCSEMS group showed a significantly lower rate of stent dysfunction (18.2% vs. 72.8%, P = 0.015), longer stent patency (P = 0.02), and lower number of re-interventions for stent dysfunction (0.27 +/- 0.65 vs. 1.27 +/- 1.1, P = 0.001) than the PS group.The adverse events of EBD, operation time, volume of intraoperative bleeding, postoperative hospitalization, postoperative adverse events and medical costs did not significantly differ between the two groups.CONCLUSIONS: In patients with BRPC for preoperative biliary drainage, stent dysfunction occurred less frequently with FCSEMSs than with PSs.In addition, FCSEMS and PS provided similar preoperative management of BRPC in terms of the safety of surgery and medical costs.(UMIN ID000030473).",0,0,0,0
25081694,"Effect of beta glucan on white blood cell counts and serum levels of IL-4 and IL-12 in women with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy: a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial.BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the most common female malignancy in the world.Beta glucan can be a hematopoietic and an immune modulator agent in cancer patients.The aim of this trial was to determine the effect of beta glucan on white blood cell counts and serum levels of IL-4 and IL-12 in women with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted on 30 women with breast carcinoma aged 28-65 years.The eligible participants were randomly assigned to intervention (n=15) or placebo (n=15) groups using a block randomization procedure with matching based on age, course of chemotherapy and menopause status.Patients in the intervention group received two 10-mg capsules of soluble 1-3, 1-6, D-beta glucan daily and the control group receiving placebo during 21 days, the interval between two courses of chemotherapy.White blood cells, neuthrophil, lymphocyte and monocyte counts as well as serum levels of IL-4 and IL-12 were measured at baseline and at the end of the study as primary outcomes of the study.RESULTS: In both groups white blood cell counts decreased after 21 days of the intervention, however in the beta glucan group, WBC was less decreased non significantly than the placebo group.At the end of the study, the change in the serum level of IL-4 in the beta glucan group in comparison with the placebo group was statistically significant (p=0.001).The serum level of IL-12 in the beta glucan group statistically increased (p=0.03) and comparison between two groups at the end of the study was significant after adjusting for baseline values and covariates (p=0.007).CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that beta glucan can be useful as a complementary or adjuvant therapy and immunomodulary agent in breast cancer patients in combination with cancer therapies, but further studies are needed for confirmation.",0,0,0,0
28106903,"Continuous treatment with lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone in transplant-ineligible patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma in Asia: subanalysis of the FIRST trial.The phase 3 FIRST (Frontline Investigation of REVLIMID + Dexamethasone Versus Standard Thalidomide) trial demonstrated that lenalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone (Rd) until disease progression (Rd continuous) is an effective treatment option for transplant-ineligible patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM).Given genetic differences between Asian and Western populations, this subanalysis of the FIRST trial examined the safety and efficacy of Rd (given continuously or for 18 cycles [Rd18]) and MPT (melphalan, prednisone, thalidomide) in 114 Asian patients from Mainland China, South Korea and Taiwan.Efficacy and safety with Rd continuous in Asian patients were consistent with those in the overall study population.The overall response rates were 77.8% for Rd continuous, 57.5% for MPT and 65.8% for Rd18.The risk of progression or death was reduced by 39% with Rd continuous versus MPT and by 35% with Rd continuous versus Rd18.Rd continuous improved the 3-year survival rate compared with MPT (70.2% vs. 56.4%) and Rd18 (58.1%).Common grade 3/4 adverse events in the Rd continuous and MPT arms were neutropenia (25.0% vs. 43.6%), infection (19.4% vs. 28.2%) and anaemia (19.4% vs. 15.4%), respectively.Thromboembolic event rates were low, and no second primary malignancies were observed.Rd continuous is safe and effective in transplant-ineligible Asian patients with NDMM.",0,0,0,0

22071311,"Cognitive performance after postoperative pituitary radiotherapy: a dosimetric study of the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex.OBJECTIVE: The hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC) are important for memory and executive functioning and are known to be sensitive to radiotherapy (RT).Radiation dosimetry relates radiation exposure to specific brain areas.The effects of various pituitary RT techniques were studied by relating detailed dosimetry of the hippocampus and PFC to cognitive performance.METHODS: In this cross-sectional design, 75 non-functioning pituitary macroadenoma (NFA) patients (61+/-10 years) participated and were divided into irradiated (RT+, n=30) and non-irradiated (RT-, n=45) groups.The RT+ group (who all received 25 fractions of 1.8 Gy; total dose: 45 Gy) consisted of three RT technique groups: three-field technique, n=10; four-field technique, n=15; and five-field technique, n=5.Memory and executive functioning were assessed by standardized neuropsychological tests.A reconstruction of the dose distributions for the three RT techniques was made.The RT doses on 30, 50, and 70% of the volume of the left and right hippocampus and PFC were calculated.RESULTS: Cognitive test performance was not different between the four groups, despite differences in radiation doses applied to the hippocampi and PFC.Age at RT, time since RT, and the use of thyroid hormone varied significantly between the groups; however, they were not related to cognitive performance.CONCLUSION: This study showed that there were no significant differences on cognitive performance between the three-, four-, and five-field RT groups and the non-irradiated patient group.A dose-response relationship could not be established, even with a radiation dose that was higher on most of the volume of the hippocampus and PFC in case of a four-field RT technique compared with the three- and five-field RT techniques.",0,0,0,0
33617184,"Deep learning applied to two-dimensional color Doppler flow imaging ultrasound images significantly improves diagnostic performance in the classification of breast masses: a multicenter study.BACKGROUND: The current deep learning diagnosis of breast masses is mainly reflected by the diagnosis of benign and malignant lesions.In China, breast masses are divided into four categories according to the treatment method: inflammatory masses, adenosis, benign tumors, and malignant tumors.These categorizations are important for guiding clinical treatment.In this study, we aimed to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) for classification of these four breast mass types using ultrasound (US) images.METHODS: Taking breast biopsy or pathological examinations as the reference standard, CNNs were used to establish models for the four-way classification of 3623 breast cancer patients from 13 centers.The patients were randomly divided into training and test groups (n = 1810 vs. n = 1813).Separate models were created for two-dimensional (2D) images only, 2D and color Doppler flow imaging (2D-CDFI), and 2D-CDFI and pulsed wave Doppler (2D-CDFI-PW) images.The performance of these three models was compared using sensitivity, specificity, area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), positive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV), positive (LR+) and negative likelihood ratios (LR-), and the performance of the 2D model was further compared between masses of different sizes with above statistical indicators, between images from different hospitals with AUC, and with the performance of 37 radiologists.RESULTS: The accuracies of the 2D, 2D-CDFI, and 2D-CDFI-PW models on the test set were 87.9%, 89.2%, and 88.7%, respectively.The AUCs for classification of benign tumors, malignant tumors, inflammatory masses, and adenosis were 0.90, 0.91, 0.90, and 0.89, respectively (95% confidence intervals [CIs], 0.87-0.91, 0.89-0.92, 0.87-0.91, and 0.86-0.90).The 2D-CDFI model showed better accuracy (89.2%) on the test set than the 2D (87.9%) and 2D-CDFI-PW (88.7%) models.The 2D model showed accuracy of 81.7% on breast masses </=1 cm and 82.3% on breast masses >1 cm; there was a significant difference between the two groups (P < 0.001).The accuracy of the CNN classifications for the test set (89.2%) was significantly higher than that of all the radiologists (30%).CONCLUSIONS: The CNN may have high accuracy for classification of US images of breast masses and perform significantly better than human radiologists.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chictr.org, ChiCTR1900021375; http://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.aspx?proj=33139.",0,0,0,0

32475079,"Mepitel Film is superior to Biafine cream in managing acute radiation-induced skin reactions in head and neck cancer patients: a randomised intra-patient controlled clinical trial.INTRODUCTION: We previously showed that Mepitel Film decreased the severity of acute radiation-induced skin reactions in head and neck cancer patients.In the current study, we compared the effect of Mepitel Film and Biafine cream on skin reaction severity in a larger cohort of head and neck cancer patients.METHODS: A total of 44 head and neck cancer patients were recruited with 39 patients contributing full data sets for analysis.Patients received a dose of 50 Gy in 25 fractions to the bilateral lymph nodes in the neck.Left and right lymph node areas were randomised to either Mepitel Film or Biafine cream, applied prophylactically.Skin reaction severity was measured using Radiation-Induced Skin Reaction Assessment Scale (RISRAS) and expanded Radiation Oncology group (RTOG) grades.Skin dose was measured using gafchromic Film.RESULTS: Skin reaction severity (combined RISRAS score) underneath Mepitel Film was decreased by 30% (P < 0.001) and moist desquamation rates by 41% (P < 0.001).Skin dose underneath Mepitel Film and Biafine cream was similar (P = 0.925) and unlikely to have affected skin reaction severity.The vast majority (80%) of patients preferred Mepitel Film over Biafine cream.Negative aspects of Mepitel Film included poor adherence (11/39) and discomfort (16/39) during hot weather and showering and itchy skin underneath Mepitel Film (12/39).CONCLUSIONS: Mepitel Film was superior to Biafine cream in reducing the severity of acute radiation-induced skin reactions and moist desquamation incidence in our head and neck patient cohort.",0,0,0,0
28209746,"A Phase II Randomized Trial (GO27827) of First-Line FOLFOX Plus Bevacizumab with or Without the MET Inhibitor Onartuzumab in Patients with Metastatic Colorectal Cancer.BACKGROUND: Dysregulated hepatocyte growth factor/mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) signaling is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to vascular endothelial growth factor inhibition in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).We report outcomes from a double-blind, multicenter phase II trial of the MET inhibitor onartuzumab in combination with mFOLFOX-6 and bevacizumab for mCRC (GO27827; NCT01418222).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive onartuzumab (10 mg/kg intravenously [IV]) or placebo plus mFOLFOX-6 and bevacizumab (5 mg/kg IV).Oxaliplatin was given for 8-12 cycles; other agents were continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or death.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) in the intent-to-treat (ITT) and MET immunohistochemistry (IHC) expression-positive populations.RESULTS: Between September 2011 and November 2012, 194 patients were enrolled.In September 2013, an interim analysis recommended stopping onartuzumab treatment due to lack of efficacy.At the time of the final analysis in February 2014, no significant improvement in PFS was seen with onartuzumab versus placebo in either the ITT or MET IHC-positive populations.An improvement in PFS was noted in the MET IHC-negative population.Neither overall survival nor response rate was improved with onartuzumab.The incidence of fatigue, peripheral edema, and deep vein thrombosis was increased with onartuzumab relative to placebo.CONCLUSION: Onartuzumab combined with mFOLFOX-6 and bevacizumab did not significantly improve efficacy outcomes in either the ITT or MET IHC-positive populations.MET expression by IHC was not a predictive biomarker in this setting.The Oncologist 2017;22:264-271 IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The addition of onartuzumab to mFOLFOX-6 plus bevacizumab did not improve outcomes in patients with previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer in this randomized, phase II study.Although initial results with onartuzumab were promising, a number of phase II/III clinical trials have reported a lack of improvement in efficacy with onartuzumab combined with standard-of-care therapies in several tumor types.Furthermore, negative study data have been published for rilotumumab and ficlatuzumab, both of which block hepatocyte growth factor binding to the mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) receptor.MET immunohistochemistry was not a predictive biomarker.It remains to be seen if other biomarkers or small molecule inhibitors may be more appropriate for inhibiting this oncogenic pathway.",1,1,1,1
31468214,"Assessment of DIEP Flap Perfusion with Intraoperative Indocyanine Green Fluorescence Imaging in Vasopressor-Dominated Hemodynamic Support Versus Liberal Fluid Administration: A Randomized Controlled Trial With Breast Cancer Patients.BACKGROUND: Dogmatic denial of vasopressor agents for blood pressure regulation during free-flap surgery is associated with concomitant large-volume intraoperative fluid administration.Yet, the doctrinal banning of vasopressors during microvascular breast reconstruction still is a subject of controversy.Several retrospective observations have recently drawn attention to serious iatrogenic consequences of intravenous crystalloid overload in microsurgery such as thrombus formation and increased flap failure rates.METHODS: This prospective randomized controlled trial investigated the potential effects of fluid-restrictive vasopressor-dominated hemodynamic support (FRV) compared with vasopressor-restrictive liberal fluid administration (LFA) on clinically relevant perfusion of the deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap via intraoperative indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging.The primary end point of the study was quantitative assessment of the percentage of insufficiently perfused tissue (NP) on the overall flap.Major complications were assessed as secondary end points.RESULTS: In 44 DIEP flap breast reconstructions after mastectomy, FRV circulatory support resulted in no statistically significant difference in total flap perfusion as detected via ICG fluorescence imaging in direct comparison with a traditional LFA strategy (NPFRV, 31.8% +/- 12.2% vs NPLFA, 29.5% +/- 13.3%; p = 0.559).One flap failure was registered with LFA, whereas no major complication occurred in the FRV cohort.CONCLUSIONS: According to the results of this study, neither a norepinephrine concentration of 0.065 +/- 0.020 mug/kg/min (FRV) nor fluid administration of 5.1 +/- 2.2 ml/kg/h (LFA) has a clinically significant impact on microperfusion in a standard DIEP flap procedure for breast reconstruction.Consistent with the current literature reporting a rise in complications with intraoperative fluid over-resuscitation, one flap failure occurred in the LFA cohort.",0,0,0,0

25778472,"Comparison of volumetric and linear serial CT assessments of lung metastases in renal cell carcinoma patients in a clinical phase IIB study.RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Accuracy of radiologic assessment may have a crucial impact on clinical studies and therapeutic decisions.We compared the variability of a central radiologic assessment (RECIST) and computer-aided volume-based assessment of lung lesions in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC).MATERIALS AND METHODS: The investigation was prospectively planned as a substudy of a clinical randomized phase IIB therapeutic trial in patients with RCC.Starting with the manual study diameter (SDM) of the central readers using RECIST in the clinical study, we performed computer-aided volume measurements.We compared SDM to an automated RECIST diameter (aRDM) and the diameter of a volume-equivalent sphere (effective diameter [EDM]), both for the individual size measurements and for the change rate (CR) between consecutive time points.One hundred thirty diameter pairs of 30 lung lesions from 14 patients were evaluable, forming 55 change pairs over two consecutive time points each.RESULTS: The SDMs of two different readers showed a correlation of 95.6%, whereas the EDMs exhibited an excellent correlation of 99.4%.Evaluation of CRs showed an SDM-CR correlation of 63.9%, which is substantially weaker than the EDM-CR correlation of 87.6%.The variability of SDM-CR is characterized by a median absolute difference of 11.4% points versus the significantly lower 1.8% points EDM-CRs variability (aRDM: 3.2% points).The limits of agreement between readers suggest that an EDM change of 10% or 1 mm can already be significant.CONCLUSIONS: Computer-aided volume-based assessments result in markedly reduced variability of parameters describing size and change, which may offer an advantage of earlier response evaluations and treatment decisions for patients.",0,0,0,0
31398258,"Randomized controlled trial on the effect of an online decision aid for young female cancer patients regarding fertility preservation.STUDY QUESTION: Does the use of an online decision aid (DA) about fertility preservation (FP), in addition to standard counselling by a specialist in reproductive medicine, reduce decisional conflict compared to standard counselling alone?SUMMARY ANSWER: Female cancer patients who could make use of the online DA had a significantly lower short-term decisional conflict score.WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Nowadays, female cancer patients have several options for preserving fertility, but having to decide whether to opt for FP within a short time frame after cancer diagnosis and before the start of treatment is challenging.According to previous studies focussing mainly on breast cancer patients, decisional conflict among these women is high, and they have expressed the need for additional support.STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: The study was a randomized controlled trial including female cancer patients who were referred by their treating oncologist to a specialist in reproductive medicine for fertility counselling.Participants were randomly assigned to the control group (counselling only) or to the intervention group (counselling and additional use of the online DA immediately after counselling).Recruitment was ongoing from July 2016 to December 2017 at eight fertility centres in Switzerland and Germany.PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The online DA was developed by an interdisciplinary team of specialists in reproductive medicine, gynaecologists, oncologists and psychologists.Of 79 recruited participants, 59 completed the first assessment and could therefore be enrolled in the study.They were asked to complete an online questionnaire at three time points: at T1, after counselling (control group, n = 27) or after counselling and the additional use of the DA (intervention group, n = 24); at T2, 1 month later (N = 41: control group, n = 23; intervention group, n = 18); and at T3, 12 months later (N = 37: control group, n = 20; intervention group, n = 17).The survey comprised questions about fertility-related knowledge, attitude towards FP, willingness to undergo FP and socio-demographic data, as well as the decisional conflict and decisional regret scales.MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: All participants showed low decisional conflict scores.Women who used the online DA in addition to counselling (intervention group) showed a significantly lower total score on the Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS) compared to the control group at T1 (P = 0.008; M = 12.15, SD = 4.38; 95% CI, 3.35-20.95) and at T2 (P = 0.043; M = 9.35, SD = 4.48; 95% CI, 0.31-18.38).At T3, the mean total score of the DCS was still lower in the intervention group compared to the control group; however, this group difference was no longer significant (P = 0.199, M = 6.86, SD = 5.24; 95% CI, -3.78 to 17.51).The majority of participants had already made a decision regarding FP (yes or no) at T1 (72.5%): 91.7% in the intervention group compared to 55.6% in the control group (P = 0.014).Those who had decided already at T1 showed significantly lower decisional conflict (P = 0.007; M = 13.69, SD = 4.89; 95% CI, 3.86-23.52).The average number of DA sessions per user was 2.23, and 80.8% of the participants completed the DA's value clarification exercises.Participants in the intervention group were satisfied with the DA and would recommend it to other patients.LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The recruitment of participants was challenging because of the emotionally difficult situation patients were in.This led to the limited sample size for final analysis.Education levels were high in two-thirds of the participants.It is difficult to say whether the DA would be equally effective in women with a lower educational background.WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: There is evidence that the DA served as a helpful complement to the decision-making process for young female cancer patients qualifying for FP.This is, to our knowledge, the first randomized controlled trial evaluating a DA targeted at patients with several cancer types and in a language other than English (i.e. German).This study contributes to extending the range of the still limited number of DAs in the context of FP.STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): The study was supported by a research grant of the Swiss Cancer Research.The authors declare that no competing interests exist.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: Clinicaltrials.gov, trial no.

25504949,"Effects of exercise on biobehavioral outcomes of fatigue during cancer treatment: results of a feasibility study.UNLABELLED: Cancer treatment is associated with decreased hemoglobin (Hb) concentration and aerobic fitness (VO2 max), which may contribute to cancer-related fatigue (CRF) and decreased quality of life (QoL).Endurance exercise may attenuate CRF and improve QoL, but the mechanisms have not been thoroughly investigated.Objectives.To (a) determine the feasibility of conducting an exercise intervention among women receiving treatment for breast cancer; (b) examine the effects of exercise on Hb and VO2 max and determine their association with changes in CRF and QoL; and (c) investigate changes in selected inflammatory markers.Methods.Fourteen women receiving chemotherapy for Stages I-II breast cancer were randomly assigned to exercise (n = 7) or usual care (n = 7).Women in the exercise group performed supervised, individualized treadmill exercise 2-3 times/week for the duration of chemotherapy (9-12 weeks).Data were collected 4 times over 15-16 weeks.Results.Recruitment rate was 45.7%.Sixteen women consented and 14 completed the trial, for a retention rate of 87.5%.Adherence to exercise protocol was 95-97%, and completion of data collection was 87.5-100%.Exercise was well tolerated.VO2 max was maintained at prechemotherapy levels in exercisers but declined in the usual-care group (p < .05).Hb decreased (p < .001) in all participants as they progressed through chemotherapy.Exercise did not have significant effects on CRF or QoL. Changes in inflammatory markers favored the exercise group.CONCLUSIONS: Exercise during chemotherapy may protect against chemotherapy-induced decline in VO2 max but not Hb concentration.",0,0,0,0

34551229,"Overall Survival Benefit with Tebentafusp in Metastatic Uveal Melanoma.BACKGROUND: Uveal melanoma is a disease that is distinct from cutaneous melanoma, with a low tumor mutational burden and a 1-year overall survival of approximately 50% in patients with metastatic uveal melanoma.Data showing a proven overall survival benefit with a systemic treatment are lacking.Tebentafusp is a bispecific protein consisting of an affinity-enhanced T-cell receptor fused to an anti-CD3 effector that can redirect T cells to target glycoprotein 100-positive cells.METHODS: In this open-label, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned previously untreated HLA-A*02:01-positive patients with metastatic uveal melanoma in a 2:1 ratio to receive tebentafusp (tebentafusp group) or the investigator's choice of therapy with single-agent pembrolizumab, ipilimumab, or dacarbazine (control group), stratified according to the lactate dehydrogenase level.The primary end point was overall survival.RESULTS: A total of 378 patients were randomly assigned to either the tebentafusp group (252 patients) or the control group (126 patients).Overall survival at 1 year was 73% in the tebentafusp group and 59% in the control group (hazard ratio for death, 0.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.37 to 0.71; P<0.001) in the intention-to-treat population.Progression-free survival was also significantly higher in the tebentafusp group than in the control group (31% vs. 19% at 6 months; hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.94; P = 0.01).The most common treatment-related adverse events in the tebentafusp group were cytokine-mediated events (due to T-cell activation) and skin-related events (due to glycoprotein 100-positive melanocytes), including rash (83%), pyrexia (76%), and pruritus (69%).These adverse events decreased in incidence and severity after the first three or four doses and infrequently led to discontinuation of the trial treatment (2%).No treatment-related deaths were reported.CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with tebentafusp resulted in longer overall survival than the control therapy among previously untreated patients with metastatic uveal melanoma.(Funded by Immunocore; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03070392; EudraCT number, 2015-003153-18.).",1,1,1,1
25012645,"The effect of resistance training during radiotherapy on spinal bone metastases in cancer patients - a randomized trial.PURPOSE: To compare the effects of resistance training versus passive physical therapy on bone density in the metastatic bone during radiation therapy (RT) as combined treatment in patients with spinal bone metastases.Secondly, to quantify pathological fractures after combined treatment.MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this randomized trial, 60 patients were allocated from September 2011 until March 2013 into one of the two groups: resistance training (group A) or passive physical therapy (group B) with thirty patients in each group during RT.Bone density in metastatic and non-metastatic vertebral bone was assessed at baseline, 3 and 6 months after RT.RESULTS: Bone density in all metastases increased significantly by 28.3% (IQR 11.4-139.0) and 80.3% (IQR 32.6-250.6) after 3 and 6 months in group A (both p < 0.01).The bone density in group A was significantly increased compared to control group after 3 and 6months (both p < 0.01, median 59.7; IQR 21.1-98.3 and median 62.9; IQR -9.7 to 161.7).The bone density data in group B showed no significant increase over the course of time (p = 0.289, median 5.5, IQR 0.0-62.2 and p = 0.057, median 52.1, IQR 0.0-162.7).23.3% of the patients in group A and 30.0% of the patients in group B had pathological fractures, no fracture was assigned to intervention, and no difference between groups after 3 and 6 months was observed (p = 0.592 and p = 0.604).CONCLUSIONS: Our trial demonstrated that resistance training concomitant to RT can improve bone density in spinal bone metastases.This combined treatment is effective, practicable, and without side effects for patients.Importantly, the pathological fracture rate in the intervention group was not increased.The results offer a rationale for future large controlled investigations to confirm these findings.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical trial identifier NCT01409720.",0,0,0,0
27782851,"Surefire infusion system versus standard microcatheter use during holmium-166 radioembolization: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: An anti-reflux catheter (ARC) may increase the tumor absorbed dose during radioembolization (RE) by elimination of particle reflux and its effects on hemodynamics.Since the catheter is fixed in a centro-luminal position, it may also increase the predictive accuracy of a scout dose administration before treatment.The purpose of the SIM trial is to compare the effects of ARC use during RE with holmium-166 ((166)Ho) microspheres in patients with colorectal liver metastases (CRLM), with the use of a standard end-hole microcatheter.METHODS/DESIGN: A within-patient randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted in 25 patients with unresectable chemorefractory liver-dominant CRLM.Study participants will undergo a (166)Ho scout dose procedure in the morning and a therapeutic procedure in the afternoon.The ARC will be randomly allocated to the left/right hepatic artery, and a standard microcatheter will be used in the contralateral artery.SPECT/CT imaging will be performed for quantitative analyses of the microsphere distribution directly after the scout and treatment procedure.Baseline and follow-up investigations include (18)F-FDG-PET + liver CT, clinical and laboratory examinations.The primary endpoint is the comparison of tumor to non-tumor (T/N) activity ratio in both groups.Secondary endpoints include comparisons of mean absorbed dose in tumors and healthy liver tissue, infusion efficiency, the predictive value of (166)Ho scout dose for tumor response.In the entire cohort, a dose-response relationship, clinical toxicity, and overall survival will be assessed.The sample was determined for the expectation that the ARC will increase the T/N ratio by 25 % (mean T/N ratio 2.0 vs. 1.6).DISCUSSION: The SIM trial is a within-patient RCT that will assess whether (166)Ho RE treatment can be optimized by using an ARC.TRIAL REGISTRATION: The SIM trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT02208804 ).Registered on 31 July 2014.",0,0,0,0
34021033,"Randomized phase II trial of lymphodepletion plus adoptive cell transfer of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, with or without dendritic cell vaccination, in patients with metastatic melanoma.BACKGROUND: The adoptive transfer of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) has demonstrated robust efficacy in metastatic melanoma patients.Tumor antigen-loaded dendritic cells (DCs) are believed to optimally activate antigen-specific T lymphocytes.We hypothesized that the combined transfer of TIL, containing a melanoma antigen recognized by T cells 1 (MART-1) specific population, with MART-1-pulsed DC will result in enhanced proliferation and prolonged survival of transferred MART-1 specific T cells in vivo ultimately leading to improved clinical responses.DESIGN: We tested the combination of TIL and DC in a phase II clinical trial of patients with advanced stage IV melanoma.HLA-A0201 patients whose early TIL cultures demonstrated reactivity to MART-1 peptide were randomly assigned to receive TIL alone or TIL +DC pulsed with MART-1 peptide.The primary endpoint was to evaluate the persistence of MART-1 TIL in the two arms.Secondary endpoints were to evaluate clinical response and survival.RESULTS: Ten patients were given TIL alone while eight patients received TIL+DC vaccine.Infused MART-1 reactive CD8(+) TIL were tracked in the blood over time by flow cytometry and results show good persistence in both arms, with no difference in the persistence of MART-1 between the two arms.The objective response rate was 30% (3/10) in the TIL arm and 50% (4/8) in the TIL+DC arm.All treatments were well tolerated.CONCLUSIONS: The combination of TIL +DC showed no difference in the persistence of MART-1 TIL compared with TIL therapy alone.Although more patients showed a clinical response to TIL+DC therapy, this study was not powered to resolve differences between groups.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT00338377.",1,1,0,0

Patients received 7 treatment cycles in median (1-35) with a median treatment duration of 4.7 months (141 days, 8-765).PFS rate at 6 months was 54% in patients treated with cisplatin/gemcitabine and panitumumab but was 73% in patients treated with cisplatin/gemcitabine without antibody, respectively.Secondary end-points were an ORR of 45% in treatment arm A compared with 39% receiving treatment B and a median OS of 12.8 months (arm A) and of 20.1 months (arm B), respectively.In contrast to the p53-status, genetic alterations in IDH1/2 were linked to a high response after chemotherapy and prolonged survival.In accordance with our results, the meta-analysis of 12 trials did not reveal a survival advantage for patients treated with EGFR antibodies compared with chemotherapy alone.CONCLUSIONS: Panitumumab in combination with chemotherapy does not improve ORR, PFS and OS in patients with KRAS wild-type, advanced biliary cancer.Genetic profiling should be included in CCA trials to identify and validate predictive and prognostic biomarkers.CLINICAL TRIALS NUMBER: The trial was registered with NCT01320254.",1,1,1,1
33865797,"Limited versus Extended Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection for Prostate Cancer: A Randomized Clinical Trial.BACKGROUND: Pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) is the most reliable procedure for lymph node staging.However, the therapeutic benefit remains unproven; although most radical prostatectomies at academic centers are accompanied by PLND, there is no consensus regarding the optimal anatomical extent of PLND.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether extended PLND results in a lower biochemical recurrence rate.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a single-center randomized trial.Patients, enrolled between October 2011 and March 2017, were scheduled to undergo radical prostatectomy and PLND.Patients were assigned to limited or extended PLND by cluster randomization.Specifically, surgeons were randomized to perform limited or extended PLND for 3-mo periods.INTERVENTION: Randomization to limited (external iliac nodes) or extended (external iliac, obturator fossa and hypogastric nodes) PLND.OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The primary endpoint was the rate of biochemical recurrence.RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Of 1440 patients included in the final analysis, 700 were randomized to limited PLND and 740 to extended PLND.The median number of nodes retrieved was 12 (interquartile range [IQR] 8-17) for limited PLND and 14 (IQR 10-20) extended PLND; the corresponding rate of positive nodes was 12% and 14% (difference -1.9%, 95% confidence interval [CI] -5.4% to 1.5%; p = 0.3).With median follow-up of 3.1 yr, there was no significant difference in the rate of biochemical recurrence between the groups (hazard ratio 1.04, 95% CI 0.93-1.15; p = 0.5).Rates for grade 2 and 3 complications were similar at 7.3% for limited versus 6.4% for extended PLND; there were no grade 4 or 5 complications.CONCLUSIONS: Extended PLND did not improve freedom from biochemical recurrence over limited PLND for men with clinically localized prostate cancer.However, there were smaller than expected differences in nodal count and the rate of positive nodes between the two templates.A randomized trial comparing PLND to no node dissection is warranted.PATIENT SUMMARY: In this clinical trial we did not find a difference in the rate of biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer between limited and extended dissection of lymph nodes in the pelvis.This study is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT01407263.",1,1,1,0

29370781,"The PANDA study: a randomized phase II study of first-line FOLFOX plus panitumumab versus 5FU plus panitumumab in RAS and BRAF wild-type elderly metastatic colorectal cancer patients.BACKGROUND: Few data are available regarding the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer elderly patients with anti-EGFR agents in combination with chemotherapy.FOLFOX plus panitumumab is a standard first-line option for RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer.Slight adjustments in chemo-dosage are commonly applied in clinical practice to elderly patients, but those modified schedules have never been prospectively tested.Clinical definition of elderly (>/=70 years old) patients that may deserve a more or less intensive combination therapy is still debated.Several geriatric screening tools have been developed to predict survival and risk of toxicity from treatment.Among those, the G8 screening tool has been tested in cancer patients showing the strongest prognostic value for overall survival, while the CRASH score can stratify patients according to an estimated risk of treatment-related toxicities.METHODS: The PANDA study is a prospective, open-label, multicenter, randomized phase II trial of first-line therapy with panitumumab in combination with dose-adjusted FOLFOX or with 5-fluorouracil monotherapy, in previously untreated elderly patients (>/=70 years) with RAS and BRAF wild-type unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer.RAS and BRAF analyses are centralized.Geriatric assessment by means of G8 and CRASH score is planned at baseline and G8 will be re-evaluated at disease progression.The primary endpoint is duration of progression-free survival in both arms.Secondary endpoints include prospective evaluation of the prognostic role of G8 score and the correlation of CRASH risk categories with toxicity.DISCUSSION: The PANDA study aims at exploring safety and efficacy of panitumumab in combination with FOLFOX or with 5FU/LV in elderly patients affected by RAS and BRAF wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer, to identify the most promising treatment strategy in this setting.Additionally, this is the first trial in which the prognostic role of the G8 score will be prospectively evaluated.Results of this study will drive further experimental developments for one or both combinations.TRIAL REGISTRATION: PANDA is registered at Clinicaltrials.gov : NCT02904031 , July 11, 2016.PANDA is registered at EudraCT-No.: 2015-003888-10, September 3, 2015.",1,1,1,0
28623628,"Does Patient Preference Measurement in Decision Aids Improve Decisional Conflict? A Randomized Trial in Men with Prostate Cancer.BACKGROUND: Shared decision making (SDM) has been advocated as an approach to medical decision making that can improve decisional quality.Decision aids are tools that facilitate SDM in the context of limited physician time; however, many decision aids do not incorporate preference measurement.OBJECTIVES: We aim to understand whether adding preference measurement to a standard patient educational intervention improves decisional quality and is feasible in a busy clinical setting.METHODS: Men with incident localized prostate cancer (n = 122) were recruited from the Greater Los Angeles Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center urology clinic, Olive View UCLA Medical Center, and Harbor UCLA Medical Center from January 2011 to May 2015 and randomized to education with a brochure about prostate cancer treatment or software-based preference assessment in addition to the brochure.Men undergoing preference assessment received a report detailing the relative strength of their preferences for treatment outcomes used in review with their doctor.Participants completed instruments measuring decisional conflict, knowledge, SDM, and patient satisfaction with care before and/or after their cancer consultation.RESULTS: Baseline knowledge scores were low (mean 62%).The baseline mean total score on the Decisional Conflict Scale was 2.3 (+/-0.9), signifying moderate decisional conflict.Men undergoing preference assessment had a significantly larger decrease in decisional conflict total score (p = 0.023) and the Perceived Effective Decision Making subscale (p = 0.003) post consult compared with those receiving education only.Improvements in satisfaction with care, SDM, and knowledge were similar between groups.CONCLUSIONS: Individual-level preference assessment is feasible in the clinic setting.Patients with prostate cancer who undergo preference assessment are more certain about their treatment decisions and report decreased levels of decisional conflict when making these decisions.",0,0,0,0
34688374,"Neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade with toripalimab, with or without celecoxib, in mismatch repair-deficient or microsatellite instability-high, locally advanced, colorectal cancer (PICC): a single-centre, parallel-group, non-comparative, randomised, phase 2 trial.BACKGROUND: PD-1 blockade is highly effective in patients with mismatch repair-deficient or microsatellite instability-high metastatic colorectal cancer.The role of single-agent PD-1 blockade in the neoadjuvant setting for resectable mismatch repair-deficient or microsatellite instability-high colorectal cancer remains unclear.We investigated the efficacy and safety of PD-1 blockade with toripalimab, with or without the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib, as neoadjuvant treatment for mismatch repair-deficient or microsatellite instability-high, locally advanced, colorectal cancers.METHODS: The PD-1 Inhibitor in Microsatellite Instability Colorectal Cancer (PICC) trial was a single-centre, open-label, parallel-group, non-comparative, randomised, phase 2 study undertaken at the Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University (Guangzhou, China).Eligible patients were aged 18-75 years, had histologically confirmed mismatch repair-deficient or microsatellite instability-high colorectal cancer, had clinical stage T3-T4 or any T with lymph node positivity (N+), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score of 0 or 1, and adequate haematological, hepatic, and renal function.Participants were randomly assigned (1:1), without any stratification or balanced blocking, to receive toripalimab 3 mg/kg intravenously on day 1, with or without celecoxib 200 mg orally twice daily from day 1 to 14 of each 14-day cycle, for six cycles before surgical resection.Adjuvant treatment with toripalimab with or without celecoxib was permitted at the investigators' discretion.The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with pathological complete response, defined as tumours without any viable tumour cells in the resected primary tumour sample and all sampled regional lymph nodes.All efficacy and safety analyses were assessed in the modified intention-to-treat population, which included all patients who were randomly assigned to treatment and who received at least one dose of toripalimab.This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03926338, and is ongoing.FINDINGS: Between May 1, 2019, and April 1, 2021, 53 patients were screened, of whom 34 were randomly assigned to either the toripalimab plus celecoxib group (n=17) or the toripalimab monotherapy group (n=17).As of data cutoff (Aug 10, 2021), median follow-up was 14.9 months (IQR 8.8-17.0).All patients received study treatment and underwent surgical resection; there were no treatment-related surgical delays.All 34 patients had an R0 resection (>1 mm resection margin).15 of 17 patients (88% [95% CI 64-99]) in the toripalimab plus celecoxib group and 11 of 17 patients (65% [38-86]) in the toripalimab monotherapy group had a pathological complete response.All patients continued to receive adjuvant toripalimab with or without celecoxib for a total perioperative duration of 6 months and were alive and free of recurrence at data cutoff.During neoadjuvant treatment, ten (59%) patients in the toripalimab plus celecoxib group and ten (59%) in the toripalimab monotherapy group had grade 1-2 treatment-related adverse events.Only one (3%) of 34 patients, who was in the toripalimab plus celecoxib group, had a grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse event during the neoadjuvant phase, which was grade 3 increased aspartate aminotransferase levels.In the adjuvant phase, only one (3%) of 34 patients, who was in the toripalimab monotherapy group, had a grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events, which was grade 3 increased aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels.INTERPRETATION: Neoadjuvant toripalimab with or without celecoxib could be a potential therapeutic option for patients with mismatch repair deficient or microsatellite instability-high, locally advanced, colorectal cancer.This treatment was associated with a high pathological complete response rate and an acceptable safety profile, which did not compromise surgery.Longer term follow-up is needed to assess effects on survival-related endpoints.FUNDING: The National Key R&D Program of China, the National Natural Science Foundation of China, and the Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology-Junshi Biosciences Oncology Immunity Research.TRANSLATION: For the Chinese translation of the abstract see Supplementary Materials section.",1,1,1,1
26897518,"TOPical Imiquimod treatment of high-grade Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (TOPIC trial): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) is the premalignant condition of cervical cancer.Whereas not all high grade CIN lesions progress to cervical cancer, the natural history and risk of progression of individual lesions remain unpredictable.Therefore, high-grade CIN is currently treated by surgical excision: large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ).This procedure has potential complications, such as acute haemorrhage, prolonged bleeding, infection and preterm birth in subsequent pregnancies.These complications could be prevented by development of a non-invasive treatment modality, such as topical imiquimod treatment.The primary study objective is to investigate the efficacy of topical imiquimod 5% cream for the treatment of high-grade CIN and to develop a biomarker profile to predict clinical response to imiquimod treatment.Secondary study objectives are to assess treatment side-effects, disease recurrence and quality of life during and after different treatment modalities.METHODS/DESIGN: The study design is a randomized controlled trial.One hundred forty women with a histological diagnosis of high-grade CIN (CIN 2-3) will be randomized into two arms: imiquimod treatment during 16 weeks (experimental arm) or immediate LLETZ (standard care arm).Treatment efficacy will be evaluated by colposcopy with diagnostic biopsies at 20 weeks for the experimental arm.Successful imiquimod treatment is defined as regression to CIN 1 or less, successful LLETZ treatment is defined as PAP 1 after 6 months.Disease recurrence will be evaluated by cytology at 6, 12 and 24 months after treatment.Side-effects will be evaluated using a standardized report form.Quality of life will be evaluated using validated questionnaires at baseline, 20 weeks and 1 year after treatment.Biomarkers, reflecting both host and viral factors in the pathophysiology of CIN, will be tested at baseline with the aim of developing a predictive biomarker profile for the clinical response to imiquimod treatment.DISCUSSION: Treatment of high-grade CIN lesions with imiquimod in a selected patient population may diminish complications as a result of surgical intervention.More knowledge on treatment efficacy, side effects and long-term recurrence rates after treatment is necessary.TRIAL REGISTRATION: EU Clinical Trials Register EU-CTR2013-001260-34 .Registered 18 March 2013.Medical Ethical Committee approval number: NL44336.068.13 (Medical Ethical Committee Maastricht University Hospital, University of Maastricht).Affiliation: Maastricht University Hospital.Registration number ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02329171.",1,1,1,0
31591063,"Ramucirumab plus erlotinib in patients with untreated, EGFR-mutated, advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (RELAY): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Dual blockade of the EGFR and VEGF pathways in EGFR-mutated metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is supported by preclinical and clinical data, yet the approach is not widely implemented.RELAY assessed erlotinib, an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) standard of care, plus ramucirumab, a human IgG1 VEGFR2 antagonist, or placebo in patients with untreated EGFR-mutated metastatic NSCLC.METHODS: This is a worldwide, double-blind, phase 3 trial done in 100 hospitals, clinics, and medical centres in 13 countries.Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older (20 years or older in Japan and Taiwan) at the time of study entry, had stage IV NSCLC, with an EGFR exon 19 deletion (ex19del) or exon 21 substitution (Leu858Arg) mutation, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, and no CNS metastases.We randomly assigned eligible patients in a 1:1 ratio to receive oral erlotinib (150 mg/day) plus either intravenous ramucirumab (10 mg/kg) or matching placebo once every 2 weeks.Randomisation was done by an interactive web response system with a computer-generated sequence and stratified by sex, geographical region, EGFR mutation type, and EGFR testing method.The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population.Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment.This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02411448, and is ongoing for long-term survival follow-up.FINDINGS: Between Jan 28, 2016, and Feb 1, 2018, 449 eligible patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to treatment with ramucirumab plus erlotinib (n=224) or placebo plus erlotinib (n=225).Median duration of follow-up was 20.7 months (IQR 15.8-27.2).At the time of primary analysis, progression-free survival was significantly longer in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib group (19.4 months [95% CI 15.4-21.6]) than in the placebo plus erlotinib group (12.4 months [11.0-13.5]), with a stratified hazard ratio of 0.59 (95% CI 0.46-0.76; p<0.0001).Grade 3-4 treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 159 (72%) of 221 patients in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib group versus 121 (54%) of 225 in the placebo plus erlotinib group.The most common grade 3-4 treatment-emergent adverse events in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib group were hypertension (52 [24%]; grade 3 only) and dermatitis acneiform (33 [15%]), and in the placebo plus erlotinib group were dermatitis acneiform (20 [9%]) and increased alanine aminotransferase (17 [8%]).Treatment-emergent serious adverse events were reported in 65 (29%) of 221 patients in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib group and 47 (21%) of 225 in the placebo plus erlotinib group.The most common serious adverse events of any grade in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib group were pneumonia (seven [3%]) and cellulitis and pneumothorax (four [2%], each); the most common in the placebo plus erlotinib group were pyrexia (four [2%]) and pneumothorax (three [1%]).One on-study treatment-related death due to an adverse event occurred (haemothorax after a thoracic drainage procedure for a pleural empyema) in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib group.INTERPRETATION: Ramucirumab plus erlotinib demonstrated superior progression-free survival compared with placebo plus erlotinib in patients with untreated EGFR-mutated metastatic NSCLC.Safety was consistent with the safety profiles of the individual compounds in advanced lung cancer.The RELAY regimen is a viable new treatment option for the initial treatment of EGFR-mutated metastatic NSCLC.FUNDING: Eli Lilly.",1,1,1,1

23497452,"A randomized trial to assess the biological activity of short-term (pre-surgical) fulvestrant 500 mg plus anastrozole versus fulvestrant 500 mg alone or anastrozole alone on primary breast cancer.INTRODUCTION: Fulvestrant shows dose-dependent biological activity.Greater estrogen-receptor (ER) blockade may feasibly be achieved by combining fulvestrant with anastrozole.This pre-surgical study compared fulvestrant plus anastrozole versus either agent alone in patients with ER-positive breast cancer.METHODS: In this double-blind, multicenter trial, 121 patients received fulvestrant 500 mg on Day 1 plus anastrozole 1 mg/day for 14 to 21 days (F + A); fulvestrant plus anastrozole placebo (F); or fulvestrant placebo plus anastrozole (A), 2 to 3 weeks before surgery.ER, progesterone-receptor (PgR) and Ki67 expression were determined from tumor biopsies before treatment and at surgery.RESULTS: A total of 103 paired samples were available (F, n = 35; F+A, n = 31; A, n = 37).All treatments significantly reduced mean ER expression from baseline (F: -41%, P = 0.0001; F + A: -39%, P = 0.0001; A: -13%, P = 0.0034).F and F + A led to greater reductions in ER versus A (both P = 0.0001); F + A did not lead to additional reductions versus F. PgR and Ki67 expression were significantly reduced with all treatments (means were -34% to -45%, and -75% to -85%, respectively; all P = 0.0001), with no differences between groups.CONCLUSIONS: In this short-term study, all treatments reduced ER expression, although F and F + A showed greater reductions than A. No significant differences were detected between the treatment groups in terms of PgR and Ki67 expression.No additional reduction in tumor biomarkers with combination treatment was observed, suggesting that F + A is unlikely to have further clinical benefit over F alone.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00259090.",1,1,1,1
28958502,"Dacomitinib versus gefitinib as first-line treatment for patients with EGFR-mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (ARCHER 1050): a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Dacomitinib is a second-generation, irreversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor.We compared its efficacy and safety with that of the reversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib in the first-line treatment of patients with advanced EGFR-mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).METHODS: In this international, multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3 study (ARCHER 1050), we enrolled adults (aged >/=18 years or >/=20 years in Japan and South Korea) with newly diagnosed advanced NSCLC and one EGFR mutation (exon 19 deletion or Leu858Arg) at 71 academic medical centres and university hospitals in seven countries or special administrative regions.We randomly assigned participants (1:1) to receive oral dacomitinib 45 mg/day (in 28-day cycles) or oral gefitinib 250 mg/day (in 28-day cycles) until disease progression or another discontinuation criterion was met.Randomisation, stratified by race and EGFR mutation type, was done with a computer-generated random code assigned by a central interactive web response system.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival assessed by masked independent review in the intention-to-treat population.Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01774721, and is ongoing but no longer recruiting patients.FINDINGS: Between May 9, 2013, and March 20, 2015, 452 eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive dacomitinib (n=227) or gefitinib (n=225).Median duration of follow-up for progression-free survival was 22.1 months (95% CI 20.3-23.9).Median progression-free survival according to masked independent review was 14.7 months (95% CI 11.1-16.6) in the dacomitinib group and 9.2 months (9.1-11.0) in the gefitinib group (hazard ratio 0.59, 95% CI 0.47-0.74; p<0.0001).The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were dermatitis acneiform (31 [14%] of 227 patients given dacomitinib vs none of 224 patients given gefitinib), diarrhoea (19 [8%] vs two [1%]), and raised alanine aminotransferase levels (two [1%] vs 19 [8%]).Treatment-related serious adverse events were reported in 21 (9%) patients given dacomitinib and in ten (4%) patients given gefitinib.Two treatment-related deaths occurred in the dacomitinib group (one related to untreated diarrhoea and one to untreated cholelithases/liver disease) and one in the gefitinib group (related to sigmoid colon diverticulitis/rupture complicated by pneumonia).INTERPRETATION: Dacomitinib significantly improved progression-free survival over gefitinib in first-line treatment of patients with EGFR-mutation-positive NSCLC and should be considered as a new treatment option for this population.FUNDING: SFJ Pharmaceuticals Group and Pfizer.",1,1,1,1
32240542,"Effects of mobile text messaging on breast cancer and breast self-examination (BSE) knowledge, BSE self-efficacy, and BSE frequency: a randomised controlled trial.AIMS: Educating women regarding breast cancer and increasing breast self-examination uptake continues to remain a major challenge despite the intensive campaigns.An innovative, cost-effective and easily customised intervention is needed especially in under-resourced and hard to reach communities.This paper is a report examining the effects of mobile text messaging on women's knowledge of breast cancer and BSE, BSE self-efficacy and frequency of BSE.METHODS: A randomised controlled trial design was used.The study sample consisted of 128 women of reproductive age (WRA) (64 in the experimental group and 64 in the control group) from two communities in the Philippines during the months of August to October 2018.Three to five short messages were sent to the participants in the experimental group daily for one month while the control group did not receive the messages.RESULTS: Women who received mobile text messages had higher knowledge of breast cancer (F = 21.756, p = 0.001) and breast self-examination (F = 6.776, p = 0.010) than the control group.However, no significant improvements were seen in the BSE self-efficacy (F = 1.446, p = 0.232) and frequency of BSE (F = 3.374, p = 0.69).CONCLUSION: Mobile text messaging significantly improved the knowledge on breast cancer and breast self-examination among women; however, it did not affect their breast self-examination self-efficacy and frequency.Mobile text messaging can be a viable tool that can be used by healthcare workers in order to educate women regarding breast cancer and breast self-examination.",0,0,0,0

24852569,"In Barrett's esophagus patients and Barrett's cell lines, ursodeoxycholic acid increases antioxidant expression and prevents DNA damage by bile acids.Hydrophobic bile acids like deoxycholic acid (DCA), which cause oxidative DNA damage and activate NF-kappaB in Barrett's metaplasia, might contribute to carcinogenesis in Barrett's esophagus.We have explored mechanisms whereby ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA, a hydrophilic bile acid) protects against DCA-induced injury in vivo in patients and in vitro using nonneoplastic, telomerase-immortalized Barrett's cell lines.We took biopsies of Barrett's esophagus from 21 patients before and after esophageal perfusion with DCA (250 muM) at baseline and after 8 wk of oral UDCA treatment.DNA damage was assessed by phospho-H2AX expression, neutral CometAssay, and phospho-H2AX nuclear foci formation.Quantitative PCR was performed for antioxidants including catalase and GPX1.Nrf2, catalase, and GPX1 were knocked down with siRNAs.Reporter assays were performed using a plasmid construct containing antioxidant responsive element.In patients, baseline esophageal perfusion with DCA significantly increased phospho-H2AX and phospho-p65 in Barrett's metaplasia.Oral UDCA increased GPX1 and catalase levels in Barrett's metaplasia and prevented DCA perfusion from inducing DNA damage and NF-kappaB activation.In cells, DCA-induced DNA damage and NF-kappaB activation was prevented by 24-h pretreatment with UDCA, but not by mixing UDCA with DCA.UDCA activated Nrf2 signaling to increase GPX1 and catalase expression, and protective effects of UDCA pretreatment were blocked by siRNA knockdown of these antioxidants.UDCA increases expression of antioxidants that prevent toxic bile acids from causing DNA damage and NF-kappaB activation in Barrett's metaplasia.Elucidation of this molecular pathway for UDCA protection provides rationale for clinical trials on UDCA for chemoprevention in Barrett's esophagus.",0,0,0,0
29319209,"Effectiveness of antibacterial prophylaxis during induction chemotherapy in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.BACKGROUND: Pediatric patients receiving induction chemotherapy for newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are at high risk of developing life-threatening infections.We investigated whether uniform antibacterial guidelines, including mandatory antibacterial prophylaxis in afebrile patients during induction, decreases the incidence of microbiologically documented bacteremia.METHODS: Between 2012 and 2015, 230 patients with newly diagnosed ALL (aged 1-21) were enrolled on Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ALL Consortium Protocol 11-001 (DFCI 11-001).Induction therapy, regardless of risk group, included vincristine, prednisone, doxorubicin, methotrexate, and PEG-asparaginase.Afebrile patients received fluoroquinolone prophylaxis at the initiation of induction and those presenting with fever received broad-spectrum antibiotics; antibiotics were continued until blood count recovery.Rates of documented bacteremias and fungal infections on DFCI 11-001 were compared to those on the predecessor protocol (DFCI 05-001), which included the same induction phase without antibiotic prophylaxis guidelines.RESULTS: Sixty-six (28.7%) patients received fluoroquinolone prophylaxis, the remaining patients received broad-spectrum antibiotics.Twenty-four (36.4%) patients on prophylaxis developed fever and seven (10.6%) developed bacteremia.The overall rate of infection during induction on DFCI 11-001 was lower than on DFCl 05-001 (14.3% vs. 26.3%, P < 0.0001) due to a decreased rate of bacteremia (10.9% vs. 24.4%, P < 0.0001).The rate of fungal infections (4.8% vs. 3.6%) and induction death (0.9% vs. 2%) was not significantly different.CONCLUSION: For children with newly diagnosed ALL, uniform antibiotic administration until blood count recovery, including fluoroquinolone prophylaxis for afebrile patients, reduced the incidence of bacteremia during the induction phase.Larger, randomized studies should be performed to confirm these findings.",0,0,0,0

33947608,"Time to Resolution of Axitinib-Related Adverse Events After Treatment Interruption in Patients With Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma.INTRODUCTION: Combined axitinib and immuno-oncology (IO) therapy is approved for first-line advanced renal cell carcinoma.Overlapping toxicities represent a clinical challenge.Calculating the time to resolution (TTR) of common axitinib-related adverse events (AEs) after treatment interruption may help to identify AE etiology and determine appropriate management strategies.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from 5 randomized or single-arm axitinib monotherapy or combination studies were analyzed.Patients with histologically confirmed clear cell advanced renal cell carcinoma were pooled into 3 cohorts based on treatment received: axitinib monotherapy, axitinib + IO, and other tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).Any grade and grade >/=3 treatment-emergent diarrhea, fatigue, hypertension, nausea, and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome were assessed.TTR was defined as the time from treatment interruption/discontinuation to resolution.RESULTS: The axitinib monotherapy cohort comprised 532 patients, the axitinib + IO cohort 541 patients, and the other TKI cohort 882 patients.Median TTR for all AEs (any grade) in the axitinib monotherapy cohort ranged from 1 to 3 days, except for fatigue (8 days).For diarrhea, hypertension, nausea, and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome, median TTRs were longer in the axitinib + IO (4-11 days) and other TKI (7-8 days) cohorts versus the monotherapy cohort.Results were similar when only AEs of grade >/=3 were considered.CONCLUSIONS: The TTR of monotherapeutic axitinib-related AEs is </=3 days, except for fatigue, and generally shorter than for other single-agent TKIs and axitinib + IO.This has important implications for identifying AE etiology with combined axitinib-IO therapy and implementation of appropriate management strategies.ClinicalTrials.org identifiers: NCT00678392, NCT00920816, NCT02493751, NCT02684006, NCT02853331.",0,0,0,0

28743247,"A randomized phase II study of paclitaxel alone versus paclitaxel plus sorafenib in second- and third-line treatment of patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer (PASO).BACKGROUND: We conducted an open-label, randomized, two-arm multi-center study to assess the efficacy and safety of paclitaxel versus paclitaxel + sorafenib in patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer.METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive either paclitaxel monotherapy (80 mg/m(2)) weekly (3 weeks on, 1 week off) plus sorafenib 400 mg orally, twice a day taken continuously throughout 28 day cycles.Sorafenib dose was gradually escalated from a starting dose of 200 mg twice a day.The primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS).RESULTS: A pre-planned efficacy interim analysis was performed on the data of 60 patients, 30 patients in each treatment arm.Median PFS was estimated at 6.6 months (95% CI: 5.1 to 9.0) in patients randomized to single-agent paclitaxel (Arm A) and 5.6 months (95% CI: 3.8 to 6.5) in patients randomized to paclitaxel-sorafenib combination (Arm B) therapy.Contrary to the hypothesis, the treatment effect was statistically significant in favor of paclitaxel monotherapy (hazard ratio 1.80, 95% CI: 1.02 to 3.20; log-rank test P = 0.0409).It was decided to stop the trial early for futility.Median OS was also in favor of Arm A (20.7 months (95% CI: 16.4 to 26.7) versus 12.1 months (95% CI: 5.8 to 20.4) in Arm B. Clinical control was achieved in 28 patients (93.3%) in Arm A and in 21 patients 70.0% in Arm B. Overall response rate was met in 43.3% of patients in Arm A and in 40.0% in Arm B. Toxicities were increased in Arm B with higher rates of diarrhea, nausea, neutropenia, hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) and anorexia, Grad 3 and 4 toxicities were rare.CONCLUSIONS: In this pre-planned interim analysis, paclitaxel-sorafenib combination therapy was not found to be superior to paclitaxel monotherapy with regard to the primary end point, progression-free survival.The trial was therefore discontinued early.There was no indication of more favorable outcomes for combination therapy in secondary efficacy end points.As expected, the safety and toxicity profile of the combination therapy was less favorable compared to monotherapy.Overall, this trial did not demonstrate that adding sorafenib to second- or third-line paclitaxel provides any clinical benefit to patients with HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer.Cautious dosing using a sorafenib ramp up schedule might have contributed to negative results.TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered at EudraCT (No 2009-018025-73) and retrospectively registered at Clinical trials.gov on March 17, 2011 ( NCT01320111 ).",1,1,1,1

27067306,"Correlates of Sun Protection and Sunburn in Children of Melanoma Survivors.INTRODUCTION: Sunburns during childhood increase melanoma risk.Children of melanoma survivors are at higher risk, but little is known about their sunburn and sun protection.One study showed that almost half of melanoma survivors' children experienced sunburn in the past year.This study evaluated sunburn and sun protection in melanoma survivors' children, and relevant survivor characteristics from Social Cognitive Theory and the Health Belief Model.METHODS: Melanoma survivors (N=340) were recruited from a comprehensive cancer center.Survivors completed a baseline questionnaire administered by telephone to report on the behavior of their children (N=340) as part of an RCT of a sun protection intervention.Data were collected in 2008 and analyzed in 2015.RESULTS: In the prior 6 months, 28% of children experienced sunburn. ""Always"" or ""frequent"" sun protection varied by behavior: sunscreen, 69%; lip balm, 15%; wide-brimmed hats, 9%; sleeved shirts, 28%; pants, 48%; sunglasses, 10%; shade, 33%; and limiting time outdoors, 45%.Survivors' sunburn and sun protection were positively associated with these outcomes in children.Correlates of sunburn also included older child age and higher risk perceptions.Correlates of sun protection behaviors included younger child age; stronger intentions, higher self-efficacy, and more positive outcome expectations about sun protection; and greater number of melanomas in survivors.CONCLUSIONS: Melanoma survivors may have a heightened awareness of the importance of their children's sun protection, but their children are not routinely protected.Correlates of children's sunburn and sun protection suggest subgroups of survivors to target with interventions to improve sun protection.",0,0,0,0
28352657,"Randomized, placebo-controlled window trial of EGFR, Src, or combined blockade in head and neck cancer.BACKGROUND.EGFR and Src family kinases are upregulated in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).EGFR interacts with Src to activate STAT3 signaling, and dual EGFR-Src targeting is synergistic in HNSCC preclinical models.pSrc overexpression predicted resistance to the EGFR inhibitor, erlotinib, in a prior window trial.We conducted a 4-arm window trial to identify biomarkers associated with response to EGFR and/or Src inhibition.METHODS.Patients with operable stage II-IVa HNSCC were randomized to 7-21 days of neoadjuvant erlotinib, the Src inhibitor dasatinib, the combination of both, or placebo.Paired tumor specimens were collected before and after treatment.Pharmacodynamic expression of EGFR and Src pathway components was evaluated by IHC of tissue microarrays and reverse-phase protein array of tissue lysates.Candidate biomarkers were assessed for correlation with change in tumor size.RESULTS.From April 2009 to December 2012, 58 patients were randomized and 55 were treated.There was a significant decrease in tumor size in both erlotinib arms (P = 0.0014); however, no effect was seen with dasatinib alone (P = 0.24).High baseline pMAPK expression was associated with response to erlotinib (P = 0.03).High baseline pSTAT3 was associated with resistance to dasatinib (P = 0.099).CONCLUSIONS.Brief exposure to erlotinib significantly decreased tumor size in operable HNSCC, with no additive effect from dasatinib.Baseline pMAPK expression warrants further study as a response biomarker for anti-EGFR therapy.Basal expression of pSTAT3 may be independent of Src, explain therapeutic resistance, and preclude development of dasatinib in biomarker-unselected cohorts.TRIAL REGISTRATION.NCT00779389.FUNDING.National Cancer Institute, American Cancer Society, Pennsylvania Department of Health, V Foundation for Cancer Research, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Astellas Pharma.",1,1,1,1

29413685,"PICCA study: panitumumab in combination with cisplatin/gemcitabine chemotherapy in KRAS wild-type patients with biliary cancer-a randomised biomarker-driven clinical phase II AIO study.BACKGROUND: Combination chemotherapy has shown benefit in the treatment of biliary cancer and further improvements might be achieved by the addition of a biological agent.We report here the effect of chemotherapy with the monoclonal EGFR antibody panitumumab as therapy for KRAS wild-type biliary cancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with advanced biliary tract cancer were randomised (2:1) to receive cisplatin 25 mg/m(2) and gemcitabine 1000 mg/m(2) on day 1 and day 8/q3w with (arm A) or without panitumumab (arm B; 9 mg/kg BW, i.v q3w).The primary end-point was the evaluation of progression-free survival (PFS) at 6 months.Secondary end-points included objective response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), and toxicity.In addition, a post hoc assessment of genetic alterations was performed.Finally, we performed a meta-analysis of trials with chemotherapy with and without EGFR antibodies.RESULTS: Sixty-two patients were randomised in arm A and 28 patients in arm B. Patients received 7 treatment cycles in median (1-35) with a median treatment duration of 4.7 months (141 days, 8-765).PFS rate at 6 months was 54% in patients treated with cisplatin/gemcitabine and panitumumab but was 73% in patients treated with cisplatin/gemcitabine without antibody, respectively.Secondary end-points were an ORR of 45% in treatment arm A compared with 39% receiving treatment B and a median OS of 12.8 months (arm A) and of 20.1 months (arm B), respectively.In contrast to the p53-status, genetic alterations in IDH1/2 were linked to a high response after chemotherapy and prolonged survival.In accordance with our results, the meta-analysis of 12 trials did not reveal a survival advantage for patients treated with EGFR antibodies compared with chemotherapy alone.CONCLUSIONS: Panitumumab in combination with chemotherapy does not improve ORR, PFS and OS in patients with KRAS wild-type, advanced biliary cancer.Genetic profiling should be included in CCA trials to identify and validate predictive and prognostic biomarkers.CLINICAL TRIALS NUMBER: The trial was registered with NCT01320254.",1,1,1,1
23190359,"Feasibility and efficacy of progressive resistance training and dietary supplements in radiotherapy treated head and neck cancer patients--the DAHANCA 25A study.BACKGROUND: Patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) often lose a considerable amount of muscle mass following the disease and treatment.This is an independent mortality predictor, lowering muscle strength and functional performance.Progressive resistance training (PRT) increases muscle mass among healthy individuals and groups of cancer patients, but it has not been investigated in HNSCC patients.Furthermore, studies in healthy subjects show an additive effect of protein and creatine supplementation following PRT.OBJECTIVES: Firstly, to investigate the feasibility of 12 weeks of PRT +/- protein and creatine supplementation among HNSCC patients.Secondly, to investigate group changes over time and group differences regarding lean body mass (LBM), muscle strength and functional performance following PRT +/- dietary supplementation.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty patients were randomized into two groups: a PROCR group undergoing a seven-day pre-trial creatine loading protocol followed by 12 weeks of PRT with creatine and protein supplementation and a PLA group undergoing a seven-day pre-trial placebo ingestion protocol followed by an identical PRT protocol with placebo supplementation.Before the pre-trial and pre- and post-PRT evaluation of LBM, maximal isometric and isokinetic muscle strength and functional performance were performed.RESULTS: Seventy percent of the patients completed the intervention and the PRT adherence rate was 97%.No significant group differences were found in any endpoints.From pre- to post-PRT, LBM increased significantly in the PROCR group by 2.6 +/- 2.2 kg (p < 0.0001) and increased in the PLA group (1.3 +/- 1.1 kg, p = 0.07).Maximal isometric and isokinetic muscle strength as well as functional performance increased significantly in both groups.CONCLUSION: PRT is feasible in radiotherapy treated HNSCC patients.Following PRT, lean body mass, muscle strength and functional performance increased significantly in both groups (LBM only borderline significant in PLA group) with no significant group difference in any endpoint.",1,1,0,0
33621350,"Three-dimensional multipath DenseNet for improving automatic segmentation of glioblastoma on pre-operative multimodal MR images.PURPOSE: Convolutional neural networks have achieved excellent results in automatic medical image segmentation.In this study, we proposed a novel three-dimensional (3D) multipath DenseNet for generating the accurate glioblastoma (GBM) tumor contour from four multimodal pre-operative MR images.We hypothesized that the multipath architecture could achieve more accurate segmentation than a singlepath architecture.METHODS: Two hundred and fifty-eight GBM patients were included in this study.Each patient had four MR images (T1-weighted, contrast-enhanced T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and FLAIR) and the manually segmented tumor contour.We built a 3D multipath DenseNet that could be trained to achieve an end-to-end mapping from four MR images to the corresponding GBM tumor contour.A 3D singlepath DenseNet was also built for comparison.Both DenseNets were based on the encoder-decoder architecture.All four images were concatenated and fed into a single encoder path in the singlepath DenseNet, while each input image had its own encoder path in the multipath DenseNet.The patient cohort was randomly split into a training set of 180 patients, a validation set of 39 patients, and a testing set of 39 patients.Model performance was evaluated using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), average surface distance (ASD), and 95% Hausdorff distance (HD95% ).Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were conducted to assess statistical significances.RESULTS: The singlepath DenseNet achieved the DSC of 0.911 +/- 0.060, ASD of 1.3 +/- 0.7 mm, and HD95% of 5.2 +/- 7.1 mm, while the multipath DenseNet achieved the DSC of 0.922 +/- 0.041, ASD of 1.1 +/- 0.5 mm, and HD95% of 3.9 +/- 3.3 mm.The P-values of all Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were less than 0.05.CONCLUSIONS: Both DenseNets generated GBM tumor contours in good agreement with the manually segmented contours from multimodal MR images.The multipath DenseNet achieved more accurate tumor segmentation than the singlepath DenseNet.Here presented the 3D multipath DenseNet that demonstrated an improved accuracy over comparable algorithms in the clinical task of GBM tumor segmentation.",0,0,0,0

27081036,"Cardiotoxicity as indicated by LVEF and troponin T sensitivity following two anthracycline-based regimens in lymphoma: Results from a randomized prospective clinical trial.Anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity influences treatment selection and may negatively affect clinical outcomes in lymphoma patients.While epirubicin induced cardiotoxicity less often than the same dose of doxorubicin in breast cancer, higher doses of epirubicin are required in lymphoma regimens for equivalent efficacy.Whether a higher dosage of epirubicin also induces cardiotoxicity less often than doxorubicin in lymphoma remains unknown.We therefore administered 6-8 cycles of cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisone (CEpOP) +/- rituximab (R) with either epirubicin (CEpOP) or doxorubicin (CHOP) to patients (N=398) with untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or follicular lymphoma grade 3 (FLG3).Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and high-sensitivity serum cardiac troponin T (HsTnT) were assessed at baseline and after 4 cycles of treatment.Epirubicin (70 mg/m2/dose) was equivalent to doxorubicin (50 mg/m2/dose) in terms of 3-year progression-free survival.The risk of decreased LVEF was similar between the two regimens.CEpOP+/-R induced HsTnT elevation less often than CHOP+/-R. We conclude that CEpOP+/-R is a more acceptable regimen with short-term efficacy similar to CHOP+/-R in lymphoma patients.Longer follow-up is needed to monitor the risk of cardiac dysfunction and determine whether differences in the induction of elevated HsTnT between epirubicin and doxorubicin justify changes in clinical practice.",0,0,0,0

27149489,"Efficacy of Intravenous Lidocaine During Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection for Gastric Neoplasm: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Controlled Study.Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is an advanced therapy for early gastric neoplasm and requires sedation with adequate analgesia.Lidocaine is a short-acting local anesthetic, and intravenous lidocaine has been shown to have analgesic efficacy in surgical settings.The aim of this study was to assess the effects of intravenous lidocaine on analgesic and sedative requirements for ESD and pain after ESD.Sixty-six patients scheduled for ESD randomly received either intravenous lidocaine as a bolus of 1.5 mg/kg before sedation, followed by continuous infusion at a rate of 2 mg/kg/h during sedation (lidocaine group; n = 33) or the same bolus and infusion volumes of normal saline (control group; n = 33).Sedation was achieved with propofol and fentanyl.The primary outcome was fentanyl requirement during ESD.We recorded hemodynamics and any events during ESD and evaluated post-ESD epigastric and throat pain.Fentanyl requirement during ESD reduced by 24% in the lidocaine group compared with the control group (105 +/- 28 vs. 138 +/- 37 mug, mean +/- SD; P < 0.001).The lidocaine group reached sedation faster [40 (20-100) vs. 55 (30-120) s, median (range); P = 0.001], and incidence of patient movement during ESD decreased in the lidocaine group (3% vs. 26%, P = 0.026).Numerical rating scale for epigastric pain was significantly lower at 6 hours after ESD [2 (0-6) vs. 3 (0-8), median (range); P = 0.023] and incidence of throat pain was significantly lower in the lidocaine group (27% vs. 65%, P = 0.003).No adverse events associated with lidocaine were discovered.Administration of intravenous lidocaine reduced fentanyl requirement and decreased patient movement during ESD.Moreover, it alleviated epigastric and throat pain after ESD.Thus, we conclude that the use of intravenous adjuvant lidocaine is a new and safe sedative method during ESD.",0,0,0,0
28209746,"A Phase II Randomized Trial (GO27827) of First-Line FOLFOX Plus Bevacizumab with or Without the MET Inhibitor Onartuzumab in Patients with Metastatic Colorectal Cancer.BACKGROUND: Dysregulated hepatocyte growth factor/mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) signaling is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to vascular endothelial growth factor inhibition in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).We report outcomes from a double-blind, multicenter phase II trial of the MET inhibitor onartuzumab in combination with mFOLFOX-6 and bevacizumab for mCRC (GO27827; NCT01418222).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive onartuzumab (10 mg/kg intravenously [IV]) or placebo plus mFOLFOX-6 and bevacizumab (5 mg/kg IV).Oxaliplatin was given for 8-12 cycles; other agents were continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or death.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) in the intent-to-treat (ITT) and MET immunohistochemistry (IHC) expression-positive populations.RESULTS: Between September 2011 and November 2012, 194 patients were enrolled.In September 2013, an interim analysis recommended stopping onartuzumab treatment due to lack of efficacy.At the time of the final analysis in February 2014, no significant improvement in PFS was seen with onartuzumab versus placebo in either the ITT or MET IHC-positive populations.An improvement in PFS was noted in the MET IHC-negative population.Neither overall survival nor response rate was improved with onartuzumab.The incidence of fatigue, peripheral edema, and deep vein thrombosis was increased with onartuzumab relative to placebo.CONCLUSION: Onartuzumab combined with mFOLFOX-6 and bevacizumab did not significantly improve efficacy outcomes in either the ITT or MET IHC-positive populations.MET expression by IHC was not a predictive biomarker in this setting.The Oncologist 2017;22:264-271 IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The addition of onartuzumab to mFOLFOX-6 plus bevacizumab did not improve outcomes in patients with previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer in this randomized, phase II study.Although initial results with onartuzumab were promising, a number of phase II/III clinical trials have reported a lack of improvement in efficacy with onartuzumab combined with standard-of-care therapies in several tumor types.Furthermore, negative study data have been published for rilotumumab and ficlatuzumab, both of which block hepatocyte growth factor binding to the mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) receptor.MET immunohistochemistry was not a predictive biomarker.It remains to be seen if other biomarkers or small molecule inhibitors may be more appropriate for inhibiting this oncogenic pathway.",1,1,1,1

28189429,"Regular Aspirin Use and the Risk of Lethal Prostate Cancer in the Physicians' Health Study.BACKGROUND: Regular aspirin use probably protects against some malignancies including prostate cancer (PC), but its impact on lethal PC is particularly unclear.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between regular aspirin and (1) the risk of lethal PC in a large prospective cohort and (2) survival after PC diagnosis.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In 1981/82, the Physicians' Health Study randomized 22 071 healthy male physicians to aspirin, beta-carotene, both, or placebo.After the trial ended in 1988, annual questionnaires have obtained data on aspirin use, cancer diagnoses, and outcomes up to 2009 for the whole cohort, and to 2015 for PC patients.OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: We evaluated the relationship between regular aspirin (>3 tablets/week) and lethal PC (metastases or PC death).Cox proportional-hazards models estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for the risk of lethal PC in the whole cohort and postdiagnosis survival among men initially diagnosed with nonlethal PC.RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Risk analysis revealed that 502 men developed lethal PC by 2009.Current and past regular aspirin was associated with a lower risk of lethal PC (current: HR 0.68, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.52-0.89; past: HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.40-0.74) compared to never users.In the survival analysis, 407/3277 men diagnosed with nonlethal PC developed lethal disease by 2015.Current postdiagnostic aspirin was associated with lower risks of lethal PC (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.52-0.90) and overall mortality (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61-0.9).We could not assess aspirin dose, and inconsistencies were observed in some sensitivity analyses.CONCLUSIONS: Current regular aspirin use was associated with a lower risk of lethal PC among all participants.Current postdiagnostic use was associated with improved survival after diagnosis, consistent with a potential inhibitory effect of aspirin on PC progression.A randomized trial is warranted to confirm or refute these findings.PATIENT SUMMARY: We examined the potential effect of regular aspirin use on lethal prostate cancer.We found that taking aspirin was associated with a lower risk of lethal prostate cancer, and taking it after diagnosis may help to prevent prostate cancer from becoming fatal.",0,0,0,0

33963594,"Neurotoxicity prevention with a multimodal program (ATENTO) prior to cancer treatment versus throughout cancer treatment in women newly diagnosed for breast cancer: Protocol for a randomized clinical trial.A current challenge in breast cancer (BC) patients is how to reduce the side effects of cancer and cancer treatments and prevent a decrease in quality of life (QoL).Neurotoxic side effects, especially from chemotherapy, are present in up to 75% of women with BC, which implies a large impact on QoL. There is a special interest in the preventive possibilities of therapeutic exercise (TE) for these neurological sequelae, and the benefits of TE could be improved when it is combined with vagal activation techniques (VATs).This superiority randomized controlled trial aims to examine the feasibility and efficacy of an 8-week multimodal intervention (ATENTO) based on moderate-vigorous intensity and individualized TE (aerobic and strength exercises) and VAT (myofascial and breathing exercises), on neurotoxicity prevention in women with BC before starting adjuvant chemotherapy (ATENTO-B) versus throughout adjuvant chemotherapy (ATENTO-T).A sample of 56 women newly diagnosed with BC, as calculated with a power of 85%, will be randomly allocated into these two groups.This study could provide an impetus for the introduction of early multimodal intervention methods to prevent neurotoxicity and consequently avoid the QoL deterioration that BC patients presently suffer throughout their treatments.",0,0,0,0

30902613,"Updated Efficacy and Safety Data and Impact of the EML4-ALK Fusion Variant on the Efficacy of Alectinib in Untreated ALK-Positive Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer in the Global Phase III ALEX Study.INTRODUCTION: At the prior data cutoff (February 9, 2017) the ALEX trial showed superior investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) for alectinib versus crizotinib in untreated, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive, advanced NSCLC (hazard ratio = 0.47, 95% confidence interval: 0.34-0.65, p < 0.001).The median PFS in the alectinib arm was not reached versus 11.1 months with crizotinib.Retrospective analyses suggest that the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 gene-ALK variant (EML4-ALK) may influence ALK-inhibitor treatment benefit.We present updated analyses, including exploratory subgroup analysis by EML4-ALK variant, after an additional 10 months' follow-up (cutoff December 1, 2017).METHODS: Patients were randomized to receive twice-daily alectinib, 600 mg, or crizotinib, 250 mg, until disease progression, toxicity, death, or withdrawal.PFS was determined by the investigators.Baseline plasma and tissue biomarker samples were analyzed by using hybrid-capture, next-generation sequencing to determine EML4-ALK variant.RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were balanced.Investigator-assessed PFS was prolonged with alectinib (stratified hazard ratio = 0.43, 95% confidence interval: 0.32-0.58).The median PFS times were 34.8 months with alectinib and 10.9 months with crizotinib.EML4-ALK fusions were detectable in 129 patient plasma samples and 124 tissue samples; variants 1, 2, and 3/ab did not affect PFS, objective response rate, or duration of response.Investigator-assessed PFS was longer for alectinib than for crizotinib across EML4-ALK variants 1, 2, and 3a/b in plasma and tissue.Despite longer treatment duration (27.0 months in the case of alectinib versus 10.8 months in the case of crizotinib), the safety of alectinib compared favorably with that of crizotinib.CONCLUSION: Alectinib continues to demonstrate superior investigator-assessed PFS versus crizotinib in untreated ALK-positive NSCLC, irrespective of EML4-ALK variant.",1,1,1,1

And the secondary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR) and overall survival (OS).RESULTS: They were randomized into gefitinib arm (n = 25) and paclitaxel/carboplatin arm (n = 26).The median PFS was 4.2 months in gefitinib arm and 8.3 months in paclitaxel/carboplatin arm (P = 0.422); ORR 36.0% in gefitinib arm and 42.3% in paclitaxel/carboplatin arm (P = 0.645); Median OS 14.4 months in gefitinib arm and 15.0 months in paclitaxel/carboplatin arm (P = 0.290).Multifactorial Cox regression analysis showed that age (P = 0.004), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutation status (P = 0.012) and subsequent treatments (platinum-based chemotherapy, P = 0.001; EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), P = 0.005) were the significant predictors of OS.CONCLUSIONS: No significant differences exist in terms of efficacy and survival between first-line gefitinib and paclitaxel/carboplatin for Chinese patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma who are non-smokers or former light smokers.And age, EGFR gene mutation status and subsequent treatments are significant predictor of OS.However, first-line gefitinib should not be recommended for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients only based on clinical factors, due to a very small sample-size in our study.",1,1,1,1
24571588,"Systematic analysis of 18F-FDG PET and metabolism, proliferation and hypoxia markers for classification of head and neck tumors.BACKGROUND: Quantification of molecular cell processes is important for prognostication and treatment individualization of head and neck cancer (HNC).However, individual tumor comparison can show discord in upregulation similarities when analyzing multiple biological mechanisms.Elaborate tumor characterization, integrating multiple pathways reflecting intrinsic and microenvironmental properties, may be beneficial to group most uniform tumors for treatment modification schemes.The goal of this study was to systematically analyze if immunohistochemical (IHC) assessment of molecular markers, involved in treatment resistance, and 18F-FDG PET parameters could accurately distinguish separate HNC tumors.METHODS: Several imaging parameters and texture features for 18F-FDG small-animal PET and immunohistochemical markers related to metabolism, hypoxia, proliferation and tumor blood perfusion were assessed within groups of BALB/c nu/nu mice xenografted with 14 human HNC models.Classification methods were used to predict tumor line based on sets of parameters.RESULTS: We found that 18F-FDG PET could not differentiate between the tumor lines.On the contrary, combined IHC parameters could accurately allocate individual tumors to the correct model.From 9 analyzed IHC parameters, a cluster of 6 random parameters already classified 70.3% correctly.Combining all PET/IHC characteristics resulted in the highest tumor line classification accuracy (81.0%; cross validation 82.0%), which was just 2.2% higher (p = 5.2x10-32) than the performance of the IHC parameter/feature based model.CONCLUSIONS: With a select set of IHC markers representing cellular processes of metabolism, proliferation, hypoxia and perfusion, one can reliably distinguish between HNC tumor lines.Addition of 18F-FDG PET improves classification accuracy of IHC to a significant yet minor degree.These results may form a basis for development of tumor characterization models for treatment allocation purposes.",0,0,0,0

27846903,"PRONTOX - proton therapy to reduce acute normal tissue toxicity in locally advanced non-small-cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC): study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Primary radiochemotherapy with photons is the standard treatment for locally advanced-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.Acute radiation-induced side effects such as oesophagitis and radiation pneumonitis limit patients' quality of life, and the latter can be potentially life-threatening.Due to its distinct physical characteristics, proton therapy enables better sparing of normal tissues, which is supposed to translate into a reduction of radiation-induced side effects.METHODS/DESIGN: This is a single-centre, prospective, randomised controlled, phase II clinical trial to compare photon to proton radiotherapy up to 66 Gy (RBE) with concomitant standard chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced-stage NSCLC.Patients will be allocated in a 1:1 ratio to photon or proton therapy, and treatment will be delivered slightly accelerated with six fractions of 2 Gy (RBE) per week.DISCUSSION: The overall aim of the study is to show a decrease of early and intermediate radiation-induced toxicity using proton therapy.For the primary endpoint of the study we postulate a decrease of radiation-induced side effects (oesophagitis and pneumonitis grade II or higher) from 39 to 12%.Secondary endpoints are locoregional and distant failure, overall survival and late side effects.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Registered at ClinicalTrials.gov with Identifier NCT02731001 on 1 April 2016.",0,0,0,0
30902613,"Updated Efficacy and Safety Data and Impact of the EML4-ALK Fusion Variant on the Efficacy of Alectinib in Untreated ALK-Positive Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer in the Global Phase III ALEX Study.INTRODUCTION: At the prior data cutoff (February 9, 2017) the ALEX trial showed superior investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) for alectinib versus crizotinib in untreated, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive, advanced NSCLC (hazard ratio = 0.47, 95% confidence interval: 0.34-0.65, p < 0.001).The median PFS in the alectinib arm was not reached versus 11.1 months with crizotinib.Retrospective analyses suggest that the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 gene-ALK variant (EML4-ALK) may influence ALK-inhibitor treatment benefit.We present updated analyses, including exploratory subgroup analysis by EML4-ALK variant, after an additional 10 months' follow-up (cutoff December 1, 2017).METHODS: Patients were randomized to receive twice-daily alectinib, 600 mg, or crizotinib, 250 mg, until disease progression, toxicity, death, or withdrawal.PFS was determined by the investigators.Baseline plasma and tissue biomarker samples were analyzed by using hybrid-capture, next-generation sequencing to determine EML4-ALK variant.RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were balanced.Investigator-assessed PFS was prolonged with alectinib (stratified hazard ratio = 0.43, 95% confidence interval: 0.32-0.58).The median PFS times were 34.8 months with alectinib and 10.9 months with crizotinib.EML4-ALK fusions were detectable in 129 patient plasma samples and 124 tissue samples; variants 1, 2, and 3/ab did not affect PFS, objective response rate, or duration of response.Investigator-assessed PFS was longer for alectinib than for crizotinib across EML4-ALK variants 1, 2, and 3a/b in plasma and tissue.Despite longer treatment duration (27.0 months in the case of alectinib versus 10.8 months in the case of crizotinib), the safety of alectinib compared favorably with that of crizotinib.CONCLUSION: Alectinib continues to demonstrate superior investigator-assessed PFS versus crizotinib in untreated ALK-positive NSCLC, irrespective of EML4-ALK variant.",1,1,1,1

31247017,"Effects of laughter therapy on quality of life in patients with cancer: An open-label, randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Few randomized controlled trials have assessed the effects of laughter therapy on health-related quality of life (QOL) in cancer patients.This study aimed to evaluate these effects as an exploratory endpoint in cancer patients as part of a randomized controlled trial conducted at a single institution in Japan.METHODS: The Initiative On Smile And CAncer (iOSACA) study was an open-label randomized controlled trial conducted in 2017 in which participants aged 40-64 years with cancer were randomly assigned to either an intervention group (laughter therapy) or control group (no laughter therapy).Each participant in the intervention group underwent a laughter therapy session once every two weeks for seven weeks (total of four sessions).Each session involved a laughter yoga routine followed by Rakugo or Manzai traditional Japanese verbal comedy performances.We assessed QOL as a secondary endpoint in this intention-to-treat population using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30).The questionnaire was completed at baseline (Week 0) and at Weeks 3 and 7.Mixed-effects models for repeated measures were developed to compare time-dependent changes in each QOL domain from baseline between the intervention and control groups.RESULTS: Four participants retracted consent and one participant was retrospectively excluded from analysis due to unmet inclusion criteria.The analysis was conducted using 56 participants, with 26 in the intervention group and 30 in the control group.Questionnaire completion rates were high (>90%), with similar QOL scores reported at baseline in both groups.The mixed-effects models showed that the intervention group had significantly better cognitive function and less pain than the control group for a short period.CONCLUSION: Laughter therapy may represent a beneficial, noninvasive complementary intervention in the clinical setting.Further studies are needed to verify the hypotheses generated from this exploratory study.",0,0,0,0
33460574,"Palbociclib with adjuvant endocrine therapy in early breast cancer (PALLAS): interim analysis of a multicentre, open-label, randomised, phase 3 study.BACKGROUND: Palbociclib added to endocrine therapy improves progression-free survival in hormone-receptor-positive, HER2-negative, metastatic breast cancer.The PALLAS trial aimed to investigate whether the addition of 2 years of palbociclib to adjuvant endocrine therapy improves invasive disease-free survival over endocrine therapy alone in patients with hormone-receptor-positive, HER2-negative, early-stage breast cancer.METHODS: PALLAS is an ongoing multicentre, open-label, randomised, phase 3 study that enrolled patients at 406 cancer centres in 21 countries worldwide with stage II-III histologically confirmed hormone-receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer, within 12 months of initial diagnosis.Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score of 0 or 1.Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) in permuted blocks of random size (4 or 6), stratified by anatomic stage, previous chemotherapy, age, and geographical region, by use of central telephone-based and web-based interactive response technology, to receive either 2 years of palbociclib (125 mg orally once daily on days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle) with ongoing standard provider or patient-choice adjuvant endocrine therapy (tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitor, with or without concurrent luteinising hormone-releasing hormone agonist), or endocrine therapy alone, without masking.The primary endpoint of the study was invasive disease-free survival in the intention-to-treat population.Safety was assessed in all randomly assigned patients who started palbociclib or endocrine therapy.This report presents results from the second pre-planned interim analysis triggered on Jan 9, 2020, when 67% of the total number of expected invasive disease-free survival events had been observed.The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02513394) and EudraCT (2014-005181-30).FINDINGS: Between Sept 1, 2015, and Nov 30, 2018, 5760 patients were randomly assigned to receive palbociclib plus endocrine therapy (n=2883) or endocrine therapy alone (n=2877).At the time of the planned second interim analysis, at a median follow-up of 23.7 months (IQR 16.9-29.2), 170 of 2883 patients assigned to palbociclib plus endocrine therapy and 181 of 2877 assigned to endocrine therapy alone had invasive disease-free survival events.3-year invasive disease-free survival was 88.2% (95% CI 85.2-90.6) for palbociclib plus endocrine therapy and 88.5% (85.8-90.7) for endocrine therapy alone (hazard ratio 0.93 [95% CI 0.76-1.15]; log-rank p=0.51).As the test statistic comparing invasive disease-free survival between groups crossed the prespecified futility boundary, the independent data monitoring committee recommended discontinuation of palbociclib in patients still receiving palbociclib and endocrine therapy.The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were neutropenia (1742 [61.3%] of 2840 patients on palbociclib and endocrine therapy vs 11 [0.3%] of 2903 on endocrine therapy alone), leucopenia (857 [30.2%] vs three [0.1%]), and fatigue (60 [2.1%] vs ten [0.3%]).Serious adverse events occurred in 351 (12.4%) of 2840 patients on palbociclib plus endocrine therapy versus 220 (7.6%) of 2903 patients on endocrine therapy alone.There were no treatment-related deaths.INTERPRETATION: At the planned second interim analysis, addition of 2 years of adjuvant palbociclib to adjuvant endocrine therapy did not improve invasive disease-free survival compared with adjuvant endocrine therapy alone.On the basis of these findings, this regimen cannot be recommended in the adjuvant setting.Long-term follow-up of the PALLAS population and correlative studies are ongoing.FUNDING: Pfizer.",1,1,1,1

23234763,"Adjuvant lapatinib for women with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer: a randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Worldwide, many patients with HER2-positive early stage breast cancer do not receive trastuzumab-the standard adjuvant treatment.We investigated the efficacy and safety of adjuvant lapatinib for patients with trastuzumab-naive HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer, started at any time after diagnosis.METHODS: This study was a placebo-controlled, multicentre, randomised phase 3 trial.Women outpatients from 405 [corrected] centres in 33 countries [corrected] with HER2-positive early-breast cancer who had previously received adjuvant chemotherapy but not trastuzumab were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive daily lapatinib (1500 mg) or daily placebo for 12 months.Randomisation was done with a computer-generated sequence, stratified by time since diagnosis, lymph node involvement at diagnosis, and tumour hormone-receptor status.Investigators, site staff, and patients were masked to treatment assignment.The primary endpoint was disease-free survival in the intention-to-treat population.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00374322.FINDINGS: Between August, 2006, and May, 2008, 3161 women were enrolled and 3147 were assigned to lapatinib (n=1571) or placebo (n=1576).After a median follow-up of 47.4 months (range 0.4-60.0) in the lapatinib group and 48.3 (0.7-61.3) in the placebo group, 210 (13%) disease-free survival events had occurred in the lapatinib group versus 264 (17%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.83, 95% CI 0.70-1.00; p=0.053).Central review of HER2 status showed that only 2490 (79%) of the randomised women were HER2-positive.157 (13%) of 1230 confirmed HER2-positive patients in the lapatinib group and in 208 (17%) of 1260 in the placebo group had a disease-free survival event (HR 0.82, 95% 0.67-1.00; p=0.04).Serious adverse events occurred in 99 (6%) of 1573 patients taking lapatinib and 77 (5%) of 1574 patients taking placebo, with higher incidences of grade 3-4 diarrhoea (97 [6%] vs nine [<1%]), rash (72 [5%] vs three [<1%]), and hepatobiliary disorders (36 [2%] vs one [<1%]).INTERPRETATION: Our data show that there was no significant difference in disease-free survival between groups when analysed in the intention-to-treat population.However, exploratory analyses restricted to patients who had HER2-positive disease confirmed by central fluorescence in-situ hybridisation review suggested marginal benefit with lapatinib in terms of disease-free survival.Thus lapatinib might be an option for women with HER2-positive breast cancer who do not or cannot receive adjuvant trastuzumab.FUNDING: GlaxoSmithKline.",1,1,1,1
23429062,"Reproductive, lifestyle, and anthropometric risk factors for cancer in elderly women.BACKGROUND: With an increasing elderly population, the United States will experience an increased cancer burden in the coming years.We evaluated associations between anthropometric, lifestyle, and reproductive factors and risk of breast, ovarian, and colorectal cancer in a prospective study of postmenopausal women with a focus on diagnoses occurring among very elderly women (>/=75 years).METHODS: For each cancer type, we estimated associations with relevant exposures in 2 age bands (<75 vs. >/=75 years of age).During 22 years of follow-up, 322 ovarian, 1,311 colon, 315 rectal, and 2,664 breast cancers occurred among 37,459 postmenopausal women (mean age at baseline 62 years, range 55-71 years).RESULTS: For ovarian cancer, we identified few significant associations in either age band.Colon cancer cases had a higher body mass index and were less likely to report estrogen or aspirin use than non-cases, yet these associations were consistent in both age bands.Few risk factors were identified for rectal cancer in women of 75 years of age or more.For breast cancer, notably different patterns were revealed, with alcohol consumption associated with risk in the younger group and previous hysterectomy associated with risk only in the older group.CONCLUSION: These analyses suggest some important differences in risk factors for cancer depending on the age at diagnosis.IMPACT: This study suggests that etiologic differences may exist in cancers occurring in the very elderly women.The ongoing demographic shift in the United States provides a strong rationale for studies evaluating cancer etiology in the elderly.",0,0,0,0
29580298,"Submental liposuction for the management of lymphedema following head and neck cancer treatment: a randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Patients who have undergone treatment for head and neck cancer are at risk for neck lymphedema, which can severely affect quality of life.Liposuction has been used successfully in cancer patients who suffer from post-treatment limb lymphedema.The purpose of our study was to review the outcomes of head and neck cancer patients at our center who have undergone submental liposuction for post-treatment lymphedema and compare their subsequent results with a control group.METHODS: All head and neck cancer patients at an oncology center in tertiary hospital setting who complained to their attending surgeon or radiation oncologist regarding cervical lymphedema secondary to head and neck cancer treatment, and had been disease-free for a minimum of one year, with no previous facial plastic surgical procedures were eligible for inclusion into the study.Study design was a non-blinded randomized controlled trial.Twenty patients were randomized into a treatment arm (underwent submental liposuction n = 10) and control arm (n = 10).Both groups of patients completed two surveys (Modified Blepharoplasty Outcome Evaluation and the validated Derriford Appearance Scale) on initial office visit after consenting for the trial.The treatment group then completed the surveys 6 months post-operatively while the control group filled the surveys 6 months after the initial assessment but had no intervention.Mann-Whitney U tests were performed to compare the responses of those that did and did not receive liposuction.RESULTS: Our study demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in patients' self-perception of appearance and statistically significant subjective scoring of appearance following submental liposuction.CONCLUSIONS: Submental liposuction is an effective and safe procedure to improves the quality of life for head and neck cancer patients suffering from post-treatment lymphedema.",0,0,0,0
23340351,"A double-blind randomized trial of wound and intercostal space infiltration with ropivacaine during breast cancer surgery: effects on chronic postoperative pain.BACKGROUND: The efficacy of local anesthetic wound infiltration for the treatment of acute and chronic postoperative pain is controversial and there are no detailed studies.The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of ropivacaine wound infiltration on chronic pain after breast surgery.METHODS: In this prospective, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study, 236 patients scheduled for breast cancer surgery were randomized (1:1) to receive ropivacaine or placebo infiltration of the wound, the second and third intercostal spaces and the humeral insertion of major pectoralis.Acute pain, analgesic consumption, nausea and vomiting were assessed every 30 min for 2 h in the postanesthesia care unit and every 6 h for 48 h. Chronic pain was evaluated 3 months, 6 months, and 1 yr after surgery by the brief pain inventory, hospital anxiety and depression, and neuropathic pain questionnaires.RESULTS: Ropivacaine wound infiltration significantly decreased immediate postoperative pain for the first 90 min, but did not decrease chronic pain at 3 months (primary endpoint), or at 6 and 12 months postoperatively.At 3 months, the incidence of chronic pain was 33% and 27% (P = 0.37) in the ropivacaine and placebo groups, respectively.During follow-up, brief pain inventory, neuropathic pain, and anxiety increased over time in both groups (P < 0.001) while depression remained stable.No complications occurred.CONCLUSION: This multicenter, prospective study shows that ropivacaine wound infiltration after breast cancer surgery decreased immediate postoperative pain but did not decrease chronic pain at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively.",0,0,0,0
34461224,"Simvastatin modulates estrogen signaling in uterine leiomyoma via regulating receptor palmitoylation, trafficking and degradation.Uterine leiomyomas or fibroids are the most common tumors of the female reproductive tract.Estrogen (E2), a steroid-derived hormone, and its receptors (ERs), particularly ER-alpha, are important drivers for the development and growth of leiomyomas.We previously demonstrated that simvastatin, a drug used for hyperlipidemia, also possesses anti-leiomyoma properties.The aim of this work is to investigate the impact of simvastatin on ER-alpha signaling in leiomyoma cells, including its expression, downstream signaling, transcriptional activity, post-translational modification, trafficking and degradation.Primary and immortalized human uterine leiomyoma (HuLM) cells were used for in vitro experiments.Immunodeficient mice xenografted with human leiomyoma tissue explants were used for in vivo studies.Leiomyoma samples were obtained from patients enrolled in an ongoing double-blinded, phase II, randomized controlled trial.Here, we found that simvastatin significantly reduced E2-induced proliferation and PCNA expression.In addition, simvastatin reduced total ER-alpha expression in leiomyoma cells and altered its subcellular localization by inhibiting its trafficking to the plasma membrane and nucleus.Simvastatin also inhibited E2 downstream signaling, including ERK and AKT pathways, E2/ER transcriptional activity and E2-responsive genes.To explain simvastatin effects on ER-alpha level and trafficking, we examined its effects on ER-alpha post-translational processing.We noticed that simvastatin reduced ER-alpha palmitoylation; a required modification for its stability, trafficking to plasma membrane, and signaling.We also observed an increase in ubiquitin-mediated ER-alpha degradation.Importantly, we found that the effects of simvastatin on ER-alpha expression were recapitulated in the xenograft leiomyoma mouse model and human tissues.Thus, our data suggest that simvastatin modulates several E2/ER signaling targets with potential implications in leiomyoma therapy and beyond.",0,0,0,0

26198205,"Computed tomographic colonography compared with colonoscopy or barium enema for diagnosis of colorectal cancer in older symptomatic patients: two multicentre randomised trials with economic evaluation (the SIGGAR trials).BACKGROUND: Computed tomographic colonography (CTC) is a relatively new diagnostic test that may be superior to existing alternatives to investigate the large bowel.OBJECTIVES: To compare the diagnostic efficacy, acceptability, safety and cost-effectiveness of CTC with barium enema (BE) or colonoscopy.DESIGN: Parallel randomised trials: BE compared with CTC and colonoscopy compared with CTC (randomisation 2 : 1, respectively).SETTING: A total of 21 NHS hospitals.PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged >/= 55 years with symptoms suggestive of colorectal cancer (CRC).INTERVENTIONS: CTC, BE and colonoscopy.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: For the trial of CTC compared with BE, the primary outcome was the detection rate of CRC and large polyps (>/= 10 mm), with the proportion of patients referred for additional colonic investigation as a secondary outcome.For the trial of CTC compared with colonoscopy, the primary outcome was the proportion of patients referred for additional colonic investigation, with the detection rate of CRC and large polyps as a secondary outcome.Secondary outcomes for both trials were miss rates for cancer (via registry data), all-cause mortality, serious adverse events, patient acceptability, extracolonic pathology and cost-effectiveness.RESULTS: A total of 8484 patients were registered and 5384 were randomised and analysed (BE trial: 2527 BE, 1277 CTC; colonoscopy trial: 1047 colonoscopy, 533 CTC).Detection rates in the BE trial were 7.3% (93/1277) for CTC, compared with 5.6% (141/2527) for BE (p = 0.0390).The difference was due to better detection of large polyps by CTC (3.6% vs. 2.2%; p = 0.0098), with no significant difference for cancer (3.7% vs. 3.4%; p = 0.66).Significantly more patients having CTC underwent additional investigation (23.5% vs. 18.3%; p = 0.0003).At the 3-year follow-up, the miss rate for CRC was 6.7% for CTC (three missed cancers) and 14.1% for BE (12 missed cancers).Significantly more patients randomised to CTC than to colonoscopy underwent additional investigation (30% vs. 8.2%; p < 0.0001).There was no significant difference in detection rates for cancer or large polyps (10.7% for CTC vs. 11.4% for colonoscopy; p = 0.69), with no difference when cancers (p = 0.94) and large polyps (p = 0.53) were analysed separately.At the 3-year follow-up, the miss rate for cancer was nil for colonoscopy and 3.4% for CTC (one missed cancer).Adverse events were uncommon for all procedures.In 1042 of 1748 (59.6%) CTC examinations, at least one extracolonic finding was reported, and this proportion increased with age (p < 0.0001).A total of 149 patients (8.5%) were subsequently investigated, and extracolonic neoplasia was diagnosed in 79 patients (4.5%) and malignancy in 29 (1.7%).In the short term, CTC was significantly more acceptable to patients than BE or colonoscopy.Total costs for CTC and colonoscopy were finely balanced, but CTC was associated with higher health-care costs than BE.The cost per large polyp or cancer detected was pound4235 (95% confidence interval pound395 to pound9656).CONCLUSIONS: CTC is superior to BE for detection of cancers and large polyps in symptomatic patients.CTC and colonoscopy detect a similar proportion of large polyps and cancers and their costs are also similar.CTC precipitates significantly more additional investigations than either BE or colonoscopy, and evidence-based referral criteria are needed.Further work is recommended to clarify the extent to which patients initially referred for colonoscopy or BE undergo subsequent abdominopelvic imaging, for example by computed tomography, which will have a significant impact on health economic estimates.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN95152621.",0,0,0,0
30807234,"Cyclin E1 Expression and Palbociclib Efficacy in Previously Treated Hormone Receptor-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer.PURPOSE: A large-panel gene expression analysis was conducted to identify biomarkers associated with the effectiveness of adding palbociclib to fulvestrant.METHODS: The PALOMA-3 ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01942135) trial randomly assigned 521 endocrine-pretreated patients with metastatic breast cancer to receive palbociclib plus fulvestrant or placebo plus fulvestrant.Primary analysis was first conducted on 10 genes on the basis of pathway biology and evidence from previous studies followed by a systematic panel-wide search among 2,534 cancer-related genes.The association of gene expression with the effect of palbociclib on progression-free survival (PFS) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, with gene expression as a continuous variable or dichotomized by median.An independent breast cancer cohort from the Preoperative Palbociclib (POP) Clinical Trial ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02008734) was used for validation, in 61 patients with primary breast cancer treated with 2 weeks of palbociclib.RESULTS: In the PALOMA-3 trial, 302 patients had tumor tissue analyzed (palbociclib arm, 194 patients; placebo arm, 108 patients).Palbociclib efficacy was lower in patients with high versus low cyclin E1 (CCNE1) mRNA expression (median PFS: palbociclib arm, 7.6 v 14.1 months; placebo arm, 4.0 v 4.8 months, respectively; interaction P unadjusted = .00238; false discovery rate-adjusted P = .0238).CCNE1 mRNA was more predictive in metastatic than in archival primary biopsy tissue samples.No significant interaction was found between treatment and expression levels of CDK4, CDK6, cyclin D1, and RB1.Palbociclib was efficacious in both luminal A and luminal B tumors.High CCNE1 mRNA expression was associated with poor antiproliferative activity of palbociclib in the POP trial (P = .005).CONCLUSION: Addition of palbociclib to fulvestrant demonstrated efficacy in all biomarker groups, although high CCNE1 mRNA expression was associated with relative resistance to palbociclib.",1,1,1,1
32666638,"Effect of a psychological nursing intervention on quality of life and cognitive function in patients with gastric carcinoma: A randomised controlled trial.AIM: We aimed to evaluate the effect of a psychological nursing intervention on quality of life (QoL) and cognitive function in patients with gastric carcinoma (GC) and proposed that the intervention might improve the QoL and cognitive function of GC patients.METHODS: Gastric carcinoma patients were randomly assigned into two groups: (a) intervention group: receiving proper psychological nursing intervention; (b) control group: receiving conventional care.RESULTS: The QoL and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores at each dimensionality between the intervention group and the control group at baseline showed no significant differences (p > .05).However, after the 6-month psychological nursing intervention, 5 of 10 dimensionalities in QoL and 5 of 6 dimensionalities in MoCA showed statistically differences between the intervention group and the control group (p < .05).In comparison with the scores at baseline, the QoL scores measured after the 6-month psychological nursing intervention showed remarkable improvement in multiple dimensionalities in the intervention group, but only appetite loss improved in the control group.MoCA scores in multiple dimensionalities in the intervention group also exhibited obvious improvement compared with those in control group.CONCLUSION: A psychological nursing intervention benefits the QoL and cognitive function in GC patients, indicating the importance of a psychological nursing intervention.",1,1,0,0
27573561,"Subgroup analysis in RAISE: a randomized, double-blind phase III study of irinotecan, folinic acid, and 5-fluorouracil (FOLFIRI) plus ramucirumab or placebo in patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma progression.BACKGROUND: The RAISE phase III clinical trial demonstrated that ramucirumab + FOLFIRI improved overall survival (OS) [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.844, P = 0.0219] and progression-free survival (PFS) (HR = 0.793, P < 0.0005) compared with placebo + FOLFIRI for second-line metastatic colorectal carcinoma (mCRC) patients previously treated with first-line bevacizumab, oxaliplatin, and a fluoropyrimidine.Since some patient or disease characteristics could be associated with differential efficacy or safety, prespecified subgroup analyses were undertaken.This report focuses on three of the most relevant ones: KRAS status (wild-type versus mutant), age (<65 versus >/=65 years), and time to progression (TTP) on first-line therapy (<6 versus >/=6 months).PATIENTS AND METHODS: OS and PFS were evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier analysis, with HR determined by the Cox proportional hazards model.Treatment-by-subgroup interaction was tested to determine whether treatment effect was consistent between subgroup pairs.RESULTS: Patients with both wild-type and mutant KRAS benefited from ramucirumab + FOLFIRI treatment over placebo + FOLFIRI (interaction P = 0.526); although numerically, wild-type KRAS patients benefited more (wild-type KRAS: median OS = 14.4 versus 11.9 months, HR = 0.82, P = 0.049; mutant KRAS: median OS = 12.7 versus 11.3 months, HR = 0.89, P = 0.263).Patients with both longer and shorter first-line TTP benefited from ramucirumab (interaction P = 0.9434), although TTP <6 months was associated with poorer OS (TTP >/=6 months: median OS = 14.3 versus 12.5 months, HR = 0.86, P = 0.061; TTP <6 months: median OS = 10.4 versus 8.0 months, HR = 0.86, P = 0.276).The subgroups of patients >/=65 versus <65 years also derived a similar ramucirumab survival benefit (interaction P = 0.9521) (>/=65 years: median OS = 13.8 versus 11.7 months, HR = 0.85, P = 0.156; <65 years: median OS = 13.1 versus 11.9 months, HR = 0.86, P = 0.098).The safety profile of ramucirumab + FOLFIRI was similar across subgroups.CONCLUSIONS: These analyses revealed similar efficacy and safety among patient subgroups with differing KRAS mutation status, longer or shorter first-line TTP, and age.Ramucirumab is a beneficial addition to second-line FOLFIRI treatment for a wide range of patients with mCRC.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01183780.",1,1,1,1
25795410,"Nivolumab versus chemotherapy in patients with advanced melanoma who progressed after anti-CTLA-4 treatment (CheckMate 037): a randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Nivolumab, a fully human IgG4 PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor antibody, can result in durable responses in patients with melanoma who have progressed after ipilimumab and BRAF inhibitors.We assessed the efficacy and safety of nivolumab compared with investigator's choice of chemotherapy (ICC) as a second-line or later-line treatment in patients with advanced melanoma.METHODS: In this randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 3 trial, we recruited patients at 90 sites in 14 countries.Eligible patients were 18 years or older, had unresectable or metastatic melanoma, and progressed after ipilimumab, or ipilimumab and a BRAF inhibitor if they were BRAF(V 600) mutation-positive.Participating investigators randomly assigned (with an interactive voice response system) patients 2:1 to receive an intravenous infusion of nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks or ICC (dacarbazine 1000 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks or paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2) combined with carboplatin area under the curve 6 every 3 weeks) until progression or unacceptable toxic effects.We stratified randomisation by BRAF mutation status, tumour expression of PD-L1, and previous best overall response to ipilimumab.We used permuted blocks (block size of six) within each stratum.Primary endpoints were the proportion of patients who had an objective response and overall survival.Treatment was given open-label, but those doing tumour assessments were masked to treatment assignment.We assessed objective responses per-protocol after 120 patients had been treated with nivolumab and had a minimum follow-up of 24 weeks, and safety in all patients who had had at least one dose of treatment.The trial is closed and this is the first interim analysis, reporting the objective response primary endpoint.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01721746.FINDINGS: Between Dec 21, 2012, and Jan 10, 2014, we screened 631 patients, randomly allocating 272 patients to nivolumab and 133 to ICC.Confirmed objective responses were reported in 38 (31.7%, 95% CI 23.5-40.8) of the first 120 patients in the nivolumab group versus five (10.6%, 3.5-23.1) of 47 patients in the ICC group.Grade 3-4 adverse events related to nivolumab included increased lipase (three [1%] of 268 patients), increased alanine aminotransferase, anaemia, and fatigue (two [1%] each); for ICC, these included neutropenia (14 [14%] of 102), thrombocytopenia (six [6%]), and anaemia (five [5%]).We noted grade 3-4 drug-related serious adverse events in 12 (5%) nivolumab-treated patients and nine (9%) patients in the ICC group.No treatment-related deaths occurred.INTERPRETATION: Nivolumab led to a greater proportion of patients achieving an objective response and fewer toxic effects than with alternative available chemotherapy regimens for patients with advanced melanoma that has progressed after ipilimumab or ipilimumab and a BRAF inhibitor.Nivolumab represents a new treatment option with clinically meaningful durable objective responses in a population of high unmet need.FUNDING: Bristol-Myers Squibb.",1,1,1,1
33539944,"A phase II randomized trial of cobimetinib plus chemotherapy, with or without atezolizumab, as first-line treatment for patients with locally advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (COLET): primary analysis.BACKGROUND: Resistance to standard chemotherapy in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) is associated with upregulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway.Cobimetinib, an MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK) inhibitor, may increase sensitivity to taxanes and programmed death-ligand 1 inhibitors.COLET is a three-cohort phase II study evaluating first-line cobimetinib plus chemotherapy, with or without atezolizumab, in patients with locally advanced or mTNBC.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were >/=18 years with locally advanced or mTNBC.Following a safety run-in, patients in cohort I were randomized 1:1 to cobimetinib (60 mg, D3-D23 of each 28-day cycle) or placebo, plus paclitaxel (80 mg/m(2), D1, 8, and 15).Additional patients were randomized (1:1) to cohort II or III to receive cobimetinib plus atezolizumab (840 mg, D1 and D15) and either paclitaxel (cohort II) or nab-paclitaxel [cohort III (100 mg/m(2), D1, D8, and D15)].Primary endpoints were investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) (cohort I) and confirmed objective response rate (ORR) (cohorts II/III).Safety and tolerability were also assessed.RESULTS: In the expansion stages, median PFS was 5.5 months for cobimetinib/paclitaxel versus 3.8 months for placebo/paclitaxel in cohort I [hazard ratio 0.73; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.43-1.24; P = 0.25].In cohort I, ORR was 38.3% (95% CI 24.40-52.20) for cobimetinib/paclitaxel and 20.9% (95% CI 8.77-33.09) for placebo/paclitaxel; ORRs in cohorts II and III were 34.4% (95% CI 18.57-53.19) and 29.0% (95% CI 14.22-48.04), respectively.Diarrhea was the most common grade >/=3 adverse events across all cohorts.CONCLUSIONS: Cobimetinib added to paclitaxel did not lead to a statistically significant increase in PFS or ORR, although a nonsignificant trend toward a numerical increase was observed.Cobimetinib plus atezolizumab and a taxane did not appear to increase ORR.This demonstrates the potential activity of a combinatorial MEK inhibitor, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy in this difficult-to-treat population.",1,1,1,1
25320361,"Tadalafil reduces myeloid-derived suppressor cells and regulatory T cells and promotes tumor immunity in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.PURPOSE: Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and regulatory T cells (Treg) play a key role in the progression of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).On the basis of our preclinical data demonstrating that phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibition can modulate these cell populations, we evaluated whether the PDE5 inhibitor tadalafil can revert tumor-induced immunosuppression and promote tumor immunity in patients with HNSCC.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: First, we functionally and phenotypically characterized MDSCs in HNSCCs and determined, retrospectively, whether their presence at the tumor site correlates with recurrence.Then, we performed a prospective single-center, double-blinded, randomized, three-arm study in which patients with HNSCC undergoing definitive surgical resection of oral and oropharyngeal tumors were treated with tadalafil 10 mg/day, 20 mg/day, or placebo for at least 20 days preoperatively.Blood and tumor MDSC and Treg presence and CD8(+) T-cell reactivity to tumor antigens were evaluated before and after treatment.RESULTS: MDSCs were characterized in HNSCC and their intratumoral presence significantly correlates with recurrence.Tadalafil treatment was well tolerated and significantly reduced both MDSCs and Treg concentrations in the blood and in the tumor (P < 0.05).In addition, the concentration of blood CD8(+) T cells reactive to autologous tumor antigens significantly increased after treatment (P < 0.05).Tadalafil immunomodulatory activity was maximized at an intermediate dose but not at higher doses.Mechanistic analysis suggests a possible off-target effect on PDE11 at high dosages that, by increasing intracellular cAMP, may negatively affect antitumor immunity.CONCLUSIONS: Tadalafil seems to beneficially modulate the tumor micro- and macro-environment in patients with HNSCC by lowering MDSCs and Tregs and increasing tumor-specific CD8(+) T cells in a dose-dependent fashion.",0,0,0,0

Patients received 7 treatment cycles in median (1-35) with a median treatment duration of 4.7 months (141 days, 8-765).PFS rate at 6 months was 54% in patients treated with cisplatin/gemcitabine and panitumumab but was 73% in patients treated with cisplatin/gemcitabine without antibody, respectively.Secondary end-points were an ORR of 45% in treatment arm A compared with 39% receiving treatment B and a median OS of 12.8 months (arm A) and of 20.1 months (arm B), respectively.In contrast to the p53-status, genetic alterations in IDH1/2 were linked to a high response after chemotherapy and prolonged survival.In accordance with our results, the meta-analysis of 12 trials did not reveal a survival advantage for patients treated with EGFR antibodies compared with chemotherapy alone.CONCLUSIONS: Panitumumab in combination with chemotherapy does not improve ORR, PFS and OS in patients with KRAS wild-type, advanced biliary cancer.Genetic profiling should be included in CCA trials to identify and validate predictive and prognostic biomarkers.CLINICAL TRIALS NUMBER: The trial was registered with NCT01320254.",1,1,1,1
23725233,"A randomized controlled trial of a cardiopulmonary resuscitation video in advance care planning for progressive pancreas and hepatobiliary cancer patients.BACKGROUND: Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is an important advance directive (AD) topic in patients with progressive cancer; however such discussions are challenging.OBJECTIVE: This study investigates whether video educational information about CPR engenders broader advance care planning (ACP) discourse.METHODS: Patients with progressive pancreas or hepatobiliary cancer were randomized to an educational CPR video or a similar CPR narrative.The primary end-point was the difference in ACP documentation one month posttest between arms.Secondary end-points included study impressions; pre- and post-intervention knowledge of and preferences for CPR and mechanical ventilation; and longitudinal patient outcomes.RESULTS: Fifty-six subjects were consented and analyzed.Rates of ACP documentation (either formal ADs or documented discussions) were 40% in the video arm (12/30) compared to 15% in the narrative arm (4/26), OR=3.6 [95% CI: 0.9-18.0], p=0.07.Post-intervention knowledge was higher in both arms.Posttest, preferences for CPR had changed in the video arm but not in the narrative arm.Preferences regarding mechanical ventilation did not change in either arm.The majority of subjects in both arms reported the information as helpful and comfortable to discuss, and they recommended it to others.More deaths occurred in the video arm compared to the narrative arm, and more subjects died in hospice settings in the video arm.CONCLUSIONS: This pilot randomized trial addressing downstream ACP effects of video versus narrative decision tools demonstrated a trend towards more ACP documentation in video subjects.This trend, as well as other video effects, is the subject of ongoing study.",0,0,0,0

27981431,"Adjusting Overall Survival Estimates after Treatment Switching: a Case Study in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.BACKGROUND: If patients in oncology trials receive subsequent therapy, standard intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses may inaccurately estimate the overall survival (OS) effect of the investigational product.In this context, a post-hoc analysis of the phase 3 PREVAIL study was performed with the aim to compare enzalutamide with placebo in terms of OS, adjusting for potential confounding from switching to antineoplastic therapies that are not part of standard metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) treatment pathways in some jurisdictions.METHODS: The PREVAIL study, which included 1717 chemotherapy-naive men with mCRPC randomized to treatment with enzalutamide 160 mg/day or placebo, was stopped after a planned interim survival analysis revealed a benefit in favor of enzalutamide.Data from this cutoff point were confounded by switching from both arms and so were evaluated in terms of OS using two switching adjustment methods: the two-stage accelerated failure time model (two-stage method) and inverse probability of censoring weights (IPCW).RESULTS: Following adjustment for switching to nonstandard antineoplastic therapies by 14.8 (129/872 patients) and 21.3% (180/845 patients) of patients initially randomized to enzalutamide and placebo, respectively, the two-stage and IPCW methods both resulted in numerical reductions in the hazard ratio (HR) for OS [HR 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57-0.81 and HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.52-0.75, respectively] for enzalutamide compared to placebo versus the unadjusted ITT analysis (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.60-0.84).These results suggest a slightly greater effect of enzalutamide on OS than originally reported.CONCLUSION: In the PREVAIL study, switching to nonstandard antineoplastic mCRPC therapies resulted in the ITT analysis of primary data underestimating the benefit of enzalutamide on OS.",1,1,1,0

32031879,"Dietary Modification and Breast Cancer Mortality: Long-Term Follow-Up of the Women's Health Initiative Randomized Trial.PURPOSE: Observational studies of dietary fat intake and breast cancer have reported inconsistent findings.This topic was addressed in additional analyses of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Dietary Modification (DM) clinical trial that evaluated a low-fat dietary pattern influence on breast cancer incidence.METHODS: In the WHI DM trial, 48,835 postmenopausal women, ages 50-79 years, with no prior breast cancer, and a dietary fat intake of >/= 32% of energy were randomly assigned at 40 US centers to a usual diet comparison group (60%) or dietary intervention group (40%).The goals were to reduce fat intake to 20% of energy and increase vegetable, fruit, and grain intake.Breast cancers were confirmed after central medical record review and serial National Death Index linkages to enhance mortality findings.RESULTS: During 8.5 years of dietary intervention, breast cancer incidence and deaths as a result of breast cancer were nonsignificantly lower in the intervention group, while deaths after breast cancer were statistically significantly lower both during intervention and through a 16.1-year (median) follow-up.Now, after a long-term, cumulative 19.6-year (median) follow-up, the significant reduction in deaths after breast cancer persists (359 [0.12%] v 652 [0.14%] deaths; hazard ratio [HR], 0.85; 95% CI, 0.74 to 0.96; P = .01), and a statistically significant reduction in deaths as a result of breast cancer (breast cancer followed by death attributed to the breast cancer) emerged (132 [0.037%, annualized risk] v 251 [0.047%] deaths, respectively; HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.64 to 0.97; P = .02).CONCLUSION: Adoption of a low-fat dietary pattern associated with increased vegetable, fruit, and grain intake, demonstrably achievable by many, may reduce the risk of death as a result of breast cancer in postmenopausal women.",0,0,0,0
28188670,"A randomized phase II trial of personalized peptide vaccine with low dose cyclophosphamide in biliary tract cancer.Since the prognosis of advanced biliary tract cancer (aBTC) still remains very poor, new therapeutic approaches, including immunotherapies, need to be developed.In the current study, we conducted an open-label randomized phase II study to test whether low dose cyclophosphamide (CPA) could improve antigen-specific immune responses and clinical efficacy of personalized peptide vaccination (PPV) in 49 previously treated aBTC patients.Patients with aBTC refractory to at least one regimen of chemotherapies were randomly assigned to receive PPV with low dose CPA (100 mg/day for 7 days before vaccination) (PPV/CPA, n = 24) or PPV alone (n = 25).A maximum of four HLA-matched peptides were selected based on the pre-existing peptide-specific IgG responses, followed by subcutaneous administration.T cell responses to the vaccinated peptides in the PPV/CPA arm tended to be greater than those in the PPV alone arm.The PPV/CPA arm showed significantly better progression-free survival (median time: 6.1 vs 2.9 months; hazard ratio (HR): 0.427; P = 0.008) and overall survival (median time: 12.1 vs 5.9 months; HR: 0.376; P = 0.004), compared to the PPV alone arm.The PPV alone arm, but not the PPV/CPA arm, showed significant increase in plasma IL-6 after vaccinations, which might be associated with inhibition of antigen-specific T cell responses.These results suggested that combined treatment with low dose CPA could provide clinical benefits in aBTC patients under PPV, possibly through prevention of IL-6-mediated immune suppression.Further clinical studies would be recommended to clarify the clinical efficacy of PPV/CPA in aBTC patients.",1,1,1,0
31200823,"Combination of icotinib and chemotherapy as first-line treatment for advanced lung adenocarcinoma in patients with sensitive EGFR mutations: A randomized controlled study.OBJECTIVE: To explore the efficacy and safety of icotinib with chemotherapy as first-line therapy for advanced lung adenocarcinoma in patients with sensitive epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations.METHODS: This prospective, randomized, controlled trial was conducted in 10 general hospitals in Shandong Province, China.Previously untreated patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma and sensitive EGFR mutations were recruited between January 16, 2014 and December 31, 2016 and randomly allocated to the combination group (icotinib plus pemetrexed and carboplatin) or the icotinib only group.The patients were followed up until May 23, 2018.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS).RESULTS: The efficacy analysis (intention-to-treat analysis) include 179 patients (n = 90 in the combination group and n = 89 in the icotinib only group).PFS was significantly longer in the combination group than in the icotinib only group (16.0 months vs. 10.0 months, hazard ratio [HR] = 0.59, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.42-0.84, P = 0.003).The objective response rate and the disease control rate for the combination group were significantly higher than those for the icotinib only group (77.8% vs. 64.0%, chi(2) = 4.094, P = 0.043; 91.1% vs. 79.8%, chi(2) = 4.632, P = 0.031).However, overall survival did not differ between the two groups (36.0 months vs. 34.0 months, HR = 0.81, 95%CI 0.54-1.22, P = 0.309).The incidence rates of leukopenia and liver function damage of grades 3-4 were higher in the combination group than in the icotinib only group (12.2% vs. 0%, chi(2) = 11.086, P = 0.001; 12.2% vs. 3.5%, chi(2) = 4.488, P = 0.034).However, adverse events were resolved in most patients.CONCLUSION: Use of the combination of icotinib and chemotherapy as first-line therapy significantly improved the PFS of advanced lung adenocarcinoma patients with sensitive EGFR mutations.Although the combination therapy increased the incidence of leukopenia and liver function damage, the observed adverse events were tolerable and manageable.",1,1,1,1
26740194,"Effect of intranasal steroids on rhinosinusitis after radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma: clinical study.OBJECTIVE: Post-irradiation rhinosinusitis is one of the most common untoward side effects in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma.This study aimed to evaluate the effect of fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray on post-irradiation rhinosinusitis.METHODS: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients who had undergone radiotherapy and subsequently developed chronic rhinosinusitis were randomised to receive either fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray 200 microg plus nasal irrigation or a single nasal irrigation, for six months.A questionnaire, nasal endoscopy and computed tomography were used to evaluate rhinosinusitis severity, at the beginning of treatment, and at three and six months after treatment.RESULTS: The group who received fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray combined with irrigation had fewer nasal complaints (overall symptoms, blocked nose and headache were reduced), a better quality of life and less severe endoscopic findings than those who only received nasal irrigation at three and six months after treatment.CONCLUSION: Nasal steroids are a safe and effective therapy for patients with post-irradiation rhinosinusitis.",0,0,0,0
26788875,"Hyaluronic acid and vitamins are effective in reducing vaginal atrophy in women receiving radiotherapy.AIM: During the last decades, therapies targeting cervical cancer have been considerably improved.Surgery and radiotherapy (RT) represent the main common therapeutic approach in cervical cancer.In order to minimize the side effects of radiotherapy approach, several protocols have been developed such as brachytherapy (BRT).Among the side effects associated with RT, the vaginal atrophy is the most important and common one.Vaginal atrophy, in turn, leads to additional alterations like inflammation, associated to relevant symptoms such as itching, burning and dyspareunia.All these alterations heavily affect the quality of women's life.The aim of our study was to evaluate the toxicity induced by RT on vaginal mucosa, and the adjuvant action of a product containing LMWHA, vitamin A, and Vitamin E (Santes(R), Lo.Li.Pharma, Rome, Italy).The introduction of adjuvant therapies may have likely had a relevant place in providing that result.METHODS: A prospective randomized study was designed.From October 2006 to October 2008, 45 women with a mean age 38 +/- 6 years were enrolled.After surgery, all patients were treated with 4 weeks of RT and 4 weeks of BRT, concomitantly with chemiotherapy.They were randomly assigned in two groups: 23 women were treated with two suppositories (Santes(R)) per day for 4 months.For the first two months the preventive treatment was simultaneous to RT and BRT.Instead the control groups for composed by 22 patients and they did not undergo any treatment during RT.To evaluate the efficacy of Santes(R) treatment three biopsies were performed.RESULTS: At the second biopsy, after the BRT therapy, the treated group showed a statistically significant improvement (P<0.05 vs. control) on inflammation, cell atypia, fibrosis, mucositis and bleeding.At the third biopsy, two months after BRT, further statistically improvement were observed for all RT/BRT associated side effects.The treatment showed an efficacy also in terms of pain severity.CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that low molecular weight HA shows good performances in treating RT-damaged tissue and plays a key role in all steps of the healing process.Indeed the results shows that women exposed to RT treatments and simultaneously treated with Santes(R), had an optimal resolution of vaginal atrophy and related symptoms.",0,0,0,0
22488488,"The impact of PLCO control arm contamination on perceived PSA screening efficacy.PURPOSE: To quantify the extent to which a clinically significant prostate cancer mortality reduction due to screening could have been masked by control arm screening (contamination) in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) trial.METHODS: We used three independently developed models of prostate cancer natural history to conduct a virtual PLCO trial.Simulated participants underwent pre-trial screening based on population patterns.The intervention arm followed observed compliance during the trial then resumed population screening.A contaminated control arm followed observed contamination during the trial then resumed population screening, while an uncontaminated control arm discontinued screening upon entry.We assumed a clinically significant screening benefit, applied population treatments and survival patterns, and calculated mortality rate ratios relative to the contaminated and uncontaminated control arms.RESULTS: The virtual trial reproduced observed incidence, including stage and grade distributions, and control arm mortality after 10 years of complete follow-up.Under the assumed screening benefit, the three models found that contamination increased the mortality rate ratio from 0.68-0.77 to 0.86-0.91, increased the chance of excess mortality in the intervention arm from 0-4 % to 15-28 %, and decreased the power of the trial to detect a mortality difference from 40-70 % to 9-25 %.CONCLUSIONS: Our computer simulation models indicate that contamination substantially limited the ability of the PLCO to identify a clinically significant screening benefit.While the trial shows annual screening does not reduce mortality relative to population screening, contamination prevents concluding whether screening reduces mortality relative to no screening.",0,0,0,0
23234763,"Adjuvant lapatinib for women with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer: a randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Worldwide, many patients with HER2-positive early stage breast cancer do not receive trastuzumab-the standard adjuvant treatment.We investigated the efficacy and safety of adjuvant lapatinib for patients with trastuzumab-naive HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer, started at any time after diagnosis.METHODS: This study was a placebo-controlled, multicentre, randomised phase 3 trial.Women outpatients from 405 [corrected] centres in 33 countries [corrected] with HER2-positive early-breast cancer who had previously received adjuvant chemotherapy but not trastuzumab were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive daily lapatinib (1500 mg) or daily placebo for 12 months.Randomisation was done with a computer-generated sequence, stratified by time since diagnosis, lymph node involvement at diagnosis, and tumour hormone-receptor status.Investigators, site staff, and patients were masked to treatment assignment.The primary endpoint was disease-free survival in the intention-to-treat population.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00374322.FINDINGS: Between August, 2006, and May, 2008, 3161 women were enrolled and 3147 were assigned to lapatinib (n=1571) or placebo (n=1576).After a median follow-up of 47.4 months (range 0.4-60.0) in the lapatinib group and 48.3 (0.7-61.3) in the placebo group, 210 (13%) disease-free survival events had occurred in the lapatinib group versus 264 (17%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.83, 95% CI 0.70-1.00; p=0.053).Central review of HER2 status showed that only 2490 (79%) of the randomised women were HER2-positive.157 (13%) of 1230 confirmed HER2-positive patients in the lapatinib group and in 208 (17%) of 1260 in the placebo group had a disease-free survival event (HR 0.82, 95% 0.67-1.00; p=0.04).Serious adverse events occurred in 99 (6%) of 1573 patients taking lapatinib and 77 (5%) of 1574 patients taking placebo, with higher incidences of grade 3-4 diarrhoea (97 [6%] vs nine [<1%]), rash (72 [5%] vs three [<1%]), and hepatobiliary disorders (36 [2%] vs one [<1%]).INTERPRETATION: Our data show that there was no significant difference in disease-free survival between groups when analysed in the intention-to-treat population.However, exploratory analyses restricted to patients who had HER2-positive disease confirmed by central fluorescence in-situ hybridisation review suggested marginal benefit with lapatinib in terms of disease-free survival.Thus lapatinib might be an option for women with HER2-positive breast cancer who do not or cannot receive adjuvant trastuzumab.FUNDING: GlaxoSmithKline.",1,1,1,1
22565002,"Randomized phase II trial of everolimus in combination with tamoxifen in patients with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative metastatic breast cancer with prior exposure to aromatase inhibitors: a GINECO study.PURPOSE: Cross-talk between signal transduction pathways likely contributes to hormone resistance in metastatic breast cancer (mBC).Everolimus, an oral inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin, has restored sensitivity in endocrine-resistance models and shown anticancer activity in early-phase mBC clinical trials.This analysis evaluated efficacy and safety of everolimus in combination with tamoxifen in patients with mBC resistant to aromatase inhibitors (AIs).PATIENTS AND METHODS: This open-label, phase II study randomly assigned postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative, AI-resistant mBC to tamoxifen 20 mg/d plus everolimus 10 mg/d (n = 54) or tamoxifen 20 mg/d alone (n = 57).Randomization was stratified by primary and secondary hormone resistance.Primary end point was clinical benefit rate (CBR), defined as the percentage of all patients with a complete or partial response or stable disease at 6 months.No formal statistical comparison between groups was planned.RESULTS: The 6-month CBR was 61% (95% CI, 47 to 74) with tamoxifen plus everolimus and 42% (95% CI, 29 to 56) with tamoxifen alone.Time to progression (TTP) increased from 4.5 months with tamoxifen alone to 8.6 months with tamoxifen plus everolimus, corresponding to a 46% reduction in risk of progression with the combination (hazard ratio [HR], 0.54; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.81).Risk of death was reduced by 55% with tamoxifen plus everolimus versus tamoxifen alone (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.24 to 0.81).The main toxicities associated with tamoxifen plus everolimus were fatigue (72% v 53% with tamoxifen alone), stomatitis (56% v 7%), rash (44% v 7%), anorexia (43% v 18%), and diarrhea (39% v 11%).CONCLUSION: This study suggests that tamoxifen plus everolimus increased CBR, TTP, and overall survival compared with tamoxifen alone in postmenopausal women with AI-resistant mBC.",1,1,1,1

Clinical control was achieved in 28 patients (93.3%) in Arm A and in 21 patients 70.0% in Arm B. Overall response rate was met in 43.3% of patients in Arm A and in 40.0% in Arm B. Toxicities were increased in Arm B with higher rates of diarrhea, nausea, neutropenia, hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) and anorexia, Grad 3 and 4 toxicities were rare.CONCLUSIONS: In this pre-planned interim analysis, paclitaxel-sorafenib combination therapy was not found to be superior to paclitaxel monotherapy with regard to the primary end point, progression-free survival.The trial was therefore discontinued early.There was no indication of more favorable outcomes for combination therapy in secondary efficacy end points.As expected, the safety and toxicity profile of the combination therapy was less favorable compared to monotherapy.Overall, this trial did not demonstrate that adding sorafenib to second- or third-line paclitaxel provides any clinical benefit to patients with HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer.Cautious dosing using a sorafenib ramp up schedule might have contributed to negative results.TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered at EudraCT (No 2009-018025-73) and retrospectively registered at Clinical trials.gov on March 17, 2011 ( NCT01320111 ).",1,1,1,1

22474202,"Effect of oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and leucovorin with or without cetuximab on survival among patients with resected stage III colon cancer: a randomized trial.CONTEXT: Leucovorin, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) is the standard adjuvant therapy for resected stage III colon cancer.Adding cetuximab to FOLFOX benefits patients with metastatic wild-type KRAS but not mutated KRAS colon cancer.OBJECTIVE: To assess the potential benefit of cetuximab added to the modified sixth version of the FOLFOX regimen (mFOLFOX6) in patients with resected stage III wild-type KRAS colon cancer.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A randomized trial of 2686 patients aged 18 years or older at multiple institutions across North America enrolled following resection and informed consent between February 10, 2004, and November 25, 2009.The primary randomized comparison was 12 biweekly cycles of mFOLFOX6 with and without cetuximab.KRAS mutation status was centrally determined.The trial was halted after a planned interim analysis of 48% of predicted events (246/515) occurring in 1863 (of 2070 planned) patients with tumors having wild-type KRAS.A total of 717 patients with mutated KRAS and 106 with indeterminate KRAS were accrued.The 2070 patients with wild-type KRAS provided 90% power to detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.33 (2-sided alpha = .05), with planned interim efficacy analyses after 25%, 50%, and 75% of expected relapses.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Disease-free survival in patients with wild-type KRAS mutations.Secondary end points included overall survival and toxicity.RESULTS: Median (range) follow-up was 28 (0-68) months.The trial demonstrated no benefit when adding cetuximab.Three-year disease-free survival for mFOLFOX6 alone was 74.6% vs 71.5% with the addition of cetuximab (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.98-1.49; P = .08) in patients with wild-type KRAS, and 67.1% vs 65.0% (HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.86-1.46; P = .38) in patients with mutated KRAS, with no significant benefit in any subgroups assessed.Among all patients, grade 3 or higher adverse events (72.5% vs 52.3%; odds ratio [OR], 2.4; 95% CI, 2.1-2.8; P < .001) and failure to complete 12 cycles (33% vs 23%; OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.4-1.9; P < .001) were significantly higher with cetuximab.Increased toxicity and greater detrimental differences in all outcomes were observed in patients aged 70 years or older.CONCLUSION: Among patients with stage III resected colon cancer, the use of cetuximab with adjuvant mFOLFOX6 compared with mFOLFOX6 alone did not result in improved disease-free survival.TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00079274.",1,1,1,1
