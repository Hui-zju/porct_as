23650416,"Randomized phase II, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of exemestane with or without entinostat in postmenopausal women with locally recurrent or metastatic estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer progressing on treatment with a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor.PURPOSE: Entinostat is an oral isoform selective histone deacetylase inhibitor that targets resistance to hormonal therapies in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer.This randomized, placebo-controlled, phase II study evaluated entinostat combined with the aromatase inhibitor exemestane versus exemestane alone.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Postmenopausal women with ER+ advanced breast cancer progressing on a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor were randomly assigned to exemestane 25 mg daily plus entinostat 5 mg once per week (EE) or exemestane plus placebo (EP).The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS).Blood was collected in a subset of patients for evaluation of protein lysine acetylation as a biomarker of entinostat activity.RESULTS: One hundred thirty patients were randomly assigned (EE group, n = 64; EP group, n = 66).Based on intent-to-treat analysis, treatment with EE improved median PFS to 4.3 months versus 2.3 months with EP (hazard ratio [HR], 0.73; 95% CI, 0.50 to 1.07; one-sided P = .055; two-sided P = .11 [predefined significance level of .10, one-sided]).Median overall survival was an exploratory end point and improved to 28.1 months with EE versus 19.8 months with EP (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.97; P = .036).Fatigue and neutropenia were the most frequent grade 3/4 toxicities.Treatment discontinuation because of adverse events was higher in the EE group versus the EP group (11% v 2%).Protein lysine hyperacetylation in the EE biomarker subset was associated with prolonged PFS.CONCLUSION: Entinostat added to exemestane is generally well tolerated and demonstrated activity in patients with ER+ advanced breast cancer in this signal-finding phase II study.Acetylation changes may provide an opportunity to maximize clinical benefit with entinostat.Plans for a confirmatory study are underway.",1,1,1,1
28716815,"Exposure-Response Analyses of Ramucirumab from Two Randomized, Phase III Trials of Second-line Treatment for Advanced Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer.Ramucirumab is an IgG1 monoclonal antibody specific for the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2.Ramucirumab, 8 mg/kg every 2 weeks, administered as monotherapy (REGARD) or in combination with paclitaxel (RAINBOW), was safe and effective in patients with previously treated advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer.We evaluated exposure-efficacy and exposure-safety relationships of ramucirumab from two randomized, placebo-controlled phase III trials.Sparse pharmacokinetic samples were collected, and a population pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted to predict ramucirumab minimum trough concentration at steady state (Cmin,ss).Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the ramucirumab exposure (Cmin,ss)-efficacy relationship to overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS).Logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate exposure-safety relationships.Analyses included 321 ramucirumab + paclitaxel and 335 placebo + paclitaxel patients from RAINBOW and 72 ramucirumab and 35 placebo patients from REGARD.Exposure-efficacy analysis showed ramucirumab Cmin,ss was a significant predictor of OS and PFS in both trials.Higher ramucirumab exposure was associated with longer OS and PFS.In RAINBOW, grade >/=3 hypertension, leukopenia, and neutropenia, but not febrile neutropenia, significantly correlated with Cmin,ss, with increased exposure leading to increased incidence.Exploratory exposure-response analyses suggest a positive relationship between efficacy and ramucirumab exposure with manageable toxicities at exposures generated from a dose of 8 mg/kg ramucirumab given every 2 weeks for patients with advanced gastric/GEJ cancer.These findings suggest an opportunity to further optimize benefit versus risk profiles of ramucirumab treatment in patients with gastric/GEJ cancer.Mol Cancer Ther; 16(10); 2215-22.(c)2017 AACR.",0,0,0,0
25356603,"One-year and long-term molecular response to nilotinib and dasatinib for newly diagnosed chronic myeloid leukemia: a matching-adjusted indirect comparison.BACKGROUND: Nilotinib and dasatinib have shown superior rates of molecular response (MR) compared to imatinib for the treatment of newly diagnosed chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase (CP).This study indirectly compares MR in patients taking nilotinib 300 mg bid with that in those taking dasatinib 100 mg qd by 12 months and through 48 months.METHODS: Patients in ENESTnd were re-weighted to match published baseline characteristics reported for DASISION using a propensity score model.After matching, differences in rates of major MR (MMR, measured as a 3 log reduction on the International Scale [IS]), MR(4.0) (4 log reduction on IS), and MR(4.5) (4.5 log reduction on IS) relative to imatinib were indirectly compared between nilotinib and dasatinib.Hazard ratios (HRs) were used to indirectly compare MR outcomes between nilotinib and dasatinib through 48 months of follow-up, while rate differences were used to compare progression to AP/BC between nilotinib and dasatinib by 48 months.RESULTS: After matching, rates of MR by 12 months were higher with nilotinib vs dasatinib by 11.7% for MMR (p = 0.045), 8.2% for MR(4.0) (p = 0.029), and 8.5% for MR(4.5) (p < 0.001).Higher rates of MMR (HR = 1.44, p = 0.018) and MR(4.0) (HR = 1.58, p = 0.013) achievement were maintained with nilotinib compared to dasatinib through 48 months of follow-up.No statistically significant differences were observed for MR(4.5) through 48 months or progression to AP/BC by 48 months.LIMITATIONS: LIMITATIONS include comparisons based solely on indirect evidence and HRs for MR(4.0) and MR(4.5) from the DASISION trial being extracted from cumulative incidence curves.CONCLUSIONS: This indirect comparison suggests that nilotinib is associated with higher rates of achieving MMR, MR(4.0), and MR(4.5) by 12 months compared to dasatinib for the treatment of newly diagnosed CML-CP.In addition, higher rates of MR achievement with nilotinib were also maintained through 48 months of follow-up.",0,0,0,0

28352657,"Randomized, placebo-controlled window trial of EGFR, Src, or combined blockade in head and neck cancer.BACKGROUND.EGFR and Src family kinases are upregulated in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).EGFR interacts with Src to activate STAT3 signaling, and dual EGFR-Src targeting is synergistic in HNSCC preclinical models.pSrc overexpression predicted resistance to the EGFR inhibitor, erlotinib, in a prior window trial.We conducted a 4-arm window trial to identify biomarkers associated with response to EGFR and/or Src inhibition.METHODS.Patients with operable stage II-IVa HNSCC were randomized to 7-21 days of neoadjuvant erlotinib, the Src inhibitor dasatinib, the combination of both, or placebo.Paired tumor specimens were collected before and after treatment.Pharmacodynamic expression of EGFR and Src pathway components was evaluated by IHC of tissue microarrays and reverse-phase protein array of tissue lysates.Candidate biomarkers were assessed for correlation with change in tumor size.RESULTS.From April 2009 to December 2012, 58 patients were randomized and 55 were treated.There was a significant decrease in tumor size in both erlotinib arms (P = 0.0014); however, no effect was seen with dasatinib alone (P = 0.24).High baseline pMAPK expression was associated with response to erlotinib (P = 0.03).High baseline pSTAT3 was associated with resistance to dasatinib (P = 0.099).CONCLUSIONS.Brief exposure to erlotinib significantly decreased tumor size in operable HNSCC, with no additive effect from dasatinib.Baseline pMAPK expression warrants further study as a response biomarker for anti-EGFR therapy.Basal expression of pSTAT3 may be independent of Src, explain therapeutic resistance, and preclude development of dasatinib in biomarker-unselected cohorts.TRIAL REGISTRATION.NCT00779389.FUNDING.National Cancer Institute, American Cancer Society, Pennsylvania Department of Health, V Foundation for Cancer Research, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Astellas Pharma.",1,1,1,1
23871490,"2 years versus 1 year of adjuvant trastuzumab for HER2-positive breast cancer (HERA): an open-label, randomised controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Trastuzumab has established efficacy against breast cancer with overexpression or amplification of the HER2 oncogene.The standard of care is 1 year of adjuvant trastuzumab, but the optimum duration of treatment is unknown.We compared 2 years of treatment with trastuzumab with 1 year of treatment, and updated the comparison of 1 year of trastuzumab versus observation at a median follow-up of 8 years, for patients enrolled in the HERceptin Adjuvant (HERA) trial.METHODS: The HERA trial is an international, multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial comparing treatment with trastuzumab for 1 and 2 years with observation after standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy, adjuvant chemotherapy, or both in 5102 patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer.The primary endpoint was disease-free survival.The comparison of 2 years versus 1 year of trastuzumab treatment involved a landmark analysis of 3105 patients who were disease-free 12 months after randomisation to one of the trastuzumab groups, and was planned after observing at least 725 disease-free survival events.The updated intention-to-treat comparison of 1 year trastuzumab treatment versus observation alone in 3399 patients at a median follow-up of 8 years (range 0-10) is also reported.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00045032.FINDINGS: We recorded 367 events of disease-free survival in 1552 patients in the 1 year group and 367 events in 1553 patients in the 2 year group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.99, 95% CI 0.85-1.14, p=0.86).Grade 3-4 adverse events and decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction during treatment were reported more frequently in the 2 year treatment group than in the 1 year group (342 [20.4%] vs 275 [16.3%] grade 3-4 adverse events, and 120 [7.2%] vs 69 [4.1%] decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction, respectively).HRs for a comparison of 1 year of trastuzumab treatment versus observation were 0.76 (95% CI 0.67-0.86, p<0.0001) for disease-free survival and 0.76 (0.65-0.88, p=0.0005) for overall survival, despite crossover of 884 (52%) patients from the observation group to trastuzumab therapy.INTERPRETATION: 2 years of adjuvant trastuzumab is not more effective than is 1 year of treatment for patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer.1 year of treatment provides a significant disease-free and overall survival benefit compared with observation and remains the standard of care.FUNDING: F Hoffmann-La Roche (Roche).",1,1,1,1

22978687,"In thyroidectomized patients with thyroid cancer, a serum thyrotropin of 30 muU/mL after thyroxine withdrawal is not always adequate for detecting an elevated stimulated serum thyroglobulin.BACKGROUND: The thyrotropin (TSH) level or duration of thyroid hormone withdrawal (THW) required to detect stimulated thyroglobulin (Tg) in differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) monitoring is unknown.The objective of this study was to evaluate the TSH cutoff of >30 muU/mL as a means to detect stimulated Tg >/=2 ng/mL after THW (THW-Tg>/=2), and sensitivity of the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) questionnaire for detecting hypothyroid symptoms.METHODS: This was a prospective longitudinal cohort study done at a tertiary academic medical center.Forty-seven patients with DTC undergoing their first Tg stimulation or after previously abnormal Tg stimulation had weekly measurements of TSH and Tg during the 4 weeks THW, and repeated questionnaire assessments.RESULTS: TSH did not reach a plateau in any patient, and in those whose Tg did not remain undetectable, Tg continued to rise.Seventy-five percent of patients had an undetectable Tg <0.2 ng/mL at baseline (95% were <0.5 mg/mL) with 16% remaining undetectable throughout THW.The majority of patients (72.7% and 97.8%) achieved TSH >30 muU/mL by 3 and 4 weeks THW, respectively.Of the 15 patients with maximum stimulated THW-Tg>/=2, 38% were detected before the minimal TSH >30 muU/mL cutoff.At 2 weeks THW, 3 had a TSH>30 muU/mL, and none of them had Tg >/=2 ng/mL. At 3 weeks THW, 11 had a TSH >30 muU/mL, and 64% of them had Tg >/=2 ng/mL. Only 60% were detected at 3-week THW regardless of their TSH level.Eighty-six percent were detected by TSH 60-<80 muU/mL. Conversely, all patients whose serum Tg was <0.2 ng/mL when their serum TSH was >20 muU/mL did not achieve a THW-Tg>/=2.CONCLUSION: The minimal TSH cutoff of >30 muU/mL was inadequate to detect many patients with final stimulated THW-Tg>/=2 during complete THW.TSH >80-100 muU/mL was a better cutoff, achieved in only 53% after 4-week THW.Conversely, we propose a preliminary THW-stopping rule for ending THW early in selected patients.In patients with a Tg <0.2 ng/mL when TSH >20 muU/mL, all had a final stimulated Tg </=2 ng/mL, potentially saving qualifying patients 40% of THW duration compared to 4-week THW.FACIT-F correlated with TSH, but was not sensitive to detect mild hypothyroidism.",0,0,0,0

25557266,"Intermittent Chemotherapy as a Platform for Testing Novel Agents in Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Department of Defense Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Consortium Randomized Phase II Trial of Intermittent Docetaxel With Prednisone With or Without Maintenance GM-CSF.BACKGROUND: Immunotherapy with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), an agent that previously demonstrated antitumor activity, was evaluated within an intermittent chemotherapy framework of docetaxel with prednisone (D+P) in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).PATIENTS AND METHODS: mCRPC patients with >/= 50% prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline after 6 cycles of D+P were randomized to either GM-CSF or observation (Obs).At disease progression (PD), D+P was reinitiated for 6 cycles followed by the same ""off chemotherapy"" regimen in patients eligible for chemotherapy interruption.The sequence was repeated until PD during chemotherapy, lack of PSA response to chemotherapy, or unacceptable toxicity.The primary end point was time to chemotherapy resistance (TTCR).RESULTS: Of 125 patients enrolled, 52 (42%) experienced >/= 50% PSA decline on induction D+P and were randomized to GM-CSF (n = 27) or Obs (n = 25).The median time to PD was 3.3 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.4-3.5) and 1.5 months (95% CI, 1.5-2.4) during the initial course of GM-CSF and Obs, respectively.Twelve of 26 (46%) patients responded to a second course of D+P. Eleven randomized patients (21%) experienced PD during chemotherapy, precluding accurate assessment of TTCR.The remaining 41 randomized patients discontinued study for lack of PSA response to chemotherapy (n = 8), patient choice to not restart chemotherapy with PSA PD (n = 13), toxicity (n = 7), or study withdrawal (n = 13).CONCLUSION: Conducting a prospective study in mCRPC with maintenance immunotherapy within the framework of intermittent chemotherapy was feasible.The use of PSA instead of radiographic end points limited the number of evaluable patients.This study provides important insight into designing contemporary intermittent chemotherapy trials with maintenance immunotherapy in patients with advanced prostate cancer.",0,0,0,0
25287825,"Postinduction minimal residual disease monitoring by polymerase chain reaction in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.PURPOSE: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common pediatric cancer.Monitoring minimal residual disease (MRD) by using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) provides information for patient stratification and individual risk-directed treatment.Cooperative studies have documented that measurement of blast clearance from the bone marrow during and after induction therapy identifies patient populations with different risk of relapse.We explored the possible contribution of measurements of MRD during the course of treatment.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We used RQ-PCR to detect MRD in 110 unselected patients treated in Italy in the International Collaborative Treatment Protocol for Children and Adolescents With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (AIEOP-BFM ALL 2000).The trial took place in AIEOP centers during postinduction chemotherapy.Results were categorized as negative, low positive (below the quantitative range [< 5 x 10(-4)]), or high positive (>/= 5 x 10(-4)).Patients with at least one low-positive or high-positive result were assigned to the corresponding subgroup.RESULTS: Patients who tested high positive, low positive, or negative had significantly different cumulative incidences of leukemia relapse: 83.3%, 34.8%, and 8.6%, respectively (P < .001).Two thirds of positive cases were identified within 4 months after induction-consolidation therapy, suggesting that this time frame may be most suitable for cost-effective MRD monitoring, particularly in patients who did not clear their disease at the end of consolidation.CONCLUSION: These findings provide further insights into the dynamic of MRD and the ongoing effort to define molecular relapse in childhood ALL.",0,0,0,0

28352657,"Randomized, placebo-controlled window trial of EGFR, Src, or combined blockade in head and neck cancer.BACKGROUND.EGFR and Src family kinases are upregulated in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).EGFR interacts with Src to activate STAT3 signaling, and dual EGFR-Src targeting is synergistic in HNSCC preclinical models.pSrc overexpression predicted resistance to the EGFR inhibitor, erlotinib, in a prior window trial.We conducted a 4-arm window trial to identify biomarkers associated with response to EGFR and/or Src inhibition.METHODS.Patients with operable stage II-IVa HNSCC were randomized to 7-21 days of neoadjuvant erlotinib, the Src inhibitor dasatinib, the combination of both, or placebo.Paired tumor specimens were collected before and after treatment.Pharmacodynamic expression of EGFR and Src pathway components was evaluated by IHC of tissue microarrays and reverse-phase protein array of tissue lysates.Candidate biomarkers were assessed for correlation with change in tumor size.RESULTS.From April 2009 to December 2012, 58 patients were randomized and 55 were treated.There was a significant decrease in tumor size in both erlotinib arms (P = 0.0014); however, no effect was seen with dasatinib alone (P = 0.24).High baseline pMAPK expression was associated with response to erlotinib (P = 0.03).High baseline pSTAT3 was associated with resistance to dasatinib (P = 0.099).CONCLUSIONS.Brief exposure to erlotinib significantly decreased tumor size in operable HNSCC, with no additive effect from dasatinib.Baseline pMAPK expression warrants further study as a response biomarker for anti-EGFR therapy.Basal expression of pSTAT3 may be independent of Src, explain therapeutic resistance, and preclude development of dasatinib in biomarker-unselected cohorts.TRIAL REGISTRATION.NCT00779389.FUNDING.National Cancer Institute, American Cancer Society, Pennsylvania Department of Health, V Foundation for Cancer Research, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Astellas Pharma.",1,1,1,1

23404145,"Oxidative stress markers in laparoscopic versus open colectomy for cancer: a double-blind randomized study.BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer as well as colorectal surgery is associated with increased oxidative stress through different mechanisms.In this study the levels of different oxidative stress markers were comparatively assessed in patients who underwent laparoscopic or conventional resection for colorectal cancer.METHODS: Sixty patients with colorectal cancer were randomly assigned to undergo laparoscopic (LS) or open surgery (OS).Lipid, protein, RNA, and nitrogen damage was investigated by measuring serum 8-isoprostanes (8-epiPGF2alpha), protein carbonyls (PC), 8-hydroxyguanosine (8-OHG), and 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT), respectively.The primary end point of the study was to analyze and compare serum levels of the oxidative stress markers between the groups.RESULTS: Postoperative serum levels of 8-epiPGF2alpha, 3-NT, and 8-OHG were significantly lower in the LS group at 24 h after surgery (p < 0.05).At 6 h postoperatively, the levels of 8-epiPGF2alpha and 3-NT were significantly lower in the LS group (p < 0.05).No difference in the levels of PC was found between the two groups at any time point.In the OS group, postoperative levels of 8-epiPGF2alpha were significantly lower than the preoperative values (p < 0.01).In the LS group, the postoperative values of 8-epiPGF2alpha, 3-NT, and 8-OHG were significantly lower than the preoperative values (p < 0.05).CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer is associated with lower oxidative stress compared to open surgery.8-epiPGF2alpha was the most suitable marker for readily defining the oxidative status in patients who underwent surgery for colorectal cancer.",0,0,0,0
22678326,"Hand-assisted laparoscopic versus open right hemicolectomy: short-term outcomes in a single institution from China.AIM: To compare the perioperative parameters and short-term outcomes of hand-assisted laparoscopic colectomy (HALC) and open colectomy (OC) for the treatment of patients with cancer of the right hemicolon.METHODS: Patients who were scheduled to perform right hemicolectomy between August 2009 and December 2010 were randomized into either HALC or OC group.Patients were excluded if they had synchronous cancers, hepatic metastases, acute intestinal obstruction, or intestinal perforations.All the operations in the 2 groups were performed by a single surgical team.Measured outcomes included the demographic variables and perioperative parameters.The former included age, sex, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists class, prior abdominal surgery, distribution of tumors, and histopathologic stage; whereas the latter included length of incision, operative time, estimated blood loss, conversion rate, number of lymph nodes retrieved, postoperative pain score, time to return of bowel function, postoperative complications, duration of hospital stay, and total cost.RESULTS: One hundred sixteen patients with cancer of the right hemicolon (HALC=59, OC=57) were recruited.The 2 groups of patients were similar in age, sex distribution, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists class, and previous abdominal surgery.No significant difference was observed between the 2 groups in terms of distribution of tumors and the final histopathologic staging.HALC had a significantly shorter incision length and longer operative time than OC.Patients in the HALC group had significantly less operative blood loss, less pain and earlier passage of flatus after operation than those in the OC group.The number of lymph nodes recovered in the specimen and the overall postoperative complications was comparable in the 2 groups.The postoperative duration of hospital stay was significantly shorter in the HALC group, whereas the median overall costs in the HALC group were significantly higher than that in the OC group.CONCLUSIONS: The results from the present study demonstrate that the HALC is a valid surgical approach for cancer of the right hemicolon that retains the benefits of minimally invasive surgery.We believe that this technique is a safe, useful, and feasible method for patients with right-sided colonic cancer.If practiced more, it might be advocated as a ""bridge"" between traditional laparoscopic surgery and conventional open procedures.",1,1,0,0
27602968,"Microneedling Prior to Levulan PDT for the Treatment of Actinic Keratoses: A Split-Face, Blinded Trial.INTRODUCTION: Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) with topical Levulan is an approved and efficacious method for treating actinic keratoses.This therapy depends on the ability of the Levulan (delta amino levulinic acid) to penetrate the stratum corneum and enter the cells of the epidermis.Microneedling is an increasing popular cosmetic therapy in which an array of tiny needles is used to make holes in the epidermis and presumably induce a wound healing cascade that leads to cosmetic improvement of the skin.We were interested to know if prior microneedling would enhance the penetration of topical Levulan and thus enhance the PDT treatment, and if a cosmetic improvement beyond the PDT alone would be seen when it is used in conjunction with microneedling.<br/> METHODS: 20 patients each with at least 4 non hyperkeratotic AKs on each side of their face were enrolled.All patients were randomized to receive multiple passes with a microneedling device to (1/2) of their face, left or right, followed by application of Levulan to the entire face.The Levulan was allowed to incubate 1 hour followed by exposure to blue light (Blu U) for 1000 seconds.<br/> RESULTS: 19 patients completed the study with 4-month follow up.The mean percentage reduction in AKs was 89.3% on the microneedling side versus 69.5% on the PDT alone side, a significant difference.A physician's global cosmetic assessment was performed based on Canfield Visia photographs: 15 of the 19 patients had a noticeable improved cosmetic appearance on one side of the face versus the other, and in 13 of these patients the improved side was the microneedled side.<br/> DISCUSSION: Prior microneedling significantly enhances the effect of Levulan PDT.It also seems to provide a cosmetic benefit above and beyond the PDT alone.It was safe and well tolerated in this study.<br /><br /> <em>J Drugs Dermatol.</em> 2016;15(9):1072-1074.",0,0,0,0

31567943,"Effect of physical fitness on colorectal tumor development in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis.Although accumulated epidemiological evidence indicates that a good physical fitness level may prevent the development of sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC), few studies have examined the effect of physical fitness level on familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP).This cross-sectional study aimed to examine the relationship between physical fitness and CRC development in patients with FAP.A total of 119 patients (54 male; 65 female) with FAP, aged 17 to 73 years, underwent a step test to induce exercise stress.Predicted maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) was calculated for each patient by using heart rate as an index of physical fitness.The association of VO2max with the presence or absence of CRC and polyp diameter was examined.Patients with FAP were divided into 3 categories according to their VO2max (high, medium, and low).The association between maximum polyp size and VO2max among the patients with FAP without a history of colectomy was examined.The risk of CRC was significantly higher in the low VO2max group than in the high VO2max group (odds ratio = 4.07; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-16.26).The maximum polyp diameter was significantly negatively correlated with the VO2max among the patients with FAP without a history of colectomy (r = -.44, P = .01).In the multiple linear regression analysis, maximum polyp diameter was independently correlated with VO2max.Our results suggest a preventive association between physical fitness and CRC development or colorectal adenoma growth exists in patients with FAP.",0,0,0,0
23234763,"Adjuvant lapatinib for women with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer: a randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Worldwide, many patients with HER2-positive early stage breast cancer do not receive trastuzumab-the standard adjuvant treatment.We investigated the efficacy and safety of adjuvant lapatinib for patients with trastuzumab-naive HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer, started at any time after diagnosis.METHODS: This study was a placebo-controlled, multicentre, randomised phase 3 trial.Women outpatients from 405 [corrected] centres in 33 countries [corrected] with HER2-positive early-breast cancer who had previously received adjuvant chemotherapy but not trastuzumab were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive daily lapatinib (1500 mg) or daily placebo for 12 months.Randomisation was done with a computer-generated sequence, stratified by time since diagnosis, lymph node involvement at diagnosis, and tumour hormone-receptor status.Investigators, site staff, and patients were masked to treatment assignment.The primary endpoint was disease-free survival in the intention-to-treat population.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00374322.FINDINGS: Between August, 2006, and May, 2008, 3161 women were enrolled and 3147 were assigned to lapatinib (n=1571) or placebo (n=1576).After a median follow-up of 47.4 months (range 0.4-60.0) in the lapatinib group and 48.3 (0.7-61.3) in the placebo group, 210 (13%) disease-free survival events had occurred in the lapatinib group versus 264 (17%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.83, 95% CI 0.70-1.00; p=0.053).Central review of HER2 status showed that only 2490 (79%) of the randomised women were HER2-positive.157 (13%) of 1230 confirmed HER2-positive patients in the lapatinib group and in 208 (17%) of 1260 in the placebo group had a disease-free survival event (HR 0.82, 95% 0.67-1.00; p=0.04).Serious adverse events occurred in 99 (6%) of 1573 patients taking lapatinib and 77 (5%) of 1574 patients taking placebo, with higher incidences of grade 3-4 diarrhoea (97 [6%] vs nine [<1%]), rash (72 [5%] vs three [<1%]), and hepatobiliary disorders (36 [2%] vs one [<1%]).INTERPRETATION: Our data show that there was no significant difference in disease-free survival between groups when analysed in the intention-to-treat population.However, exploratory analyses restricted to patients who had HER2-positive disease confirmed by central fluorescence in-situ hybridisation review suggested marginal benefit with lapatinib in terms of disease-free survival.Thus lapatinib might be an option for women with HER2-positive breast cancer who do not or cannot receive adjuvant trastuzumab.FUNDING: GlaxoSmithKline.",1,1,1,1
31574097,"Community-based football in men with prostate cancer: 1-year follow-up on a pragmatic, multicentre randomised controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Physical exercise has been shown to be effective in relation to fatigue, aerobic fitness, and lower body strength in men with prostate cancer.However, research into the clinically relevant effects of interventions conducted in heterogeneous patient populations and in real-life clinical practice settings is warranted.METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a pragmatic, multicentre, parallel randomised controlled trial in 5 Danish urological departments.Recruitment began in May 2015, the first participant was randomised in June 2015, and the last participant was included in February 2017.In total, 214 men with prostate cancer were randomly assigned to either 6 months of free-of-charge football training twice weekly at a local club (football group [FG]) (n = 109) or usual care (usual care group [UG]) (n = 105), including brief information on physical activity recommendations at randomisation.Participants were on average 68.4 (SD 6.2) years old, 157 (73%) were retired, 87 (41%) were on castration-based treatment, 19 (9%) had received chemotherapy, and 41 (19%) had skeletal metastases at baseline.In this 1-year follow-up study, we evaluated the effects of community-based football training on the following outcomes: primary outcome, quality of life; secondary outcomes: continuation of football after 6 months, hip and lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD), mental health score, fat and lean body mass, and safety outcomes, i.e., fractures, falls, and hospital admissions.Intention to treat (ITT) and per protocol (PP) analyses were conducted.No statistically significant between-group difference was observed in change in prostate-cancer-specific quality of life (ITT: 1.9 points [95% CI -1.9 to 5.8], p = 0.325; PP: 3.6 points [95% CI -0.9 to 8.2], p = 0.119).A statistically significant between-group difference was observed in change in total hip BMD, in favour of FG (0.007 g/cm2 [95% CI 0.004 to 0.013], p = 0.037).No differences were observed in change in lumbar spine BMD or lean body mass.Among patients allocated to football, 59% chose to continue playing football after the end of the 6-month intervention period.At 1-year follow-up in the PP population, FG participants had more improvement on the Mental Component Summary (2.9 [95% CI 0.0 to 5.7], p = 0.048 points higher) than UG participants, as well as a greater loss of fat mass (-0.9 kg [95% CI -1.7 to -0.1], p = 0.029).There were no differences between groups in relation to fractures or falls.Hospital admissions were more frequent in UG compared to FG (33 versus 20; the odds ratio based on PP analysis was 0.34 for FG compared to UG).There were 3 deaths in FG and 4 in UG.Main limitations of the study were the physically active control group and assessment of physical activity by means of self-report.CONCLUSIONS: In this trial, participants allocated to football appeared to have improved hip BMD and fewer hospital admissions.Men who played football more than once a week for 1 year lost fat mass and reported improved mental health.Community-based football proved to be acceptable, even when club membership was not subsidised.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02430792.",1,1,0,0
24472479,"A planned, prospective comparison of short-term quality of life outcomes among older patients with breast cancer treated with standard chemotherapy in a randomized clinical trial vs. an observational study: CALGB #49907 and #369901.OBJECTIVES: Patients >/= 65 years old (""older"") are often not included in randomized clinical trials (RCT), but when they are, care in an RCT might improve quality of life (QoL).We conducted a prospective comparison of QoL among older women receiving standard chemotherapy from the same cooperative group physicians in an RCT vs. an observational study (""off-trial"").METHODS: Older women with invasive, non-metastatic breast cancer (n=150 RCT; 530 off-trial) were included.Linear mixed-effects models tested associations between chemotherapy on- vs. off-trial and changes in EORTC (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire) QoL scores over 24 months, controlling for pre-treatment QoL, age, education, tumor factors, comorbidity, and other covariates.RESULTS: Anthracycline regimens were used by 58% of women treated on-trial vs. 54% of those treated off-trial.Women in the RCT reported an adjusted mean increase of 13.7 points (95% CI 10.2, 17.1) in global QoL at 24 months (vs. mid-treatment), while women treated off-trial had only an adjusted improvement of 7.0 points (95% CI 3.5, 10.4; p=.007 for difference in mean changes).Women in the RCT had significantly greater improvement in emotional function than those treated off-trial, controlling for baseline; they also had greater reductions in therapy side effects and fatigue at 24 months than women off-trial, controlling for covariates.CONCLUSION: There may be different QoL trajectories for older women undergoing breast cancer chemotherapy on- vs. off-trial.If confirmed, the results suggest that the extra monitoring and communication within an RCT could provide the infrastructure for interventions to address symptoms and improve QoL for the growing older cancer population.",0,0,0,0
29445928,"Efficacy and safety of trastuzumab, lapatinib, and paclitaxel neoadjuvant treatment with or without prolonged exposure to anti-HER2 therapy, and with or without hormone therapy for HER2-positive primary breast cancer: a randomised, five-arm, multicentre, open-label phase II trial.BACKGROUND: Dual blockade of HER2 promises increased pathological complete response (pCR) rate compared with single blockade in the presence of chemotherapy for HER2-positive (+) primary breast cancer.Many questions remain regarding optimal duration of treatment and combination impact of endocrine therapy for luminal HER2 disease.METHODS: We designed a randomised phase II, five-arm study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lapatinib and trastuzumab (6 weeks) followed by lapatinib and trastuzumab plus weekly paclitaxel (12 weeks) with/without prolongation of anti-HER2 therapy prior to chemotherapy (18 vs. 6 weeks), and with/without endocrine therapy in patients with HER2+ and/or oestrogen receptor (ER)+ disease.The primary endpoint was comprehensive pCR (CpCR) rate.Among the secondary endpoints, pCR (yT0-isyN0) rate, safety, and clinical response were evaluated.RESULTS: In total, 215 patients were enrolled; 212 were included in the full analysis set (median age 53.0 years; tumour size = T2, 65%; and tumour spread = N0, 55%).CpCR was achieved in 101 (47.9%) patients and was significantly higher in ER- patients than in ER+ patients (ER- 63.0%, ER+ 36.1%; P = 0.0034).pCR with pN0 was achieved in 42.2% of patients (ER- 57.6%, ER+ 30.3%).No significant difference was observed in pCR rate between prolonged exposure groups and standard groups.Better clinical response outcomes were obtained in the prolongation phase of the anti-HER2 therapy.No surplus was detected in pCR rate by adding endocrine treatment.No major safety concern was recognised by prolonging the anti-HER2 treatment or adding endocrine therapy.CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed the therapeutic impact of lapatinib, trastuzumab, and paclitaxel therapy for each ER- and ER+ subgroup of HER2+ patients.Development of further strategies and tools is required, particularly for luminal HER2 disease.",1,1,1,1

27114605,"Response to Cetuximab With or Without Irinotecan in Patients With Refractory Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Harboring the KRAS G13D Mutation: Australasian Gastro-Intestinal Trials Group ICECREAM Study.PURPOSE: RAS mutations predict lack of response to epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody therapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), but preclinical studies and retrospective clinical data suggest that patients with tumors harboring the exon 2 KRAS G13D mutation may benefit from cetuximab.We aimed to assess cetuximab monotherapy and cetuximab plus irinotecan in patients with molecularly selected (G13D mutation) chemotherapy-refractory mCRC in a randomized phase II trial of this rare molecular subtype.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with chemotherapy-refractory KRAS G13D mutation-positive mCRC who had progressed within 6 months of irinotecan therapy were randomly assigned to cetuximab 400 mg/m(2) loading dose and then 250 mg/m(2) once per week with or without irinotecan 180 mg/m(2) once every 2 weeks.The primary end point was 6-month progression-free survival; secondary end points were response rate, overall survival, quality of life, and toxicity.RESULTS: Fifty-one of 53 patients recruited over 2 years were eligible.The 6-month progression-free survival rate was 10% (95% CI, 2% to 26%) for cetuximab versus 23% (95% CI, 9% to 40%) for cetuximab plus irinotecan with a hazard ratio of 0.74 (95% CI, 0.42 to 1.32).Response and stable disease rates were 0% and 58% for monotherapy versus 9% and 70% for combination treatment, respectively.Overall survival and quality of life were similar; toxicities were higher with combination therapy.CONCLUSION: In patients with G13D-mutated chemotherapy-refractory mCRC, there was no statistically significant improvement in disease control at 6 months with either cetuximab monotherapy or cetuximab plus irinotecan.No responses were seen with single-agent cetuximab.The responses observed with the combination of cetuximab and irinotecan may reflect true drug synergy or persistent irinotecan sensitivity.The ICECREAM (Irinotecan Cetuximab Evaluation and Cetuximab Response Evaluation Among Patients with a G13D Mutation) study demonstrates the need to prospectively evaluate hypotheses that were previously supported by retrospective analyses and exemplifies the value of international collaboration in trials of rare molecular subtypes.",1,1,1,1
26878247,"Dual-focus versus conventional magnification endoscopy for the diagnosis of superficial squamous neoplasms in the pharynx and esophagus: a randomized trial.BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Conventional magnification narrow-band imaging (CM-NBI) endoscopy has demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy for superficial squamous neoplasms in the pharynx and esophagus.This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic utility of the newly developed dual-focus NBI (DF-NBI) compared with that of CM-NBI.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We recruited patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in the head and neck, or esophagus, or with a history of SCC.The primary endpoint of this prospective controlled non-inferiority trial was the sensitivity of DF-NBI and CM-NBI for detecting superficial carcinoma in the pharynx and esophagus.Secondary endpoints included other diagnostic values and the resolving power of each endoscope.Superficial carcinoma was defined as high grade dysplasia and SCC invading up to the submucosal layer.RESULTS: The study included 93 patients.A total of 28 superficial carcinomas were detected in the pharynx and esophagus.The sensitivities of DF-NBI and CM-NBI for superficial carcinoma were 82 % and 71 %, respectively.The lower limit of the 90 % confidence interval for the difference between the sensitivities exceeded the non-inferiority threshold.The specificity and overall accuracy of DF-NBI vs. CM-NBI were 93 % vs. 90 % and 91 % vs. 86 %, respectively (both non-significant differences).The maximum resolving power of a conventional magnification endoscope was significantly higher than a dual-focus endoscope (7.2 microm vs. 11.6 microm: P < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate the non-inferiority of DF-NBI versus CM-NBI in detecting superficial carcinoma in the pharynx and esophagus.DF-NBI appears to have a resolving power that, although significantly lower, is sufficient to achieve high diagnostic accuracy, comparable to that of CM-NBI.University Hospital Medical Information Network (UMIN, No. 000007585).",0,0,0,0
25683204,"Prostate cancer screening using risk stratification based on a multi-state model of genetic variants.BACKGROUND: Risk-stratified screening for prostate cancer (PCa) with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing incorporating genetic variants has received some attention but has been scarcely investigated.We developed a model to stratify the Finnish population by different risk profiles related to genetic variants to optimize the screening policy.METHODS: Data from the Finnish randomized controlled trial on screening for PCa with PSA testing were used to estimate a six-state Markov model of disease progression.Blood samples from Finnish men were used to assess the risk of PCa related to three genetic variants (rs4242382, rs138213197, and rs200331695).A risk score-based approach combined with a series of computer simulation models was applied to optimize individual screening policies.RESULTS: The 10-year risk of having progressive prostate cancer detected ranged from 43% in the top 5% risk group to approximately 11% in the bottom half of the population.Using the median group, with screening every four years beginning at 55 years-old, as the reference group, the recommended age beginning screening was approximately 47 years-old for the top 5% risk group and 55 years-old for those in the lower 60% risk group.The recommended interscreening interval has been shortened for individuals in the high risk group.The increased availability of genomic information allows the proposed multistate model to be more discriminating with respect to risk stratification and the suggested screening policy, particularly for the lowest risk groups-. -- CONCLUSIONS: A multi-state genetic variant-based model was developed for further application to population risk stratification to optimize the interscreening interval and the age at which to begin screening for PSA.A small sub-group of the population is likely to benefit from more intensive screening with early start and short interval, while half of the population is unlikely to benefit from such protocol (compared with four-year interval after age 55 years).",0,0,0,0
27589688,"Primary analysis of a prospective, randomized, single-blinded phase II trial evaluating the HER2 peptide GP2 vaccine in breast cancer patients to prevent recurrence.GP2 is a HER2-derived, HLA-A2+ restricted peptide.Phase I studies showed GP2 administered with GM-CSF to be safe and immunogenic.Here we report the primary analysis of a prospective, randomized, multicenter phase II adjuvant trial conducted to determine the vaccine's efficacy.The trial enrolled HLA-A2+, clinically disease-free, node-positive and high-risk node-negative breast cancer patients with tumors expressing HER2 (immunohistochemistry[IHC] 1+-3+).Patients were randomized to GP2+GM-CSF versus GM-CSF alone.Disease-free survival (DFS) was analyzed in intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-treatment cohorts; pre-specified subgroup analyses were performed for patients with IHC 3+ or FISH+ disease.The trial enrolled 180 patients; 89 received GP2+GM-CSF and 91 received GM-CSF alone.The groups were well-matched for clinicopathologic characteristics.Toxicities have been minimal.The Kaplan-Meier estimated 5-year DFS rate in the ITT analyses was 88% (95% CI:78-94%) in vaccinated vs. 81% (95% CI:69-89%) (P = 0.43) in control patients after a 34 month median follow-up.In the per-treatment analysis, the estimated 5-year DFS rates were 94% (95% CI:83-98%) and 85% (73-92%) (P = 0.17).In IHC 3+/FISH+ patients, the estimated 5-year DFS rate was 94% (82-98%) in vaccinated patients (n = 51) vs. 89% (71-96%) in control patients (n = 50), (P = 0.86) in the ITT analyses and 100% vs. 89% (71-96%) in vaccinated vs. control patients in the per-treatment analyses (P = 0.08).While the overall ITT analysis did not demonstrate benefit to vaccination, this trial confirmed that the GP2 vaccine is safe and suggests that vaccination may have clinical activity, particularly in patients with HER2 overexpression who received the full vaccine series (ie per-treatment group).",1,1,1,1
28352657,"Randomized, placebo-controlled window trial of EGFR, Src, or combined blockade in head and neck cancer.BACKGROUND.EGFR and Src family kinases are upregulated in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).EGFR interacts with Src to activate STAT3 signaling, and dual EGFR-Src targeting is synergistic in HNSCC preclinical models.pSrc overexpression predicted resistance to the EGFR inhibitor, erlotinib, in a prior window trial.We conducted a 4-arm window trial to identify biomarkers associated with response to EGFR and/or Src inhibition.METHODS.Patients with operable stage II-IVa HNSCC were randomized to 7-21 days of neoadjuvant erlotinib, the Src inhibitor dasatinib, the combination of both, or placebo.Paired tumor specimens were collected before and after treatment.Pharmacodynamic expression of EGFR and Src pathway components was evaluated by IHC of tissue microarrays and reverse-phase protein array of tissue lysates.Candidate biomarkers were assessed for correlation with change in tumor size.RESULTS.From April 2009 to December 2012, 58 patients were randomized and 55 were treated.There was a significant decrease in tumor size in both erlotinib arms (P = 0.0014); however, no effect was seen with dasatinib alone (P = 0.24).High baseline pMAPK expression was associated with response to erlotinib (P = 0.03).High baseline pSTAT3 was associated with resistance to dasatinib (P = 0.099).CONCLUSIONS.Brief exposure to erlotinib significantly decreased tumor size in operable HNSCC, with no additive effect from dasatinib.Baseline pMAPK expression warrants further study as a response biomarker for anti-EGFR therapy.Basal expression of pSTAT3 may be independent of Src, explain therapeutic resistance, and preclude development of dasatinib in biomarker-unselected cohorts.TRIAL REGISTRATION.NCT00779389.FUNDING.National Cancer Institute, American Cancer Society, Pennsylvania Department of Health, V Foundation for Cancer Research, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Astellas Pharma.",1,1,1,1

27220897,"Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography May Improve the Diagnostic Accuracy of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Localized Prostate Cancer.PURPOSE: Positron emission tomography using ligands targeting prostate specific membrane antigen has recently been introduced.Positron emission tomography imaging with (68)Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC has been shown to detect metastatic prostate cancer lesions at a high rate.In this study we compare multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and prostate specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography of the prostate with whole mount ex vivo prostate histopathology to determine the true sensitivity and specificity of these imaging modalities for detecting and locating tumor foci within the prostate.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a prospective clinical trial setting 20 patients with localized prostate cancer and a planned radical prostatectomy were recruited.All patients underwent multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography before surgery, and whole mount histopathology slides were directly compared to the images.European Society of Urogenital Radiology guidelines for reporting magnetic resonance imaging were used as a template for regional units of analysis.The uropathologist and radiologists were blinded to individual components of the study, and the final correlation was performed by visual and deformable registration analysis.RESULTS: A total of 50 clinically significant lesions were identified from the whole mount histopathological analysis.Based on regional analysis the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging were 44%, 94%, 81% and 76%, respectively.With prostate specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 49%, 95%, 85% and 88%, respectively.Prostate specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography yielded a higher specificity and positive predictive value.CONCLUSIONS: A significant proportion of cancers are potentially missed and underestimated by both imaging modalities.Prostate specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography may be used in addition to multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging to help improve local staging in those patients undergoing retropubic radical prostatectomy.",0,0,0,0
28797454,"Impact of early prophylactic feeding on long term tube dependency outcomes in patients with head and neck cancer.OBJECTIVES: Prophylactic gastrostomy tube (PGT) is frequently used in patients with head and neck cancer (HNSCC).There are concerns this leads to tube dependency but this phenomena is not well defined.This study aimed to determine whether early feeding via PGT impacted on longer term tube feeding outcomes.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with HNSCC with PGT were observed monthly post-treatment regarding tube use and time to removal up to twelve months.Patients were from a randomised controlled trial comparing an early feeding intervention via the PGT (n=57) versus usual care which commenced feeding when clinically indicated (n=67).RESULTS: Patient characteristics; male (88%), mean age 60+/-10.1years, oropharyngeal tumours (76%), receiving chemoradiotherapy (82%).Tubes were used by 87% (108/124) on completion of treatment and 66% (83/124) one month post.No differences in tube use between groups at any time point or tube removal rates over 12months (p=0.181).In patients free of disease (n=99), the intervention had higher tube use at 4months (p=0.003) and slower removal rates (p=0.047).Overall ten patients had their tube in-situ at 12months (8%) but five were awaiting removal (4% true dependency rate).Of the five patients legitimately using the tube, only one (<1%) was from severe dysphagia post definitive chemoradiotherapy.CONCLUSION: PGT use is high in the acute phase post-treatment.Encouraging early use may prolong time to tube removal but it does not increase long term dependency rates beyond four months post treatment.Monitoring tube use is important to prevent over-estimation of dependency rates.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial has been registered in the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials registry as ACTRN12612000579897.Available at http://www.anzctr.org.au.",1,1,0,0
24214881,"Vitamin D-binding protein, circulating vitamin D and risk of renal cell carcinoma.Cell culture experiments suggest that vitamin D may inhibit renal carcinogenesis, but human studies of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], the accepted measure of vitamin D status, and kidney cancer have been null.Limited research has examined the role of circulating vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) in the association between 25(OH)D and disease risk, and it is unclear whether free 25(OH)D in circulation is a better measure of effective exposure, or if DBP may independently impact outcomes.We conducted a nested case-control analysis within the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention (ATBC) Study to examine whether circulating DBP concentration was prospectively associated with risk of renal cell carcinoma, and whether it modified the association with 25(OH)D. Renal cell carcinoma cases (n = 262) were matched 1:1 to controls on age (+/-1 year) and date of blood collection (+/- 30 days).We estimated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of renal cell carcinoma risk by quartiles of 25(OH)D, DBP and the molar ratio of 25(OH)D:DBP, a proxy for free circulating 25(OH)D. Men with higher DBP concentrations were at significantly decreased risk of kidney cancer (Q4 vs. Q1: OR = 0.17, 95% CI = 0.08-0.33; p-trend < 0.0001), a finding unchanged by adjustment for 25(OH)D.

29864379,"Improvement in Overall Survival in a Randomized Study That Compared Dacomitinib With Gefitinib in Patients With Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer and EGFR-Activating Mutations.Purpose ARCHER 1050, a randomized, open-label, phase III study of dacomitinib versus gefitinib in treatment-naive patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and activating mutations in EGFR, reported significant improvement in progression-free survival with dacomitinib.The mature overall survival (OS) analysis for the intention-to-treat population is presented here.Patients and Methods In this multinational, multicenter study, patients age 18 years or older (>/= 20 years in Japan and Korea) who had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 and newly diagnosed NSCLC with activating mutations in EGFR (exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R) were enrolled and randomly assigned in a 1:1 manner to dacomitinib (n = 227) or gefitinib (n = 225).Random assignment was stratified by race (Japanese, Chinese, other East Asian, or non-Asian) and EGFR mutation type.The final OS analysis was conducted with a data cutoff date of February 17, 2017; at that time 220 deaths (48.7%) were observed.Results During a median follow-up time of 31.3 months, 103 (45.4%) and 117 (52.0%) deaths occurred in the dacomitinib and gefitinib arms, respectively.The estimated hazard ratio for OS was 0.760 (95% CI, 0.582 to 0.993; two-sided P = .044).The median OS was 34.1 months with dacomitinib versus 26.8 months with gefitinib.The OS probabilities at 30 months were 56.2% and 46.3% with dacomitinib and gefitinib, respectively.Preliminary subgroup analyses for OS that are based on baseline characteristics were consistent with the primary OS analysis.Conclusion In patients with advanced NSCLC and EGFR activating mutations, dacomitinib is the first second-generation epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) to show significant improvement in OS in a phase III randomized study compared with a standard-of-care TKI.Dacomitinib should be considered one of the standard treatment options for these patients.",1,1,1,1
29244528,"Phase III, Randomized Study of Dual Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) Blockade With Lapatinib Plus Trastuzumab in Combination With an Aromatase Inhibitor in Postmenopausal Women With HER2-Positive, Hormone Receptor-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer: ALTERNATIVE.Purpose Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) targeting plus endocrine therapy (ET) improved clinical benefit in HER2-positive, hormone receptor (HR)-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) versus ET alone.Dual HER2 blockade enhances clinical benefit versus single HER2 blockade.The ALTERNATIVE study evaluated the efficacy and safety of dual HER2 blockade plus aromatase inhibitor (AI) in postmenopausal women with HER2-positive/HR-positive MBC who received prior ET and prior neo(adjuvant)/first-line trastuzumab (TRAS) plus chemotherapy.Methods Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive lapatinib (LAP) + TRAS + AI, TRAS + AI, or LAP + AI.Patients for whom chemotherapy was intended were excluded.The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS; investigator assessed) with LAP + TRAS + AI versus TRAS + AI.Secondary end points were PFS (comparison of other arms), overall survival, overall response rate, clinical benefit rate, and safety.Results Three hundred fifty-five patients were included in this analysis: LAP + TRAS + AI (n = 120), TRAS + AI (n = 117), and LAP + AI (n = 118).Baseline characteristics were balanced.The study met its primary end point; superior PFS was observed with LAP + TRAS + AI versus TRAS + AI (median PFS, 11 v 5.7 months; hazard ratio, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.88; P = .0064).Consistent PFS benefit was observed in predefined subgroups.Overall response rate, clinical benefit rate, and overall survival also favored LAP + TRAS + AI.The median PFS with LAP + AI versus TRAS + AI was 8.3 versus 5.7 months (hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.98; P = .0361).Common adverse events (AEs; >/= 15%) with LAP + TRAS + AI, TRAS + AI, and LAP + AI were diarrhea (69%, 9%, and 51%, respectively), rash (36%, 2%, and 28%, respectively), nausea (22%, 9%, and 22%, respectively), and paronychia (30%, 0%, and 15%, respectively), mostly grade 1 or 2.Serious AEs were reported similarly across the three groups, and AEs leading to discontinuation were lower with LAP + TRAS + AI.Conclusion Dual HER2 blockade with LAP + TRAS + AI showed superior PFS benefit versus TRAS + AI in patients with HER2-positive/HR-positive MBC.This combination offers an effective and safe chemotherapy-sparing alternative treatment regimen for this patient population.",1,1,1,1
30150014,"Erlotinib versus vinorelbine plus cisplatin as adjuvant therapy in Chinese patients with stage IIIA EGFR mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (EVAN): a randomised, open-label, phase 2 trial.BACKGROUND: Adjuvant chemotherapy after radical resection of stage IIIA non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has quite poor outcomes.We aimed to investigate whether adjuvant erlotinib therapy improves 2-year disease-free survival compared with chemotherapy in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation-positive stage IIIA NSCLC.METHODS: In this randomised, open-label, phase 2 trial, eligible patients aged 18-75 years who had undergone complete (R0) resection of histologically or pathologically confirmed stage IIIA EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC and had not received any previous anticancer therapies were enrolled.Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either adjuvant erlotinib (150 mg once daily administered orally) or vinorelbine and cisplatin chemotherapy (four cycles of vinorelbine [25 mg/m(2) intravenously on days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle] plus cisplatin [75 mg/m(2) intravenously on day 1 of each 21-day cycle]).Randomisation was done by Simon's minimisation with a random element and was stratified by EGFR activating mutation type (exon 19 vs 21), histology (adenocarcinoma vs non-adenocarcinoma), and smoking status (smoker vs non-smoker).The primary endpoint in the unblinded intention-to-treat analysis was 2-year disease-free survival.This ongoing study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01683175.FINDINGS: Between Sept 8, 2012, and May 21, 2015, 102 patients from 16 centres across China were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive erlotinib (n=51) or chemotherapy (n=51).Median follow-up was 33.0 months (IQR 17.8-43.1).2-year disease-free survival was 81.4% (95% CI 69.6-93.1) in the erlotinib group and 44.6% (26.9-62.4) in the chemotherapy group (relative risk 1.823 [95% CI 1.194-2.784; p=0.0054).The difference in 2-year disease-free survival between the groups was 36.7% (95% CI 15.5-58.0; p=0.0007).Adverse events of any grade occurred in 29 (58%) of 50 patients in the erlotinib group and 28 (65%) of 43 patients in the chemotherapy group.Grade 3 or worse adverse events occurred in six (12%) of 50 patients in the erlotinib group versus 11 (26%) of 43 in the chemotherapy group; the most common of these in the erlotinib group was rash (in two [4%] of 50 patients) and in the chemotherapy group were decreased neutrophil count (in seven [16%] of 43 patients) and myelosuppression (in four [9%]).No treatment-related deaths were reported.INTERPRETATION: Adjuvant erlotinib improved 2-year disease-free survival in patients with EGFR mutation-positive stage IIIA NSCLC compared with chemotherapy, with a better tolerability profile.This study suggests that tyrosine kinase inhibitors could have a potentially important role as adjuvant therapy in EGFR mutation-positive stage IIIA NSCLC.However, this trial was a phase 2 study.Mature overall survival data are also needed.Ongoing studies will hopefully confirm the role of adjuvant EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy in patients with NSCLC.FUNDING: National Key Research and Development Program of China and Shanghai Roche Pharmaceuticals Ltd.",1,1,1,1
29573941,"Encorafenib plus binimetinib versus vemurafenib or encorafenib in patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma (COLUMBUS): a multicentre, open-label, randomised phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Combined BRAF-MEK inhibitor therapy is the standard of care for BRAF(V600)-mutant advanced melanoma.We investigated encorafenib, a BRAF inhibitor with unique target-binding properties, alone or in combination with the MEK inhibitor binimetinib, versus vemurafenib in patients with advanced BRAF(V600)-mutant melanoma.METHODS: COLUMBUS was conducted as a two-part, randomised, open-label phase 3 study at 162 hospitals in 28 countries.Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older and had histologically confirmed locally advanced (American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] stage IIIB, IIIC, or IV), unresectable or metastatic cutaneous melanoma, or unknown primary melanoma; a BRAF(V600E) or BRAF(V600K) mutation; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1; and were treatment naive or had progressed on or after previous first-line immunotherapy.In part 1 of the study, patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) via interactive response technology to receive either oral encorafenib 450 mg once daily plus oral binimetinib 45 mg twice daily (encorafenib plus binimetinib group), oral encorafenib 300 mg once daily (encorafenib group), or oral vemurafenib 960 mg twice daily (vemurafenib group).The primary endpoint was progression-free survival by blinded independent central review for encorafenib plus binimetinib versus vemurafenib.Efficacy analyses were by intention-to-treat.Safety was analysed in patients who received at least one dose of study drug and one postbaseline safety assessment.The results of part 2 will be published separately.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01909453, and EudraCT, number 2013-001176-38.FINDINGS: Between Dec 30, 2013, and April 10, 2015, 577 of 1345 screened patients were randomly assigned to either the encorafenib plus binimetinib group (n=192), the encorafenib group (n=194), or the vemurafenib group (n=191).With a median follow-up of 16.6 months (95% CI 14.8-16.9), median progression-free survival was 14.9 months (95% CI 11.0-18.5) in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group and 7.3 months (5.6-8.2) in the vemurafenib group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.54, 95% CI 0.41-0.71; two-sided p<0.0001).The most common grade 3-4 adverse events seen in more than 5% of patients in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group were increased gamma-glutamyltransferase (18 [9%] of 192 patients), increased creatine phosphokinase (13 [7%]), and hypertension (11 [6%]); in the encorafenib group they were palmoplantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (26 [14%] of 192 patients), myalgia (19 [10%]), and arthralgia (18 [9%]); and in the vemurafenib group it was arthralgia (11 [6%] of 186 patients).There were no treatment-related deaths except for one death in the combination group, which was considered possibly related to treatment by the investigator.INTERPRETATION: Encorafenib plus binimetinib and encorafenib monotherapy showed favourable efficacy compared with vemurafenib.Overall, encorafenib plus binimetinib appears to have an improved tolerability profile compared with encorafenib or vemurafenib.Encorafenib plus binimetinib could represent a new treatment option for patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma.FUNDING: Array BioPharma, Novartis.",1,1,1,1
29045554,"Veliparib with temozolomide or carboplatin/paclitaxel versus placebo with carboplatin/paclitaxel in patients with BRCA1/2 locally recurrent/metastatic breast cancer: randomized phase II study.Background: Homologous recombination defects in BRCA1/2-mutated tumors result in sensitivity to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors, which interfere with DNA damage repair.Veliparib, a potent poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor, enhanced the antitumor activity of platinum agents and temozolomide in early phase clinical trials.This phase II study examined the safety and efficacy of intermittent veliparib with carboplatin/paclitaxel (VCP) or temozolomide (VT) in patients with BRCA1/2-mutated breast cancer.Patients and methods: Eligible patients >/=18 years with locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer and a deleterious BRCA1/2 germline mutation were randomized 1 : 1 : 1 to VCP, VT, or placebo plus carboplatin/paclitaxel (PCP).Primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS); secondary end points included overall survival (OS) and overall response rate (ORR).Results: Of 290 randomized patients, 284 were BRCA+, confirmed by central laboratory.For VCP versus PCP, median PFS was 14.1 and 12.3 months, respectively [hazard ratio (HR) 0.789; 95% CI 0.536-1.162; P = 0.227], interim median OS 28.3 and 25.9 months (HR 0.750; 95% CI 0.503-1.117; P = 0.156), and ORR 77.8% and 61.3% (P = 0.027).For VT (versus PCP), median PFS was 7.4 months (HR 1.858; 95% CI 1.278-2.702; P = 0.001), interim median OS 19.1 months (HR 1.483; 95% CI 1.032-2.131; P = 0.032), and ORR 28.6% (P < 0.001).Safety profile was comparable between carboplatin/paclitaxel arms.Adverse events (all grades) of neutropenia, anemia, alopecia, and neuropathy were less frequent with VT versus PCP.Conclusion: Numerical but not statistically significant increases in both PFS and OS were observed in patients with BRCA1/2-mutated recurrent/metastatic breast cancer receiving VCP compared with PCP.The addition of veliparib to carboplatin/paclitaxel significantly improved ORR.There was no clinically meaningful increase in toxicity with VCP versus PCP.VT was inferior to PCP.An ongoing phase III trial is evaluating VCP versus PCP, with optional continuation single-agent therapy with veliparib/placebo if chemotherapy is discontinued without progression, in this patient population.Clinical trial information: NCT01506609.",1,1,1,1
23085153,"MAPPED study design: a 6 month randomised controlled study to evaluate the effect of dutasteride on prostate cancer volume using magnetic resonance imaging.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the percentage change in volume of prostate cancer, as assessed by T2-weighted MRI, following exposure to dutasteride (Avodart) 0.5mg daily for six months.PATIENTS AND METHODS: MRI in Primary Prostate cancer after Exposure to Dutasteride (MAPPED) is a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, supported by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK).Men with prostate cancer suitable for active surveillance (low-intermediate risk prostate cancer on biopsy), and a visible lesion on T2-weighted MRI of at least 0.2 cc, were eligible for consideration.Forty-two men were randomised to 6 months of daily dutasteride 0.5mg or placebo.Multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI) scans were performed at baseline, 3 and 6 months.The percentage changes in cancer volume over time will be compared between the dutasteride and placebo groups.Planned analyses will examine the association between tumour volume and characteristics (perfusion and contrast washout) as seen on mpMRI, HistoScan ultrasound and biopsy histopathology in both groups.DISCUSSION: MAPPED is the first randomised controlled trial to use mpMRI to look at the effect of dutasteride on the volume of prostate cancer.If dutasteride is shown to reduce the volume of prostate cancer, it might be considered as an adjunct for men on active surveillance.Analysis of the placebo arm will allow us to comment on the short-term natural variability of the MR appearance in men who are not receiving any treatment.CONCLUSION: MAPPED will evaluate the short-term effect of dutasteride on prostate cancer volume, as assessed by mpMRI, in men undergoing active surveillance for low or intermediate risk prostate cancer.The study completed recruitment in January 2012.",0,0,0,0
31750855,"Effect of Supplementation With Marine omega-3 Fatty Acid on Risk of Colorectal Adenomas and Serrated Polyps in the US General Population: A Prespecified Ancillary Study of a Randomized Clinical Trial.Importance: Marine omega-3 fatty acid has been suggested to protect against colorectal cancer.Objective: To assess the effect of daily marine omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on the risk of colorectal cancer precursors, including conventional adenomas and serrated polyps.Design, Setting, and Participants: This study was a prespecified ancillary study of the placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial VITAL (Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial).An intention-to-treat analysis was used to examine the effect of daily marine omega-3 supplements among 25871 adults in the US general population (including 5106 African American persons) free of cancer and cardiovascular disease at enrollment.Randomization was from November 2011 to March 2014, and intervention ended as planned on December 31, 2017.Interventions: Marine omega-3 fatty acid, 1 g daily (which included eicosapentaenoic acid, 460 mg, and docosahexaenoic acid, 380 mg) and vitamin D3 (2000 IU daily) supplements.Main Outcomes and Measures: Risk of conventional adenomas (including tubular adenoma, tubulovillous adenoma, villous adenoma, and adenoma with high-grade dysplasia) or serrated polyps (including hyperplastic polyp, traditional serrated adenoma, and sessile serrated polyp).In a subset of participants who reported receiving a diagnosis of polyp on follow-up questionnaires, endoscopic and pathologic records were obtained to confirm the diagnosis.Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were calculated using logistic regression, after adjusting for age, sex, vitamin D treatment assignment, and use of endoscopy.Secondary analyses were performed according to polyp features and participants' characteristics.Results: The demographic characteristics of participants at randomization were well balanced between the treatment and placebo groups; for example, 50.6% vs 50.5% were women, and 19.7% vs 19.8% were African American persons were included in each group.The mean (SD) age was 67.1 (7.1) years in the placebo group and 67.2 (7.1) in the omega-3 treatment group.During a median follow-up of 5.3 years (range, 3.8-6.1 years), 294 cases of conventional adenomas were documented in the omega-3 group and 301 in the control group (multivariable OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.83-1.15) (1:1 ratio between number of cases and number of participants).In addition, 174 cases of serrated polyps were documented in the omega-3 group and 167 in the control group (OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.84-1.29).Null associations were found for polyp subgroups according to size, location, multiplicity, or histology.In secondary analyses, marine omega-3 treatment appeared to be associated with lower risk of conventional adenomas among individuals with low plasma levels of omega-3 index at baseline (OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.57-1.02; P = .03 for interaction by omega-3 index).A beneficial association of supplementation was also noted in the African American population (OR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.35-1.00) but not in other racial/ethnic groups (P = .11 for interaction).Conclusions and Relevance: Supplementation with marine omega-3 fatty acids, 1 g per day, was not associated with reduced risk of colorectal cancer precursors.A potential benefit of this supplementation for individuals with low baseline omega-3 levels or for African American persons requires further confirmation.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01169259.",0,0,0,0

23463655,"Randomized clinical trial of vitamin D3 doses on prostatic vitamin D metabolite levels and ki67 labeling in prostate cancer patients.CONTEXT: Vitamin D3 might benefit prostate cancer (PCa) patients because prostate cells can locally synthesize the active hormone calcitriol.OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine the effects of oral vitamin D3 on vitamin D metabolites and PCa proliferative activity in prostate tissue.DESIGN AND SETTING: We conducted a double-blind randomized clinical trial at surgical oncology clinics in Toronto, Canada.PATIENTS: PCa patients (Gleason 6 or 7) participated in the study.Of 66 subjects who were enrolled, 63 completed the dosing protocol.INTERVENTION: Vitamin D3 (400, 10 000, or 40 000 IU/d) was orally administered before radical prostatectomy.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We evaluated vitamin D metabolite levels and Ki67 labeling in surgical prostate tissue.Safety measures, PTH, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were also assessed.RESULTS: Prostate tissue and serum levels of vitamin D metabolites, including calcitriol, increased dose dependently (P < .03) and were significantly higher in the 40 000-IU/d group than in every other dose group (P < .03).Prostate vitamin D metabolites correlated positively with serum levels (P < .0001).Ki67 measures did not differ significantly among vitamin D dose groups.However, cross-sectional analysis indicated that the calcitriol level attained in prostate was inversely associated with Ki67 intensity and Ki67 (3+) percent positive nuclei in PCa and benign tissue (P < .05).Safety measures did not change adversely with dosing.Compared with the 400-IU/d group, serum PTH and PSA were lower in the combined higher-dose groups at the end of the study (P < .02).CONCLUSIONS: Oral vitamin D3 raised prostate calcitriol levels (level 1 evidence) and modestly lowered both PSA and PTH.Although Ki67 expression did not differ among dose groups, its levels correlated inversely with prostate calcitriol.These suggestions of clinical benefit justify continued clinical research.",0,0,0,0
28188086,"Two intermittent vismodegib dosing regimens in patients with multiple basal-cell carcinomas (MIKIE): a randomised, regimen-controlled, double-blind, phase 2 trial.BACKGROUND: Vismodegib, a first-in-class Hedgehog-pathway inhibitor, is approved for use in adults with advanced basal-cell carcinoma.Patients with multiple basal-cell carcinomas, including those with basal-cell nevus (Gorlin) syndrome, need extended treatment.We assessed the safety and activity of two long-term intermittent vismodegib dosing regimens in patients with multiple basal-cell carcinomas.METHODS: In this randomised, regimen-controlled, double-blind, phase 2 trial, we enrolled adult patients with multiple basal-cell carcinomas, including those with basal-cell nevus syndrome, who had one or more histopathologically confirmed and at least six clinically evident basal-cell carcinomas.From a centralised randomisation schedule accessed via an interactive voice or web-based response system, patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to treatment group A (150 mg oral vismodegib per day for 12 weeks, then three rounds of 8 weeks of placebo daily followed by 12 weeks of 150 mg vismodegib daily) or treatment group B (150 mg oral vismodegib per day for 24 weeks, then three rounds of 8 weeks of placebo daily followed by 8 weeks of 150 mg vismodegib daily).Treatment assignment was stratified by diagnosis of basal-cell nevus syndrome, geographical region, and immunosuppression status.The primary endpoint was percentage reduction from baseline in the number of clinically evident basal-cell carcinomas at week 73.The primary analysis was by intention to treat.The safety population included all patients who received at least one dose of study drug.This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01815840, and the study is ongoing.FINDINGS: Between April 30, 2013, and April 9, 2014, 229 patients were randomly assigned treatment, 116 in treatment group A and 113 in treatment group B.

26971190,"Comparison of prostate cancer detection at 3-T MRI with and without an endorectal coil: A prospective, paired-patient study.OBJECTIVES: To compare the sensitivity of 2 different non-endorectal coil strategies vs. endorectal coil (ERC) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for detection of prostate cancer (PCa).METHODS: In this prospective, single-center, paired-patient, paired-reader study, 49 men with a clinical indication for MRI underwent non-ERC (phased-array coil only) T2-weighted imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging followed by the same sequences using both ERC and phased-array coils (ERC Protocol).Patients were randomized into 1 of 2 arms: standard non-ERC protocol and augmented non-ERC protocol.Lesions with Likert score>/=3 were defined as suspicious for cancer.Radical prostatectomy specimen or combined systematic plus targeted biopsies served as the standard of reference.Cancers were stratified into risk groups according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines.Generalized estimating equations with Bonferroni correction were used for comparisons.The level of reader confidence was inferred by the Likert scores assigned to index lesions.RESULTS: The ERC protocol provided sensitivity (78%) superior to MRI without ERC for PCa detection, both with a standard (43%) (P<0.0001) or augmented (60%) (P<0.01) protocol.The ERC MRI missed less-intermediate or high-risk index lesions (4%) than standard non-ERC (42%) (P = 0.02) and augmented non-ERC MRI (25%), although the latter did not reach significance (P = 0.09).The ERC improved radiologist confidence for the detection of PCa (average Likert score = 4.2+/-1.4) compared to standard (2.3+/-2.3) and augmented (2.9+/-2.1) non-ERC (P = 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: The use of combined ERC and pelvic phased-array coil for T2-weighted imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging provides superior sensitivity for the detection of PCa compared to an examination performed without the ERC.",0,0,0,0
28958502,"Dacomitinib versus gefitinib as first-line treatment for patients with EGFR-mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (ARCHER 1050): a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Dacomitinib is a second-generation, irreversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor.We compared its efficacy and safety with that of the reversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib in the first-line treatment of patients with advanced EGFR-mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).METHODS: In this international, multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3 study (ARCHER 1050), we enrolled adults (aged >/=18 years or >/=20 years in Japan and South Korea) with newly diagnosed advanced NSCLC and one EGFR mutation (exon 19 deletion or Leu858Arg) at 71 academic medical centres and university hospitals in seven countries or special administrative regions.We randomly assigned participants (1:1) to receive oral dacomitinib 45 mg/day (in 28-day cycles) or oral gefitinib 250 mg/day (in 28-day cycles) until disease progression or another discontinuation criterion was met.Randomisation, stratified by race and EGFR mutation type, was done with a computer-generated random code assigned by a central interactive web response system.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival assessed by masked independent review in the intention-to-treat population.Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01774721, and is ongoing but no longer recruiting patients.FINDINGS: Between May 9, 2013, and March 20, 2015, 452 eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive dacomitinib (n=227) or gefitinib (n=225).Median duration of follow-up for progression-free survival was 22.1 months (95% CI 20.3-23.9).Median progression-free survival according to masked independent review was 14.7 months (95% CI 11.1-16.6) in the dacomitinib group and 9.2 months (9.1-11.0) in the gefitinib group (hazard ratio 0.59, 95% CI 0.47-0.74; p<0.0001).The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were dermatitis acneiform (31 [14%] of 227 patients given dacomitinib vs none of 224 patients given gefitinib), diarrhoea (19 [8%] vs two [1%]), and raised alanine aminotransferase levels (two [1%] vs 19 [8%]).Treatment-related serious adverse events were reported in 21 (9%) patients given dacomitinib and in ten (4%) patients given gefitinib.Two treatment-related deaths occurred in the dacomitinib group (one related to untreated diarrhoea and one to untreated cholelithases/liver disease) and one in the gefitinib group (related to sigmoid colon diverticulitis/rupture complicated by pneumonia).INTERPRETATION: Dacomitinib significantly improved progression-free survival over gefitinib in first-line treatment of patients with EGFR-mutation-positive NSCLC and should be considered as a new treatment option for this population.FUNDING: SFJ Pharmaceuticals Group and Pfizer.",1,1,1,1
23218945,"Modifiable endoscopic factors that influence the adenoma detection rate in colorectal cancer screening colonoscopies.BACKGROUND: Adenoma detection rate (ADR) has become the most important quality indicator for colonoscopy.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate which modifiable factors, directly related to the endoscopic procedure, influenced the ADR in screening colonoscopies.DESIGN: Observational, nested study.SETTING: Multicenter, randomized, controlled trials.PATIENTS: Asymptomatic people aged 50 to 69 years were eligible for a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial designed to compare colonoscopy and fecal immunochemical testing in colorectal cancer screening.A total of 4539 individuals undergoing a direct screening colonoscopy were included in this study.INTERVENTION: Colonoscopy.MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Bowel cleansing, sedation, withdrawal time in normal colonoscopies, and cecal intubation were analyzed as possible predictors of adenoma detection by using logistic regression analysis, adjusted for age and sex.RESULTS: In multivariate analysis, after adjustment for age and sex, factors independently related to the ADR were a mean withdrawal time longer than 8 minutes (odds ratio [OR] 1.51; 95% CI, 1.17-1.96) in normal colonoscopies and split preparation (OR 1.26; 95% CI, 1.01-1.57).For advanced adenomas, only withdrawal time maintained statistical significance in the multivariate analysis.For proximal adenomas, withdrawal time and cecal intubation maintained independent statistical significance, whereas only withdrawal time longer than 8 minutes and a <10-hour period between the end of preparation and colonoscopy showed independent associations for distal adenomas.LIMITATIONS: Only endoscopic variables have been analyzed.CONCLUSION: Withdrawal time was the only modifiable factor related to the ADR in colorectal cancer screening colonoscopies associated with an increased detection rate of overall, advanced, proximal, and distal adenomas.",1,0,0,0
23429062,"Reproductive, lifestyle, and anthropometric risk factors for cancer in elderly women.BACKGROUND: With an increasing elderly population, the United States will experience an increased cancer burden in the coming years.We evaluated associations between anthropometric, lifestyle, and reproductive factors and risk of breast, ovarian, and colorectal cancer in a prospective study of postmenopausal women with a focus on diagnoses occurring among very elderly women (>/=75 years).METHODS: For each cancer type, we estimated associations with relevant exposures in 2 age bands (<75 vs. >/=75 years of age).During 22 years of follow-up, 322 ovarian, 1,311 colon, 315 rectal, and 2,664 breast cancers occurred among 37,459 postmenopausal women (mean age at baseline 62 years, range 55-71 years).RESULTS: For ovarian cancer, we identified few significant associations in either age band.Colon cancer cases had a higher body mass index and were less likely to report estrogen or aspirin use than non-cases, yet these associations were consistent in both age bands.Few risk factors were identified for rectal cancer in women of 75 years of age or more.For breast cancer, notably different patterns were revealed, with alcohol consumption associated with risk in the younger group and previous hysterectomy associated with risk only in the older group.CONCLUSION: These analyses suggest some important differences in risk factors for cancer depending on the age at diagnosis.IMPACT: This study suggests that etiologic differences may exist in cancers occurring in the very elderly women.The ongoing demographic shift in the United States provides a strong rationale for studies evaluating cancer etiology in the elderly.",0,0,0,0
22286332,"Upper limb progressive resistance training and stretching exercises following surgery for early breast cancer: a randomized controlled trial.The aim of this study was to determine whether an exercise program, commencing 4-6 weeks post-operatively, reduces upper limb impairments in women treated for early breast cancer.Women (n = 160) were randomized to either an 8-week exercise program (n = 81) or to a control group (n = 79) following stratification for axillary surgery.The exercise program comprised a weekly session and home program of passive stretching and progressive resistance training for shoulder muscles.The control group attended fortnightly assessments but no exercises were provided.The primary outcome was self-reported arm symptoms derived from the EORTC breast cancer-specific questionnaire (BR23), scored out of 100 with a low score indicative of fewer symptoms.The secondary outcomes included physical measures of shoulder range of motion, strength, and swelling (i.e., lymphedema).Women were assessed immediately following the intervention and at 6 months post-intervention.The change in symptoms from baseline was not significantly different between groups immediately following the intervention or at 6 m post-intervention.The between group difference immediately following the intervention was 4 (95% CI -1 to 9) and 6 months post-intervention was 4 (-2 to 10).However, the change in range of motion for flexion and abduction was significantly greater in the exercise group immediately following the intervention, as was change in shoulder abductor strength.In conclusion, a supervised exercise program provided some, albeit small, additional benefit at 6 months post-intervention to women who had been provided with written information and reminders to use their arm.Both the groups reported few impairments including swelling immediately following the intervention and 6 months post-intervention.Notably, resistance training in the post-operative period did not precipitate lymphedema.",0,0,0,0

29852043,"Effect of Adjuvant Trastuzumab for a Duration of 9 Weeks vs 1 Year With Concomitant Chemotherapy for Early Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2-Positive Breast Cancer: The SOLD Randomized Clinical Trial.Importance: Trastuzumab plus chemotherapy is the standard adjuvant treatment for patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive early breast cancer.While the standard duration of trastuzumab treatment is 12 months, the benefits and harms of trastuzumab continued beyond the chemotherapy are unclear.Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of adjuvant trastuzumab continued beyond chemotherapy in women treated with up-front chemotherapy containing a taxane and trastuzumab.Design, Setting, and Participants: Open-label, randomized (1:1) clinical trial including women with HER2-positive breast cancer.Chemotherapy was identical in the 2 groups, consisting of 3 cycles of 3-weekly docetaxel (either 80 or 100 mg/m2) plus trastuzumab for 9 weeks, followed by 3 cycles of fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide.Thereafter, no trastuzumab was administered in the 9-week group, whereas controls received trastuzumab to complete 1 year of administration.Disease-free survival (DFS) was compared between the groups using a Cox model and the noninferiority approach.The estimated sample size was 2168 patients (1-sided testing, with a relative noninferiority margin of 1.3).From January 3, 2008, to December 16, 2014, 2176 patients were accrued from 7 countries.Intervention: Docetaxel plus trastuzumab for 9 weeks, followed by 3 cycles of fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide in both groups.Controls continued trastuzumab to 1 year.Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary objective was DFS; secondary objectives included distant disease-free survival, overall survival, cardiac DFS, and safety.Results: In the 2174 women analyzed, median age was 56 (interquartile range [IQR], 48-64) years.The median follow-up was 5.2 (IQR, 3.8-6.7) years.Noninferiority of the 9-week treatment could not be demonstrated for DFS (hazard ratio, 1.39; 2-sided 90% CI, 1.12-1.72).Distant disease-free survival and overall survival did not differ substantially between the groups.Thirty-six (3%) and 21 (2%) patients in the 1-year and the 9-week groups, respectively, had cardiac failure; the left ventricle ejection fraction was better maintained in the 9-week group.An interaction was detected between the docetaxel dose and DFS; patients in the 9-week group treated with 80 mg/m2 had inferior and those treated with 100 mg/m2 had similar DFS as patients in the 1-year group.Conclusions and Relevance: Nine weeks of trastuzumab was not noninferior to 1 year of trastuzumab when given with similar chemotherapy.Cardiac safety was better in the 9-week group.The docetaxel dosing with trastuzumab requires further study.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00593697.",1,1,1,1
24661333,"Long-term tolerability and efficacy of degarelix: 5-year results from a phase III extension trial with a 1-arm crossover from leuprolide to degarelix.OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the safety and efficacy of up to 5 years of degarelix treatment and the effects of crossing over from leuprolide to degarelix in the extension phase of a phase III pivotal 1-year trial.METHODS: Patients receiving degarelix who completed the 1-year trial continued on 80 mg (n = 125) or 160 mg (n = 126) maintenance doses.Patients who received leuprolide were rerandomized to degarelix 240/80 mg (n = 69) or 240/160 mg (n = 65).Safety and tolerability were assessed (primary end point), as well as testosterone and prostate-specific antigen levels and prostate-specific antigen progression-free survival (secondary end points).RESULTS: Adverse event frequency was similar between both the groups.Adverse events included initial injection site reactions, hot flushes, and increased weight.Testosterone and prostate-specific antigen values during the extension study were similar to those seen during the 1-year trial in patients who continued on degarelix or crossed over from leuprolide.The prostate-specific antigen progression-free survival hazard rate was decreased significantly after the crossover in the leuprolide to degarelix group (from 0.20 to 0.09; P = .002), whereas in patients who continued on degarelix, the rate did not change significantly.In patients with baseline prostate-specific antigen >20 ng/mL, the same hazard rate change pattern was observed on crossover (from 0.38 to 0.19; P = .019).CONCLUSION: Degarelix was well tolerated; no safety concerns were identified.The significant prostate-specific antigen progression-free survival benefit established for degarelix over leuprolide during year 1 remained consistent at 5 years.",0,0,0,0
22488460,"Efficient identification and referral of low-income women at high risk for hereditary breast cancer: a practice-based approach.BACKGROUND: Identification of low-income women with the rare but serious risk of hereditary cancer and their referral to appropriate services presents an important public health challenge.We report the results of formative research to reach thousands of women for efficient identification of those at high risk and expedient access to free genetic services.External validity is maximized by emphasizing intervention fit with the two end-user organizations who must connect to make this possible.This study phase informed the design of a subsequent randomized controlled trial.METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled pilot study (n = 38) to compare two intervention models for feasibility and impact.The main outcome was receipt of genetic counseling during a two-month intervention period.Model 1 was based on the usual outcall protocol of an academic hospital genetic risk program, and Model 2 drew on the screening and referral procedures of a statewide toll-free phone line through which large numbers of high-risk women can be identified.In Model 1, the risk program proactively calls patients to schedule genetic counseling; for Model 2, women are notified of their eligibility for counseling and make the call themselves.We also developed and pretested a family history screener for administration by phone to identify women appropriate for genetic counseling.RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in receipt of genetic counseling between women randomized to Model 1 (3/18) compared with Model 2 (3/20) during the intervention period.However, when unresponsive women in Model 2 were called after 2 months, 7 more obtained counseling; 4 women from Model 1 were also counseled after the intervention.Thus, the intervention model that closely aligned with the risk program's outcall to high-risk women was found to be feasible and brought more low-income women to free genetic counseling.Our screener was easy to administer by phone and appeared to identify high-risk callers effectively.The model and screener are now in use in the main trial to test the effectiveness of this screening and referral intervention.A validation analysis of the screener is also underway.CONCLUSION: Identification of intervention strategies and tools, and their systematic comparison for impact and efficiency in the context where they will ultimately be usedare critical elements of practice-based research.",0,0,0,0
29573941,"Encorafenib plus binimetinib versus vemurafenib or encorafenib in patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma (COLUMBUS): a multicentre, open-label, randomised phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Combined BRAF-MEK inhibitor therapy is the standard of care for BRAF(V600)-mutant advanced melanoma.We investigated encorafenib, a BRAF inhibitor with unique target-binding properties, alone or in combination with the MEK inhibitor binimetinib, versus vemurafenib in patients with advanced BRAF(V600)-mutant melanoma.METHODS: COLUMBUS was conducted as a two-part, randomised, open-label phase 3 study at 162 hospitals in 28 countries.Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older and had histologically confirmed locally advanced (American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] stage IIIB, IIIC, or IV), unresectable or metastatic cutaneous melanoma, or unknown primary melanoma; a BRAF(V600E) or BRAF(V600K) mutation; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1; and were treatment naive or had progressed on or after previous first-line immunotherapy.In part 1 of the study, patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) via interactive response technology to receive either oral encorafenib 450 mg once daily plus oral binimetinib 45 mg twice daily (encorafenib plus binimetinib group), oral encorafenib 300 mg once daily (encorafenib group), or oral vemurafenib 960 mg twice daily (vemurafenib group).The primary endpoint was progression-free survival by blinded independent central review for encorafenib plus binimetinib versus vemurafenib.Efficacy analyses were by intention-to-treat.Safety was analysed in patients who received at least one dose of study drug and one postbaseline safety assessment.The results of part 2 will be published separately.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01909453, and EudraCT, number 2013-001176-38.FINDINGS: Between Dec 30, 2013, and April 10, 2015, 577 of 1345 screened patients were randomly assigned to either the encorafenib plus binimetinib group (n=192), the encorafenib group (n=194), or the vemurafenib group (n=191).With a median follow-up of 16.6 months (95% CI 14.8-16.9), median progression-free survival was 14.9 months (95% CI 11.0-18.5) in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group and 7.3 months (5.6-8.2) in the vemurafenib group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.54, 95% CI 0.41-0.71; two-sided p<0.0001).The most common grade 3-4 adverse events seen in more than 5% of patients in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group were increased gamma-glutamyltransferase (18 [9%] of 192 patients), increased creatine phosphokinase (13 [7%]), and hypertension (11 [6%]); in the encorafenib group they were palmoplantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (26 [14%] of 192 patients), myalgia (19 [10%]), and arthralgia (18 [9%]); and in the vemurafenib group it was arthralgia (11 [6%] of 186 patients).There were no treatment-related deaths except for one death in the combination group, which was considered possibly related to treatment by the investigator.INTERPRETATION: Encorafenib plus binimetinib and encorafenib monotherapy showed favourable efficacy compared with vemurafenib.Overall, encorafenib plus binimetinib appears to have an improved tolerability profile compared with encorafenib or vemurafenib.Encorafenib plus binimetinib could represent a new treatment option for patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma.FUNDING: Array BioPharma, Novartis.",1,1,1,1

28111430,"Incorporating Erlotinib or Irinotecan Plus Cisplatin into Chemoradiotherapy for Stage III Non-small Cell Lung Cancer According to EGFR Mutation Status.PURPOSE: Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) is the standard care for stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients; however, a more effective regimen is needed to improve the outcome by better controlling occult metastases.We conducted two parallel randomized phase II studies to incorporate erlotinib or irinotecan-cisplatin (IP) into CCRT for stage III NSCLC depending on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation status.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with EGFR-mutant tumors were randomized to receive three cycles of erlotinib first and then either CCRT with erlotinib followed by erlotinib (arm A) or CCRT with IP only (arm B).Patients with EGFR unknown or wild-type tumors were randomized to receive either three cycles of IP before (arm C) or after CCRT with IP (arm D).RESULTS: Seventy-three patients were screened and the study was closed early because of slow accrual after 59 patients were randomized.Overall, there were seven patients in arm A, five in arm B, 22 in arm C, and 25 in arm D. The response rate was 71.4% and 80.0% for arm A and B, and 70.0% and 73.9% for arm C and D. The median overall survival (OS) was 39.3 months versus 31.2 months for arm A and B (p=0.442), and 16.3 months versus 25.3 months for arm C and D (p=0.050).Patients with sensitive EGFR mutations had significantly longer OS than EGFR-wild patients (74.8 months vs. 25.3 months, p=0.034).There were no unexpected toxicities.CONCLUSION: Combined-modality treatment by molecular diagnostics is feasible in stage III NSCLC.EGFR-mutant patients appear to be a distinct subset with longer survival.",1,1,1,1
23053638,"A randomized phase II trial of platinum salts in basal-like breast cancer patients in the neoadjuvant setting. Results from the GEICAM/2006-03, multicenter study.Chemotherapy remains as the only systemic treatment option available for basal-like breast cancer (BC) patients.Preclinical models and several phase II studies suggested that platinum salts are active drugs in this BC subtype though there is no randomized study supporting this hypothesis.This study investigates if the addition of carboplatin to a combination of an alkylating agent together with anthracyclines and taxanes is able to increase the efficacy in the neoadjuvant treatment context.Patients with operable breast cancer and immunophenotypically defined basal-like disease (ER-/PR-/HER2- and cytokeratin 5/6+ or EGFR+) were recruited.Patients were randomized to receive EC (epirubicin 90 mg/m(2) plus cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2) for 4 cycles) followed either by D (docetaxel 100 mg/m(2) x 4 cycles; EC-D) or DCb (docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) plus carboplatin AUC 6 x 4 cycles; EC-DCb).The primary end point was pathological complete response (pCR) in the breast following the Miller and Payne criteria.Ninety-four patients were randomized (46 EC-D, 48 EC-DCb).pCR rate in the breast was seen in 16 patients (35 %) with EC-D and 14 patients (30 %) with EC-DCb (P value = 0.61).pCR in the breast and axilla was seen in 30 % of patients in both arms.The overall clinical response rate was 70 % (95 % CI 56-83) in the EC-D arm and 77 % (95 % CI 65-87) in the EC-DCb arm.Grade 3/4 toxicity was similar in both arms.The addition of carboplatin to conventional chemotherapy with EC-D in basal-like breast cancer patients did not improve the efficacy probably because they had already received an alkylating agent.These findings should be taken into consideration when developing new agents for this disease.",1,1,1,0

22960769,"Early initiation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist in polycystic ovarian syndrome patients undergoing assisted reproduction: randomized controlled trial ISRCTN69937179.PURPOSE: To compare the implantation rates in two groups of women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) after embryo transfer based on the initiation time of GnRH antagonist.Secondary outcome measures included clinical pregnancy, delivery and miscarriage rates.METHODS: This is a prospective, randomized trial in which 140 PCOS patients underwent ICSI, with 122 having ET performed.GnRH-antagonist was started on day 1 of stimulation in 69 patients (Group 1) or day 5 in 71 patients (Group 2).RESULTS: The overall implantation rate in Group 1 (46.2 %) was clinically higher than Group 2 (35.5 %), although not statistically significant (p = 0.075).For blastocysts transfer, the implantation rate in Group 1 was 55.1 %, compared to 40.4 % in Group 2 (p = 0.051).There was a clinically, but not statistically, higher clinical pregnancy rate (68.3 % vs. 56.5 %) and delivery rate (60.0 % vs. 53.2 %) per transfer in Group 1 compared to Group 2, respectively.There was a statistically significant lower biochemical pregnancy rate in Group 1 (2.4 %) compared to Group 2 (18.6 %) [p = 0.015].There was no difference in miscarriage rates between the two groups.CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that early initiation of GnRH antagonist on day 1 of ovarian stimulation in PCOS patients undergoing ICSI-ET may improve implantation rates, especially after blastocyst transfer.",0,0,0,0
23146280,"The prognostic and predictive value of mRNA expression of vascular endothelial growth factor family members in breast cancer: a study in primary tumors of high-risk early breast cancer patients participating in a randomized Hellenic Cooperative Oncology Group trial.INTRODUCTION: The main prognostic variables in early breast cancer are tumor size, histological grade, estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor (ER/PgR) status, number of positive nodes and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status.The present study evaluated the prognostic and/or predictive value of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family members in high-risk early breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant chemo-hormonotherapy.METHODS: RNA was isolated from 308 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded primary tumor samples from breast cancer patients enrolled in the HE10/97 trial, evaluating adjuvant dose-dense sequential chemotherapy with epirubicin followed by cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil (CMF) with or without paclitaxel (E-T-CMF versus E-CMF).A fully automated method based on magnetic beads was applied for RNA extraction, followed by one-step quantitative RT-PCR for mRNA analysis of VEGF-A, -B, -C and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) 1, 2, 3.RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 8 years, 109 patients (35%) developed a relapse and 80 patients (26%) died.In high VEGF-C and VEGFR1 mRNA expressing tumors, ER/PgR-negative tumors (Fisher's exact test, P = 0.001 and P = 0.021, respectively) and HER2-positive tumors (P <0.001 and P = 0.028, respectively) were more frequent than in low VEGF-C and VEGFR1 expressing tumors, respectively.From the VEGF family members evaluated, high VEGFR1 mRNA expression (above the 75th percentile) emerged as a significant negative prognostic factor for overall survival (OS; hazard ratio (HR) = 1.60, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01 to 2.55, Wald's P = 0.047) and disease-free survival (DFS; HR = 1.67, 95% CI: 1.13 to 2.48, P = 0.010), when adjusting for treatment group.High VEGF-C mRNA expression was predictive for benefit from adjuvant treatment with paclitaxel (E-T-CMF arm) for OS (test for interaction, Wald's P = 0.038), while in multivariate analysis the interaction of VEGF-C with taxane treatment was significant for both OS (Wald's P = 0.019) and DFS (P = 0.041) and continuous VEGF-B mRNA expression values for OS (P = 0.019).CONCLUSIONS: The present study reports, for the first time, that VEGF-C mRNA overexpression, as assessed by qRT-PCR, has a strong predictive value in high-risk early breast cancer patients undergoing adjuvant paclitaxel-containing treatment.Further studies are warranted to validate the prognostic and/or predictive value of VEGF-B, VEGF-C and VEGFR1 in patients treated with adjuvant therapies and to reveal which members of the VEGF family could possibly be useful markers in identifying patients who will benefit most from anti-VEGF strategies.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR) ACTRN12611000506998.",0,0,0,0
23340351,"A double-blind randomized trial of wound and intercostal space infiltration with ropivacaine during breast cancer surgery: effects on chronic postoperative pain.BACKGROUND: The efficacy of local anesthetic wound infiltration for the treatment of acute and chronic postoperative pain is controversial and there are no detailed studies.The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of ropivacaine wound infiltration on chronic pain after breast surgery.METHODS: In this prospective, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study, 236 patients scheduled for breast cancer surgery were randomized (1:1) to receive ropivacaine or placebo infiltration of the wound, the second and third intercostal spaces and the humeral insertion of major pectoralis.Acute pain, analgesic consumption, nausea and vomiting were assessed every 30 min for 2 h in the postanesthesia care unit and every 6 h for 48 h. Chronic pain was evaluated 3 months, 6 months, and 1 yr after surgery by the brief pain inventory, hospital anxiety and depression, and neuropathic pain questionnaires.RESULTS: Ropivacaine wound infiltration significantly decreased immediate postoperative pain for the first 90 min, but did not decrease chronic pain at 3 months (primary endpoint), or at 6 and 12 months postoperatively.At 3 months, the incidence of chronic pain was 33% and 27% (P = 0.37) in the ropivacaine and placebo groups, respectively.During follow-up, brief pain inventory, neuropathic pain, and anxiety increased over time in both groups (P < 0.001) while depression remained stable.No complications occurred.CONCLUSION: This multicenter, prospective study shows that ropivacaine wound infiltration after breast cancer surgery decreased immediate postoperative pain but did not decrease chronic pain at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively.",0,0,0,0
27830671,"Prolidase activity and oxidative stress in patients with breast carcinoma A prospective randomized case-controlled study.INTRODUCTION: Oxidative stress plays an important role in the pathogenesis of malign diseases.Prolidase is a member of the matrix metalloproteinase family, plays a major role in collagen metabolism, cell growth, and matrix remodeling.Elevated serum prolidase activity have beendemonstrated in several types of carcinoma.The aim of this study is to investigate the serum prolidase activity, total oxidant status (TOS), total antioxidant status (TAS) and to evaluate their relationship with tumor stage, lymph node metastasis, and tumor size in patients with breast carcinoma.METHODS: Thirty-five patients with breast carcinoma and forty healthy controls were enrolled to this study.Serum TAS, TOS levels, and prolidase activities were measured and oxidative stress indices (OSI) were calculated.RESULTS: TOS, OSI levels and prolidase activities were significantly higher in the patients with breast carcinoma compared to the control group (P < 0.001, P < 0.001, P = 0.002, respectively).TAS levels were significantly lower in the in the patients with breast carcinoma compared to the control group (P = 0.016).Positive correlations were found between prolidase activity, TOS, OSI levels and tumor stage, lymph node metastasis, and tumor size.A negative correlation was found between TAS levels and tumor size,hovewer there were no correlationsbetween tas levels and stage of the tumor,as well as lymph node infiltration.CONCLUSION: We conclude that elevatedserum prolidase activity and oxidative stress may be associated with breast carcinoma.Increased serum prolidase activity may be related to stage and prognosis of breast carcinoma.KEY WORDS: Breast carcinoma, Oxidative stress, Proline dipeptidase.",0,0,0,0

24654201,"Food or medicine: ethnic variations in perceptions of advanced cancer patients and their caregivers regarding artificial hydration during the last weeks of life.PURPOSE: To identify whether advanced cancer patients receiving home hospice care and their primary caregivers view artificial hydration (AH) as food or medicine, and the demographic and clinical factors influencing these perceptions.METHODS: Participants were enrolled in a randomised, double-blind controlled trial examining the efficacy of AH in cancer hospice patients.In-depth interviews at days 1 and 4 of study enrolment explored the meanings attributed to AH at the end of life.Responses to the question, 'Are these fluids more like food or more like medicine?' were categorised as 'food', 'medicine', 'both' or 'other'. chi(2) analyses were conducted with data from 122 interviews (54 patients and 68 caregivers) to identify differences between patients and caregivers, and by gender, age, ethnicity and caregiver relationship.Predictors of perceptions were identified using logistic regression analysis.RESULTS: Overall, 47 participants (38%) understood the fluids to be more like food, 41 (34%) as medicine, 17 (14%) as both, and 17 (14%)as 'other'. Ethnic minority participants (n=34, 66%) were significantly more likely than non-Hispanic European Americans (n=30, 42%) to view AH as food, or both as food and medicine (p=0.034).Ethnic differences persisted in the final regression model (OR 2.7; 95% CI 1.3 to 5.7, p=0.010).No significant differences were detected between patients and caregivers, or across gender, age, caregivers' relationship to the patients, group assignment, disease severity or cancer type.CONCLUSIONS: AH was perceived as food/nutrition by many cancer patients and caregivers in the study, particularly among ethnic minorities.This perception may lead to greater distress if fluids are discontinued or withheld.Asking patients/caregivers about their AH perceptions may enhance patient/provider communication and culturally appropriate end-of-life care.",0,0,0,0
25057173,"EGFR biomarkers predict benefit from vandetanib in combination with docetaxel in a randomized phase III study of second-line treatment of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.BACKGROUND: ZODIAC was a randomized phase III study of second-line treatment in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that evaluated the addition of vandetanib to docetaxel.The study showed a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival and objective response rate, but not in overall survival for unselected patients.This study evaluated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutation, copy number gain, and protein expression, and KRAS gene mutation, in pretreatment tumor samples as potential biomarkers predicting benefit from vandetanib as second-line treatment of NSCLC.PATIENTS AND METHODS: After progression following first-line chemotherapy, 1391 patients with locally advanced or metastatic (stage IIIB/IV) NSCLC were randomized 1 : 1 to receive vandetanib (100 mg/day) plus docetaxel (75 mg/m(2) every 21 days) or placebo plus docetaxel in the ZODIAC study.Archival tumor samples (n = 570) were collected from consenting patients (n = 958) for predefined, prospective biomarker analyses.RESULTS: Of evaluable samples, 14% were EGFR mutation positive, 35% were EGFR FISH positive, 88% were EGFR protein expression positive, and 13% were KRAS mutation positive.Compared with the overall study population, in which progression-free survival (PFS) [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.79] but not OS (HR = 0.91) were significantly improved with vandetanib, there was greater relative clinical benefit for patients with EGFR mutation-positive tumors [PFS HR 0.51, confidence interval (CI) 0.25-1.06 and OS HR 0.46, CI 0.14-1.57] and EGFR FISH-positive tumors (PFS HR 0.61, CI 0.39-0.94 and OS HR 0.48, CI 0.28-0.84).Similarly, patients with EGFR mutation or FISH-positive tumor samples who received vandetanib had an increased chance of objective tumor response (odds ratios 3.34, CI 0.8-13.89, and 3.90, CI 1.02-14.82, respectively).There did not appear to be benefit for vandetanib in patients with KRAS mutation-positive tumors.CONCLUSIONS: High EGFR gene copy number or activating EGFR mutations may identify patient subgroups who receive increased clinical benefit from vandetanib in combination with docetaxel in second-line NSCLC.CLINICALTRIALSGOV: NCT00312377.",1,1,1,1
31786279,"Second Cancers in Patients With Locally Advanced Prostate Cancer Randomized to Lifelong Endocrine Treatment With or Without Radical Radiation Therapy: Long-Term Follow-up of the Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group-7 Trial.BACKGROUND: Curative radiation therapy (RT) constitutes a cornerstone in prostate cancer (PC) treatment.We present long-term follow-up estimates for second cancer (SC) risk and overall survival (OS) in patients randomized to hormone therapy (ET) alone or combined with 70 Gy prostatic RT in the Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group-7 (SPCG-7) study.We explored the effect of salvage RT (>/=60 Gy to the ET group) and reported causes of death.METHODS AND MATERIALS: The SPCG-7 study (1996-2002) was a randomized controlled trial that included 875 men with locally advanced nonmetastatic PC.In this analysis, including data from the Norwegian and Swedish Cancer and Cause of Death registries for 651 Norwegian and 209 Swedish study patients, we estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for SC and death, and cumulative incidences of SC.RESULTS: Median follow-up of the 860 (431 ET and 429) ET + RT patients was 12.2 years for SC risk analysis and 12.6 years for the OS analysis.Eighty-three of the Norwegian ET patients received salvage RT, and median time to salvage RT was 5.9 years.We found 125 and 168 SCs in the ET and ET + RT patients, respectively.With ET alone as reference, ET + RT patients had an HR of 1.19 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.92-1.54) for all SCs and 2.54 (95% CI, 1.14-5.69) for urinary bladder cancer (UBC).The total number of UBC was 31 (23 in ET + RT; 8 in ET), and the vast majority (85%) were superficial.The HR for SC in salvage RT patients was 0.48 (95% CI, 0.24-0.94).Median OS was 12.8 (95% CI, 11.8-13.8) and 15.3 (95%, CI 14.3-16.4) years in the ET and ET + RT groups, respectively.Compared with ET alone, the risk of death was reduced in ET + RT patients (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.62-0.86) and in ET patients receiving salvage RT (HR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.30-0.65).CONCLUSIONS: Although the risk of UBC was increased in PC patients who received RT in addition to ET, this disadvantage is outweighed by the OS benefit of RT confirmed in our study.The risk of SC, and especially UBC, should be discussed with patients and be reflected in follow-up programs.",0,0,0,0
23335153,"Reducing the psychological distress of family caregivers of home-based palliative care patients: short-term effects from a randomised controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Palliative care is expected to incorporate comprehensive support for family caregivers given that many caregivers suffer psychological morbidity.However, systematically implemented evidence-based psychological support initiatives are lacking.AIM: The objective of this study was to prepare caregivers for the role of supporting a patient with advanced cancer receiving home-based palliative care by offering a one-to-one psycho-educational intervention.We hypothesised that primary family caregivers who participated in the intervention would report decreased psychological distress (primary outcome), fewer unmet needs and increased levels of perceived preparedness, competence and positive emotions.METHODS: A three-arm randomised controlled trial was conducted comparing two versions of the intervention (one face-to-face visit versus two visits) plus standard care to a control group (standard care) across four sites in Australia.RESULTS: A total of 298 participants were recruited; 148 were in the Control condition, 57 in Intervention 1 (one visit) and 93 in Intervention 2 (two visits).Relative to participants in the control group; the psychological well-being of participants in the intervention condition was improved by a small amount but non-significantly.No significant reduction in unmet needs or improvements in positive aspects of caregiving amongst the intervention group were identified.However, the intervention demonstrated significant improvements in participants' levels of preparedness and competence for Intervention 2.CONCLUSION/IMPLICATIONS: This research adds to accumulating body of evidence demonstrating that relatively short psycho-educational interventions can enable family caregivers to feel more prepared and competent in the role of supporting a dying relative.Further investigation is required to determine the longer term outcomes of such interventions.",0,0,0,0

28743247,"A randomized phase II study of paclitaxel alone versus paclitaxel plus sorafenib in second- and third-line treatment of patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer (PASO).BACKGROUND: We conducted an open-label, randomized, two-arm multi-center study to assess the efficacy and safety of paclitaxel versus paclitaxel + sorafenib in patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer.METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive either paclitaxel monotherapy (80 mg/m(2)) weekly (3 weeks on, 1 week off) plus sorafenib 400 mg orally, twice a day taken continuously throughout 28 day cycles.Sorafenib dose was gradually escalated from a starting dose of 200 mg twice a day.The primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS).RESULTS: A pre-planned efficacy interim analysis was performed on the data of 60 patients, 30 patients in each treatment arm.Median PFS was estimated at 6.6 months (95% CI: 5.1 to 9.0) in patients randomized to single-agent paclitaxel (Arm A) and 5.6 months (95% CI: 3.8 to 6.5) in patients randomized to paclitaxel-sorafenib combination (Arm B) therapy.Contrary to the hypothesis, the treatment effect was statistically significant in favor of paclitaxel monotherapy (hazard ratio 1.80, 95% CI: 1.02 to 3.20; log-rank test P = 0.0409).It was decided to stop the trial early for futility.Median OS was also in favor of Arm A (20.7 months (95% CI: 16.4 to 26.7) versus 12.1 months (95% CI: 5.8 to 20.4) in Arm B. Clinical control was achieved in 28 patients (93.3%) in Arm A and in 21 patients 70.0% in Arm B. Overall response rate was met in 43.3% of patients in Arm A and in 40.0% in Arm B. Toxicities were increased in Arm B with higher rates of diarrhea, nausea, neutropenia, hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) and anorexia, Grad 3 and 4 toxicities were rare.CONCLUSIONS: In this pre-planned interim analysis, paclitaxel-sorafenib combination therapy was not found to be superior to paclitaxel monotherapy with regard to the primary end point, progression-free survival.The trial was therefore discontinued early.There was no indication of more favorable outcomes for combination therapy in secondary efficacy end points.As expected, the safety and toxicity profile of the combination therapy was less favorable compared to monotherapy.Overall, this trial did not demonstrate that adding sorafenib to second- or third-line paclitaxel provides any clinical benefit to patients with HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer.Cautious dosing using a sorafenib ramp up schedule might have contributed to negative results.TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered at EudraCT (No 2009-018025-73) and retrospectively registered at Clinical trials.gov on March 17, 2011 ( NCT01320111 ).",1,1,1,1

30215676,"Alectinib versus crizotinib in treatment-naive anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive (ALK+) non-small-cell lung cancer: CNS efficacy results from the ALEX study.Background: The phase III ALEX study in patients with treatment-naive advanced anaplastic lymphoma kinase mutation-positive (ALK+) non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) met its primary end point of improved progression-free survival (PFS) with alectinib versus crizotinib.Here, we present detailed central nervous system (CNS) efficacy data from ALEX.Patients and methods: Overall, 303 patients aged >/=18 years underwent 1:1 randomization to receive twice-daily doses of alectinib 600 mg or crizotinib 250 mg.Brain imaging was conducted in all patients at baseline and every subsequent 8 weeks.End points (analyzed by subgroup: patients with/without baseline CNS metastases; patients with/without prior radiotherapy) included PFS, CNS objective response rate (ORR), and time to CNS progression.Results: In total, 122 patients had Independent Review Committee-assessed baseline CNS metastases (alectinib, n = 64; crizotinib, n = 58), 43 had measurable lesions (alectinib, n = 21; crizotinib, n = 22), and 46 had received prior radiotherapy (alectinib, n = 25; crizotinib, n = 21).Investigator-assessed PFS with alectinib was consistent between patients with baseline CNS metastases [hazard ratio (HR) 0.40, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.25-0.64] and those without (HR 0.51, 95% CI: 0.33-0.80, P interaction = 0.36).Similar results were seen in patients regardless of prior radiotherapy.Time to CNS progression was significantly longer with alectinib versus crizotinib and comparable between patients with and without baseline CNS metastases (P < 0.0001).CNS ORR was 85.7% with alectinib versus 71.4% with crizotinib in patients who received prior radiotherapy and 78.6% versus 40.0%, respectively, in those who had not.Conclusion: Alectinib demonstrated superior CNS activity and significantly delayed CNS progression versus crizotinib in patients with previously untreated, advanced ALK+ NSCLC, irrespective of prior CNS disease or radiotherapy.Clinical trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02075840.",1,1,1,1
29070044,"Neoadjuvant everolimus plus letrozole versus fluorouracil, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide for ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer: study protocol for a randomized pilot trial.BACKGROUND: The response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) varies by estrogen receptor (ER) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) statuses, with responses being lower in ER-positive, HER2-negative tumors as compared with ER-negative, HER2-positive or triple-negative tumors.Neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (NET) is an attractive alternative to NAC for ER-positive, HER2-negative cancer.However, a prior trial comparing NET with standard NAC in ER-positive tumor showed that the difference of response was not significant.Studies demonstrated that the mTOR inhibitor everolimus could sensitize breast tumors to endocrine therapy.A pilot open-label, randomized trial has been designed to evaluate the feasibility, efficacy and tolerability of neoadjuvant everolimus plus letrozole versus NAC in treating postmenopausal women with ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer.METHODS: Forty postmenopausal women with non-metastatic ER-positive, HER2-negative invasive breast cancer with a primary tumor > 2 cm or positive axillary lymph node(s) proved by biopsy will be randomly (1:1) enrolled from Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital to receive neoadjuvant everolimus plus letrozole for 18 weeks or fluorouracil, epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide (FEC) for six cycles before surgery.Primary outcome is the feasibility of the trial.Secondary outcome measures include ultrasound response rate, pathological complete response rate, breast-conserving surgery rate, toxicities, and changes in the percentages of peripheral blood CD4(+) T cells, CD8(+) T cells, T helper cells, regulatory T cells, and NK cells.DISCUSSION: This is the first study to determine the feasibility, efficacy and tolerability of head-to-head neoadjuvant everolimus plus letrozole versus neoadjuvant FEC in treating postmenopausal women with ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer.The trial will provide evidence to assess the feasibility of a future multicenter, randomized controlled trial, and will provide valuable clinical data of the immunoregulatory effect of everolimus in breast cancer.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov registry, ID: NCT02742051 .Registered on 7 April 2016.",1,1,1,1
29327085,"Acceptance and commitment therapy for symptom interference in metastatic breast cancer patients: a pilot randomized trial.PURPOSE: Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality in women worldwide.With medical advances, metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients often live for years with many symptoms that interfere with activities.However, there is a paucity of efficacious interventions to address symptom-related suffering and functional interference.Thus, this study examined the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of telephone-based acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) for symptom interference with functioning in MBC patients.METHODS: Symptomatic MBC patients (N = 47) were randomly assigned to six telephone sessions of ACT or six telephone sessions of education/support.Patients completed measures of symptom interference and measures assessing the severity of pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance, depressive symptoms, and anxiety.RESULTS: The eligibility screening rate (64%) and high retention (83% at 8 weeks post-baseline) demonstrated feasibility.When examining within-group change, ACT participants showed decreases in symptom interference (i.e., fatigue interference and sleep-related impairment; Cohen's d range = - 0.23 to - 0.31) at 8 and 12 weeks post-baseline, whereas education/support participants showed minimal change in these outcomes (d range = - 0.03 to 0.07).Additionally, at 12 weeks post-baseline, ACT participants showed moderate decreases in fatigue and sleep disturbance (both ds = - 0.43), whereas education/support participants showed small decreases in these outcomes (ds = - 0.24 and - 0.18 for fatigue and sleep disturbance, respectively).Both the ACT and education/support groups showed reductions in depressive symptoms (ds = - 0.27 and - 0.28) at 12 weeks post-baseline.Group differences in all outcomes were not statistically significant.CONCLUSIONS: ACT shows feasibility and promise in improving fatigue and sleep-related outcomes in MBC patients and warrants further investigation.",0,0,0,0
26386748,"The Comparative Impact of Mindfulness-Based Cancer Recovery (MBCR) and Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) on Sleep and Mindfulness in Cancer Patients.BACKGROUND: Insomnia is an important but often overlooked side effect of cancer.Dysfunctional sleep beliefs have been identified as an important perpetuating factor for insomnia.Mindfulness practice has been demonstrated to improve sleep quality but it is unknown whether these effects relate to changes in dysfunctional sleep beliefs.PURPOSE: This study is a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial comparing mindfulness-based cancer recovery (MBCR) to cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) in cancer patients with insomnia.This present analysis compares program impact on mindfulness, dysfunctional sleep beliefs, and insomnia severity clinical cutoffs.METHODS: Patients (MBCR, n = 32; CBT-I, n = 40) were assessed at baseline, post-program, and 3-month follow-up.RESULTS: Across both groups, patients showed improvements over time in acting with awareness (P = .021) and not judging experiences (P = .023).Changes in dysfunctional sleep beliefs produced by the CBT-I group exceeded those produced by MBCR at post-program and follow-up (P < .001).Acting with awareness, non-judging, and non-reacting were the facets of mindfulness associated with an overall reduction in dysfunctional sleep beliefs.There were no significant differences between the MBCR and CBT-I groups in the percentage of patients exceeding insomnia severity clinical cutoffs at post-program or follow-up.CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the use of both CBT-I and MBCR to reduce insomnia severity and suggests the development of mindfulness facets as a method of reducing dysfunctional sleep beliefs.",0,0,0,0
28209746,"A Phase II Randomized Trial (GO27827) of First-Line FOLFOX Plus Bevacizumab with or Without the MET Inhibitor Onartuzumab in Patients with Metastatic Colorectal Cancer.BACKGROUND: Dysregulated hepatocyte growth factor/mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) signaling is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to vascular endothelial growth factor inhibition in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).We report outcomes from a double-blind, multicenter phase II trial of the MET inhibitor onartuzumab in combination with mFOLFOX-6 and bevacizumab for mCRC (GO27827; NCT01418222).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive onartuzumab (10 mg/kg intravenously [IV]) or placebo plus mFOLFOX-6 and bevacizumab (5 mg/kg IV).Oxaliplatin was given for 8-12 cycles; other agents were continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or death.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) in the intent-to-treat (ITT) and MET immunohistochemistry (IHC) expression-positive populations.RESULTS: Between September 2011 and November 2012, 194 patients were enrolled.In September 2013, an interim analysis recommended stopping onartuzumab treatment due to lack of efficacy.At the time of the final analysis in February 2014, no significant improvement in PFS was seen with onartuzumab versus placebo in either the ITT or MET IHC-positive populations.An improvement in PFS was noted in the MET IHC-negative population.Neither overall survival nor response rate was improved with onartuzumab.The incidence of fatigue, peripheral edema, and deep vein thrombosis was increased with onartuzumab relative to placebo.CONCLUSION: Onartuzumab combined with mFOLFOX-6 and bevacizumab did not significantly improve efficacy outcomes in either the ITT or MET IHC-positive populations.MET expression by IHC was not a predictive biomarker in this setting.The Oncologist 2017;22:264-271 IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The addition of onartuzumab to mFOLFOX-6 plus bevacizumab did not improve outcomes in patients with previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer in this randomized, phase II study.Although initial results with onartuzumab were promising, a number of phase II/III clinical trials have reported a lack of improvement in efficacy with onartuzumab combined with standard-of-care therapies in several tumor types.Furthermore, negative study data have been published for rilotumumab and ficlatuzumab, both of which block hepatocyte growth factor binding to the mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) receptor.MET immunohistochemistry was not a predictive biomarker.It remains to be seen if other biomarkers or small molecule inhibitors may be more appropriate for inhibiting this oncogenic pathway.",1,1,1,1

30902613,"Updated Efficacy and Safety Data and Impact of the EML4-ALK Fusion Variant on the Efficacy of Alectinib in Untreated ALK-Positive Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer in the Global Phase III ALEX Study.INTRODUCTION: At the prior data cutoff (February 9, 2017) the ALEX trial showed superior investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) for alectinib versus crizotinib in untreated, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive, advanced NSCLC (hazard ratio = 0.47, 95% confidence interval: 0.34-0.65, p < 0.001).The median PFS in the alectinib arm was not reached versus 11.1 months with crizotinib.Retrospective analyses suggest that the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 gene-ALK variant (EML4-ALK) may influence ALK-inhibitor treatment benefit.We present updated analyses, including exploratory subgroup analysis by EML4-ALK variant, after an additional 10 months' follow-up (cutoff December 1, 2017).METHODS: Patients were randomized to receive twice-daily alectinib, 600 mg, or crizotinib, 250 mg, until disease progression, toxicity, death, or withdrawal.PFS was determined by the investigators.Baseline plasma and tissue biomarker samples were analyzed by using hybrid-capture, next-generation sequencing to determine EML4-ALK variant.RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were balanced.Investigator-assessed PFS was prolonged with alectinib (stratified hazard ratio = 0.43, 95% confidence interval: 0.32-0.58).The median PFS times were 34.8 months with alectinib and 10.9 months with crizotinib.EML4-ALK fusions were detectable in 129 patient plasma samples and 124 tissue samples; variants 1, 2, and 3/ab did not affect PFS, objective response rate, or duration of response.Investigator-assessed PFS was longer for alectinib than for crizotinib across EML4-ALK variants 1, 2, and 3a/b in plasma and tissue.Despite longer treatment duration (27.0 months in the case of alectinib versus 10.8 months in the case of crizotinib), the safety of alectinib compared favorably with that of crizotinib.CONCLUSION: Alectinib continues to demonstrate superior investigator-assessed PFS versus crizotinib in untreated ALK-positive NSCLC, irrespective of EML4-ALK variant.",1,1,1,1

28111430,"Incorporating Erlotinib or Irinotecan Plus Cisplatin into Chemoradiotherapy for Stage III Non-small Cell Lung Cancer According to EGFR Mutation Status.PURPOSE: Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) is the standard care for stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients; however, a more effective regimen is needed to improve the outcome by better controlling occult metastases.We conducted two parallel randomized phase II studies to incorporate erlotinib or irinotecan-cisplatin (IP) into CCRT for stage III NSCLC depending on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation status.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with EGFR-mutant tumors were randomized to receive three cycles of erlotinib first and then either CCRT with erlotinib followed by erlotinib (arm A) or CCRT with IP only (arm B).Patients with EGFR unknown or wild-type tumors were randomized to receive either three cycles of IP before (arm C) or after CCRT with IP (arm D).RESULTS: Seventy-three patients were screened and the study was closed early because of slow accrual after 59 patients were randomized.Overall, there were seven patients in arm A, five in arm B, 22 in arm C, and 25 in arm D. The response rate was 71.4% and 80.0% for arm A and B, and 70.0% and 73.9% for arm C and D. The median overall survival (OS) was 39.3 months versus 31.2 months for arm A and B (p=0.442), and 16.3 months versus 25.3 months for arm C and D (p=0.050).Patients with sensitive EGFR mutations had significantly longer OS than EGFR-wild patients (74.8 months vs. 25.3 months, p=0.034).There were no unexpected toxicities.CONCLUSION: Combined-modality treatment by molecular diagnostics is feasible in stage III NSCLC.EGFR-mutant patients appear to be a distinct subset with longer survival.",1,1,1,1
23017529,"Perioperative outcomes and oncologic efficacy from a pilot prospective randomized clinical trial of open versus robotic assisted radical cystectomy.PURPOSE: Robotic assisted laparoscopic radical cystectomy for bladder cancer has been reported with potential for improvement in perioperative morbidity compared to the open approach.However, most studies are retrospective with significant selection bias.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A pilot prospective randomized trial evaluating perioperative outcomes and oncologic efficacy of open vs robotic assisted laparoscopic radical cystectomy for consecutive patients was performed from July 2009 to June 2011.RESULTS: To date 47 patients have been randomized with data available on 40 patients for analysis.Each group was similar with regard to age, gender, race, body mass index and comorbidities, as well as previous surgeries, operative time, postoperative complications and final pathological stage.We observed no significant differences between oncologic outcomes of positive margins (5% each, p = 0.50) or number of lymph nodes removed for open radical cystectomy (23, IQR 15-28) vs robotic assisted laparoscopic radical cystectomy (11, IQR 8.75-21.5) groups (p = 0.135).The robotic assisted laparoscopic radical cystectomy group (400 ml, IQR 300-762.5) was noted to have decreased estimated blood loss compared to the open radical cystectomy group (800 ml, IQR 400-1,100) and trended toward a decreased rate of excessive length of stay (greater than 5 days) (65% vs 90%, p = 0.11) compared to the open radical cystectomy group.The robotic group also trended toward fewer transfusions (40% vs 50%, p = 0.26).CONCLUSIONS: Our study validates the concept of randomizing patients with bladder cancer undergoing radical cystectomy to an open or robotic approach.Our results suggest no significant differences in surrogates of oncologic efficacy.Robotic assisted laparoscopic radical cystectomy demonstrates potential benefits of decreased estimated blood loss and decreased hospital stay compared to open radical cystectomy.Our results need to be validated in a larger multicenter prospective randomized clinical trial.",1,1,0,0

24882434,"Olaparib maintenance therapy in patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed serous ovarian cancer: a preplanned retrospective analysis of outcomes by BRCA status in a randomised phase 2 trial.BACKGROUND: Maintenance monotherapy with the PARP inhibitor olaparib significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) versus placebo in patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent serous ovarian cancer.We aimed to explore the hypothesis that olaparib is most likely to benefit patients with a BRCA mutation.METHODS: We present data from the second interim analysis of overall survival and a retrospective, preplanned analysis of data by BRCA mutation status from our randomised, double-blind, phase 2 study that assessed maintenance treatment with olaparib 400 mg twice daily (capsules) versus placebo in patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent serous ovarian cancer who had received two or more platinum-based regimens and who had a partial or complete response to their most recent platinum-based regimen.Randomisation was by an interactive voice response system, stratified by time to progression on penultimate platinum-based regimen, response to the most recent platinum-based regimen before randomisation, and ethnic descent.The primary endpoint was PFS, analysed for the overall population and by BRCA status.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00753545.FINDINGS: Between Aug 28, 2008, and Feb 9, 2010, 136 patients were assigned to olaparib and 129 to placebo.BRCA status was known for 131 (96%) patients in the olaparib group versus 123 (95%) in the placebo group, of whom 74 (56%) versus 62 (50%) had a deleterious or suspected deleterious germline or tumour BRCA mutation.Of patients with a BRCA mutation, median PFS was significantly longer in the olaparib group than in the placebo group (11.2 months [95% CI 8.3-not calculable] vs 4.3 months [3.0-5.4]; HR 0.18 [0.10-0.31]; p<0.0001); similar findings were noted for patients with wild-type BRCA, although the difference between groups was lower (7.4 months [5.5-10.3] vs 5.5 months [3.7-5.6]; HR 0.54 [0.34-0.85]; p=0.0075).At the second interim analysis of overall survival (58% maturity), overall survival did not significantly differ between the groups (HR 0.88 [95% CI 0.64-1.21]; p=0.44); similar findings were noted for patients with mutated BRCA (HR 0.73 [0.45-1.17]; p=0.19) and wild-type BRCA (HR 0.99 [0.63-1.55]; p=0.96).The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events in the olaparib group were fatigue (in ten [7%] patients in the olaparib group vs four [3%] in the placebo group) and anaemia (seven [5%] vs one [<1%]).Serious adverse events were reported in 25 (18%) patients who received olaparib and 11 (9%) who received placebo.Tolerability was similar in patients with mutated BRCA and the overall population.INTERPRETATION: These results support the hypothesis that patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent serous ovarian cancer with a BRCA mutation have the greatest likelihood of benefiting from olaparib treatment.FUNDING: AstraZeneca.",1,1,1,1
24569327,"Botulinum toxin for prevention of delayed gastric emptying after esophagectomy.BACKGROUND: Esophageal cancer is among the most common gastrointestinal cancers for which the main treatment is surgery.This study was undertaken to analyze the results of Botox injection in preventing gastric stasis in these patients.PATIENTS AND METHODS: 60 patients with esophageal cancer in the middle and lower third parts were included in our study between 2010 and 2011, and were randomly divided into two groups.In group A, 30 patients underwent pyloroplasty, and in group B, injection of botulinum toxin into the pyloric sphincter muscle was used in 30 patients.RESULTS: The mean age of these patients was 61 +/- 10.7 years and the male/female ratio was 33:27.Isotope scans 3 weeks after surgery showed that 5 patients in group A and 3 in group B had delayed gastric emptying; there was no significant difference between the 2 groups, and the success rate of Botox injection was 90%.CONCLUSION: Considering the fact that there was no significant difference between pyloroplasty and Botox injection on gastric emptying after surgery, and given the need to use less-aggressive techniques and facilitate greater use of endoscopic methods, botulinum toxin injection may be used instead of pyloroplasty as a simple, effective, and complication-free method to prevent delayed gastric emptying.",0,0,0,0

27050431,"Memantine before Mastectomy Prevents Post-Surgery Pain: A Randomized, Blinded Clinical Trial in Surgical Patients.BACKGROUND: Neuropathic pain following surgical treatment for breast cancer with or without chemotherapy is a clinical burden and patients frequently report cognitive, emotional and quality of life impairment.A preclinical study recently showed that memantine administered before surgery may prevent neuropathic pain development and cognitive dysfunction.With a translational approach, a clinical trial has been carried out to evaluate whether memantine administered before and after mastectomy could prevent the development of neuropathic pain, the impairment of cognition and quality of life.METHOD: A randomized, pilot clinical trial included 40 women undergoing mastectomy in the Oncology Department, University Hospital, Clermont-Ferrand, France.Memantine (5 to 20 mg/day; n = 20) or placebo (n = 20) was administered for four weeks starting two weeks before surgery.The primary endpoint was pain intensity measured on a (0-10) numerical rating scale at three months post-mastectomy.RESULTS: Data analyses were performed using mixed models and the tests were two-sided, with a type I error set at alpha = 0.05.Compared with placebo, patients receiving memantine showed at three months a significant difference in post-mastectomy pain intensity, less rescue analgesia and a better emotional state.An improvement of pain symptoms induced by cancer chemotherapy was also reported.CONCLUSIONS: This study shows for the first time the beneficial effect of memantine to prevent post-mastectomy pain development and to diminish chemotherapy-induced pain symptoms.The lesser analgesic consumption and better well-being of patients for at least six months after treatment suggests that memantine could be an interesting therapeutic option to diminish the burden of breast cancer therapy.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01536314.",0,0,0,0
22614994,"Reach out to enhance wellness home-based diet-exercise intervention promotes reproducible and sustainable long-term improvements in health behaviors, body weight, and physical functioning in older, overweight/obese cancer survivors.PURPOSE: Diet and exercise interventions have been tested in cancer survivors as a means to reduce late effects and comorbidity, but few have assessed adherence and health outcomes long term.METHODS: Between July 2005 and May 2007, the Reach Out to Enhance Wellness (RENEW) trial accrued 641 locoregionally staged, long-term (>/= 5 years from diagnosis) colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer survivors in the United States (21 states), Canada, and the United Kingdom.All participants were sedentary (< 150 minutes of physical activity [PA] a week), overweight or obese (body mass index, 25 to 40 kg/m(2)), and over age 65 years.The trial tested a diet-exercise intervention delivered via mailed print materials and telephone counseling.RENEW used a wait-list control, cross-over design (ie, participants received the year-long intervention immediately or after a 1-year delay), which allowed the opportunity to assess program efficacy (previously reported primary outcome), durability, and reproducibility (reported herein).Measures included diet quality (DQ), PA, BMI, and physical function (PF).RESULTS: No significant relapse was observed in the immediate-intervention arm for DQ, PA, and BMI; however, rates of functional decline increased when the intervention ceased.From year 1 to year 2, significant improvements were observed in the delayed-intervention arm; mean change scores in behaviors and BMI and PF slopes were as follows: DQ score, 5.2 (95% CI, 3.4 to 7.0); PA, 45.8 min/wk (95% CI, 26.9 to 64.6 min/wk); BMI, -0.56 (95% CI, -0.75 to -0.36); and Short Form-36 PF, -1.02 versus -5.52 (P < .001 for all measures).Overall, both arms experienced significant improvements in DQ, PA, and BMI from baseline to 2-year follow-up (P < .001).CONCLUSION: Older cancer survivors respond favorably to lifestyle interventions and make durable changes in DQ and PA that contribute to sustained weight loss.These changes positively reorient functional decline trajectories during intervention delivery.",1,1,0,0
28816951,"Effect of therapeutic care for treating fatigue in patients with breast cancer receiving chemotherapy.BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of therapeutic care (TC) for fatigue in breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.METHODS: A total of 48 breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy were randomly divided into the intervention group and the control group, with 24 patients in each group.The patients in the intervention group were treated with TC, while the participants in the control group received the sham intervention.The interventions in both groups were for 30 min/d, 3 days weekly for 12 weeks.The primary outcome of fatigue was measured by the multidimensional fatigue inventory (MFI).The secondary outcomes were measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).All outcomes were assessed before and after 6 and 12 weeks of the intervention.RESULTS: The intervention with TC showed greater efficacy than sham TC in decreasing the MFI score after week 6 (P < .05) and week 12 (P < .01) of treatment.Significant differences were also found in the HADS and PSQI between the 2 groups after 12 weeks of treatment (P < .01).CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that TC might decrease fatigue and relieve the anxiety and depression of breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.",0,0,0,0
23650416,"Randomized phase II, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of exemestane with or without entinostat in postmenopausal women with locally recurrent or metastatic estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer progressing on treatment with a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor.PURPOSE: Entinostat is an oral isoform selective histone deacetylase inhibitor that targets resistance to hormonal therapies in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer.This randomized, placebo-controlled, phase II study evaluated entinostat combined with the aromatase inhibitor exemestane versus exemestane alone.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Postmenopausal women with ER+ advanced breast cancer progressing on a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor were randomly assigned to exemestane 25 mg daily plus entinostat 5 mg once per week (EE) or exemestane plus placebo (EP).The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS).Blood was collected in a subset of patients for evaluation of protein lysine acetylation as a biomarker of entinostat activity.RESULTS: One hundred thirty patients were randomly assigned (EE group, n = 64; EP group, n = 66).Based on intent-to-treat analysis, treatment with EE improved median PFS to 4.3 months versus 2.3 months with EP (hazard ratio [HR], 0.73; 95% CI, 0.50 to 1.07; one-sided P = .055; two-sided P = .11 [predefined significance level of .10, one-sided]).Median overall survival was an exploratory end point and improved to 28.1 months with EE versus 19.8 months with EP (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.97; P = .036).Fatigue and neutropenia were the most frequent grade 3/4 toxicities.Treatment discontinuation because of adverse events was higher in the EE group versus the EP group (11% v 2%).Protein lysine hyperacetylation in the EE biomarker subset was associated with prolonged PFS.CONCLUSION: Entinostat added to exemestane is generally well tolerated and demonstrated activity in patients with ER+ advanced breast cancer in this signal-finding phase II study.Acetylation changes may provide an opportunity to maximize clinical benefit with entinostat.Plans for a confirmatory study are underway.",1,1,1,1
25722381,"A randomized phase II study of the MEK1/MEK2 inhibitor trametinib (GSK1120212) compared with docetaxel in KRAS-mutant advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)dagger.BACKGROUND: KRAS mutations are detected in 25% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and no targeted therapies are approved for this subset population.Trametinib, a selective allosteric inhibitor of MEK1/MEK2, demonstrated preclinical and clinical activity in KRAS-mutant NSCLC.We report a phase II trial comparing trametinib with docetaxel in patients with advanced KRAS-mutant NSCLC.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients with histologically confirmed KRAS-mutant NSCLC previously treated with one prior platinum-based chemotherapy were randomly assigned in a ratio of 2 : 1 to trametinib (2 mg orally once daily) or docetaxel (75 mg/m(2) i.v.every 3 weeks).Crossover to the other arm after disease progression was allowed.Primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS).The study was prematurely terminated after the interim analysis of 92 PFS events, which showed the comparison of trametinib versus docetaxel for PFS crossed the futility boundary.RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-nine patients with KRAS-mutant NSCLC were randomized; of which, 86 patients received trametinib and 43 received docetaxel.Median PFS was 12 weeks in the trametinib arm and 11 weeks in the docetaxel arm (hazard ratio [HR] 1.14; 95% CI 0.75-1.75; P = 0.5197).Median overall survival, while the data are immature, was 8 months in the trametinib arm and was not reached in the docetaxel arm (HR 0.97; 95% CI 0.52-1.83; P = 0.934).There were 10 (12%) partial responses (PRs) in the trametinib arm and 5 (12%) PRs in the docetaxel arm (P = 1.0000).The most frequent adverse events (AEs) in >/=20% of trametinib patients were rash, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue.The most frequent grade 3 treatment-related AEs in the trametinib arm were hypertension, rash, diarrhea, and asthenia.CONCLUSION: Trametinib showed similar PFS and a response rate as docetaxel in patients with previously treated KRAS-mutant-positive NSCLC.CLINICALTRIALSGOV REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT01362296.",1,1,1,1
28209746,"A Phase II Randomized Trial (GO27827) of First-Line FOLFOX Plus Bevacizumab with or Without the MET Inhibitor Onartuzumab in Patients with Metastatic Colorectal Cancer.BACKGROUND: Dysregulated hepatocyte growth factor/mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) signaling is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to vascular endothelial growth factor inhibition in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).We report outcomes from a double-blind, multicenter phase II trial of the MET inhibitor onartuzumab in combination with mFOLFOX-6 and bevacizumab for mCRC (GO27827; NCT01418222).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive onartuzumab (10 mg/kg intravenously [IV]) or placebo plus mFOLFOX-6 and bevacizumab (5 mg/kg IV).Oxaliplatin was given for 8-12 cycles; other agents were continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or death.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) in the intent-to-treat (ITT) and MET immunohistochemistry (IHC) expression-positive populations.RESULTS: Between September 2011 and November 2012, 194 patients were enrolled.In September 2013, an interim analysis recommended stopping onartuzumab treatment due to lack of efficacy.At the time of the final analysis in February 2014, no significant improvement in PFS was seen with onartuzumab versus placebo in either the ITT or MET IHC-positive populations.An improvement in PFS was noted in the MET IHC-negative population.Neither overall survival nor response rate was improved with onartuzumab.The incidence of fatigue, peripheral edema, and deep vein thrombosis was increased with onartuzumab relative to placebo.CONCLUSION: Onartuzumab combined with mFOLFOX-6 and bevacizumab did not significantly improve efficacy outcomes in either the ITT or MET IHC-positive populations.MET expression by IHC was not a predictive biomarker in this setting.The Oncologist 2017;22:264-271 IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The addition of onartuzumab to mFOLFOX-6 plus bevacizumab did not improve outcomes in patients with previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer in this randomized, phase II study.Although initial results with onartuzumab were promising, a number of phase II/III clinical trials have reported a lack of improvement in efficacy with onartuzumab combined with standard-of-care therapies in several tumor types.Furthermore, negative study data have been published for rilotumumab and ficlatuzumab, both of which block hepatocyte growth factor binding to the mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) receptor.MET immunohistochemistry was not a predictive biomarker.It remains to be seen if other biomarkers or small molecule inhibitors may be more appropriate for inhibiting this oncogenic pathway.",1,1,1,1
26442791,"Shared Medical Decision Making in Lung Cancer Screening: Experienced versus Descriptive Risk Formats.BACKGROUND: Annual lung cancer screening using low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) scans is associated with a survival benefit, but it is also associated with potential harm.Unlike descriptive probability formats, experienced tasks have been shown to decrease perceptions of rare events.The objective of this study was to compare descriptive versus experienced probability formats on patients' knowledge, beliefs, endorsement of screening for heavy smokers, and preference (choice predisposition) to undergo screening.METHODS: A total of 276 patients attending an outpatient pulmonary practice were randomized to learn about screening using 1 of 3 formats: numbers only, numbers + icon arrays, numbers + a set of slides illustrating LDCT scans of 250 people in random order that displayed the number of normal scans, false-positive lung nodules, cancers found leading to a life saved, and cancers found leading to death despite treatment.RESULTS: Knowledge differed between the 3 formats (P= 0.001), with participants randomized to the numbers + icon array format having the highest knowledge score.Beliefs were more favorable among participants randomized to the numbers + experienced format compared with the numbers + icon array format (difference between means [95% confidence interval]= 1.6 [0.4-2.8]).Differences in participants' endorsement of screening (P= 0.4) and choice predisposition (P= 0.6) across probability format mirrored those of beliefs but were not statistically significant.DISCUSSION: Contrary to what we expected, the experienced format increased propensity toward screening compared with the numbers + icon array format, as indicated by more favorable beliefs and nonsignificant trends toward stronger choice predisposition and endorsement.Experienced risk formats may not be a practical approach to improve risk communication for patients deciding whether or not to undergo annual lung cancer screening.",0,0,0,0

31520215,"Inverse association between changes in energetic cost of walking and vertical accelerations in non-metastatic breast cancer survivors.PURPOSE: With accelerometry, the utility to detect changes in physical activity are predicated on the assumption that walking energetics and gait mechanics do not change.The present work examined associations between changes () in walking energetics, exercise self-efficacy, and several accelerometer-derived metrics.METHODS: Secondary analyses were performed among a sub-sample (n = 29) of breast cancer survivors participating in a larger randomized trial.During 4 min of treadmill walking (0.89 m s(-1), 0% grade), indirect calorimetry quantified steady-state energy expenditure (EE), wherein, participants were fitted with a heart rate monitor and hip-worn triaxial accelerometer.Exercise self-efficacy was measured using a 9-item questionnaire, while vector magnitude (VM) and individual planes (e.g., mediolateral, vertical, and anteroposterior) of the movement were extracted for data analyses.Evaluations were made at baseline and after 3 months.RESULTS: From baseline to 3 months, the energetic cost of walking (kcals min(-1)) significantly decreased by an average of - 5.1% (p = 0.001; d = 0.46).Conversely, VM significantly increased (p = 0.007; d = 0.53), exclusively due to greater vertical accelerations (acc) (+ 5.7 +/- 7.8 acc; p = 0.001; d = 0.69).Changes in vertical accelerations were inversely and positively associated with walking EE (r = - 0.37; p = 0.047) and exercise self-efficacy (r = 0.39; p = 0.034), respectively.CONCLUSION: Hip-worn accelerometers do not appear well-suited to correctly detect changes in ease of walking as evidenced by reduced energetic cost.Further research should determine if a divergence between measured EE and vertical accelerations could contribute to erroneous inferences in free-living physical activity.",0,0,0,0
29070044,"Neoadjuvant everolimus plus letrozole versus fluorouracil, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide for ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer: study protocol for a randomized pilot trial.BACKGROUND: The response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) varies by estrogen receptor (ER) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) statuses, with responses being lower in ER-positive, HER2-negative tumors as compared with ER-negative, HER2-positive or triple-negative tumors.Neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (NET) is an attractive alternative to NAC for ER-positive, HER2-negative cancer.However, a prior trial comparing NET with standard NAC in ER-positive tumor showed that the difference of response was not significant.Studies demonstrated that the mTOR inhibitor everolimus could sensitize breast tumors to endocrine therapy.A pilot open-label, randomized trial has been designed to evaluate the feasibility, efficacy and tolerability of neoadjuvant everolimus plus letrozole versus NAC in treating postmenopausal women with ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer.METHODS: Forty postmenopausal women with non-metastatic ER-positive, HER2-negative invasive breast cancer with a primary tumor > 2 cm or positive axillary lymph node(s) proved by biopsy will be randomly (1:1) enrolled from Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital to receive neoadjuvant everolimus plus letrozole for 18 weeks or fluorouracil, epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide (FEC) for six cycles before surgery.Primary outcome is the feasibility of the trial.Secondary outcome measures include ultrasound response rate, pathological complete response rate, breast-conserving surgery rate, toxicities, and changes in the percentages of peripheral blood CD4(+) T cells, CD8(+) T cells, T helper cells, regulatory T cells, and NK cells.DISCUSSION: This is the first study to determine the feasibility, efficacy and tolerability of head-to-head neoadjuvant everolimus plus letrozole versus neoadjuvant FEC in treating postmenopausal women with ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer.The trial will provide evidence to assess the feasibility of a future multicenter, randomized controlled trial, and will provide valuable clinical data of the immunoregulatory effect of everolimus in breast cancer.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov registry, ID: NCT02742051 .Registered on 7 April 2016.",1,1,1,1

27114605,"Response to Cetuximab With or Without Irinotecan in Patients With Refractory Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Harboring the KRAS G13D Mutation: Australasian Gastro-Intestinal Trials Group ICECREAM Study.PURPOSE: RAS mutations predict lack of response to epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody therapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), but preclinical studies and retrospective clinical data suggest that patients with tumors harboring the exon 2 KRAS G13D mutation may benefit from cetuximab.We aimed to assess cetuximab monotherapy and cetuximab plus irinotecan in patients with molecularly selected (G13D mutation) chemotherapy-refractory mCRC in a randomized phase II trial of this rare molecular subtype.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with chemotherapy-refractory KRAS G13D mutation-positive mCRC who had progressed within 6 months of irinotecan therapy were randomly assigned to cetuximab 400 mg/m(2) loading dose and then 250 mg/m(2) once per week with or without irinotecan 180 mg/m(2) once every 2 weeks.The primary end point was 6-month progression-free survival; secondary end points were response rate, overall survival, quality of life, and toxicity.RESULTS: Fifty-one of 53 patients recruited over 2 years were eligible.The 6-month progression-free survival rate was 10% (95% CI, 2% to 26%) for cetuximab versus 23% (95% CI, 9% to 40%) for cetuximab plus irinotecan with a hazard ratio of 0.74 (95% CI, 0.42 to 1.32).Response and stable disease rates were 0% and 58% for monotherapy versus 9% and 70% for combination treatment, respectively.Overall survival and quality of life were similar; toxicities were higher with combination therapy.CONCLUSION: In patients with G13D-mutated chemotherapy-refractory mCRC, there was no statistically significant improvement in disease control at 6 months with either cetuximab monotherapy or cetuximab plus irinotecan.No responses were seen with single-agent cetuximab.The responses observed with the combination of cetuximab and irinotecan may reflect true drug synergy or persistent irinotecan sensitivity.The ICECREAM (Irinotecan Cetuximab Evaluation and Cetuximab Response Evaluation Among Patients with a G13D Mutation) study demonstrates the need to prospectively evaluate hypotheses that were previously supported by retrospective analyses and exemplifies the value of international collaboration in trials of rare molecular subtypes.",1,1,1,1
26481741,"Does Early Postsurgical Temozolomide Plus Concomitant Radiochemotherapy Regimen Have Any Benefit in Newly-diagnosed Glioblastoma Patients? A Multi-center, Randomized, Parallel, Open-label, Phase II Clinical Trial.BACKGROUND: The radiochemotherapy regimen concomitantly employing temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy and radiotherapy (RT) 4 weeks after surgery, followed by 6 cycles of TMZ is a common treatment for glioblastoma (GBM).However, its median overall survival (OS) is only 14.6 months.This study was to explore the effectiveness and safety of early TMZ chemotherapy between surgery and chemoradiotherapy plus the standard concomitant radiochemotherapy regimen.METHODS: A randomized, parallel group, open-label study of 99 newly diagnosed GBM patients was conducted at 10 independent Chinese neurosurgical departments from June 2008 to June 2012.Patients were treated with concomitant radiochemotherapy regimen plus early postsurgical temozolomide (early TMZ group) or standard concomitant radiochemotherapy regimen (control group).Overall response was assessed based on objective tumor assessments, administration of corticosteroid and neurological status test.Hematological, biochemical, laboratory, adverse event (AE), and neurological condition were measured for 24 months of follow-up.The primary efficacy endpoint of this study was overall survival (OS).The secondary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS).RESULTS: The median OS time in the early TMZ group was 17.6 months, compared with 13.2 months in the control group (log-rank test P = 0.021).In addition, the OS rate in the early TMZ group was higher at 6, 12, and 18 months than in the control group, respectively (P < 0.05).The median PFS time was 8.7 months in the early TMZ group and 10.4 months in the control group (log-rank test P = 0.695).AEs occurred in 29 (55.8%) and 31(73.8%) patients respectively in early and control groups, including nausea (15.4% vs. 33.3%), vomiting (7.7% vs. 28.6%), fever (7.7% vs. 11.9%), and headache (3.8% vs. 23.8%).Only 30.8% and 33.3% were drug-related, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Addition of TMZ chemotherapy in the early break of the standard concomitant radiochemotherapy regimen was well tolerated and significantly improved the OS of the GBM patients, compared with standard concomitant radiochemotherapy regimen.However, a larger randomized trial is warranted to verify these results.",1,1,1,0
29413685,"PICCA study: panitumumab in combination with cisplatin/gemcitabine chemotherapy in KRAS wild-type patients with biliary cancer-a randomised biomarker-driven clinical phase II AIO study.BACKGROUND: Combination chemotherapy has shown benefit in the treatment of biliary cancer and further improvements might be achieved by the addition of a biological agent.We report here the effect of chemotherapy with the monoclonal EGFR antibody panitumumab as therapy for KRAS wild-type biliary cancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with advanced biliary tract cancer were randomised (2:1) to receive cisplatin 25 mg/m(2) and gemcitabine 1000 mg/m(2) on day 1 and day 8/q3w with (arm A) or without panitumumab (arm B; 9 mg/kg BW, i.v q3w).The primary end-point was the evaluation of progression-free survival (PFS) at 6 months.Secondary end-points included objective response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), and toxicity.In addition, a post hoc assessment of genetic alterations was performed.Finally, we performed a meta-analysis of trials with chemotherapy with and without EGFR antibodies.RESULTS: Sixty-two patients were randomised in arm A and 28 patients in arm B. Patients received 7 treatment cycles in median (1-35) with a median treatment duration of 4.7 months (141 days, 8-765).PFS rate at 6 months was 54% in patients treated with cisplatin/gemcitabine and panitumumab but was 73% in patients treated with cisplatin/gemcitabine without antibody, respectively.Secondary end-points were an ORR of 45% in treatment arm A compared with 39% receiving treatment B and a median OS of 12.8 months (arm A) and of 20.1 months (arm B), respectively.In contrast to the p53-status, genetic alterations in IDH1/2 were linked to a high response after chemotherapy and prolonged survival.In accordance with our results, the meta-analysis of 12 trials did not reveal a survival advantage for patients treated with EGFR antibodies compared with chemotherapy alone.CONCLUSIONS: Panitumumab in combination with chemotherapy does not improve ORR, PFS and OS in patients with KRAS wild-type, advanced biliary cancer.Genetic profiling should be included in CCA trials to identify and validate predictive and prognostic biomarkers.CLINICAL TRIALS NUMBER: The trial was registered with NCT01320254.",1,1,1,1

27434595,"TRAPEZE: a randomised controlled trial of the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of chemotherapy with zoledronic acid, strontium-89, or both, in men with bony metastatic castration-refractory prostate cancer.BACKGROUND: Bony metastatic castration-refractory prostate cancer is associated with a poor prognosis and high morbidity.TRAPEZE was a two-by-two factorial randomised controlled trial of zoledronic acid (ZA) and strontium-89 (Sr-89), each combined with docetaxel.All have palliative benefits, are used to control bone symptoms and are used with docetaxel to prolong survival.ZA, approved on the basis of reducing skeletal-related events (SREs), is commonly combined with docetaxel in practice, although evidence of efficacy and cost-effectiveness is lacking.Sr-89, approved for controlling metastatic pain and reducing need for subsequent bone treatments, is generally palliatively used in patients unfit for chemotherapy.Phase II analysis confirmed the safety and feasibility of combining these agents.TRAPEZE aimed to determine the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of each agent.METHODS: Patients were randomised to receive six cycles of docetaxel plus prednisolone: alone, with ZA, with a single Sr-89 dose after cycle 6, or with both.Primary outcomes were clinical progression-free survival (CPFS: time to pain progression, SRE or death) and cost-effectiveness.Secondary outcomes were SRE-free interval (SREFI), total SREs, overall survival (OS) and quality of life (QoL).Log-rank test and Cox regression modelling were used to determine clinical effectiveness.Cost-effectiveness was assessed from the NHS perspective and expressed as cost per additional quality-adjusted life-year (QALY).An additional analysis was carried out for ZA to reflect the availability of generic ZA.RESULTS: PATIENTS: 757 randomised (median age 68.7 years; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group scale score 0, 40%; 1, 52%; 2, 8%; prior radiotherapy, 45%); median prostate-specific antigen 143.78 ng/ml (interquartile range 50.8-353.9 ng/ml).Stratified log-rank analysis of CPFS was statistically non-significant for either agent (Sr-89, p = 0.11; ZA, p = 0.45).Cox regression analysis adjusted for stratification variables showed CPFS benefit for Sr-89 [hazard ratio (HR) 0.845, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 0.99; p = 0.036] and confirmed no effect of ZA (p = 0.46).ZA showed a significant SREFI effect (HR 0.76; 95% CI 0.63 to 0.93; p = 0.008).Neither agent affected OS (Sr-89, p = 0.74; ZA, p = 0.91), but both increased total cost (vs. no ZA and no Sr-89, respectively); decreased post-trial therapies partly offset costs [net difference: Sr-89 pound1341; proprietary ZA (Zometa((R)), East Hanover, NJ, USA) pound1319; generic ZA pound251].QoL was maintained in all trial arms; Sr-89 (0.08 additional QALYs) and ZA (0.03 additional QALYs) showed slight improvements.The resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for Sr-89 was pound16,590, with pound42,047 per QALY for Zometa and pound8005 per QALY for generic ZA.CONCLUSION: Strontium-89 improved CPFS, but not OS.ZA did not improve CPFS or OS but significantly improved SREFI, mostly post progression, suggesting a role as post-chemotherapy maintenance therapy.QoL was well maintained in all treatment arms, with differing patterns of care resulting from the effects of Sr-89 on time to progression and ZA on SREFI and total SREs.The addition of Sr-89 resulted in additional cost and a small positive increase in QALYs, with an ICER below the pound20,000 ceiling per QALY.The additional costs and small positive QALY changes in favour of ZA resulted in ICERs of pound42,047 (Zometa) and pound8005 for the generic alternative; thus, generic ZA represents a cost-effective option.Additional analyses on the basis of data from the Hospital Episode Statistics data set would allow corroborating the findings of this study.Further research into the use of ZA (and other bone-targeting therapies) with newer prostate cancer therapies would be desirable.STUDY REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN12808747.FUNDING: This project was funded by the NIHR Health Technology Assessment programme and will be published in full in Health Technology Assessment; Vol. 20, No. 53.See the NIHR Journals Library website for further project information.",0,0,0,0
30902613,"Updated Efficacy and Safety Data and Impact of the EML4-ALK Fusion Variant on the Efficacy of Alectinib in Untreated ALK-Positive Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer in the Global Phase III ALEX Study.INTRODUCTION: At the prior data cutoff (February 9, 2017) the ALEX trial showed superior investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) for alectinib versus crizotinib in untreated, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive, advanced NSCLC (hazard ratio = 0.47, 95% confidence interval: 0.34-0.65, p < 0.001).The median PFS in the alectinib arm was not reached versus 11.1 months with crizotinib.Retrospective analyses suggest that the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 gene-ALK variant (EML4-ALK) may influence ALK-inhibitor treatment benefit.We present updated analyses, including exploratory subgroup analysis by EML4-ALK variant, after an additional 10 months' follow-up (cutoff December 1, 2017).METHODS: Patients were randomized to receive twice-daily alectinib, 600 mg, or crizotinib, 250 mg, until disease progression, toxicity, death, or withdrawal.PFS was determined by the investigators.Baseline plasma and tissue biomarker samples were analyzed by using hybrid-capture, next-generation sequencing to determine EML4-ALK variant.RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were balanced.Investigator-assessed PFS was prolonged with alectinib (stratified hazard ratio = 0.43, 95% confidence interval: 0.32-0.58).The median PFS times were 34.8 months with alectinib and 10.9 months with crizotinib.EML4-ALK fusions were detectable in 129 patient plasma samples and 124 tissue samples; variants 1, 2, and 3/ab did not affect PFS, objective response rate, or duration of response.Investigator-assessed PFS was longer for alectinib than for crizotinib across EML4-ALK variants 1, 2, and 3a/b in plasma and tissue.Despite longer treatment duration (27.0 months in the case of alectinib versus 10.8 months in the case of crizotinib), the safety of alectinib compared favorably with that of crizotinib.CONCLUSION: Alectinib continues to demonstrate superior investigator-assessed PFS versus crizotinib in untreated ALK-positive NSCLC, irrespective of EML4-ALK variant.",1,1,1,1
22806147,"Island pedicle and bilobed flaps in ala and back nose reconstruction: a prospective comparative analysis.BACKGROUND: Reconstruction of face deformities resulting from skin cancer includes reconstructing the area with similar tissue.This prospective study aimed to compare the functional and aesthetic outcomes between two types of local flaps (the island pedicle flap vs the bilobed flap) used in reconstruction of the ala and back nose.METHODS: In this study, 120 patients with skin cancer of the nose underwent ala and back reconstruction: 60 patients using the island flap (IF group) and 60 patients using the bilobed flap (BF group).The two groups were homogeneous for sex, age, and anatomic area.Complications, scarring according to the scale of Vancouver, cosmetic appearance, and disorders of sensations were analyzed, and statistical analysis was performed using Chi-square and analysis of variance (ANOVA).RESULTS: Early complications were more common in the BF group than in the IF group (p < 0.005).The Vancouver Scar Scale scores were significantly better for the IF patients (p < 0,005), who also showed better results in the analysis of cosmetic outcomes (p < 0.005).CONCLUSION: The study showed that the island flap used for ala and back nose reconstruction provides better functional and cosmetic results than the bilobed flap, from both functional and aesthetic points of view.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE III: This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.",1,1,0,0
29445928,"Efficacy and safety of trastuzumab, lapatinib, and paclitaxel neoadjuvant treatment with or without prolonged exposure to anti-HER2 therapy, and with or without hormone therapy for HER2-positive primary breast cancer: a randomised, five-arm, multicentre, open-label phase II trial.BACKGROUND: Dual blockade of HER2 promises increased pathological complete response (pCR) rate compared with single blockade in the presence of chemotherapy for HER2-positive (+) primary breast cancer.Many questions remain regarding optimal duration of treatment and combination impact of endocrine therapy for luminal HER2 disease.METHODS: We designed a randomised phase II, five-arm study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lapatinib and trastuzumab (6 weeks) followed by lapatinib and trastuzumab plus weekly paclitaxel (12 weeks) with/without prolongation of anti-HER2 therapy prior to chemotherapy (18 vs. 6 weeks), and with/without endocrine therapy in patients with HER2+ and/or oestrogen receptor (ER)+ disease.The primary endpoint was comprehensive pCR (CpCR) rate.Among the secondary endpoints, pCR (yT0-isyN0) rate, safety, and clinical response were evaluated.RESULTS: In total, 215 patients were enrolled; 212 were included in the full analysis set (median age 53.0 years; tumour size = T2, 65%; and tumour spread = N0, 55%).CpCR was achieved in 101 (47.9%) patients and was significantly higher in ER- patients than in ER+ patients (ER- 63.0%, ER+ 36.1%; P = 0.0034).pCR with pN0 was achieved in 42.2% of patients (ER- 57.6%, ER+ 30.3%).No significant difference was observed in pCR rate between prolonged exposure groups and standard groups.Better clinical response outcomes were obtained in the prolongation phase of the anti-HER2 therapy.No surplus was detected in pCR rate by adding endocrine treatment.No major safety concern was recognised by prolonging the anti-HER2 treatment or adding endocrine therapy.CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed the therapeutic impact of lapatinib, trastuzumab, and paclitaxel therapy for each ER- and ER+ subgroup of HER2+ patients.Development of further strategies and tools is required, particularly for luminal HER2 disease.",1,1,1,1

PgR and Ki67 expression were significantly reduced with all treatments (means were -34% to -45%, and -75% to -85%, respectively; all P = 0.0001), with no differences between groups.CONCLUSIONS: In this short-term study, all treatments reduced ER expression, although F and F + A showed greater reductions than A. No significant differences were detected between the treatment groups in terms of PgR and Ki67 expression.No additional reduction in tumor biomarkers with combination treatment was observed, suggesting that F + A is unlikely to have further clinical benefit over F alone.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00259090.",1,1,1,1

26953983,"Pathologic Complete Response in Rectal Cancer: Can We Detect It? Lessons Learned From a Proposed Randomized Trial of Watch-and-Wait Treatment of Rectal Cancer.BACKGROUND: Chemoradiotherapy has the potential to downsize and downstage tumors before surgery, decrease locoregional recurrence, and induce a complete sterilization of tumor cells for middle and low locally advanced rectal cancer.A watch-and-wait tactic has been proposed for patients with clinical complete response.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to verify our ability to identify complete clinical response in patients with rectal cancer based on clinical and radiologic criteria.DESIGN: This was a prospective study.SETTINGS: The study was conducted at a single institution, in the setting of a watch-and-wait randomized trial.PATIENTS: Consecutive patients with stage T3 to T4N0M0 or T(any)N+M0 cancer located within 10 cm from anal verge or T2N0 within 7 cm from anal verge were included in the study.Patients were staged and restaged 8 weeks after completion of chemoradiation (5-fluorouracil, 5040 cGy) by digital examination, colonoscopy, pelvic MRI, and thorax and abdominal CT scans.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical and radiologic judgments of tumor response were compared with pathologic response of patients treated by total mesorectal excision or clinical follow-up of patients selected for nonoperative treatment.RESULTS: A total of 118 patients were treated.Six patients were considered clinic complete responders (2 randomly assigned for surgery (1 ypT0N0 and 1 ypT2N0) and 4 patients randomly assigned for observation (3 sustained clinic complete response and 1 had tumor regrowth)).The 112 clinic incomplete responders underwent total mesorectal excision, and 18 revealed pathologic complete response.These 18 patients were not considered complete responders at restaging because they presented at least 1 of the following conditions: mucosal ulceration and/or deformity and/or substenosis of rectal lumen at digital rectal examination and colonoscopy (n = 16), ymrT1 to T4 (n = 16), ymrN+ (n = 2), involvement of circumferential resection margin on MRI (n = 3), extramural vascular invasion on MRI (n = 4), MRI tumor response grade 2 to 4 (n = 15), and pelvic side wall lymph node involvement on MRI (n = 1).Sensitivity for identification of ypT0N0 or sustained clinic complete response was 18.2%.LIMITATIONS: This study has a short follow-up and small sample size.Radiologists who reviewed the restaging examination were not blinded to the pretreatment stage.Only 1 radiologist read the images of each patient.CONCLUSIONS: Evaluation of clinic complete response according to current adopted criteria has low sensitivity because pathologic complete response more frequently presented as clinic incomplete response (see Video, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/DCR/A221).",0,0,0,0

Investigator-assessed median progression-free survival was 9.2 months (95% CI, 7.4 to 15.6) and 12.9 months (95% CI, 11.1 to not reached) in arms A and B, respectively.Independent review committee-assessed intracranial ORR in patients with measurable brain metastases at baseline was 42% (11 of 26 patients) in arm A and 67% (12 of 18 patients) in arm B. Common treatment-emergent adverse events were nausea (arm A/B, 33%/40%), diarrhea (arm A/B, 19%/38%), headache (arm A/B, 28%/27%), and cough (arm A/B, 18%/34%), and were mainly grades 1 to 2.A subset of pulmonary adverse events with early onset (median onset: day 2) occurred in 14 of 219 treated patients (all grades, 6%; grade >/= 3, 3%); none occurred after escalation to 180 mg in arm B. Seven of 14 patients were successfully retreated with brigatinib.Conclusion Brigatinib yielded substantial whole-body and intracranial responses as well as robust progression-free survival; 180 mg (with lead-in) showed consistently better efficacy than 90 mg, with acceptable safety.",1,1,1,1
23650416,"Randomized phase II, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of exemestane with or without entinostat in postmenopausal women with locally recurrent or metastatic estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer progressing on treatment with a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor.PURPOSE: Entinostat is an oral isoform selective histone deacetylase inhibitor that targets resistance to hormonal therapies in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer.This randomized, placebo-controlled, phase II study evaluated entinostat combined with the aromatase inhibitor exemestane versus exemestane alone.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Postmenopausal women with ER+ advanced breast cancer progressing on a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor were randomly assigned to exemestane 25 mg daily plus entinostat 5 mg once per week (EE) or exemestane plus placebo (EP).The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS).Blood was collected in a subset of patients for evaluation of protein lysine acetylation as a biomarker of entinostat activity.RESULTS: One hundred thirty patients were randomly assigned (EE group, n = 64; EP group, n = 66).Based on intent-to-treat analysis, treatment with EE improved median PFS to 4.3 months versus 2.3 months with EP (hazard ratio [HR], 0.73; 95% CI, 0.50 to 1.07; one-sided P = .055; two-sided P = .11 [predefined significance level of .10, one-sided]).Median overall survival was an exploratory end point and improved to 28.1 months with EE versus 19.8 months with EP (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.97; P = .036).Fatigue and neutropenia were the most frequent grade 3/4 toxicities.Treatment discontinuation because of adverse events was higher in the EE group versus the EP group (11% v 2%).Protein lysine hyperacetylation in the EE biomarker subset was associated with prolonged PFS.CONCLUSION: Entinostat added to exemestane is generally well tolerated and demonstrated activity in patients with ER+ advanced breast cancer in this signal-finding phase II study.Acetylation changes may provide an opportunity to maximize clinical benefit with entinostat.Plans for a confirmatory study are underway.",1,1,1,1
27589688,"Primary analysis of a prospective, randomized, single-blinded phase II trial evaluating the HER2 peptide GP2 vaccine in breast cancer patients to prevent recurrence.GP2 is a HER2-derived, HLA-A2+ restricted peptide.Phase I studies showed GP2 administered with GM-CSF to be safe and immunogenic.Here we report the primary analysis of a prospective, randomized, multicenter phase II adjuvant trial conducted to determine the vaccine's efficacy.The trial enrolled HLA-A2+, clinically disease-free, node-positive and high-risk node-negative breast cancer patients with tumors expressing HER2 (immunohistochemistry[IHC] 1+-3+).Patients were randomized to GP2+GM-CSF versus GM-CSF alone.Disease-free survival (DFS) was analyzed in intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-treatment cohorts; pre-specified subgroup analyses were performed for patients with IHC 3+ or FISH+ disease.The trial enrolled 180 patients; 89 received GP2+GM-CSF and 91 received GM-CSF alone.The groups were well-matched for clinicopathologic characteristics.Toxicities have been minimal.The Kaplan-Meier estimated 5-year DFS rate in the ITT analyses was 88% (95% CI:78-94%) in vaccinated vs. 81% (95% CI:69-89%) (P = 0.43) in control patients after a 34 month median follow-up.In the per-treatment analysis, the estimated 5-year DFS rates were 94% (95% CI:83-98%) and 85% (73-92%) (P = 0.17).In IHC 3+/FISH+ patients, the estimated 5-year DFS rate was 94% (82-98%) in vaccinated patients (n = 51) vs. 89% (71-96%) in control patients (n = 50), (P = 0.86) in the ITT analyses and 100% vs. 89% (71-96%) in vaccinated vs. control patients in the per-treatment analyses (P = 0.08).While the overall ITT analysis did not demonstrate benefit to vaccination, this trial confirmed that the GP2 vaccine is safe and suggests that vaccination may have clinical activity, particularly in patients with HER2 overexpression who received the full vaccine series (ie per-treatment group).",1,1,1,1

29654415,"Health-related quality of life of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative advanced breast cancer treated with ribociclib + letrozole: results from MONALEESA-2.PURPOSE: Evaluate patient-reported outcomes (PROs) for postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) advanced breast cancer treated with first-line ribociclib plus letrozole.METHODS: In the phase III MONALEESA-2 study (NCT01958021), 668 patients were randomized 1:1 to ribociclib (600 mg/day; 3-weeks-on/1-week-off) plus letrozole (2.5 mg/day) or placebo plus letrozole.PROs were assessed using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer core quality-of-life (EORTC QLQ-C30) and breast cancer-specific (EORTC QLQ-BR23) questionnaires.Changes from baseline and time to deterioration in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) were analyzed using linear mixed-effect and stratified Cox regression models, respectively.Exploratory analysis of area-under-the-curve for change from baseline in pain score (AUC-pain) was performed.RESULTS: On-treatment HRQoL scores were consistently maintained from baseline and were similar between arms.A clinically meaningful (> 5 points) reduction in pain score was observed as early as Week 8 and was maintained up to Cycle 15 in the ribociclib arm.A statistically significant increase in mean AUC-pain was also observed in the ribociclib arm.Scores for all other EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-BR23 domains were maintained from baseline and were similar between arms.CONCLUSIONS: HRQoL was consistently maintained from baseline in postmenopausal women with HR+, HER2- advanced breast cancer receiving ribociclib plus letrozole and was similar to that observed in the placebo plus letrozole arm.Together with the improved clinical efficacy and manageable safety profile, these PRO results provide additional support for the benefit of ribociclib plus letrozole in this patient population.",1,1,1,1
28049139,"A randomized phase 2 study of MK-2206 versus everolimus in refractory renal cell carcinoma.Background: Activation of the phosphoinisitide-3 kinase (PI3K) pathway through mutation and constitutive upregulation has been described in renal cell carcinoma (RCC), making it an attractive target for therapeutic intervention.We performed a randomized phase II study in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy refractory patients to determine whether MK-2206, an allosteric inhibitor of AKT, was more efficacious than the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor everolimus.Patients and methods: A total of 43 patients were randomized in a 2:1 distribution, with 29 patients assigned to the MK-2206 arm and 14 to the everolimus arm.Progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary endpoint.Results: The trial was closed at the first futility analysis with an observed PFS of 3.68 months in the MK-2206 arm and 5.98 months in the everolimus arm.Dichotomous response rate profiles were seen in the MK-2206 arm with one complete response and three partial responses in the MK-2206 arm versus none in the everolimus arm.On the other hand, progressive disease was best response in 44.8% of MK2206 versus 14.3% of everolimus-treated patients.MK-2206 induced significantly more rash and pruritis than everolimus, and dose reduction occurred in 37.9% of MK-2206 versus 21.4% of everolimus-treated patients.Genomic analysis revealed that 57.1% of the patients in the PD group had either deleterious TP53 mutations or ATM mutations or deletions.In contrast, none of the patients in the non-PD group had TP53 or ATM defects.No predictive marker for response was observed in this small dataset.Conclusions: Dichotomous outcomes are observed when VEGF therapy refractory patients are treated with MK-2206, and MK-2206 does not demonstrate superiority to everolimus.Additionally, mutations in DNA repair genes are associated with early disease progression, indicating that dysregulation of DNA repair is associated with a more aggressive tumor phenotype in RCC.",1,1,1,1
25081390,"NY-ESO-1 specific antibody and cellular responses in melanoma patients primed with NY-ESO-1 protein in ISCOMATRIX and boosted with recombinant NY-ESO-1 fowlpox virus.Vaccination strategies based on repeated injections of NY-ESO-1 protein formulated in ISCOMATRIX particles (NY-ESO-1 ISCOMATRIX) have shown to elicit combined NY-ESO-1 specific antibody and T cell responses.However, it remains unclear whether heterologous prime-boost strategies based on the combination with NY-ESO-1 ISCOMATRIX with different NY-ESO-1 boosting reagents could be used to increase NY-ESO-1 CD8(+) or CD4(+) T cell responses.To address this question, we carried out a randomized clinical trial in 39 high-risk, resected melanoma patients vaccinated with NY-ESO-1 ISCOMATRIX, and then boosted with repeated injections of either recombinant fowlpox virus encoding full length NY-ESO-1 (rF-NY-ESO-1) (Arm A) or NY-ESO-1 ISCOMATRIX alone (Arm B).We have comprehensively analyzed NY-ESO-1 specific T cells and B cells response in all patients before and after vaccination for a total of seven time points per patient.NY-ESO-1 ISCOMATRIX alone elicited a strong NY-ESO-1 specific CD4(+) T cell and antibody response, which was maintained by both regiments at similar levels.However, CD8(+) T cell responses were significantly boosted in 3 out of 18 patients in Arm A after the first rF-NY-ESO-1 injection and such responses were maintained until the end of the trial, while no patients in Arm B showed similar CD8(+) T cell responses.In addition, our results clearly identified immunodominant regions in the NY-ESO-1 protein: NY-ESO-179-102 and NY-ESO-1115-138 for CD4+ T cells and NY-ESO-185-108 for CD8+ T cells in a large proportion of vaccinated patients.These regions of NY-ESO-1 protein should be considered in future clinical trials as immunodominant epitopes.",1,1,1,0

Patients received 7 treatment cycles in median (1-35) with a median treatment duration of 4.7 months (141 days, 8-765).PFS rate at 6 months was 54% in patients treated with cisplatin/gemcitabine and panitumumab but was 73% in patients treated with cisplatin/gemcitabine without antibody, respectively.Secondary end-points were an ORR of 45% in treatment arm A compared with 39% receiving treatment B and a median OS of 12.8 months (arm A) and of 20.1 months (arm B), respectively.In contrast to the p53-status, genetic alterations in IDH1/2 were linked to a high response after chemotherapy and prolonged survival.In accordance with our results, the meta-analysis of 12 trials did not reveal a survival advantage for patients treated with EGFR antibodies compared with chemotherapy alone.CONCLUSIONS: Panitumumab in combination with chemotherapy does not improve ORR, PFS and OS in patients with KRAS wild-type, advanced biliary cancer.Genetic profiling should be included in CCA trials to identify and validate predictive and prognostic biomarkers.CLINICAL TRIALS NUMBER: The trial was registered with NCT01320254.",1,1,1,1
29070044,"Neoadjuvant everolimus plus letrozole versus fluorouracil, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide for ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer: study protocol for a randomized pilot trial.BACKGROUND: The response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) varies by estrogen receptor (ER) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) statuses, with responses being lower in ER-positive, HER2-negative tumors as compared with ER-negative, HER2-positive or triple-negative tumors.Neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (NET) is an attractive alternative to NAC for ER-positive, HER2-negative cancer.However, a prior trial comparing NET with standard NAC in ER-positive tumor showed that the difference of response was not significant.Studies demonstrated that the mTOR inhibitor everolimus could sensitize breast tumors to endocrine therapy.A pilot open-label, randomized trial has been designed to evaluate the feasibility, efficacy and tolerability of neoadjuvant everolimus plus letrozole versus NAC in treating postmenopausal women with ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer.METHODS: Forty postmenopausal women with non-metastatic ER-positive, HER2-negative invasive breast cancer with a primary tumor > 2 cm or positive axillary lymph node(s) proved by biopsy will be randomly (1:1) enrolled from Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital to receive neoadjuvant everolimus plus letrozole for 18 weeks or fluorouracil, epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide (FEC) for six cycles before surgery.Primary outcome is the feasibility of the trial.Secondary outcome measures include ultrasound response rate, pathological complete response rate, breast-conserving surgery rate, toxicities, and changes in the percentages of peripheral blood CD4(+) T cells, CD8(+) T cells, T helper cells, regulatory T cells, and NK cells.DISCUSSION: This is the first study to determine the feasibility, efficacy and tolerability of head-to-head neoadjuvant everolimus plus letrozole versus neoadjuvant FEC in treating postmenopausal women with ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer.The trial will provide evidence to assess the feasibility of a future multicenter, randomized controlled trial, and will provide valuable clinical data of the immunoregulatory effect of everolimus in breast cancer.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov registry, ID: NCT02742051 .Registered on 7 April 2016.",1,1,1,1
25057173,"EGFR biomarkers predict benefit from vandetanib in combination with docetaxel in a randomized phase III study of second-line treatment of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.BACKGROUND: ZODIAC was a randomized phase III study of second-line treatment in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that evaluated the addition of vandetanib to docetaxel.The study showed a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival and objective response rate, but not in overall survival for unselected patients.This study evaluated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutation, copy number gain, and protein expression, and KRAS gene mutation, in pretreatment tumor samples as potential biomarkers predicting benefit from vandetanib as second-line treatment of NSCLC.PATIENTS AND METHODS: After progression following first-line chemotherapy, 1391 patients with locally advanced or metastatic (stage IIIB/IV) NSCLC were randomized 1 : 1 to receive vandetanib (100 mg/day) plus docetaxel (75 mg/m(2) every 21 days) or placebo plus docetaxel in the ZODIAC study.Archival tumor samples (n = 570) were collected from consenting patients (n = 958) for predefined, prospective biomarker analyses.RESULTS: Of evaluable samples, 14% were EGFR mutation positive, 35% were EGFR FISH positive, 88% were EGFR protein expression positive, and 13% were KRAS mutation positive.Compared with the overall study population, in which progression-free survival (PFS) [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.79] but not OS (HR = 0.91) were significantly improved with vandetanib, there was greater relative clinical benefit for patients with EGFR mutation-positive tumors [PFS HR 0.51, confidence interval (CI) 0.25-1.06 and OS HR 0.46, CI 0.14-1.57] and EGFR FISH-positive tumors (PFS HR 0.61, CI 0.39-0.94 and OS HR 0.48, CI 0.28-0.84).Similarly, patients with EGFR mutation or FISH-positive tumor samples who received vandetanib had an increased chance of objective tumor response (odds ratios 3.34, CI 0.8-13.89, and 3.90, CI 1.02-14.82, respectively).There did not appear to be benefit for vandetanib in patients with KRAS mutation-positive tumors.CONCLUSIONS: High EGFR gene copy number or activating EGFR mutations may identify patient subgroups who receive increased clinical benefit from vandetanib in combination with docetaxel in second-line NSCLC.CLINICALTRIALSGOV: NCT00312377.",1,1,1,1

29126244,"Impact of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy on health-related quality of life in long-term survivors of esophageal or junctional cancer: results from the randomized CROSS trial.Background: Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) plus surgery is a standard of care for patients with esophageal or junctional cancer, but the long-term impact of nCRT on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is unknown.The purpose of this study is to compare very long-term HRQOL in long-term survivors of esophageal cancer who received nCRT plus surgery or surgery alone.Patients and methods: Patients were randomly assigned to receive nCRT (carboplatin/paclitaxel with 41.4-Gy radiotherapy) plus surgery or surgery alone.HRQOL was measured using EORTC-QLQ-C30, EORTC-QLQ-OES24 and K-BILD questionnaires after a minimum follow-up of 6 years.To allow for examination over time, EORTC-QLQ-C30 and QLQ-OES24 questionnaire scores were compared with pretreatment and 12 months postoperative questionnaire scores.Physical functioning (QLQ-C30), eating problems (QLQ-OES24) and respiratory problems (K-BILD) were predefined primary end points.Predefined secondary end points were global quality of life and fatigue (both QLQ-C30).Results: After a median follow-up of 105 months, 123/368 included patients (33%) were still alive (70 nCRT plus surgery, 53 surgery alone).No statistically significant or clinically relevant differential effects in HRQOL end points were found between both groups.Compared with 1-year postoperative levels, eating problems, physical functioning, global quality of life and fatigue remained at the same level in both groups.Compared with pretreatment levels, eating problems had improved (Cohen's d -0.37, P = 0.011) during long-term follow-up, whereas physical functioning and fatigue were not restored to pretreatment levels in both groups (Cohen's d -0.56 and 0.51, respectively, both P < 0.001).Conclusions: Although physical functioning and fatigue remain reduced after long-term follow-up, no adverse impact of nCRT is apparent on long-term HRQOL compared with patients who were treated with surgery alone.In addition to the earlier reported improvement in survival and the absence of impact on short-term HRQOL, these results support the view that nCRT according to CROSS can be considered as a standard of care.Trial registration number: Netherlands Trial Register NTR487.",0,0,0,0

23374147,"Immunomodulatory effects of total intravenous and balanced inhalation anesthesia in patients with bladder cancer undergoing elective radical cystectomy: preliminary results.BACKGROUND: Although surgery and anesthesia induce immunesuppression, remains largely unknown whether various anesthetic techniques have different immunosuppressive effects on cancer patients.Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the influence of total intravenous anesthesia with target-controlled infusion (TIVA-TCI) and balanced inhalation anesthesia (BAL) on the peri-operative levels of inflammatory cytokines and regulatory T cells (Tregs) in patients with bladder cancer undergoing surgery.METHODS: Twenty eight consecutive patients with bladder cancer who underwent radical cystectomy were prospectively randomized into two groups to receive TIVA-TCI (n = 14) or BAL (n = 14).Before the induction of anesthesia (T0), 6-8 hours (T1) post-surgery, and 5 days post-surgery (T2), Tregs and serum levels of interleukin -1beta (IL-1beta), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin -2 (IL-2), interleukin -6 (IL-6), and interleukin -10 (IL-10) were measured.RESULTS: In the peri-operative period all cancer patients showed a marked and significant increase in IL-6.Moreover, TIVA-TCI patients also showed a higher increase in IFN-gamma, whereas in BAL patients Tregs were reduced by approximately 30% during surgery.The incidence of infections, metastases, and death was similar in both groups.CONCLUSIONS: The increase in the Th1 response in the TIVA-TCI group and the reduction in Tregs in the BAL group seem to balance the immunosuppressive effect induced by IL-6.Therefore TIVA-TCI and BAL can be both used in major surgery in patients with bladder cancer without worsening the outcome.",0,0,0,0

27114605,"Response to Cetuximab With or Without Irinotecan in Patients With Refractory Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Harboring the KRAS G13D Mutation: Australasian Gastro-Intestinal Trials Group ICECREAM Study.PURPOSE: RAS mutations predict lack of response to epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody therapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), but preclinical studies and retrospective clinical data suggest that patients with tumors harboring the exon 2 KRAS G13D mutation may benefit from cetuximab.We aimed to assess cetuximab monotherapy and cetuximab plus irinotecan in patients with molecularly selected (G13D mutation) chemotherapy-refractory mCRC in a randomized phase II trial of this rare molecular subtype.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with chemotherapy-refractory KRAS G13D mutation-positive mCRC who had progressed within 6 months of irinotecan therapy were randomly assigned to cetuximab 400 mg/m(2) loading dose and then 250 mg/m(2) once per week with or without irinotecan 180 mg/m(2) once every 2 weeks.The primary end point was 6-month progression-free survival; secondary end points were response rate, overall survival, quality of life, and toxicity.RESULTS: Fifty-one of 53 patients recruited over 2 years were eligible.The 6-month progression-free survival rate was 10% (95% CI, 2% to 26%) for cetuximab versus 23% (95% CI, 9% to 40%) for cetuximab plus irinotecan with a hazard ratio of 0.74 (95% CI, 0.42 to 1.32).Response and stable disease rates were 0% and 58% for monotherapy versus 9% and 70% for combination treatment, respectively.Overall survival and quality of life were similar; toxicities were higher with combination therapy.CONCLUSION: In patients with G13D-mutated chemotherapy-refractory mCRC, there was no statistically significant improvement in disease control at 6 months with either cetuximab monotherapy or cetuximab plus irinotecan.No responses were seen with single-agent cetuximab.The responses observed with the combination of cetuximab and irinotecan may reflect true drug synergy or persistent irinotecan sensitivity.The ICECREAM (Irinotecan Cetuximab Evaluation and Cetuximab Response Evaluation Among Patients with a G13D Mutation) study demonstrates the need to prospectively evaluate hypotheses that were previously supported by retrospective analyses and exemplifies the value of international collaboration in trials of rare molecular subtypes.",1,1,1,1
24435063,"Interest and informational preferences regarding genomic testing for modest increases in colorectal cancer risk.BACKGROUND/AIMS: This study explored the interest in genomic testing for modest changes in colorectal cancer risk and preferences for receiving genomic risk communications among individuals with intermediate disease risk due to a family history of colorectal cancer.METHODS: Surveys were conducted on 272 men and women at intermediate risk for colorectal cancer enrolled in a randomized trial comparing a remote personalized risk communication intervention (TeleCARE) aimed at promoting colonoscopy to a generic print control condition.Guided by Leventhal's Common Sense Model of Self-Regulation, we examined demographic and psychosocial factors possibly associated with interest in SNP testing.Descriptive statistics and logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with interest in SNP testing and preferences for receiving genomic risk communications.RESULTS: Three-fourths of participants expressed interest in SNP testing for colorectal cancer risk.Testing interest did not markedly change across behavior modifier scenarios.Participants preferred to receive genomic risk communications from a variety of sources: printed materials (69.5%), oncologists (54.8%), primary-care physicians (58.4%), and the web (58.1%).Overall, persons who were unmarried (p = 0.029), younger (p = 0.003) and with greater cancer-related fear (p = 0.019) were more likely to express interest in predictive genomic testing for colorectal cancer risk.In a stratified analysis, cancer-related fear was associated with the interest in predictive genomic testing in the intervention group (p = 0.017), but not the control group.CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with intermediate familial risk for colorectal cancer are highly interested in genomic testing for modest increases in disease risk, specifically unmarried persons, younger age groups and those with greater cancer fear.",0,0,0,0
30902613,"Updated Efficacy and Safety Data and Impact of the EML4-ALK Fusion Variant on the Efficacy of Alectinib in Untreated ALK-Positive Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer in the Global Phase III ALEX Study.INTRODUCTION: At the prior data cutoff (February 9, 2017) the ALEX trial showed superior investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) for alectinib versus crizotinib in untreated, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive, advanced NSCLC (hazard ratio = 0.47, 95% confidence interval: 0.34-0.65, p < 0.001).The median PFS in the alectinib arm was not reached versus 11.1 months with crizotinib.Retrospective analyses suggest that the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 gene-ALK variant (EML4-ALK) may influence ALK-inhibitor treatment benefit.We present updated analyses, including exploratory subgroup analysis by EML4-ALK variant, after an additional 10 months' follow-up (cutoff December 1, 2017).METHODS: Patients were randomized to receive twice-daily alectinib, 600 mg, or crizotinib, 250 mg, until disease progression, toxicity, death, or withdrawal.PFS was determined by the investigators.Baseline plasma and tissue biomarker samples were analyzed by using hybrid-capture, next-generation sequencing to determine EML4-ALK variant.RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were balanced.Investigator-assessed PFS was prolonged with alectinib (stratified hazard ratio = 0.43, 95% confidence interval: 0.32-0.58).The median PFS times were 34.8 months with alectinib and 10.9 months with crizotinib.EML4-ALK fusions were detectable in 129 patient plasma samples and 124 tissue samples; variants 1, 2, and 3/ab did not affect PFS, objective response rate, or duration of response.Investigator-assessed PFS was longer for alectinib than for crizotinib across EML4-ALK variants 1, 2, and 3a/b in plasma and tissue.Despite longer treatment duration (27.0 months in the case of alectinib versus 10.8 months in the case of crizotinib), the safety of alectinib compared favorably with that of crizotinib.CONCLUSION: Alectinib continues to demonstrate superior investigator-assessed PFS versus crizotinib in untreated ALK-positive NSCLC, irrespective of EML4-ALK variant.",1,1,1,1

29045554,"Veliparib with temozolomide or carboplatin/paclitaxel versus placebo with carboplatin/paclitaxel in patients with BRCA1/2 locally recurrent/metastatic breast cancer: randomized phase II study.Background: Homologous recombination defects in BRCA1/2-mutated tumors result in sensitivity to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors, which interfere with DNA damage repair.Veliparib, a potent poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor, enhanced the antitumor activity of platinum agents and temozolomide in early phase clinical trials.This phase II study examined the safety and efficacy of intermittent veliparib with carboplatin/paclitaxel (VCP) or temozolomide (VT) in patients with BRCA1/2-mutated breast cancer.Patients and methods: Eligible patients >/=18 years with locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer and a deleterious BRCA1/2 germline mutation were randomized 1 : 1 : 1 to VCP, VT, or placebo plus carboplatin/paclitaxel (PCP).Primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS); secondary end points included overall survival (OS) and overall response rate (ORR).Results: Of 290 randomized patients, 284 were BRCA+, confirmed by central laboratory.For VCP versus PCP, median PFS was 14.1 and 12.3 months, respectively [hazard ratio (HR) 0.789; 95% CI 0.536-1.162; P = 0.227], interim median OS 28.3 and 25.9 months (HR 0.750; 95% CI 0.503-1.117; P = 0.156), and ORR 77.8% and 61.3% (P = 0.027).For VT (versus PCP), median PFS was 7.4 months (HR 1.858; 95% CI 1.278-2.702; P = 0.001), interim median OS 19.1 months (HR 1.483; 95% CI 1.032-2.131; P = 0.032), and ORR 28.6% (P < 0.001).Safety profile was comparable between carboplatin/paclitaxel arms.Adverse events (all grades) of neutropenia, anemia, alopecia, and neuropathy were less frequent with VT versus PCP.Conclusion: Numerical but not statistically significant increases in both PFS and OS were observed in patients with BRCA1/2-mutated recurrent/metastatic breast cancer receiving VCP compared with PCP.The addition of veliparib to carboplatin/paclitaxel significantly improved ORR.There was no clinically meaningful increase in toxicity with VCP versus PCP.VT was inferior to PCP.An ongoing phase III trial is evaluating VCP versus PCP, with optional continuation single-agent therapy with veliparib/placebo if chemotherapy is discontinued without progression, in this patient population.Clinical trial information: NCT01506609.",1,1,1,1
29342492,"Efficacy and safety of endoscopic radiofrequency ablation for unresectable extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma: a randomized trial.BACKGROUND: Endoscopic placement of biliary stents to relieve jaundice is the main palliative treatment for unresectable extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.Endoscopic biliary radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has been reported to prolong stent patency, which may be beneficial in improving patient survival.However, available evidence is still insufficient, as most reported studies are retrospective case series.The aim of this study was to explore the clinical effect and safety of RFA in patients with unresectable extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.METHODS: 65 patients with unresectable extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, except Bismuth type III and IV hilar cholangiocarcinoma, were enrolled and randomly underwent either RFA combined with biliary stenting (RFA + stent group; n = 32) or biliary stent only (stent-only group; n = 33).Overall survival time, stent patency period, and postoperative adverse events were recorded.RESULTS: In the 21-month follow-up period, the overall mean survival time was significantly longer in the RFA + stent group than in the stent-only group (13.2 +/- 0.6 vs. 8.3 +/- 0.5 months; P < 0.001).The mean stent patency period of the RFA + stent group was also significantly longer than that of the stent-only group (6.8 vs. 3.4 months; P = 0.02).There was no significant difference in the incidence of postoperative adverse events between the two groups (6.3 % [2/32] vs. 9.1 % [3/33]; P = 0.67).CONCLUSION: Endoscopic RFA combined with stenting can significantly prolong survival and the stent patency period without increasing the incidence of adverse events in patients with extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma patient, except Bismuth type III and IV hilar cholangiocarcinoma.This approach can be considered as a safe and effective palliative treatment for these patients.",0,0,0,0
24573743,"A phase II open-label randomized multicenter trial of TSU-68 in combination with S-1 and oxaliplatin versus S-1 in combination with oxaliplatin in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide.The combination of oxaliplatin-based treatments (oxaliplatin plus infusional 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin [FOLFOX] or oxaliplatin plus capecitabine [CapeOX]) and bevacizumab is a standard chemotherapy regimen for metastatic CRC (mCRC).However, several clinical studies that tested S-1 plus oxaliplatin (SOX) indicate that SOX is also a treatment option for mCRC.TSU-68 is an oral compound that inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptor and platelet-derived growth factor receptor.The recommended dose of TSU-68 + SOX was previously determined in a phase I study of mCRC patients.The goal of this trial was to evaluate the efficacy of TSU-68 in combination with SOX.METHODS: This open-label multicenter randomized phase II trial was performed in Korea.Treatment-naive mCRC patients with a performance status of 0 or 1 were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either TSU-68 + SOX or SOX alone.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS).RESULTS: A total of 105 patients (TSU-68 + SOX, 52 patients; SOX alone, 53 patients) were randomized.The median PFS was 7.0 months in the TSU-68 + SOX group (hazard ratio [HR], 1.057) and 7.2 months in the SOX group (p = 0.8401).The most frequent grade 3 and 4 adverse events were thrombocytopenia (9.6 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 26.4 % [SOX]), neutropenia (13.5 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 15.1 % [SOX]), and anemia (3.8 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 13.2 % [SOX]).We observed a difference between the 2 groups for all grades of anemia (15.4 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 32.1 % [SOX]), diarrhea (30.8 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 47.2 % [SOX]), vomiting (50.0 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 26.4 % [SOX]), and chromaturia (23.1 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 0.0 % [SOX]).Analysis using a Cox proportional hazard model showed that baseline interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels were associated with a survival benefit of TSU-68 (p = 0.012).CONCLUSION: TSU-68 + SOX had a favorable safety profile.However, TSU-68 did not have a synergistic effect on the efficacy of SOX.The baseline serum IL-6 level could be a prognostic factor for TSU-68 efficacy.",1,1,1,0

25596266,"The genotype of MLH1 identifies a subgroup of follicular lymphoma patients who do not benefit from doxorubicin: FIL-FOLL study.Though most follicular lymphoma biomarkers rely on tumor features, the host genetic background may also be relevant for outcome.Here we aimed at verifying the contribution of candidate polymorphisms of FCgamma receptor, DNA repair and detoxification genes to prognostic stratification of follicular lymphoma treated with immunochemotherapy.The study was based on 428 patients enrolled in the FOLL05 prospective trial that compared three standard-of-care regimens (rituximab-cyclophosphamide-vincristine-prednisone versus rituximab-cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-vincristine-prednisone versus rituximab-fludarabine-mitoxantrone) for the first line therapy of advanced follicular lymphoma.Polymorphisms were genotyped on peripheral blood DNA samples.The primary endpoint was time to treatment failure.Polymorphisms of FCGR2A and FCGR3A, which have been suggested to influence the activity of rituximab as a single agent, did not affect time to treatment failure in the pooled analysis of the three FOLL05 treatment arms that combined rituximab with chemotherapy (P=0.742, P=0.252, respectively).These results were consistent even when the analysis was conducted by intention to treat, indicating that different chemotherapy regimens and loads did not interact differentially with the FCGR2A and FCGR3A genotypes.The genotype of MLH1, which regulates the genotoxic effect of doxorubicin, significantly affected time to treatment failure in patients in the rituximab-cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-vincristine-prednisone arm (P=0.001; q<0.1), but not in arms in which patients did not receive doxorubicin (i.e., the rituximab-cyclophosphamide-vincristine-prednisone and rituximab-fludarabine-mitoxantrone arms).The impact of MLH1 on time to treatment failure was independent after adjusting for the Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index and other potential confounding variables by multivariate analysis.These data indicate that MLH1 genotype is a predictor of failure to benefit from rituximab-cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-vincristine-prednisone treatment in advanced follicular lymphoma and confirm that FCGR2A and FCGR3A polymorphisms have no impact when follicular lymphoma is treated with rituximab plus chemotherapy (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT00774826).",0,0,0,0

27795558,"Expression of CD33 is a predictive factor for effect of gemtuzumab ozogamicin at different doses in adult acute myeloid leukaemia.It remains unclear in adult acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) whether leukaemic expression of CD33, the target antigen for gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO), adds prognostic information on GO effectiveness at different doses.CD33 expression quantified in 1583 patients recruited to UK-NCRI-AML17 (younger adults) and UK-NCRI-AML16 (older adults) trials was correlated with clinical outcomes and benefit from GO including a dose randomisation.CD33 expression associated with genetic subgroups, including lower levels in both adverse karyotype and core-binding factor (CBF)-AML, but was not independently prognostic.When comparing GO versus no GO (n=393, CBF-AMLs excluded) by stratified subgroup-adjusted analysis, patients with lowest quartile (Q1) %CD33-positivity had no benefit from GO (relapse risk, HR 2.41 (1.27-4.56), P=0.009 for trend; overall survival, HR 1.52 (0.92-2.52)).However, from the dose randomisation (NCRI-AML17, n=464, CBF-AMLs included), 6 mg/m(2) GO only had a relapse benefit without increased early mortality in CD33-low (Q1) patients (relapse risk HR 0.64 (0.36-1.12) versus 1.70 (0.99-2.92) for CD33-high, P=0.007 for trend).Thus CD33 expression is a predictive factor for GO effect in adult AML; although GO does not appear to benefit the non-CBF AML patients with lowest CD33 expression a higher GO dose may be more effective for CD33-low but not CD33-high younger adults.",0,0,0,0
29864379,"Improvement in Overall Survival in a Randomized Study That Compared Dacomitinib With Gefitinib in Patients With Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer and EGFR-Activating Mutations.Purpose ARCHER 1050, a randomized, open-label, phase III study of dacomitinib versus gefitinib in treatment-naive patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and activating mutations in EGFR, reported significant improvement in progression-free survival with dacomitinib.The mature overall survival (OS) analysis for the intention-to-treat population is presented here.Patients and Methods In this multinational, multicenter study, patients age 18 years or older (>/= 20 years in Japan and Korea) who had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 and newly diagnosed NSCLC with activating mutations in EGFR (exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R) were enrolled and randomly assigned in a 1:1 manner to dacomitinib (n = 227) or gefitinib (n = 225).Random assignment was stratified by race (Japanese, Chinese, other East Asian, or non-Asian) and EGFR mutation type.The final OS analysis was conducted with a data cutoff date of February 17, 2017; at that time 220 deaths (48.7%) were observed.Results During a median follow-up time of 31.3 months, 103 (45.4%) and 117 (52.0%) deaths occurred in the dacomitinib and gefitinib arms, respectively.The estimated hazard ratio for OS was 0.760 (95% CI, 0.582 to 0.993; two-sided P = .044).The median OS was 34.1 months with dacomitinib versus 26.8 months with gefitinib.The OS probabilities at 30 months were 56.2% and 46.3% with dacomitinib and gefitinib, respectively.Preliminary subgroup analyses for OS that are based on baseline characteristics were consistent with the primary OS analysis.Conclusion In patients with advanced NSCLC and EGFR activating mutations, dacomitinib is the first second-generation epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) to show significant improvement in OS in a phase III randomized study compared with a standard-of-care TKI.Dacomitinib should be considered one of the standard treatment options for these patients.",1,1,1,1

22321061,"Effects of exemestane and tamoxifen on hormone levels within the Tamoxifen Exemestane Adjuvant Multicentre (TEAM) trial: results of a German substudy.AIM: The aim of this study was to compare the effects of exemestane and tamoxifen on hormone levels in postmenopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer within a Germany substudy of the Tamoxifen Exemestane Adjuvant Multinational (TEAM) trial.METHODS: Within the TEAM trial, patients were randomized to receive adjuvant treatment with exemestane for 5 years or tamoxifen for 2.5-3 years followed by exemestane for 2-2.5 years.Serum levels of testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and parathyroid hormone (PTH)-intact were measured at screening and after 3, 6 and 12 months of treatment.RESULTS: Data on hormone levels were available from 63 patients in the tamoxifen arm and 68 patients in the exemestane arm.Treatment with exemestane resulted in decreases from baseline in SHBG and PTH-intact levels, and increases from baseline in testosterone, DHEAS and FSH levels.Tamoxifen treatment resulted in increases from baseline in SHBG and PTH-intact, whereas levels of testosterone and FSH decreased and DHEAS levels did not change.At all time points assessed, the absolute change from baseline was significantly different between tamoxifen and exemestane for testosterone, SHBG, FSH and PTH-intact (all p < 0.0001).CONCLUSIONS: Exemestane and tamoxifen had statistically significantly different effects on hormone levels, including testosterone, SHBG, FSH and PTH-intact.",1,1,1,1
26951379,"AVAREG: a phase II, randomized, noncomparative study of fotemustine or bevacizumab for patients with recurrent glioblastoma.BACKGROUND: Few prospective studies have assessed the role of bevacizumab and included a control arm with standard treatments for recurrent glioblastoma.We conducted a noncomparative phase II trial (AVAREG) to examine the efficacy of bevacizumab or fotemustine in this setting.METHODS: Eligible patients were randomized 2:1 to receive bevacizumab (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks) or fotemustine (75 mg/m(2) on days 1, 8, and 15, then 100 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks after a 35-day interval).The primary endpoint was 6-month overall survival (OS) rate (OS-6).No formal efficacy comparison was made between the treatment arms.RESULTS: Ninety-one patients were enrolled (bevacizumab n = 59; fotemustine n = 32).Median age was 57 years (range, 28-78 y), and patients had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 (n = 42), 1 (n = 35), or 2 (n = 14).OS-6 rate was 62.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 48.4-74.5) with bevacizumab and 73.3% (95% CI, 54.1-87.7) with fotemustine.OS-6 rates were lower in bevacizumab-treated patients with MGMT promoter methylated tumors than in those with unmethylated tumors (50% and 85%, respectively), but higher in fotemustine-treated patients (87.5% and 50%, respectively).OS rates at 9 months were 37.9% (95% CI, 25.5-51.6) and 46.7% (95% CI, 28.3-65.7) with bevacizumab and fotemustine, respectively, and median OS was 7.3 months (95% CI, 5.8-9.2) and 8.7 months (95% CI, 6.3-15.4), respectively.Toxicity was as expected with the 2 agents.CONCLUSION: Single-agent bevacizumab may have a role in patients with recurrent glioblastoma.",1,1,1,0
28882061,"Feasibility of a home-based exercise intervention with remote guidance for patients with stable grade II and III gliomas: a pilot randomized controlled trial.OBJECTIVE: In this pilot study, we investigated the feasibility of a home-based, remotely guided exercise intervention for patients with gliomas.DESIGN: Pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) with randomization (2:1) to exercise or control group.SUBJECTS: Patients with stable grade II and III gliomas.INTERVENTION: The six-month intervention included three home-based exercise sessions per week at 60%-85% of maximum heart rate.Participants wore heart rate monitors connected to an online platform to record activities that were monitored weekly by the physiotherapist.MAIN MEASURES: Accrual, attrition, adherence, safety, satisfaction, patient-reported physical activity, VO2 peak (by maximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing) and body mass index (BMI) at baseline and at six-month follow-up.RESULTS: In all, 34 of 136 eligible patients (25%) were randomized to exercise training ( N = 23) or the control group ( N = 11), of whom 19 and 9, respectively, underwent follow-up.Mean adherence to prescribed sessions was 79%.Patients' experiences were positive.There were no adverse events.Compared to the control group, the exercise group showed larger improvements in absolute VO2 peak (+158.9 mL/min; 95% CI: -44.8 to 362.5) and BMI (-0.3 kg/m(2); 95% CI: -0.9 to 0.2).The median increase in physical activity was 1489 metabolic equivalent of task (MET) minutes higher in the exercise group.The most reported reasons for non-participation were lack of motivation or time.CONCLUSION: This innovative and intensive home-based exercise intervention was feasible in a small subset of patients with stable gliomas who were interested in exercising.The observed effects suggest that the programme may improve cardiorespiratory fitness.These results support the need for large-scale trials of exercise interventions in brain tumour patients.",0,0,0,0
21660669,"Light treatment prevents fatigue in women undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer.PURPOSE: Fatigue is one of the most disturbing complaints of cancer patients and is often the reason for discontinuing treatment.This randomized controlled study tested the hypothesis that increased morning bright light, compared to dim light, would result in less fatigue in women with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy.METHODS: Thirty-nine women newly diagnosed with stage I-III breast cancer were randomized to either bright white light (BWL) or dim red light (DRL) treatment and were instructed to use the light box for 30 min every morning throughout the first four cycles of chemotherapy.The Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory was administered prior to the start of chemotherapy (baseline), during the chemotherapy treatment week of cycle 1 (C1TW), the last week (recovery week) of cycle 1 (C1RW), the chemotherapy treatment week of cycle 4 (C4TW), and the last week (recovery week) of cycle 4 (C4RW).RESULTS: The DRL group reported increased fatigue at C1TW (p = 0.003) and C4TW (p < 0.001) compared to baseline, while there was no significant change from baseline in the BWL group.A secondary analysis showed that the increases in fatigue levels in the DRL group were not mediated through nor associated with changes in sleep or in circadian rhythms as measured with wrist actigraphy.CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that morning bright light treatment may prevent overall fatigue from worsening during chemotherapy.Although our hypothesis that overall fatigue would improve with bright light treatment was not supported, the lack of deterioration in total fatigue scores suggests that bright morning light may be a useful intervention during chemotherapy for breast cancer.",0,0,0,0

Canadian Cancer Trials Group (CCTG) IND.219.INTRODUCTION: Activation of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway may confer resistance to chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Selumetinib (AZD6244, ARRY142886), a MEK1/2 inhibitor combined with chemotherapy in patients with NSCLC was evaluated in two schedules to evaluate efficacy and toxicity.METHODS: IND.219 was a three-arm study of first line pemetrexed/platinum chemotherapy with two schedules of selumetinib (Arm A: intermittent given on days 2-19; Arm B: continuous given on days 1-21) versus chemotherapy alone (Arm C).The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR); secondary objectives were tolerability, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS).The trial was stopped at the planned interim analysis.RESULTS: Arms A/B/C enrolled 20/21/21 patients, ORR was 35% (95% CI 15-59% median duration 3.8 months), 62% (95% CI 38-82%; median duration 6.3 months), 24% (95% CI 8-47%; median duration 11.6 months) respectively.The PFS (months Arm A, B, C) was 7.5, 6.7, 4.0 respectively (hazard ratio (HR) PFS Arm A over Arm C: 0.76 [95% CI, 0.38-1.51, 2-sided p = 0.42]; Arm B over Arm C 0.75 [95% CI 0.37-1.54, p = 0.43].Skin and gastrointestinal adverse events were more common with the addition of selumetinib.A high incidence of venous thromboembolism was seen in all arms.CONCLUSIONS: Selumetinib combined with chemotherapy was associated with a higher response rate.Continuous selumetinib appeared to be superior to an intermittent schedule.PFS was prolonged with the addition of selumetinib, however this was not statistically significant.",1,1,1,1
22795435,"American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z4099/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 1021: a randomized study of sublobar resection compared with stereotactic body radiotherapy for high-risk stage I non-small cell lung cancer.During the past decade, tremendous interest has arisen in the use of nonoperative therapies for patients with non-small cell lung cancer.Of these therapies, stereotactic body radiotherapy has become established as an effective modality for treating peripheral cancer in medically inoperable patients.Toxicity is low, and the treatment is effective, with excellent local control rates.Several investigators have suggested that stereotactic body radiotherapy could be effective for high-risk operable patients (usually treated with sublobar resection) and even perhaps for standard-risk operable patients (usually treated with lobectomy); however, this is less accepted.A direct comparison of stereotactic body radiotherapy and sublobar resection is difficult for a number of reasons.These include different definitions of recurrence, different populations of patients in these studies (with those undergoing stereotactic body radiotherapy tending to be the medically inoperable group), and different methods of classifying morbidity in the surgical and radiation oncology studies.Imaging follow-up has also not been standardized among the studies.Thus, a randomized study is necessary and timely.Investigators from the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group and the Radiation Therapy and Oncology Group have collaborated to develop a phase III randomized study comparing stereotactic body radiotherapy and sublobar resection (with or without brachytherapy) for high-risk operable patients with non-small cell lung cancer.This study (American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z4099/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 1021) has recently opened for accrual.It is hoped that this will help to better define the role of these therapies for patients with non-small cell lung cancer.",0,0,0,0

23281805,"Randomized Phase II trial of paclitaxel and carboplatin followed by gemcitabine switch-maintenance therapy versus gemcitabine and carboplatin followed by gemcitabine continuation-maintenance therapy in previously untreated advanced non-small cell lung cancer.BACKGROUND: In recent years, maintenance chemotherapy is increasingly being recognized as a new treatment strategy to improve the outcome of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).However, the optimal maintenance strategy is still controversial.Gemcitabine is a promising candidate for single-agent maintenance therapy because of little toxicity and good tolerability.We have conducted a randomized phase II study to evaluate the validity of single-agent maintenance chemotherapy of gemcitabine and to compare continuation- and switch-maintenance.METHODS: Chemonaive patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC were randomly assigned 1:1 to either arm A or B. Patients received paclitaxel (200 mg/m2, day 1) plus carboplatin (AUC 6 mg/mL/min, day 1) every 3 weeks in arm A, or gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2, days 1 and 8) plus carboplatin (AUC 5 mg/mL/min, day1) every 3 weeks in arm B. Non-progressive patients following 3 cycles of induction chemotherapy received maintenance gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2, days 1 and 8) every 3 weeks.( TRIAL REGISTRATION: UMIN000008252)RESULTS: The study was stopped because of delayed accrual at interim analysis.Of the randomly assigned 50 patients, 49 except for one in arm B were evaluable.Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 4.6 months for arm A vs. 3.5 months for arm B (HR = 1.03; 95% CI, 0.45-2.27; p = 0.95) and median overall survival (OS) was 15.0 months for arm A vs. 14.8 months for arm B (HR = 0.79; 95% CI, 0.40-1.51; p = 0.60), showing no difference between the two arms.The response rate, disease control rate, and the transit rate to maintenance phase were 36.0% (9/25), 64.0% (16/25), and 48% (12/25) for arm A vs. 16.7% (4/24), 50.0% (12/24), and 33% (8/24) for arm B, which were also statistically similar between the two arms (p = 0.13, p = 0.32, and p = 0.30, respectively).Both induction regimens were tolerable, except that more patients experienced peripheral neuropathy in arm A. Toxicities during the maintenance phase were also minimal.CONCLUSION: Survival and overall response were not significantly different between the two arms.Gemcitabine may be well-tolerable and feasible for maintenance therapy.",1,1,1,0

27209164,"BEVERLY: Rationale and Design of a Randomized Open-Label Phase III Trial Comparing Bevacizumab Plus Erlotinib Versus Erlotinib Alone as First-Line Treatment of Patients With EGFR-Mutated Advanced Nonsquamous Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.BACKGROUND: About 20% of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases harbor somatic mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene.In these patients, the standard first-line treatments are the EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as gefitinib, erlotinib, or afatinib.Most of these patients develop resistance and relapse within about 1 year of initiation of an EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor.Consequently, it is important to develop new combination strategies to delay this resistance.Preclinical data have showed that EGFR and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) share a common downstream pathway, suggesting the important role of VEGF in the resistance to EGFR blockade.The combination of erlotinib and bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF agent, showed very interesting clinical results.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The bevacizumab plus erlotinib study (BEVERLY) is a randomized, open-label, phase III trial investigating first-line erlotinib plus bevacizumab versus erlotinib in patients with advanced NSCLC harboring activating EGFR mutations.The co-primary endpoints are investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) and blinded, independent centrally reviewed PFS.The secondary endpoints include overall survival, quality of life, objective response rate, and safety.A total of 200 patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive oral erlotinib (150 mg daily) plus bevacizumab (15 mg/kg, intravenously, on day 1 of every 21-day cycle) or erlotinib alone, until objective disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or the patient's or physician's motivated decision to stop the treatment.CONCLUSION: If the primary endpoint of PFS is met, the erlotinib plus bevacizumab combination will be confirmed as the best first-line treatment for patients with advanced NSCLC harboring activating EGFR mutations.",1,1,0,0
22071311,"Cognitive performance after postoperative pituitary radiotherapy: a dosimetric study of the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex.OBJECTIVE: The hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC) are important for memory and executive functioning and are known to be sensitive to radiotherapy (RT).Radiation dosimetry relates radiation exposure to specific brain areas.The effects of various pituitary RT techniques were studied by relating detailed dosimetry of the hippocampus and PFC to cognitive performance.METHODS: In this cross-sectional design, 75 non-functioning pituitary macroadenoma (NFA) patients (61+/-10 years) participated and were divided into irradiated (RT+, n=30) and non-irradiated (RT-, n=45) groups.The RT+ group (who all received 25 fractions of 1.8 Gy; total dose: 45 Gy) consisted of three RT technique groups: three-field technique, n=10; four-field technique, n=15; and five-field technique, n=5.Memory and executive functioning were assessed by standardized neuropsychological tests.A reconstruction of the dose distributions for the three RT techniques was made.The RT doses on 30, 50, and 70% of the volume of the left and right hippocampus and PFC were calculated.RESULTS: Cognitive test performance was not different between the four groups, despite differences in radiation doses applied to the hippocampi and PFC.Age at RT, time since RT, and the use of thyroid hormone varied significantly between the groups; however, they were not related to cognitive performance.CONCLUSION: This study showed that there were no significant differences on cognitive performance between the three-, four-, and five-field RT groups and the non-irradiated patient group.A dose-response relationship could not be established, even with a radiation dose that was higher on most of the volume of the hippocampus and PFC in case of a four-field RT technique compared with the three- and five-field RT techniques.",0,0,0,0
27718781,"Adjuvant Sunitinib in High-Risk Renal-Cell Carcinoma after Nephrectomy.BACKGROUND: Sunitinib, a vascular endothelial growth factor pathway inhibitor, is an effective treatment for metastatic renal-cell carcinoma.We sought to determine the efficacy and safety of sunitinib in patients with locoregional renal-cell carcinoma at high risk for tumor recurrence after nephrectomy.METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trial, we assigned 615 patients with locoregional, high-risk clear-cell renal-cell carcinoma to receive either sunitinib (50 mg per day) or placebo on a 4-weeks-on, 2-weeks-off schedule for 1 year or until disease recurrence, unacceptable toxicity, or consent withdrawal.The primary end point was disease-free survival, according to blinded independent central review.Secondary end points included investigator-assessed disease-free survival, overall survival, and safety.RESULTS: The median duration of disease-free survival was 6.8 years (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.8 to not reached) in the sunitinib group and 5.6 years (95% CI, 3.8 to 6.6) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.98; P=0.03).Overall survival data were not mature at the time of data cutoff.Dose reductions because of adverse events were more frequent in the sunitinib group than in the placebo group (34.3% vs. 2%), as were dose interruptions (46.4% vs. 13.2%) and discontinuations (28.1% vs. 5.6%).Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were more frequent in the sunitinib group (48.4% for grade 3 events and 12.1% for grade 4 events) than in the placebo group (15.8% and 3.6%, respectively).There was a similar incidence of serious adverse events in the two groups (21.9% for sunitinib vs. 17.1% for placebo); no deaths were attributed to toxic effects.CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with locoregional clear-cell renal-cell carcinoma at high risk for tumor recurrence after nephrectomy, the median duration of disease-free survival was significantly longer in the sunitinib group than in the placebo group, at a cost of a higher rate of toxic events.(Funded by Pfizer; S-TRAC ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00375674 .).",0,0,0,0

28352657,"Randomized, placebo-controlled window trial of EGFR, Src, or combined blockade in head and neck cancer.BACKGROUND.EGFR and Src family kinases are upregulated in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).EGFR interacts with Src to activate STAT3 signaling, and dual EGFR-Src targeting is synergistic in HNSCC preclinical models.pSrc overexpression predicted resistance to the EGFR inhibitor, erlotinib, in a prior window trial.We conducted a 4-arm window trial to identify biomarkers associated with response to EGFR and/or Src inhibition.METHODS.Patients with operable stage II-IVa HNSCC were randomized to 7-21 days of neoadjuvant erlotinib, the Src inhibitor dasatinib, the combination of both, or placebo.Paired tumor specimens were collected before and after treatment.Pharmacodynamic expression of EGFR and Src pathway components was evaluated by IHC of tissue microarrays and reverse-phase protein array of tissue lysates.Candidate biomarkers were assessed for correlation with change in tumor size.RESULTS.From April 2009 to December 2012, 58 patients were randomized and 55 were treated.There was a significant decrease in tumor size in both erlotinib arms (P = 0.0014); however, no effect was seen with dasatinib alone (P = 0.24).High baseline pMAPK expression was associated with response to erlotinib (P = 0.03).High baseline pSTAT3 was associated with resistance to dasatinib (P = 0.099).CONCLUSIONS.Brief exposure to erlotinib significantly decreased tumor size in operable HNSCC, with no additive effect from dasatinib.Baseline pMAPK expression warrants further study as a response biomarker for anti-EGFR therapy.Basal expression of pSTAT3 may be independent of Src, explain therapeutic resistance, and preclude development of dasatinib in biomarker-unselected cohorts.TRIAL REGISTRATION.NCT00779389.FUNDING.National Cancer Institute, American Cancer Society, Pennsylvania Department of Health, V Foundation for Cancer Research, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Astellas Pharma.",1,1,1,1
25722381,"A randomized phase II study of the MEK1/MEK2 inhibitor trametinib (GSK1120212) compared with docetaxel in KRAS-mutant advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)dagger.BACKGROUND: KRAS mutations are detected in 25% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and no targeted therapies are approved for this subset population.Trametinib, a selective allosteric inhibitor of MEK1/MEK2, demonstrated preclinical and clinical activity in KRAS-mutant NSCLC.We report a phase II trial comparing trametinib with docetaxel in patients with advanced KRAS-mutant NSCLC.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients with histologically confirmed KRAS-mutant NSCLC previously treated with one prior platinum-based chemotherapy were randomly assigned in a ratio of 2 : 1 to trametinib (2 mg orally once daily) or docetaxel (75 mg/m(2) i.v.every 3 weeks).Crossover to the other arm after disease progression was allowed.Primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS).The study was prematurely terminated after the interim analysis of 92 PFS events, which showed the comparison of trametinib versus docetaxel for PFS crossed the futility boundary.RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-nine patients with KRAS-mutant NSCLC were randomized; of which, 86 patients received trametinib and 43 received docetaxel.Median PFS was 12 weeks in the trametinib arm and 11 weeks in the docetaxel arm (hazard ratio [HR] 1.14; 95% CI 0.75-1.75; P = 0.5197).Median overall survival, while the data are immature, was 8 months in the trametinib arm and was not reached in the docetaxel arm (HR 0.97; 95% CI 0.52-1.83; P = 0.934).There were 10 (12%) partial responses (PRs) in the trametinib arm and 5 (12%) PRs in the docetaxel arm (P = 1.0000).The most frequent adverse events (AEs) in >/=20% of trametinib patients were rash, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue.The most frequent grade 3 treatment-related AEs in the trametinib arm were hypertension, rash, diarrhea, and asthenia.CONCLUSION: Trametinib showed similar PFS and a response rate as docetaxel in patients with previously treated KRAS-mutant-positive NSCLC.CLINICALTRIALSGOV REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT01362296.",1,1,1,1

30806758,"A study of second-line irinotecan plus cisplatin vs. irinotecan alone in platinum-naive patients with early relapse of gastric cancer refractory to adjuvant S-1 monotherapy: exploratory subgroup analysis of the randomized phase III TRICS trial.BACKGROUNDS: Many patients with gastric cancer relapse during or early after adjuvant chemotherapy.The standard treatment for early relapse patients is a second-line chemotherapy (SLC) based on irinotecan, taxanes, or a platinum-based chemotherapy.The platinum-containing biweekly irinotecan plus cisplatin (IRI/CDDP) combination was assumed to be promising in several reports of clinical trials as SLC.TRICS trial, a randomized phase III study of IRI/CDDP vs. IRI in platinum-naive gastric cancers refractory to S-1 monotherapy, revealed that both irinotecan-based chemotherapies were effective and well tolerated.METHODS: This study analyzed 108 patients in the TRICS trial who experienced early relapse.Patients receiving IRI/CDDP (IRI, 60 mg/m(2); CDDP, 30 mg/m(2), q2w) versus IRI (150 mg/m(2), q2w) were compared regarding overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), overall response rate (ORR), and safety.RESULTS: The OS was 14.0 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 11.0-21.2) and 14.0 (95% CI: 10.7-16.5) months for IRI/CDDP and IRI, respectively (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.782; 95% CI: 0.515-1.188, P = 0.249).No significant differences were observed for PFS (5.0 vs. 4.5 months, respectively; HR: 0.802; 95% CI: 0.543-1.185, P = 0.268) or ORR (19.6% [95% CI: 9.4-33.9%] vs. 23.3% [95% CI: 11.8-38.6%], respectively).The incidence of grade 3-4 anemia was higher for IRI/CDDP than for IRI (20% vs. 0%, respectively; P = 0.0006).CONCLUSION: Our study showed no significant survival differences between IRI/CDDP and IRI in platinum-naive patients who relapsed during or within 6 months after S-1 adjuvant therapy; therefore, IRI may be a good option in this population.CLINICAL TRIAL INFORMATION: UMIN 000002571.",0,0,0,0
31792878,"Oral morphine drops for prompt relief of breathlessness in patients with advanced cancer-a randomized, double blinded, crossover trial of morphine sulfate oral drops vs. morphine hydrochloride drops with ethanol (red morphine drops).PURPOSE: Episodic breathlessness is frequent in palliative cancer patients.Opioids are the only pharmacological agents with sufficient evidence in treatment.In Denmark, the main recommendation is red morphine drops (RMD), an off-label solution of morphine, ethanol, and red color (cochenille) described since 1893 (Pharmacopoea Danica).In 2015, the Danish Medicines Agency increased focus on off-label medicines and recommended registered morphine drops without ethanol instead.However, our palliative patients told us that RMD was better.For that reason, we conducted a clinical trial to clarify any perceived difference between the two types of drops.METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double blinded, crossover trial.Patients were asked to perform standardized activity (2-min walk) aiming to provoke breathlessness.Primary endpoint (breathlessness NRS) and secondary endpoints (saturation, pulse, respiratory frequency) were measured before (t = 0) and after test medicine at t = 1, t = 3, t = 5, t = 10, and t = 20 min.After 2-4 days (washout period), the patients repeated the test, receiving the alternative drops in a blinded setup (crossover).RESULTS: In the first 3 min, the relative drop in breathlessness for morphine drops with ethanol (RMD) was significant more than for morphine drops without ethanol.We found no significant difference in secondary endpoints.CONCLUSIONS: A conclusion could be that ethanol might facilitate morphine absorption in the mouth.Our results needs further research of opioid absorption in the mouth as well as trials, testing morphine vs. more lipophilic opioids.The RMD drops are cheap, easy to use, and noninvasive and keep the patient independent of health care professionals.",0,0,0,0

PgR and Ki67 expression were significantly reduced with all treatments (means were -34% to -45%, and -75% to -85%, respectively; all P = 0.0001), with no differences between groups.CONCLUSIONS: In this short-term study, all treatments reduced ER expression, although F and F + A showed greater reductions than A. No significant differences were detected between the treatment groups in terms of PgR and Ki67 expression.No additional reduction in tumor biomarkers with combination treatment was observed, suggesting that F + A is unlikely to have further clinical benefit over F alone.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00259090.",1,1,1,1

29413685,"PICCA study: panitumumab in combination with cisplatin/gemcitabine chemotherapy in KRAS wild-type patients with biliary cancer-a randomised biomarker-driven clinical phase II AIO study.BACKGROUND: Combination chemotherapy has shown benefit in the treatment of biliary cancer and further improvements might be achieved by the addition of a biological agent.We report here the effect of chemotherapy with the monoclonal EGFR antibody panitumumab as therapy for KRAS wild-type biliary cancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with advanced biliary tract cancer were randomised (2:1) to receive cisplatin 25 mg/m(2) and gemcitabine 1000 mg/m(2) on day 1 and day 8/q3w with (arm A) or without panitumumab (arm B; 9 mg/kg BW, i.v q3w).The primary end-point was the evaluation of progression-free survival (PFS) at 6 months.Secondary end-points included objective response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), and toxicity.In addition, a post hoc assessment of genetic alterations was performed.Finally, we performed a meta-analysis of trials with chemotherapy with and without EGFR antibodies.RESULTS: Sixty-two patients were randomised in arm A and 28 patients in arm B. Patients received 7 treatment cycles in median (1-35) with a median treatment duration of 4.7 months (141 days, 8-765).PFS rate at 6 months was 54% in patients treated with cisplatin/gemcitabine and panitumumab but was 73% in patients treated with cisplatin/gemcitabine without antibody, respectively.Secondary end-points were an ORR of 45% in treatment arm A compared with 39% receiving treatment B and a median OS of 12.8 months (arm A) and of 20.1 months (arm B), respectively.In contrast to the p53-status, genetic alterations in IDH1/2 were linked to a high response after chemotherapy and prolonged survival.In accordance with our results, the meta-analysis of 12 trials did not reveal a survival advantage for patients treated with EGFR antibodies compared with chemotherapy alone.CONCLUSIONS: Panitumumab in combination with chemotherapy does not improve ORR, PFS and OS in patients with KRAS wild-type, advanced biliary cancer.Genetic profiling should be included in CCA trials to identify and validate predictive and prognostic biomarkers.CLINICAL TRIALS NUMBER: The trial was registered with NCT01320254.",1,1,1,1
26782957,"A randomized clinical trial of neoadjuvant chemotherapy versus neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for cancer of the oesophagus or gastro-oesophageal junction.BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant therapy improves long-term survival after oesophagectomy, treating oesophageal cancer, but the evidence to date is insufficient to determine which of the two main neoadjuvant therapy types, chemotherapy (nCT) or chemoradiotherapy (nCRT), is more beneficial.We aimed to compare the effects of nCT with those of nCRT.PATIENTS AND METHODS: This multicentre trial, which was conducted in Sweden and Norway, recruited 181 patients with carcinoma of the oesophagus or the gastro-oesophageal junction who were candidates for curative-intended treatment.The primary end point was histological complete response after neoadjuvant treatment, which has been shown to be correlated with increased long-term survival.Study participants were randomized to nCT or nCRT, followed by surgery with two-field lymphadenectomy.Three cycles of platin/5-fluorouracil were administered in both arms, whereas 40 Gy of concomitant radiotherapy was added in the nCRT arm.RESULTS: The trial met the primary end point, histological complete response being achieved in 28% after nCRT versus 9% after nCT (P = 0.002).Lymph-node metastases were observed in 62% in the nCT group versus 35% in the nCRT group (P = 0.001).The R0 resection rate was 87% after nCRT and 74% after nCT (P = 0.04).There was no difference in overall survival between the treatment arms.CONCLUSION: The addition of radiotherapy to neoadjuvant chemotherapy results in higher histological complete response rate, higher R0 resection rate, and a lower frequency of lymph-node metastases, without significantly affecting survival.CLINICALTRIALSGOV: NCT01362127 (https://clinicaltrials.gov; The full study protocol was registered in the Clinical Trials Database).",0,0,0,0

26822398,"Afatinib plus vinorelbine versus trastuzumab plus vinorelbine in patients with HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer who had progressed on one previous trastuzumab treatment (LUX-Breast 1): an open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Trastuzumab resistance is a key therapeutic challenge in metastatic breast cancer.We postulated that broader inhibition of ErbB receptors with afatinib would improve clinical outcomes compared with HER2 inhibition alone in patients who had progressed on previous trastuzumab treatment.LUX-Breast 1 compared afatinib plus vinorelbine with trastuzumab plus vinorelbine for such patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.METHODS: We did this open-label trial at 350 hospitals in 41 countries worldwide.We enrolled female patients with HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer who had progressed on or following adjuvant trastuzumab or first-line treatment of metastatic disease with trastuzumab.Participants were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive oral afatinib (40 mg/day) plus intravenous vinorelbine (25 mg/m(2) per week) or intravenous trastuzumab (2 mg/kg per week after 4 mg/kg loading dose) plus vinorelbine.Randomisation was done centrally and stratified by previous trastuzumab treatment (adjuvant vs first-line treatment), hormone receptor status (oestrogen receptor and progesterone receptor positive vs others), and region.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, assessed in the intention-to-treat population.This trial is closed to enrolment and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01125566.FINDINGS: Between Aug 26, 2010, and April 26, 2013, we enrolled 508 patients: 339 assigned to the afatinib group and 169 assigned to the trastuzumab group.Recruitment was stopped on April 26, 2013, after a benefit-risk assessment by the independent data monitoring committee was unfavourable for the afatinib group.Patients on afatinib plus vinorelbine had to switch to trastuzumab plus vinorelbine, afatinib monotherapy, vinorelbine monotherapy, or receive treatment outside of the trial.Median follow-up was 9.3 months (IQR 3.7-16.0).Median progression-free survival was 5.5 months (95% CI 5.4-5.6) in the afatinib group and 5.6 months (5.3-7.3) in the trastuzumab group (hazard ratio 1.10 95% CI 0.86-1.41; p=0.43).The most common drug-related adverse events of grade 3 or higher were neutropenia (190 [56%] of 337 patients in the afatinib group vs 102 [60%] of 169 patients in the trastuzumab group), leucopenia (64 [19%] vs 34 [20%]), and diarrhoea (60 [18%] vs none).INTERPRETATION: Trastuzumab-based therapy remains the treatment of choice for patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who had progressed on trastuzumab.FUNDING: Boehringer Ingelheim.",1,1,1,1
26386540,"Safety, efficacy, and immunogenicity of VGX-3100, a therapeutic synthetic DNA vaccine targeting human papillomavirus 16 and 18 E6 and E7 proteins for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2/3: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2b trial.BACKGROUND: Despite preventive vaccines for oncogenic human papillomaviruses (HPVs), cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) is common, and current treatments are ablative and can lead to long-term reproductive morbidity.We assessed whether VGX-3100, synthetic plasmids targeting HPV-16 and HPV-18 E6 and E7 proteins, delivered by electroporation, would cause histopathological regression in women with CIN2/3.METHODS: Efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of VGX-3100 were assessed in CIN2/3 associated with HPV-16 and HPV-18, in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2b study.Patients from 36 academic and private gynaecology practices in seven countries were randomised (3:1) to receive 6 mg VGX-3100 or placebo (1 mL), given intramuscularly at 0, 4, and 12 weeks.Randomisation was stratified by age (<25 vs >/=25 years) and CIN2 versus CIN3 by computer-generated allocation sequence (block size 4).Funder and site personnel, participants, and pathologists were masked to treatment.The primary efficacy endpoint was regression to CIN1 or normal pathology 36 weeks after the first dose.Per-protocol and modified intention-to-treat analyses were based on patients receiving three doses without protocol violations, and on patients receiving at least one dose, respectively.The safety population included all patients who received at least one dose.The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (number NCT01304524) and EudraCT (number 2012-001334-33).FINDINGS: Between Oct 19, 2011, and July 30, 2013, 167 patients received either VGX-3100 (n=125) or placebo (n=42).In the per-protocol analysis 53 (49.5%) of 107 VGX-3100 recipients and 11 (30.6%) of 36 placebo recipients had histopathological regression (percentage point difference 19.0 [95% CI 1.4-36.6]; p=0.034).In the modified intention-to-treat analysis 55 (48.2%) of 114 VGX-3100 recipients and 12 (30.0%) of 40 placebo recipients had histopathological regression (percentage point difference 18.2 [95% CI 1.3-34.4]; p=0.034).Injection-site reactions occurred in most patients, but only erythema was significantly more common in the VGX-3100 group (98/125, 78.4%) than in the placebo group (24/42, 57.1%; percentage point difference 21.3 [95% CI 5.3-37.8]; p=0.007).INTERPRETATION: VGX-3100 is the first therapeutic vaccine to show efficacy against CIN2/3 associated with HPV-16 and HPV-18.VGX-3100 could present a non-surgical therapeutic option for CIN2/3, changing the treatment outlook for this common disease.FUNDING: Inovio Pharmaceuticals.",0,0,0,0
22892060,"Hormone replacement therapy after breast cancer: 10 year follow up of the Stockholm randomised trial.BACKGROUND: The management of hormonal deficiency symptoms in breast cancer survivors is an unsolved problem.While hormone replacement therapy (HRT) may increase the risk of breast cancer in healthy women, its effects on recurrence is unclear.Observational studies have suggested decreased recurrence rates from HRT.The few clinical trials in this field have all been closed preterm.METHODS: The Stockholm trial was started in 1997 and designed to minimise the dose of progestogen in the HRT arm.Disease-free women with a history of breast cancer were randomised to HRT (n=188) or no HRT (n=190).The trial was stopped in 2003 when another Swedish study (HABITS, the Hormonal Replacement After Breast Cancer - Is it Safe?) reported increased recurrence.However the Stockholm material showed no excess risk after 4 years of follow-up.A long term follow-up has now been performed.FINDINGS: After 10.8 years of follow-up, there was no difference in new breast cancer events: 60 in the HRT group versus 48 among controls (hazard ratio (HR)=1.3; 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.9-1.9).Among women on HRT, 11 had local recurrence and 12 distant metastases versus 15 and 12 for the controls.There were 14 contra-lateral breast cancers in the HRT group and four in the control group (HR=3.6; 95% CI=1.2-10.9; p=0.013).No differences in mortality or new primary malignancies were found.INTERPRETATION: The number of new events did not differ significantly between groups, in contrast to previous reports.The increased recurrence in HABITS has been attributed to higher progestogen exposure.As both trials were prematurely closed, data do not allow firm conclusions.Both studies found no increased mortality from breast cancer or other causes from HRT.Current guidelines typically consider HRT contraindicated in breast cancer survivors.Findings suggest that, in some women symptom relief may outweigh the potential risks of HRT.",0,0,0,0

Race, Gleason score, tumor stage, node stage, pretreatment PSA level, and duration of neoAS were associated with the groups of patients with PSA levels </=0.1 and >0.1 ng/mL. In univariate analyses, post-neoAS, pre-RT PSA level >0.1 ng/mL was associated with increased risks of biochemical failure (hazard ratio [HR], 2.04; P < .0001); local failure (HR, 2.51; P < .0001); distant metastases (HR, 1.73; P = .0006); cause-specific mortality (HR, 2.36; P < .0001); and all-cause mortality (HR, 1.24; P = .005).In multivariable models that also included baseline and treatment variables, post-neoAS, pre-RT PSA level >0.1 ng/mL was independently associated with increased risk of biochemical failure (HR, 2.00; P < .0001); local failure (HR, 2.33; P < .0001); and cause-specific mortality (HR, 1.75; P = .03).CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a PSA level >0.1 ng/mL after neoAS and before the start of RT had less favorable clinical outcomes than patients whose PSA level was </=0.1 ng/mL. The role of post-neoAS, pre-RT PSA level relative to PSA levels obtained along the continuum of medical care is not presently defined but could be tested in future clinical trials.",0,0,0,0

28459941,"German Adjuvant Intergroup Node-positive Study (GAIN): a phase III trial comparing two dose-dense regimens (iddEPC versus ddEC-PwX) in high-risk early breast cancer patients.BACKGROUND: Dose-dense (dd) regimens are one of the preferred options for the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer patients with intermediate to high risk.The German Adjuvant Intergroup Node-positive trial aimed at optimizing intense dd (idd) strategies by evaluating drug combinations and the addition of capecitabine.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Women (aged 18 years and biologically <65 years) with histologically involved axillary lymph nodes were randomly assigned to receive three courses each of epirubicin (E) 150 mg/m2, paclitaxel (P) 225 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide (C) 2500 mg/m2 (reduced to 2000 mg/m2 after recruitment of 1200 patients) q2w intravenously (i.v.) (iddEPC-regimen) or ddEC (E 112.5 mg/m2 + C 600 mg/m2, i.v.q2w for 4 cycles) followed by paclitaxel weekly (Pw 67.5 mg/m2 i.v.q8d for 10 weeks) plus capecitabine (X 2000 mg/m2 p.o.days 1-14, q22 for 4 cycles) (ddEC-PwX-regimen).Further randomization assigned patients to ibandronate for 2 years versus observation and to pegfilgrastim day 2 versus 4.RESULTS: From June 2004 to August 2008, 2994 patients were randomized to either iddEPC (N = 1498), or ddEC-PwX (N = 1496) and started treatment.Median age was 50 years; pN1 (37.8%), pN2 (35.3%); pN3 (26.9%); 46.4% were G3 tumors; 76.9% hormone receptor-positive and 22% HER2-positive.After a median follow-up of 74 months, 645 events and 383 deaths were recorded.Hematological adverse events grades 3-4 were more common with iddEPC (P < 0.001), nonhematological with ddEC-PwX (P = 0.04), even if the toxicity profile of the two regimens was different.At 5 years, estimated disease-free survival rates for ddEC-PwX and iddEPC were 81.7% [95% confidence interval (CI) 79.5-83.6] versus 80.2% (95% CI 78.0-82.2).Hazard ratio (HR)=0.95 (95% CI 0.81-1.11, log-rank P = 0.49).Five-year overall survival rates were 89.4% for ddEC-PwX (95% CI 87.7-91.0) and 89.0% for iddEPC (95% CI 87.2-90.6), HR = 0.85 (95% CI 0.69-1.04, log-rank P = 0.10).CONCLUSION: Adding capecitabine to ddEC-Pw did not improve outcome in comparison to iddEPC but increased toxicity and should not be recommended for further use.",1,1,1,0
26502987,"School-based brief psycho-educational intervention to raise adolescent cancer awareness and address barriers to medical help-seeking about cancer: a cluster randomised controlled trial.OBJECTIVES: Raising cancer awareness and addressing barriers to help-seeking may improve early diagnosis.The aim was to assess whether a psycho-educational intervention increased adolescents' cancer awareness and addressed help-seeking barriers.METHODS: This was a cluster randomised controlled trial involving 2173 adolescents in 20 schools.The intervention was a 50-min presentation delivered by a member of Teenage Cancer Trust's (UK charity) education team.Schools were stratified by deprivation and roll size and randomly allocated to intervention/control conditions within these strata.Outcome measures were the number of cancer warning signs and cancer risk factors recognised, help-seeking barriers endorsed and cancer communication.Communication self-efficacy and intervention fidelity were also assessed.RESULTS: Regression models showed significant differences in the number of cancer warning signs and risk factors recognised between intervention and control groups.In intervention schools, the greatest increases in recognition of cancer warning signs at 6-month follow-up were for unexplained weight loss (from 44.2% to 62.0%) and change in the appearance of a mole (from 46.3% to 70.7%), up by 17.8% and 24.4%, respectively.Greatest increases in recognition of cancer risk factors were for getting sunburnt more than once as a child (from 41.0% to 57.6%) and being overweight (from 42.7% to 55.5%), up by 16.6% and 12.8%, respectively.Regression models showed that adolescents in intervention schools were 2.7 times more likely to discuss cancer at 2-week follow-up compared with the control group.No differences in endorsement of barriers to help-seeking were observed.CONCLUSIONS: School-based brief psycho-educational interventions are easy to deliver, require little resource and improve cancer awareness.(c) 2015 The Authors.Psycho-Oncology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",0,0,0,0
25813447,"A Phase II Study of Pazopanib in Patients with Localized Renal Cell Carcinoma to Optimize Preservation of Renal Parenchyma.PURPOSE: Preservation of renal function is prioritized during surgical management of localized renal cell carcinoma.VEGF targeted agents can downsize tumors in metastatic renal cell carcinoma and may do the same in localized renal cell carcinoma, allowing for optimal preservation of renal parenchyma associated with partial nephrectomy.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Localized clear cell renal cell carcinoma patients meeting 1 or both of the following criteria were enrolled in a prospective phase II trial, including radical or partial nephrectomy likely to yield a glomerular filtration rate of less than 30 ml/minute/1.73 m(2), or partial nephrectomy high risk due to high complexity (R.E.N.A.L. 10 to 12) or tumor adjacent to hilar vessels.Pazopanib (800 mg once daily) was administered for 8 to 16 weeks with repeat imaging at completion of therapy, followed by surgery.RESULTS: A total of 25 patients enrolled with a median tumor size of 7.3 cm and a median R.E.N.A.L. score of 11.Of index lesions 80% were high complexity and 56% of patients had a solitary kidney.Patients received a median of 8 weeks of pazopanib.The median interval from treatment start to surgery was 10.6 weeks.R.E.N.A.L. score decreased in 71% of tumors and 92% of patients experienced a reduction in tumor volume.Six of 13 patients for whom partial nephrectomy was not possible at baseline were able to undergo partial nephrectomy after treatment.The mean parenchymal volume that could be saved with surgery increased from an estimated 107 to 173 cc (p = 0.0015).In 5 patients a urine leak developed, which was managed conservatively, and 7 received a transfusion, of whom 1 required embolization.CONCLUSIONS: Neoadjuvant pazopanib resulted in downsizing localized renal cell carcinoma, allowing for improved preservation of renal parenchyma and enabling partial nephrectomy in a select subset of patients who would otherwise require radical nephrectomy.",0,0,0,0
29413685,"PICCA study: panitumumab in combination with cisplatin/gemcitabine chemotherapy in KRAS wild-type patients with biliary cancer-a randomised biomarker-driven clinical phase II AIO study.BACKGROUND: Combination chemotherapy has shown benefit in the treatment of biliary cancer and further improvements might be achieved by the addition of a biological agent.We report here the effect of chemotherapy with the monoclonal EGFR antibody panitumumab as therapy for KRAS wild-type biliary cancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with advanced biliary tract cancer were randomised (2:1) to receive cisplatin 25 mg/m(2) and gemcitabine 1000 mg/m(2) on day 1 and day 8/q3w with (arm A) or without panitumumab (arm B; 9 mg/kg BW, i.v q3w).The primary end-point was the evaluation of progression-free survival (PFS) at 6 months.Secondary end-points included objective response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), and toxicity.In addition, a post hoc assessment of genetic alterations was performed.Finally, we performed a meta-analysis of trials with chemotherapy with and without EGFR antibodies.RESULTS: Sixty-two patients were randomised in arm A and 28 patients in arm B. Patients received 7 treatment cycles in median (1-35) with a median treatment duration of 4.7 months (141 days, 8-765).PFS rate at 6 months was 54% in patients treated with cisplatin/gemcitabine and panitumumab but was 73% in patients treated with cisplatin/gemcitabine without antibody, respectively.Secondary end-points were an ORR of 45% in treatment arm A compared with 39% receiving treatment B and a median OS of 12.8 months (arm A) and of 20.1 months (arm B), respectively.In contrast to the p53-status, genetic alterations in IDH1/2 were linked to a high response after chemotherapy and prolonged survival.In accordance with our results, the meta-analysis of 12 trials did not reveal a survival advantage for patients treated with EGFR antibodies compared with chemotherapy alone.CONCLUSIONS: Panitumumab in combination with chemotherapy does not improve ORR, PFS and OS in patients with KRAS wild-type, advanced biliary cancer.Genetic profiling should be included in CCA trials to identify and validate predictive and prognostic biomarkers.CLINICAL TRIALS NUMBER: The trial was registered with NCT01320254.",1,1,1,1

PgR and Ki67 expression were significantly reduced with all treatments (means were -34% to -45%, and -75% to -85%, respectively; all P = 0.0001), with no differences between groups.CONCLUSIONS: In this short-term study, all treatments reduced ER expression, although F and F + A showed greater reductions than A. No significant differences were detected between the treatment groups in terms of PgR and Ki67 expression.No additional reduction in tumor biomarkers with combination treatment was observed, suggesting that F + A is unlikely to have further clinical benefit over F alone.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00259090.",1,1,1,1
28056902,"An objective and cross-sectional examination of sun-safe behaviours in New South Wales primary schools.BACKGROUND: Previous evaluations have supported the link between sun protection policies and improved sun protection behaviours.However these evaluations have relied on self-reported data.METHODS: A cross-sectional design as part of an ongoing 18-month cluster-controlled trial in primary schools (n = 20) was used.Researchers conducted direct observations to record students' hat use and teachers' use of sun protective measures during recess and lunch.Researchers also recorded the volume of sunscreen consumed in each school.RESULTS: Only 60% of primary school children wear a sun-safe hat during their breaks when observed using objective measures.Weak correlations were observed between the wearing of a sun-safe hat and a school's socio-economic status (r = 0.26).All other independent variables measured had only very weak correlations (r < 0.19) with sun-safe hat wearing behaviour of students.Sunscreen consumption by school students during the school day is negligible.CONCLUSIONS: A large percentage of NSW primary schools in this study wear sun-safe hats during the school day but this is well below what has been reported in previous national surveys.Given the finite resources of schools and the correlation, though small, with SES status for these behaviours, it behoves researchers to investigate low-cost solutions to these problems.Further qualitative data will also be needed to inform the enablers and barriers for sun-safe behaviour interventions to be adopted in NSW primary schools.",0,0,0,0
28958502,"Dacomitinib versus gefitinib as first-line treatment for patients with EGFR-mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (ARCHER 1050): a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Dacomitinib is a second-generation, irreversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor.We compared its efficacy and safety with that of the reversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib in the first-line treatment of patients with advanced EGFR-mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).METHODS: In this international, multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3 study (ARCHER 1050), we enrolled adults (aged >/=18 years or >/=20 years in Japan and South Korea) with newly diagnosed advanced NSCLC and one EGFR mutation (exon 19 deletion or Leu858Arg) at 71 academic medical centres and university hospitals in seven countries or special administrative regions.We randomly assigned participants (1:1) to receive oral dacomitinib 45 mg/day (in 28-day cycles) or oral gefitinib 250 mg/day (in 28-day cycles) until disease progression or another discontinuation criterion was met.Randomisation, stratified by race and EGFR mutation type, was done with a computer-generated random code assigned by a central interactive web response system.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival assessed by masked independent review in the intention-to-treat population.Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01774721, and is ongoing but no longer recruiting patients.FINDINGS: Between May 9, 2013, and March 20, 2015, 452 eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive dacomitinib (n=227) or gefitinib (n=225).Median duration of follow-up for progression-free survival was 22.1 months (95% CI 20.3-23.9).Median progression-free survival according to masked independent review was 14.7 months (95% CI 11.1-16.6) in the dacomitinib group and 9.2 months (9.1-11.0) in the gefitinib group (hazard ratio 0.59, 95% CI 0.47-0.74; p<0.0001).The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were dermatitis acneiform (31 [14%] of 227 patients given dacomitinib vs none of 224 patients given gefitinib), diarrhoea (19 [8%] vs two [1%]), and raised alanine aminotransferase levels (two [1%] vs 19 [8%]).Treatment-related serious adverse events were reported in 21 (9%) patients given dacomitinib and in ten (4%) patients given gefitinib.Two treatment-related deaths occurred in the dacomitinib group (one related to untreated diarrhoea and one to untreated cholelithases/liver disease) and one in the gefitinib group (related to sigmoid colon diverticulitis/rupture complicated by pneumonia).INTERPRETATION: Dacomitinib significantly improved progression-free survival over gefitinib in first-line treatment of patients with EGFR-mutation-positive NSCLC and should be considered as a new treatment option for this population.FUNDING: SFJ Pharmaceuticals Group and Pfizer.",1,1,1,1

23871490,"2 years versus 1 year of adjuvant trastuzumab for HER2-positive breast cancer (HERA): an open-label, randomised controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Trastuzumab has established efficacy against breast cancer with overexpression or amplification of the HER2 oncogene.The standard of care is 1 year of adjuvant trastuzumab, but the optimum duration of treatment is unknown.We compared 2 years of treatment with trastuzumab with 1 year of treatment, and updated the comparison of 1 year of trastuzumab versus observation at a median follow-up of 8 years, for patients enrolled in the HERceptin Adjuvant (HERA) trial.METHODS: The HERA trial is an international, multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial comparing treatment with trastuzumab for 1 and 2 years with observation after standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy, adjuvant chemotherapy, or both in 5102 patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer.The primary endpoint was disease-free survival.The comparison of 2 years versus 1 year of trastuzumab treatment involved a landmark analysis of 3105 patients who were disease-free 12 months after randomisation to one of the trastuzumab groups, and was planned after observing at least 725 disease-free survival events.The updated intention-to-treat comparison of 1 year trastuzumab treatment versus observation alone in 3399 patients at a median follow-up of 8 years (range 0-10) is also reported.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00045032.FINDINGS: We recorded 367 events of disease-free survival in 1552 patients in the 1 year group and 367 events in 1553 patients in the 2 year group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.99, 95% CI 0.85-1.14, p=0.86).Grade 3-4 adverse events and decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction during treatment were reported more frequently in the 2 year treatment group than in the 1 year group (342 [20.4%] vs 275 [16.3%] grade 3-4 adverse events, and 120 [7.2%] vs 69 [4.1%] decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction, respectively).HRs for a comparison of 1 year of trastuzumab treatment versus observation were 0.76 (95% CI 0.67-0.86, p<0.0001) for disease-free survival and 0.76 (0.65-0.88, p=0.0005) for overall survival, despite crossover of 884 (52%) patients from the observation group to trastuzumab therapy.INTERPRETATION: 2 years of adjuvant trastuzumab is not more effective than is 1 year of treatment for patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer.1 year of treatment provides a significant disease-free and overall survival benefit compared with observation and remains the standard of care.FUNDING: F Hoffmann-La Roche (Roche).",1,1,1,1
26324738,"Clinical and Translational Results of a Phase II, Randomized Trial of an Anti-IGF-1R (Cixutumumab) in Women with Breast Cancer That Progressed on Endocrine Therapy.PURPOSE: This phase II trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of cixutumumab, a human anti-insulin-like growth factor receptor 1 (IGF-1R) monoclonal IgG1 antibody, and explored potential biomarkers in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer that progressed on antiestrogen therapy received (2:1 randomization) cixutumumab 10 mg/kg and the same antiestrogen (arm A) or cixutumumab alone (arm B) every 2 weeks (q2w).Primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS); secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS) and safety.Correlative analyses of IGF-1R, total insulin receptor (IR), and IR isoforms A (IR-A) and B (IR-B) expression in tumor tissue were explored.RESULTS: Ninety-three patients were randomized (arm A, n = 62; arm B, n = 31).Median PFS was 2.0 and 3.1 months for arm A and arm B, respectively.Secondary efficacy measures were similar between the arms.Overall, cixutumumab was well tolerated.IGF-1R expression was not associated with clinical outcomes.Regardless of the treatment, lower IR-A, IR-B, and total IR mRNA expression in tumor tissue was significantly associated with longer PFS [IR-A: HR, 2.62 (P = 0.0062); IR-B: HR, 2.21 (P = 0.0202); and total IR: HR, 2.18 (P = 0.0230)] and OS [IR-A: HR, 2.94 (P = 0.0156); IR-B: HR, 2.69 (P = 0.0245); and total IR: HR, 2.72 (P = 0.0231)].CONCLUSIONS: Cixutumumab (10 mg/kg) with or without antiestrogen q2w had an acceptable safety profile, but no significant clinical efficacy.Patients with low total IR, IR-A, and IR-B mRNA expression levels had significantly longer PFS and OS, independent of the treatment.The prognostic or predictive value of IR as a biomarker for IGF-1R-targeted therapies requires further validation.",1,1,1,1
28743247,"A randomized phase II study of paclitaxel alone versus paclitaxel plus sorafenib in second- and third-line treatment of patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer (PASO).BACKGROUND: We conducted an open-label, randomized, two-arm multi-center study to assess the efficacy and safety of paclitaxel versus paclitaxel + sorafenib in patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer.METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive either paclitaxel monotherapy (80 mg/m(2)) weekly (3 weeks on, 1 week off) plus sorafenib 400 mg orally, twice a day taken continuously throughout 28 day cycles.Sorafenib dose was gradually escalated from a starting dose of 200 mg twice a day.The primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS).RESULTS: A pre-planned efficacy interim analysis was performed on the data of 60 patients, 30 patients in each treatment arm.Median PFS was estimated at 6.6 months (95% CI: 5.1 to 9.0) in patients randomized to single-agent paclitaxel (Arm A) and 5.6 months (95% CI: 3.8 to 6.5) in patients randomized to paclitaxel-sorafenib combination (Arm B) therapy.Contrary to the hypothesis, the treatment effect was statistically significant in favor of paclitaxel monotherapy (hazard ratio 1.80, 95% CI: 1.02 to 3.20; log-rank test P = 0.0409).It was decided to stop the trial early for futility.Median OS was also in favor of Arm A (20.7 months (95% CI: 16.4 to 26.7) versus 12.1 months (95% CI: 5.8 to 20.4) in Arm B. Clinical control was achieved in 28 patients (93.3%) in Arm A and in 21 patients 70.0% in Arm B. Overall response rate was met in 43.3% of patients in Arm A and in 40.0% in Arm B. Toxicities were increased in Arm B with higher rates of diarrhea, nausea, neutropenia, hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) and anorexia, Grad 3 and 4 toxicities were rare.CONCLUSIONS: In this pre-planned interim analysis, paclitaxel-sorafenib combination therapy was not found to be superior to paclitaxel monotherapy with regard to the primary end point, progression-free survival.The trial was therefore discontinued early.There was no indication of more favorable outcomes for combination therapy in secondary efficacy end points.As expected, the safety and toxicity profile of the combination therapy was less favorable compared to monotherapy.Overall, this trial did not demonstrate that adding sorafenib to second- or third-line paclitaxel provides any clinical benefit to patients with HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer.Cautious dosing using a sorafenib ramp up schedule might have contributed to negative results.TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered at EudraCT (No 2009-018025-73) and retrospectively registered at Clinical trials.gov on March 17, 2011 ( NCT01320111 ).",1,1,1,1

25795410,"Nivolumab versus chemotherapy in patients with advanced melanoma who progressed after anti-CTLA-4 treatment (CheckMate 037): a randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Nivolumab, a fully human IgG4 PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor antibody, can result in durable responses in patients with melanoma who have progressed after ipilimumab and BRAF inhibitors.We assessed the efficacy and safety of nivolumab compared with investigator's choice of chemotherapy (ICC) as a second-line or later-line treatment in patients with advanced melanoma.METHODS: In this randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 3 trial, we recruited patients at 90 sites in 14 countries.Eligible patients were 18 years or older, had unresectable or metastatic melanoma, and progressed after ipilimumab, or ipilimumab and a BRAF inhibitor if they were BRAF(V 600) mutation-positive.Participating investigators randomly assigned (with an interactive voice response system) patients 2:1 to receive an intravenous infusion of nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks or ICC (dacarbazine 1000 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks or paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2) combined with carboplatin area under the curve 6 every 3 weeks) until progression or unacceptable toxic effects.We stratified randomisation by BRAF mutation status, tumour expression of PD-L1, and previous best overall response to ipilimumab.We used permuted blocks (block size of six) within each stratum.Primary endpoints were the proportion of patients who had an objective response and overall survival.Treatment was given open-label, but those doing tumour assessments were masked to treatment assignment.We assessed objective responses per-protocol after 120 patients had been treated with nivolumab and had a minimum follow-up of 24 weeks, and safety in all patients who had had at least one dose of treatment.The trial is closed and this is the first interim analysis, reporting the objective response primary endpoint.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01721746.FINDINGS: Between Dec 21, 2012, and Jan 10, 2014, we screened 631 patients, randomly allocating 272 patients to nivolumab and 133 to ICC.Confirmed objective responses were reported in 38 (31.7%, 95% CI 23.5-40.8) of the first 120 patients in the nivolumab group versus five (10.6%, 3.5-23.1) of 47 patients in the ICC group.Grade 3-4 adverse events related to nivolumab included increased lipase (three [1%] of 268 patients), increased alanine aminotransferase, anaemia, and fatigue (two [1%] each); for ICC, these included neutropenia (14 [14%] of 102), thrombocytopenia (six [6%]), and anaemia (five [5%]).We noted grade 3-4 drug-related serious adverse events in 12 (5%) nivolumab-treated patients and nine (9%) patients in the ICC group.No treatment-related deaths occurred.INTERPRETATION: Nivolumab led to a greater proportion of patients achieving an objective response and fewer toxic effects than with alternative available chemotherapy regimens for patients with advanced melanoma that has progressed after ipilimumab or ipilimumab and a BRAF inhibitor.Nivolumab represents a new treatment option with clinically meaningful durable objective responses in a population of high unmet need.FUNDING: Bristol-Myers Squibb.",1,1,1,1
27114605,"Response to Cetuximab With or Without Irinotecan in Patients With Refractory Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Harboring the KRAS G13D Mutation: Australasian Gastro-Intestinal Trials Group ICECREAM Study.PURPOSE: RAS mutations predict lack of response to epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody therapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), but preclinical studies and retrospective clinical data suggest that patients with tumors harboring the exon 2 KRAS G13D mutation may benefit from cetuximab.We aimed to assess cetuximab monotherapy and cetuximab plus irinotecan in patients with molecularly selected (G13D mutation) chemotherapy-refractory mCRC in a randomized phase II trial of this rare molecular subtype.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with chemotherapy-refractory KRAS G13D mutation-positive mCRC who had progressed within 6 months of irinotecan therapy were randomly assigned to cetuximab 400 mg/m(2) loading dose and then 250 mg/m(2) once per week with or without irinotecan 180 mg/m(2) once every 2 weeks.The primary end point was 6-month progression-free survival; secondary end points were response rate, overall survival, quality of life, and toxicity.RESULTS: Fifty-one of 53 patients recruited over 2 years were eligible.The 6-month progression-free survival rate was 10% (95% CI, 2% to 26%) for cetuximab versus 23% (95% CI, 9% to 40%) for cetuximab plus irinotecan with a hazard ratio of 0.74 (95% CI, 0.42 to 1.32).Response and stable disease rates were 0% and 58% for monotherapy versus 9% and 70% for combination treatment, respectively.Overall survival and quality of life were similar; toxicities were higher with combination therapy.CONCLUSION: In patients with G13D-mutated chemotherapy-refractory mCRC, there was no statistically significant improvement in disease control at 6 months with either cetuximab monotherapy or cetuximab plus irinotecan.No responses were seen with single-agent cetuximab.The responses observed with the combination of cetuximab and irinotecan may reflect true drug synergy or persistent irinotecan sensitivity.The ICECREAM (Irinotecan Cetuximab Evaluation and Cetuximab Response Evaluation Among Patients with a G13D Mutation) study demonstrates the need to prospectively evaluate hypotheses that were previously supported by retrospective analyses and exemplifies the value of international collaboration in trials of rare molecular subtypes.",1,1,1,1
27498129,"Toxicity of dual HER2-blockade with pertuzumab added to anthracycline versus non-anthracycline containing chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment in HER2-positive breast cancer: The TRAIN-2 study.BACKGROUND: The addition of pertuzumab to neoadjuvant trastuzumab-based chemotherapy improves pathologic complete response rates in HER2-positive breast cancer.However, increased toxicity has been reported with the addition of pertuzumab, and this may differ between various chemotherapy backbone regimens.We evaluated toxicities of pertuzumab when added to either FEC-T (5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide, trastuzumab) or weekly paclitaxel, trastuzumab, carboplatin (PTC).METHODS: The TRAIN-2 study is a neoadjuvant randomized controlled trial in stage II and III HER2-positive breast cancer (NCT01996267).Patients are randomly assigned to receive either three cycles of FEC-T plus pertuzumab or three cycles of PTC plus pertuzumab, followed by six cycles of PTC plus pertuzumab in both arms.Toxicities are described per treatment arm according to the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03.RESULTS: This analysis includes 110 patients balanced over both treatment arms.Neutropenia was the most common hematologic toxicity, with grade 3-4 occurring in 53% in the FEC-T-arm and in 51% in the PTC-arm.Febrile neutropenia occurred in 9% in the FEC-T arm and did not occur in the PTC-arm.Secondary G-CSF prophylaxis was used in 35-40% of patients.Asymptomatic ejection fraction decrease grade 2 was observed in 24% in the FEC-T-arm and 11% in the PTC-arm.The most common grade 3-4 non-hematologic toxicity was diarrhea (5% in the FEC-T-arm and 18% in the PTC-arm).CONCLUSIONS: Pertuzumab in combination with FEC-T mostly causes neutropenia, and when added to PTC mostly causes diarrhea.Significant cardiac toxicity is rare with both regimens, and toxicity is overall well manageable.",1,1,1,1

24105750,"A randomized study of interferon alpha-2b versus no treatment as consolidation after high dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation for patients with relapsed lymphoma.Patients with lymphoma who have experienced a first relapse or progression and have disease deemed sensitive to salvage chemotherapy nevertheless have a high likelihood of having a second relapse.To decrease the likelihood of a second relapse after high-dose therapy (HDT) and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT), interferon (IFN) alpha-2b was given in a prospective randomized international trial.Methods.In this trial, 221 patients with varying histologic diagnoses (8 small lymphocytic, 37 follicular, 9 mantle, 90 diffuse large B-cell, 20 peripheral T-cell, 3 high-grade B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and 54 Hodgkin lymphoma) were randomly assigned to receive no further treatment (arm A: 117 patients) or IFNalpha-2b, 3 MU three times weekly, for 18 months (arm B: 104 patients).Results.In arm B, 21 patients (20%) did not receive IFNalpha-2b because of early progression or absence of hematologic recovery, 29 patients (28%) completed the 18 months of treatment, and 54 patients (52%) interrupted treatment because of progression (23%) or toxicity (29%).Event-free survival and overall survival were not different between the two arms on an intent-to-treat analysis and also if analysis was restricted to patients who were alive and had not experienced disease progression three months after transplantation.The study was not sufficiently powered to evaluate effects in histologic subtypes.Conclusion.In this trial, post-autograft IFNalpha-2b did not improve outcomes in a heterogeneous group of patients with lymphoma.",1,1,1,0
29413685,"PICCA study: panitumumab in combination with cisplatin/gemcitabine chemotherapy in KRAS wild-type patients with biliary cancer-a randomised biomarker-driven clinical phase II AIO study.BACKGROUND: Combination chemotherapy has shown benefit in the treatment of biliary cancer and further improvements might be achieved by the addition of a biological agent.We report here the effect of chemotherapy with the monoclonal EGFR antibody panitumumab as therapy for KRAS wild-type biliary cancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with advanced biliary tract cancer were randomised (2:1) to receive cisplatin 25 mg/m(2) and gemcitabine 1000 mg/m(2) on day 1 and day 8/q3w with (arm A) or without panitumumab (arm B; 9 mg/kg BW, i.v q3w).The primary end-point was the evaluation of progression-free survival (PFS) at 6 months.Secondary end-points included objective response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), and toxicity.In addition, a post hoc assessment of genetic alterations was performed.Finally, we performed a meta-analysis of trials with chemotherapy with and without EGFR antibodies.RESULTS: Sixty-two patients were randomised in arm A and 28 patients in arm B. Patients received 7 treatment cycles in median (1-35) with a median treatment duration of 4.7 months (141 days, 8-765).PFS rate at 6 months was 54% in patients treated with cisplatin/gemcitabine and panitumumab but was 73% in patients treated with cisplatin/gemcitabine without antibody, respectively.Secondary end-points were an ORR of 45% in treatment arm A compared with 39% receiving treatment B and a median OS of 12.8 months (arm A) and of 20.1 months (arm B), respectively.In contrast to the p53-status, genetic alterations in IDH1/2 were linked to a high response after chemotherapy and prolonged survival.In accordance with our results, the meta-analysis of 12 trials did not reveal a survival advantage for patients treated with EGFR antibodies compared with chemotherapy alone.CONCLUSIONS: Panitumumab in combination with chemotherapy does not improve ORR, PFS and OS in patients with KRAS wild-type, advanced biliary cancer.Genetic profiling should be included in CCA trials to identify and validate predictive and prognostic biomarkers.CLINICAL TRIALS NUMBER: The trial was registered with NCT01320254.",1,1,1,1
28796885,"Photodynamic therapy is more effective than imiquimod for actinic keratosis in organ transplant recipients: a randomized intraindividual controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Actinic keratoses (AKs) in solid organ transplant recipients (OTRs) are difficult-to-treat premalignancies and comparison of topical therapies is therefore warranted.OBJECTIVES: In an intraindividual study to compare the efficacy and safety of field treatment with methyl aminolaevulinate photodynamic therapy (MAL-PDT) and imiquimod (IMIQ) for AKs in OTRs.METHODS: OTRs (n = 35) with 572 AKs (grade I-III) in two similar areas on the face, scalp, dorsal hands or forearms were included.All patients received one MAL-PDT and one IMIQ session (three applications per week for 4 weeks) in each study area according to randomization.Treatments were repeated after 2 months (IMIQ) and 3 months (PDT) in skin with incomplete AK response.Outcome measures were complete lesion response (CR), skin reactions, laboratory results and treatment preference.RESULTS: The majority of study areas received two treatment sessions (PDT n = 25 patients; IMIQ n = 29 patients).At 3 months after two treatments, skin treated with PDT achieved a higher rate of CR (AK I-III median 78%; range 50-100) compared with IMIQ-treated skin areas (median 61%, range 33-100; P < 0.001).Fewer emergent AKs were seen in PDT-treated skin vs. IMIQ-treated skin (0.7 vs. 1.5 AKs, P = 0.04).Patients developed more intense inflammatory skin reactions following PDT, which resolved more rapidly compared with IMIQ (median 10 days vs. 18 days, P < 0.01).Patient preference (P = 0.47) and cosmesis (P > 0.30) were similar for PDT and IMIQ.CONCLUSIONS: Compared with IMIQ, PDT treatment obtained a higher rate of AK clearance at 3-month follow-up and achieved shorter-lasting, but more intense, short-term skin reactions.",0,0,0,0
28961845,"Borealis-1: a randomized, first-line, placebo-controlled, phase II study evaluating apatorsen and chemotherapy for patients with advanced urothelial cancer.Background: Five-year survival of patients with inoperable, advanced urothelial carcinoma treated with the first-line chemotherapy is 5%-15%.We assessed whether the Hsp27 inhibitor apatorsen combined with gemcitabine plus cisplatin (GC) could improve overall survival (OS) in these patients.Patients and methods: This placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase II trial randomized 183 untreated urothelial carcinoma patients (North America and Europe) to receive GC plus either placebo (N = 62), 600 mg apatorsen (N = 60), or 1000 mg apatorsen (N = 61).In the experimental arm, treatment included loading doses of apatorsen followed by up to six cycles of apatorsen plus GC.Patients receiving at least four cycles could continue apatorsen monotherapy as maintenance until progression or unacceptable toxicity.The primary end point was OS.Results: OS was not significantly improved in the single or combined 600- or 1000-mg apatorsen arms versus placebo [hazard ratio (HR), 0.86 and 0.90, respectively].Exploratory study of specific statistical modeling showed a trend for improved survival in patients with baseline poor prognostic features treated with 600 mg apatorsen compared with placebo (HR = 0.72).Landmark analysis of serum Hsp27 (sHsp27) levels showed a trend toward survival benefit for poor-prognosis patients in 600- and 1000-mg apatorsen arms who achieved lower area under the curve sHsp27 levels, compared with the placebo arm (HR = 0.45 and 0.62, respectively).Higher baseline circulating tumor cells (>/=5 cells/7.5 ml) was observed in patients with poor prognosis in correlation with poor survival.Treatment-emergent adverse events were manageable and more common in both apatorsen-treatment arms.Conclusions: Even though apatorsen combined with standard chemotherapy did not demonstrate a survival benefit in the overall study population, patients with poor prognostic features might benefit from this combination.Serum Hsp27 levels may act as a biomarker to predict treatment outcome.Further exploration of apatorsen in poor-risk patients is warranted.",1,1,1,1

28743247,"A randomized phase II study of paclitaxel alone versus paclitaxel plus sorafenib in second- and third-line treatment of patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer (PASO).BACKGROUND: We conducted an open-label, randomized, two-arm multi-center study to assess the efficacy and safety of paclitaxel versus paclitaxel + sorafenib in patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer.METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive either paclitaxel monotherapy (80 mg/m(2)) weekly (3 weeks on, 1 week off) plus sorafenib 400 mg orally, twice a day taken continuously throughout 28 day cycles.Sorafenib dose was gradually escalated from a starting dose of 200 mg twice a day.The primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS).RESULTS: A pre-planned efficacy interim analysis was performed on the data of 60 patients, 30 patients in each treatment arm.Median PFS was estimated at 6.6 months (95% CI: 5.1 to 9.0) in patients randomized to single-agent paclitaxel (Arm A) and 5.6 months (95% CI: 3.8 to 6.5) in patients randomized to paclitaxel-sorafenib combination (Arm B) therapy.Contrary to the hypothesis, the treatment effect was statistically significant in favor of paclitaxel monotherapy (hazard ratio 1.80, 95% CI: 1.02 to 3.20; log-rank test P = 0.0409).It was decided to stop the trial early for futility.Median OS was also in favor of Arm A (20.7 months (95% CI: 16.4 to 26.7) versus 12.1 months (95% CI: 5.8 to 20.4) in Arm B. Clinical control was achieved in 28 patients (93.3%) in Arm A and in 21 patients 70.0% in Arm B. Overall response rate was met in 43.3% of patients in Arm A and in 40.0% in Arm B. Toxicities were increased in Arm B with higher rates of diarrhea, nausea, neutropenia, hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) and anorexia, Grad 3 and 4 toxicities were rare.CONCLUSIONS: In this pre-planned interim analysis, paclitaxel-sorafenib combination therapy was not found to be superior to paclitaxel monotherapy with regard to the primary end point, progression-free survival.The trial was therefore discontinued early.There was no indication of more favorable outcomes for combination therapy in secondary efficacy end points.As expected, the safety and toxicity profile of the combination therapy was less favorable compared to monotherapy.Overall, this trial did not demonstrate that adding sorafenib to second- or third-line paclitaxel provides any clinical benefit to patients with HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer.Cautious dosing using a sorafenib ramp up schedule might have contributed to negative results.TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered at EudraCT (No 2009-018025-73) and retrospectively registered at Clinical trials.gov on March 17, 2011 ( NCT01320111 ).",1,1,1,1

22847995,"Pilot, randomized trial of resistance exercise during radiation therapy for head and neck cancer.BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility of a randomized trial of resistance exercise in patients with head and neck cancer receiving radiation.METHODS: Fifteen patients with head and neck cancer receiving radiation were randomized to resistance exercise (using resistance bands) or control group.Resistance exercise occurred at the radiation therapy site (weeks 1-6) and home (weeks 7-12).RESULTS: No serious adverse events occurred related to resistance exercise.Medium to large effect size differences favoring resistance exercise versus control group were noted for perceived fatigue at 6 weeks (smaller increase in fatigue for resistance exercise group; 7.4 vs 15.4, effect size [d] = -0.64), quality of life at 6 weeks (-7.0 vs -14.4, d = 0.52), and chair rise time (seconds) at 6 and 12 weeks (-1.6 vs 0.4, d = -.63 and -1.9 vs 0.1, d = -0.60, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: Resistance exercise is safe and feasible in patients with head and neck cancer receiving radiation; a definitive trial is warranted.",0,0,0,0
25213161,"Randomized phase III trial of regorafenib in metastatic colorectal cancer: analysis of the CORRECT Japanese and non-Japanese subpopulations.BACKGROUND: In the international, phase III, randomized, double-blind CORRECT trial, regorafenib significantly prolonged overall survival (OS) versus placebo in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) that had progressed on all standard therapies.This post hoc analysis evaluated the efficacy and safety of regorafenib in Japanese and non-Japanese subpopulations in the CORRECT trial.METHODS: Patients were randomized 2 : 1 to regorafenib 160 mg once daily or placebo for weeks 1-3 of each 4-week cycle.The primary endpoint was OS.Outcomes were assessed using descriptive statistics.RESULTS: One hundred Japanese and 660 non-Japanese patients were randomized to regorafenib (n = 67 and n = 438) or placebo (n = 33 and n = 222).Regorafenib had a consistent OS benefit in the Japanese and non-Japanese subpopulations, with hazard ratios of 0.81 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.43-1.51) and 0.77 (95 % CI 0.62-0.94), respectively.Regorafenib-associated hand-foot skin reaction, hypertension, proteinuria, thrombocytopenia, and lipase elevations occurred more frequently in the Japanese subpopulation than in the non-Japanese subpopulation, but were generally manageable.CONCLUSION: Regorafenib appears to have comparable efficacy in Japanese and non-Japanese subpopulations, with a manageable adverse-event profile, suggesting that this agent could potentially become a standard of care in patients with mCRC.",0,0,0,0
29852043,"Effect of Adjuvant Trastuzumab for a Duration of 9 Weeks vs 1 Year With Concomitant Chemotherapy for Early Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2-Positive Breast Cancer: The SOLD Randomized Clinical Trial.Importance: Trastuzumab plus chemotherapy is the standard adjuvant treatment for patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive early breast cancer.While the standard duration of trastuzumab treatment is 12 months, the benefits and harms of trastuzumab continued beyond the chemotherapy are unclear.Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of adjuvant trastuzumab continued beyond chemotherapy in women treated with up-front chemotherapy containing a taxane and trastuzumab.Design, Setting, and Participants: Open-label, randomized (1:1) clinical trial including women with HER2-positive breast cancer.Chemotherapy was identical in the 2 groups, consisting of 3 cycles of 3-weekly docetaxel (either 80 or 100 mg/m2) plus trastuzumab for 9 weeks, followed by 3 cycles of fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide.Thereafter, no trastuzumab was administered in the 9-week group, whereas controls received trastuzumab to complete 1 year of administration.Disease-free survival (DFS) was compared between the groups using a Cox model and the noninferiority approach.The estimated sample size was 2168 patients (1-sided testing, with a relative noninferiority margin of 1.3).From January 3, 2008, to December 16, 2014, 2176 patients were accrued from 7 countries.Intervention: Docetaxel plus trastuzumab for 9 weeks, followed by 3 cycles of fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide in both groups.Controls continued trastuzumab to 1 year.Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary objective was DFS; secondary objectives included distant disease-free survival, overall survival, cardiac DFS, and safety.Results: In the 2174 women analyzed, median age was 56 (interquartile range [IQR], 48-64) years.The median follow-up was 5.2 (IQR, 3.8-6.7) years.Noninferiority of the 9-week treatment could not be demonstrated for DFS (hazard ratio, 1.39; 2-sided 90% CI, 1.12-1.72).Distant disease-free survival and overall survival did not differ substantially between the groups.Thirty-six (3%) and 21 (2%) patients in the 1-year and the 9-week groups, respectively, had cardiac failure; the left ventricle ejection fraction was better maintained in the 9-week group.An interaction was detected between the docetaxel dose and DFS; patients in the 9-week group treated with 80 mg/m2 had inferior and those treated with 100 mg/m2 had similar DFS as patients in the 1-year group.Conclusions and Relevance: Nine weeks of trastuzumab was not noninferior to 1 year of trastuzumab when given with similar chemotherapy.Cardiac safety was better in the 9-week group.The docetaxel dosing with trastuzumab requires further study.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00593697.",1,1,1,1
28244415,"A Randomized Phase 2 Trial of Prophylactic Manuka Honey for the Reduction of Chemoradiation Therapy-Induced Esophagitis During the Treatment of Lung Cancer: Results of NRG Oncology RTOG 1012.PURPOSE: Randomized trials have shown that honey is effective for the prevention of radiation-induced mucositis in head and neck cancer patients.Because there is no efficacious preventative for radiation esophagitis in lung cancer patients, this trial compared liquid honey, honey lozenges, and standard supportive care for radiation esophagitis.METHODS: The patients were stratified by percentage of esophagus receiving specific radiation dose (V60 Gy esophagus <30% or >/=30%) and were then randomized between supportive care, 10 mL of liquid manuka honey 4 times a day, and 2 lozenges (10 mL of dehydrated manuka honey) 4 times a day during concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy.The primary endpoint was patient-reported pain on swallowing, with the use of an 11-point (0-10) scale at 4 weeks (Numerical Rating Pain Scale, NRPS).The study was designed to detect a 15% relative reduction of change in NRPS score.The secondary endpoints were trend of pain over time, opioid use, clinically graded and patient-reported adverse events, weight loss, dysphagia, nutritional status, and quality of life.RESULTS: 53 patients were randomized to supportive care, 54 were randomized to liquid honey, and 56 were randomized to lozenge honey.There was no significant difference in the primary endpoint of change in the NRPS at 4 weeks between arms.There were no differences in any of the secondary endpoints except for opioid use at 4 weeks during treatment between the supportive care and liquid honey arms, which was found to be significant (P=.03), with more patients on the supportive care arm taking opioids.CONCLUSION: Honey as prescribed within this protocol was not superior to best supportive care in preventing radiation esophagitis.Further testing of other types of honey and research into the mechanisms of action are needed.",0,0,0,0
23871490,"2 years versus 1 year of adjuvant trastuzumab for HER2-positive breast cancer (HERA): an open-label, randomised controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Trastuzumab has established efficacy against breast cancer with overexpression or amplification of the HER2 oncogene.The standard of care is 1 year of adjuvant trastuzumab, but the optimum duration of treatment is unknown.We compared 2 years of treatment with trastuzumab with 1 year of treatment, and updated the comparison of 1 year of trastuzumab versus observation at a median follow-up of 8 years, for patients enrolled in the HERceptin Adjuvant (HERA) trial.METHODS: The HERA trial is an international, multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial comparing treatment with trastuzumab for 1 and 2 years with observation after standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy, adjuvant chemotherapy, or both in 5102 patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer.The primary endpoint was disease-free survival.The comparison of 2 years versus 1 year of trastuzumab treatment involved a landmark analysis of 3105 patients who were disease-free 12 months after randomisation to one of the trastuzumab groups, and was planned after observing at least 725 disease-free survival events.The updated intention-to-treat comparison of 1 year trastuzumab treatment versus observation alone in 3399 patients at a median follow-up of 8 years (range 0-10) is also reported.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00045032.FINDINGS: We recorded 367 events of disease-free survival in 1552 patients in the 1 year group and 367 events in 1553 patients in the 2 year group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.99, 95% CI 0.85-1.14, p=0.86).Grade 3-4 adverse events and decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction during treatment were reported more frequently in the 2 year treatment group than in the 1 year group (342 [20.4%] vs 275 [16.3%] grade 3-4 adverse events, and 120 [7.2%] vs 69 [4.1%] decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction, respectively).HRs for a comparison of 1 year of trastuzumab treatment versus observation were 0.76 (95% CI 0.67-0.86, p<0.0001) for disease-free survival and 0.76 (0.65-0.88, p=0.0005) for overall survival, despite crossover of 884 (52%) patients from the observation group to trastuzumab therapy.INTERPRETATION: 2 years of adjuvant trastuzumab is not more effective than is 1 year of treatment for patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer.1 year of treatment provides a significant disease-free and overall survival benefit compared with observation and remains the standard of care.FUNDING: F Hoffmann-La Roche (Roche).",1,1,1,1

23657629,"Activation, dysfunction and retention of T cells in vaccine sites after injection of incomplete Freund's adjuvant, with or without peptide.We conducted a randomized clinical trial in 45 patients with resected AJCC stage IIB-IV melanoma to characterize cellular and molecular events at sites of immunization with incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) alone, or a melanoma vaccine in IFA.At a primary vaccine site, all patients received a multi-peptide melanoma vaccine in IFA.At a replicate vaccine site, which was biopsied, group 1 received IFA only; group 2 received vaccine in IFA.Lymphocytes isolated from replicate vaccine site microenvironments (VSME) were compared to time-matched peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in ELISpot and flow cytometry assays.Compared to PBMC, the VSME had fewer naive and greater proportions of effector memory CD8(+) T cells (TCD8).The vast majority of TCD8 within the VSME were activated (CD69(+)), with a concentration of antigen-specific (tetramer(pos)) cells in the VSME, particularly in vaccine sites with peptide (group 2).CXCR3(+) lymphocytes were concentrated in the VSME of all patients, suggesting IFA-induced chemokine recruitment.TCD8 expression of retention integrins alphaEbeta7 and alpha1beta1 was elevated in VSME, with the highest levels observed in antigen-specific cells in VSME containing peptide (group 2).TCD8 retained in the VSME of both groups were strikingly dysfunctional, with minimal IFN-gamma production in response to peptide stimulation and few tetramer(pos) cells producing IFN-gamma.These data suggest that vaccine-induced selective retention and dysfunction of antigen-specific TCD8 within VSME may represent a significant mechanism underlying transient immune responses and low clinical response rates to peptide vaccines administered in IFA.",0,0,0,0
24840109,"Luteal phase clomiphene citrate for ovulation induction in women with polycystic ovary syndrome.PURPOSE: The aim was to test a new protocol of luteal phase administration of clomiphene citrate (CC) for ovulation induction in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).METHODS: This was a prospective, randomized, controlled trial.Two hundred and fifty-two women (cycles) with PCOS were utilized to create two groups.Patients in Group 1 (126 patients) received 100 mg of CC daily for 5 days starting on day 5 of menses, and patients in Group 2 (126 patients) received 100 mg of CC daily for 5 days starting the next day after finishing medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) (before withdrawal bleeding).The main outcome measures were the number of growing and mature follicles, serum E2 (in pg/mL), serum progesterone (in ng/mL) levels, endometrial thickness (in mm), pregnancy, and miscarriage rates.RESULTS: The total number of follicles and the number of follicles >/=14 mm during stimulation were significantly greater in Group 2.The endometrial thickness at the time of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) administration was significantly greater in Group 2 as compared to Group 1 (7.84 +/- 1.22 and 8.81 +/- 0.9, respectively).Serum E2 levels were also significantly higher (p < 0.05) in Group 2 as compared to Group 1 (449.61 +/- 243.45 vs. 666.09 +/-153.41 pg/mL).Pregnancy occurred in 13 patients (10.3 %) in Group 2 and in 11 patients (8.7 %) in Group 1.The difference was not statistically significant.CONCLUSION: Luteal phase administration of CC in patients with PCOS leads to increased follicular growth and endometrial thickness, which might result in a higher pregnancy rate.",0,0,0,0
26681677,"Association between PSA kinetics and cancer-specific mortality in patients with localised prostate cancer: analysis of the placebo arm of the SPCG-6 study.BACKGROUND: The prognostic value of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) kinetics in untreated prostate cancer (PCa) patients is debatable.We investigated the association between PSA doubling time (PSAdt), PSA velocity (PSAvel) and PSAvel risk count (PSAvRC) and PCa mortality in a cohort of patients with localised PCa managed on watchful waiting.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with clinically localised PCa managed observationally, who were randomised to and remained on placebo for minimum 18 months in the SPCG-6 study, were included.All patients survived at least 2 years and had a minimum of three PSA determinations available.The prognostic value of PSA kinetics was analysed and patients were stratified according to their PSA at consent: </=10, 10.1-25, and >25 ng/ml.Cumulative incidences of PCa-specific mortality were estimated with the Aalen-Johansen method.RESULTS: Two hundred and sixty-three patients were included of which 116, 76 and 71 had a PSA at consent </=10, 10.1-25, and >25 ng/ml, respectively.Median follow-up was 13.6 years.For patients with PSA at consent between 10.1 and 25 ng/ml, the 13-year risks of PCa mortality were associated with PSA kinetics: PSAdt </=3 years: 62.0% versus PSAdt >3 years: 16.3% (Gray's test: P < 0.0001), PSAvel >/=2 ng/ml/year: 48.0% versus PSAvel <2 ng/ml/year: 11.0% (Gray's test: P = 0.0008), and PSAvRC 2: 45.0% versus 0-1: 3.8% (Gray's test: P = 0.001).In contrast, none of the PSA kinetics were significantly associated with changes of 13-year risks of PCa mortality in patients with PSA at consent </=10 or >25 ng/ml.CONCLUSION: We found that magnitude changes in 13-year risks of PCa mortality that can be indicated by PSA kinetics depend on PSA level in patients with localised PCa who were managed observationally.Our results question PSA kinetics as surrogate marker for PCa mortality in patients with low and high PSA values.CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: NCT00672282.",0,0,0,0
31200828,"Selumetinib in patients receiving standard pemetrexed and platinum-based chemotherapy for advanced or metastatic KRAS wildtype or unknown non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer: A randomized, multicenter, phase II study. Canadian Cancer Trials Group (CCTG) IND.219.INTRODUCTION: Activation of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway may confer resistance to chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Selumetinib (AZD6244, ARRY142886), a MEK1/2 inhibitor combined with chemotherapy in patients with NSCLC was evaluated in two schedules to evaluate efficacy and toxicity.METHODS: IND.219 was a three-arm study of first line pemetrexed/platinum chemotherapy with two schedules of selumetinib (Arm A: intermittent given on days 2-19; Arm B: continuous given on days 1-21) versus chemotherapy alone (Arm C).The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR); secondary objectives were tolerability, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS).The trial was stopped at the planned interim analysis.RESULTS: Arms A/B/C enrolled 20/21/21 patients, ORR was 35% (95% CI 15-59% median duration 3.8 months), 62% (95% CI 38-82%; median duration 6.3 months), 24% (95% CI 8-47%; median duration 11.6 months) respectively.The PFS (months Arm A, B, C) was 7.5, 6.7, 4.0 respectively (hazard ratio (HR) PFS Arm A over Arm C: 0.76 [95% CI, 0.38-1.51, 2-sided p = 0.42]; Arm B over Arm C 0.75 [95% CI 0.37-1.54, p = 0.43].Skin and gastrointestinal adverse events were more common with the addition of selumetinib.A high incidence of venous thromboembolism was seen in all arms.CONCLUSIONS: Selumetinib combined with chemotherapy was associated with a higher response rate.Continuous selumetinib appeared to be superior to an intermittent schedule.PFS was prolonged with the addition of selumetinib, however this was not statistically significant.",1,1,1,1
29768118,"Final Overall Survival Analysis From a Study Comparing First-Line Crizotinib Versus Chemotherapy in ALK-Mutation-Positive Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.Purpose The phase III PROFILE 1014 trial compared crizotinib with chemotherapy as first-line treatment in patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) -positive advanced nonsquamous non-small-cell lung cancer.Here, we report the final overall survival (OS) results.Patients and Methods Patients were randomly assigned to receive oral crizotinib 250 mg twice daily (n = 172) or intravenous pemetrexed 500 mg/m(2) plus cisplatin 75 mg/m(2) or carboplatin (area under the concentration-time curve of 5 to 6 mg.mL/min) every 3 weeks for a maximum of six cycles (n = 171).Crossover to crizotinib was permitted after disease progression.OS was analyzed using a stratified log-rank test and a prespecified rank-preserving structural failure time model to account for crossover.Results Median follow-up duration for OS was approximately 46 months for both arms.In the chemotherapy arm, 144 patients (84.2%) received crizotinib in subsequent lines.Hazard ratio for OS was 0.760 (95% CI, 0.548 to 1.053; two-sided P = .0978).Median OS was not reached (NR) with crizotinib (95% CI, 45.8 months to NR) and 47.5 months with chemotherapy (95% CI, 32.2 months to NR).Survival probability at 4 years was 56.6% (95% CI, 48.3% to 64.1%) with crizotinib and 49.1% (95% CI, 40.5% to 57.1%) with chemotherapy.After crossover adjustment, there was an improvement in OS that favored crizotinib (hazard ratio, 0.346; 95% bootstrap CI, 0.081 to 0.718).The longest OS was observed in crizotinib-treated patients who received a subsequent ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor.No new safety signals were identified.Conclusion The final analysis of the PROFILE 1014 study provides a new benchmark for OS in patients with ALK-rearranged non-small-cell lung cancer and highlights the benefit of crizotinib for prolonging survival in this patient population.",1,1,1,1

25712685,"Rilotumumab exposure-response relationship in patients with advanced or metastatic gastric cancer.PURPOSE: Rilotumumab is an investigational, fully human monoclonal antibody to hepatocyte growth factor.In a randomized phase II study, trends toward improved survival were observed with rilotumumab (7.5 or 15 mg/kg) plus epirubicin, cisplatin, and capecitabine (ECX) versus placebo plus ECX in gastric/gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer patients, especially in MET-positive patients.Here, we quantitatively characterized the longitudinal exposure-response [tumor growth (TG) and overall survival (OS)] relationship for rilotumumab.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Rilotumumab concentrations, tumor sizes, and survival time from the phase II study were pooled to develop a longitudinal exposure versus TG model and parametric OS model that explored predictive/prognostic/treatment effects (MET expression, rilotumumab exposure, relative tumor size).Model evaluation included visual predictive checks, nonparametric bootstrap, and normalized prediction distribution errors.Simulations were undertaken to predict the relationship between rilotumumab dose and OS.RESULTS: Rilotumumab exhibited linear time-independent pharmacokinetics not affected by MET expression.The TG model adequately described tumor size across arms.A Weibull distribution best described OS.Rilotumumab exposure and change in tumor size from baseline at week 24 were predictive of OS.MET-positive patients showed shorter survival and responded better to rilotumumab than MET-negative patients.Simulations predicted a median (95% confidence interval) HR of 0.38 (0.18-0.60) in MET-positive patients treated with 15 mg/kg rilotumumab Q3W.CONCLUSIONS: Rilotumumab plus ECX demonstrated concentration-dependent effects on OS, influenced by MET expression, and tumor size in gastric/GEJ cancer patients.These findings support the phase II testing of rilotumumab 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks in MET-positive gastric/GEJ cancer (RILOMET-1; NCT01697072).",0,0,0,0
30215676,"Alectinib versus crizotinib in treatment-naive anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive (ALK+) non-small-cell lung cancer: CNS efficacy results from the ALEX study.Background: The phase III ALEX study in patients with treatment-naive advanced anaplastic lymphoma kinase mutation-positive (ALK+) non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) met its primary end point of improved progression-free survival (PFS) with alectinib versus crizotinib.Here, we present detailed central nervous system (CNS) efficacy data from ALEX.Patients and methods: Overall, 303 patients aged >/=18 years underwent 1:1 randomization to receive twice-daily doses of alectinib 600 mg or crizotinib 250 mg.Brain imaging was conducted in all patients at baseline and every subsequent 8 weeks.End points (analyzed by subgroup: patients with/without baseline CNS metastases; patients with/without prior radiotherapy) included PFS, CNS objective response rate (ORR), and time to CNS progression.Results: In total, 122 patients had Independent Review Committee-assessed baseline CNS metastases (alectinib, n = 64; crizotinib, n = 58), 43 had measurable lesions (alectinib, n = 21; crizotinib, n = 22), and 46 had received prior radiotherapy (alectinib, n = 25; crizotinib, n = 21).Investigator-assessed PFS with alectinib was consistent between patients with baseline CNS metastases [hazard ratio (HR) 0.40, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.25-0.64] and those without (HR 0.51, 95% CI: 0.33-0.80, P interaction = 0.36).Similar results were seen in patients regardless of prior radiotherapy.Time to CNS progression was significantly longer with alectinib versus crizotinib and comparable between patients with and without baseline CNS metastases (P < 0.0001).CNS ORR was 85.7% with alectinib versus 71.4% with crizotinib in patients who received prior radiotherapy and 78.6% versus 40.0%, respectively, in those who had not.Conclusion: Alectinib demonstrated superior CNS activity and significantly delayed CNS progression versus crizotinib in patients with previously untreated, advanced ALK+ NSCLC, irrespective of prior CNS disease or radiotherapy.Clinical trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02075840.",1,1,1,1
23850170,"Which patients benefit most from primary surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy in stage IIIC or IV ovarian cancer? An exploratory analysis of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer 55971 randomised trial.BACKGROUND: To investigate whether biomarkers consisting of baseline characteristics of advanced stage ovarian cancer patients can help in identifying subgroups of patients who would benefit more from primary surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy.METHODS: We used data of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 55971 trial in which 670 patients were randomly assigned to primary surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy.The primary outcome was overall survival.Ten baseline clinical and pathological characteristics were selected as potential biomarkers.Using Subpopulation Treatment Effect Pattern Plots (STEPP), biomarkers with a statistically significant qualitative additive interaction with treatment were considered as potentially informative for treatment selection.We also combined selected biomarkers to form a multimarker treatment selection rule.FINDINGS: The size of the largest metastatic tumour and clinical stage were significantly associated with the magnitude of the benefit from treatment, in terms of five-year survival (p for interaction: 0.008 and 0.016, respectively).Stage IIIC patients with metastatic tumours 45 mm benefited more from primary surgery while stage IV patients with metastatic tumours >45 mm benefited more from neoadjuvant chemotherapy.In stage IIIC patients with larger metastatic tumours and in stage IV patients with less extensive metastatic tumours both treatments were equally effective.We estimated that by selecting treatments for patients based on largest metastatic tumour and clinical stage, the potential five-year survival rate in the population of treated patients would be 27.3% (95% confidence interval (CI) 21.9-33.0), 7.8% higher than if all were treated with primary surgery, and 5.6% higher if all were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.INTERPRETATION: Although survival was comparable after primary surgery and neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the overall group of patients with ovarian cancer in the EORTC 55971 trial, we found in this exploratory analysis that patients with stage IIIC and less extensive metastatic tumours had higher survival with primary surgery, while patients with stage IV disease and large metastatic tumours had higher survival with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.For patients who did not meet these criteria, both treatment options led to comparable survival rates.",0,0,0,0
27498129,"Toxicity of dual HER2-blockade with pertuzumab added to anthracycline versus non-anthracycline containing chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment in HER2-positive breast cancer: The TRAIN-2 study.BACKGROUND: The addition of pertuzumab to neoadjuvant trastuzumab-based chemotherapy improves pathologic complete response rates in HER2-positive breast cancer.However, increased toxicity has been reported with the addition of pertuzumab, and this may differ between various chemotherapy backbone regimens.We evaluated toxicities of pertuzumab when added to either FEC-T (5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide, trastuzumab) or weekly paclitaxel, trastuzumab, carboplatin (PTC).METHODS: The TRAIN-2 study is a neoadjuvant randomized controlled trial in stage II and III HER2-positive breast cancer (NCT01996267).Patients are randomly assigned to receive either three cycles of FEC-T plus pertuzumab or three cycles of PTC plus pertuzumab, followed by six cycles of PTC plus pertuzumab in both arms.Toxicities are described per treatment arm according to the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03.RESULTS: This analysis includes 110 patients balanced over both treatment arms.Neutropenia was the most common hematologic toxicity, with grade 3-4 occurring in 53% in the FEC-T-arm and in 51% in the PTC-arm.Febrile neutropenia occurred in 9% in the FEC-T arm and did not occur in the PTC-arm.Secondary G-CSF prophylaxis was used in 35-40% of patients.Asymptomatic ejection fraction decrease grade 2 was observed in 24% in the FEC-T-arm and 11% in the PTC-arm.The most common grade 3-4 non-hematologic toxicity was diarrhea (5% in the FEC-T-arm and 18% in the PTC-arm).CONCLUSIONS: Pertuzumab in combination with FEC-T mostly causes neutropenia, and when added to PTC mostly causes diarrhea.Significant cardiac toxicity is rare with both regimens, and toxicity is overall well manageable.",1,1,1,1
28961845,"Borealis-1: a randomized, first-line, placebo-controlled, phase II study evaluating apatorsen and chemotherapy for patients with advanced urothelial cancer.Background: Five-year survival of patients with inoperable, advanced urothelial carcinoma treated with the first-line chemotherapy is 5%-15%.We assessed whether the Hsp27 inhibitor apatorsen combined with gemcitabine plus cisplatin (GC) could improve overall survival (OS) in these patients.Patients and methods: This placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase II trial randomized 183 untreated urothelial carcinoma patients (North America and Europe) to receive GC plus either placebo (N = 62), 600 mg apatorsen (N = 60), or 1000 mg apatorsen (N = 61).In the experimental arm, treatment included loading doses of apatorsen followed by up to six cycles of apatorsen plus GC.Patients receiving at least four cycles could continue apatorsen monotherapy as maintenance until progression or unacceptable toxicity.The primary end point was OS.Results: OS was not significantly improved in the single or combined 600- or 1000-mg apatorsen arms versus placebo [hazard ratio (HR), 0.86 and 0.90, respectively].Exploratory study of specific statistical modeling showed a trend for improved survival in patients with baseline poor prognostic features treated with 600 mg apatorsen compared with placebo (HR = 0.72).Landmark analysis of serum Hsp27 (sHsp27) levels showed a trend toward survival benefit for poor-prognosis patients in 600- and 1000-mg apatorsen arms who achieved lower area under the curve sHsp27 levels, compared with the placebo arm (HR = 0.45 and 0.62, respectively).Higher baseline circulating tumor cells (>/=5 cells/7.5 ml) was observed in patients with poor prognosis in correlation with poor survival.Treatment-emergent adverse events were manageable and more common in both apatorsen-treatment arms.Conclusions: Even though apatorsen combined with standard chemotherapy did not demonstrate a survival benefit in the overall study population, patients with poor prognostic features might benefit from this combination.Serum Hsp27 levels may act as a biomarker to predict treatment outcome.Further exploration of apatorsen in poor-risk patients is warranted.",1,1,1,1
30807234,"Cyclin E1 Expression and Palbociclib Efficacy in Previously Treated Hormone Receptor-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer.PURPOSE: A large-panel gene expression analysis was conducted to identify biomarkers associated with the effectiveness of adding palbociclib to fulvestrant.METHODS: The PALOMA-3 ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01942135) trial randomly assigned 521 endocrine-pretreated patients with metastatic breast cancer to receive palbociclib plus fulvestrant or placebo plus fulvestrant.Primary analysis was first conducted on 10 genes on the basis of pathway biology and evidence from previous studies followed by a systematic panel-wide search among 2,534 cancer-related genes.The association of gene expression with the effect of palbociclib on progression-free survival (PFS) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, with gene expression as a continuous variable or dichotomized by median.An independent breast cancer cohort from the Preoperative Palbociclib (POP) Clinical Trial ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02008734) was used for validation, in 61 patients with primary breast cancer treated with 2 weeks of palbociclib.RESULTS: In the PALOMA-3 trial, 302 patients had tumor tissue analyzed (palbociclib arm, 194 patients; placebo arm, 108 patients).Palbociclib efficacy was lower in patients with high versus low cyclin E1 (CCNE1) mRNA expression (median PFS: palbociclib arm, 7.6 v 14.1 months; placebo arm, 4.0 v 4.8 months, respectively; interaction P unadjusted = .00238; false discovery rate-adjusted P = .0238).CCNE1 mRNA was more predictive in metastatic than in archival primary biopsy tissue samples.No significant interaction was found between treatment and expression levels of CDK4, CDK6, cyclin D1, and RB1.Palbociclib was efficacious in both luminal A and luminal B tumors.High CCNE1 mRNA expression was associated with poor antiproliferative activity of palbociclib in the POP trial (P = .005).CONCLUSION: Addition of palbociclib to fulvestrant demonstrated efficacy in all biomarker groups, although high CCNE1 mRNA expression was associated with relative resistance to palbociclib.",1,1,1,1
24158787,"Everolimus plus exemestane in postmenopausal patients with HR(+) breast cancer: BOLERO-2 final progression-free survival analysis.INTRODUCTION: Effective treatments for hormone-receptor-positive (HR(+)) breast cancer (BC) following relapse/progression on nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI) therapy are needed.Initial Breast Cancer Trials of OraL EveROlimus-2 (BOLERO-2) trial data demonstrated that everolimus and exemestane significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) versus placebo plus exemestane alone in this patient population.METHODS: BOLERO-2 is a phase 3, double-blind, randomized, international trial comparing everolimus (10 mg/day) plus exemestane (25 mg/day) versus placebo plus exemestane in postmenopausal women with HR(+) advanced BC with recurrence/progression during or after NSAIs.The primary endpoint was PFS by local investigator review, and was confirmed by independent central radiology review.Overall survival, response rate, and clinical benefit rate were secondary endpoints.RESULTS: Final study results with median 18-month follow-up show that median PFS remained significantly longer with everolimus plus exemestane versus placebo plus exemestane [investigator review: 7.8 versus 3.2 months, respectively; hazard ratio = 0.45 (95% confidence interval 0.38-0.54); log-rank P < 0.0001; central review: 11.0 versus 4.1 months, respectively; hazard ratio = 0.38 (95% confidence interval 0.31-0.48); log-rank P < 0.0001] in the overall population and in all prospectively defined subgroups, including patients with visceral metastases, [corrected] and irrespective of age.The incidence and severity of adverse events were consistent with those reported at the interim analysis and in other everolimus trials.CONCLUSION: The addition of everolimus to exemestane markedly prolonged PFS in patients with HR(+) advanced BC with disease recurrence/progression following prior NSAIs.These results further support the use of everolimus plus exemestane in this patient population.ClinicalTrials.gov #NCT00863655.",1,1,1,1
31591063,"Ramucirumab plus erlotinib in patients with untreated, EGFR-mutated, advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (RELAY): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Dual blockade of the EGFR and VEGF pathways in EGFR-mutated metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is supported by preclinical and clinical data, yet the approach is not widely implemented.RELAY assessed erlotinib, an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) standard of care, plus ramucirumab, a human IgG1 VEGFR2 antagonist, or placebo in patients with untreated EGFR-mutated metastatic NSCLC.METHODS: This is a worldwide, double-blind, phase 3 trial done in 100 hospitals, clinics, and medical centres in 13 countries.Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older (20 years or older in Japan and Taiwan) at the time of study entry, had stage IV NSCLC, with an EGFR exon 19 deletion (ex19del) or exon 21 substitution (Leu858Arg) mutation, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, and no CNS metastases.We randomly assigned eligible patients in a 1:1 ratio to receive oral erlotinib (150 mg/day) plus either intravenous ramucirumab (10 mg/kg) or matching placebo once every 2 weeks.Randomisation was done by an interactive web response system with a computer-generated sequence and stratified by sex, geographical region, EGFR mutation type, and EGFR testing method.The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population.Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment.This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02411448, and is ongoing for long-term survival follow-up.FINDINGS: Between Jan 28, 2016, and Feb 1, 2018, 449 eligible patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to treatment with ramucirumab plus erlotinib (n=224) or placebo plus erlotinib (n=225).Median duration of follow-up was 20.7 months (IQR 15.8-27.2).At the time of primary analysis, progression-free survival was significantly longer in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib group (19.4 months [95% CI 15.4-21.6]) than in the placebo plus erlotinib group (12.4 months [11.0-13.5]), with a stratified hazard ratio of 0.59 (95% CI 0.46-0.76; p<0.0001).Grade 3-4 treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 159 (72%) of 221 patients in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib group versus 121 (54%) of 225 in the placebo plus erlotinib group.The most common grade 3-4 treatment-emergent adverse events in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib group were hypertension (52 [24%]; grade 3 only) and dermatitis acneiform (33 [15%]), and in the placebo plus erlotinib group were dermatitis acneiform (20 [9%]) and increased alanine aminotransferase (17 [8%]).Treatment-emergent serious adverse events were reported in 65 (29%) of 221 patients in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib group and 47 (21%) of 225 in the placebo plus erlotinib group.The most common serious adverse events of any grade in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib group were pneumonia (seven [3%]) and cellulitis and pneumothorax (four [2%], each); the most common in the placebo plus erlotinib group were pyrexia (four [2%]) and pneumothorax (three [1%]).One on-study treatment-related death due to an adverse event occurred (haemothorax after a thoracic drainage procedure for a pleural empyema) in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib group.INTERPRETATION: Ramucirumab plus erlotinib demonstrated superior progression-free survival compared with placebo plus erlotinib in patients with untreated EGFR-mutated metastatic NSCLC.Safety was consistent with the safety profiles of the individual compounds in advanced lung cancer.The RELAY regimen is a viable new treatment option for the initial treatment of EGFR-mutated metastatic NSCLC.FUNDING: Eli Lilly.",1,1,1,1
30982687,"Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy versus standard of care palliative treatment in patients with oligometastatic cancers (SABR-COMET): a randomised, phase 2, open-label trial.BACKGROUND: The oligometastatic paradigm suggests that some patients with a limited number of metastases might be cured if all lesions are eradicated.Evidence from randomised controlled trials to support this paradigm is scarce.We aimed to assess the effect of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) on survival, oncological outcomes, toxicity, and quality of life in patients with a controlled primary tumour and one to five oligometastatic lesions.METHODS: This randomised, open-label phase 2 study was done at 10 hospitals in Canada, the Netherlands, Scotland, and Australia.Patients aged 18 or older with a controlled primary tumour and one to five metastatic lesions, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score of 0-1, and a life expectancy of at least 6 months were eligible.After stratifying by the number of metastases (1-3 vs 4-5), we randomly assigned patients (1:2) to receive either palliative standard of care treatments alone (control group), or standard of care plus SABR to all metastatic lesions (SABR group), using a computer-generated randomisation list with permuted blocks of nine.Neither patients nor physicians were masked to treatment allocation.The primary endpoint was overall survival.We used a randomised phase 2 screening design with a two-sided alpha of 0.20 (wherein p<0.20 designates a positive trial).All analyses were intention to treat.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01446744.FINDINGS: 99 patients were randomised between Feb 10, 2012, and Aug 30, 2016.Of 99 patients, 33 (33%) were assigned to the control group and 66 (67%) to the SABR group.Two (3%) patients in the SABR group did not receive allocated treatment and withdrew from the trial; two (6%) patients in the control group also withdrew from the trial.Median follow-up was 25 months (IQR 19-54) in the control group versus 26 months (23-37) in the SABR group.Median overall survival was 28 months (95% CI 19-33) in the control group versus 41 months (26-not reached) in the SABR group (hazard ratio 0.57, 95% CI 0.30-1.10; p=0.090).Adverse events of grade 2 or worse occurred in three (9%) of 33 controls and 19 (29%) of 66 patients in the SABR group (p=0.026), an absolute increase of 20% (95% CI 5-34).Treatment-related deaths occurred in three (4.5%) of 66 patients after SABR, compared with none in the control group.INTERPRETATION: SABR was associated with an improvement in overall survival, meeting the primary endpoint of this trial, but three (4.5%) of 66 patients in the SABR group had treatment-related death.Phase 3 trials are needed to conclusively show an overall survival benefit, and to determine the maximum number of metastatic lesions wherein SABR provides a benefit.FUNDING: Ontario Institute for Cancer Research and London Regional Cancer Program Catalyst Grant.",0,0,0,0

Investigator-assessed median progression-free survival was 9.2 months (95% CI, 7.4 to 15.6) and 12.9 months (95% CI, 11.1 to not reached) in arms A and B, respectively.Independent review committee-assessed intracranial ORR in patients with measurable brain metastases at baseline was 42% (11 of 26 patients) in arm A and 67% (12 of 18 patients) in arm B. Common treatment-emergent adverse events were nausea (arm A/B, 33%/40%), diarrhea (arm A/B, 19%/38%), headache (arm A/B, 28%/27%), and cough (arm A/B, 18%/34%), and were mainly grades 1 to 2.A subset of pulmonary adverse events with early onset (median onset: day 2) occurred in 14 of 219 treated patients (all grades, 6%; grade >/= 3, 3%); none occurred after escalation to 180 mg in arm B.

29534639,"Cytokeratin-18 fragments predict treatment response and overall survival in gastric cancer in a randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer is common malignancy and exhibits a poor prognosis.At the time of diagnosis, the majority of patients present with metastatic disease which precludes curative treatment.Non-invasive biomarkers which discriminate early from advanced stages or predict the response to treatment are urgently required.This study explored the cytokeratin-18 fragment M30 and full-length cytokeratin-18 M65 in predicting treatment response and survival in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of advanced gastric cancer.METHODS: Patients enrolled in the SUN-CASE study received sunitinib or placebo as an adjunct to standard therapy with leucovorin (Ca-folinate), 5-fluorouracil, and irinotecan in second or third line.Treatment response rates, progression-free survival and overall survival were assessed during a follow-up period of 12 months.Cytokeratin-18 fragments were analyzed in 52 patients at baseline and day 14 of therapy.RESULTS: Levels of M30 correlated with the presence of metastasis and lymph node involvement and decreased significantly during chemotherapy.Importantly, baseline levels of M30 were significantly higher in patients who failed therapy.In addition, patients who did not respond to treatment were also identifiable at day 14 based on elevated M30 levels.By stepwise regression analysis, M30 at day 14 was identified as independent predictor of treatment response.Likewise, serum levels of full-length cytokeratin-18 M65 at baseline also correlated with treatment failure and progression-free survival.The addition of sunitinib did not exert any effects on serum levels of M30 or M65.CONCLUSION: The cytokeratin-18 fragment M30 at day 14 identifies patients that fail to second- or third-line therapy for advanced gastric cancer.Validation of this non-invasive biomarker in gastric cancer is warranted.",1,1,1,0
28111430,"Incorporating Erlotinib or Irinotecan Plus Cisplatin into Chemoradiotherapy for Stage III Non-small Cell Lung Cancer According to EGFR Mutation Status.PURPOSE: Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) is the standard care for stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients; however, a more effective regimen is needed to improve the outcome by better controlling occult metastases.We conducted two parallel randomized phase II studies to incorporate erlotinib or irinotecan-cisplatin (IP) into CCRT for stage III NSCLC depending on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation status.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with EGFR-mutant tumors were randomized to receive three cycles of erlotinib first and then either CCRT with erlotinib followed by erlotinib (arm A) or CCRT with IP only (arm B).Patients with EGFR unknown or wild-type tumors were randomized to receive either three cycles of IP before (arm C) or after CCRT with IP (arm D).RESULTS: Seventy-three patients were screened and the study was closed early because of slow accrual after 59 patients were randomized.Overall, there were seven patients in arm A, five in arm B, 22 in arm C, and 25 in arm D. The response rate was 71.4% and 80.0% for arm A and B, and 70.0% and 73.9% for arm C and D. The median overall survival (OS) was 39.3 months versus 31.2 months for arm A and B (p=0.442), and 16.3 months versus 25.3 months for arm C and D (p=0.050).Patients with sensitive EGFR mutations had significantly longer OS than EGFR-wild patients (74.8 months vs. 25.3 months, p=0.034).There were no unexpected toxicities.CONCLUSION: Combined-modality treatment by molecular diagnostics is feasible in stage III NSCLC.EGFR-mutant patients appear to be a distinct subset with longer survival.",1,1,1,1
24728665,"Peretinoin after curative therapy of hepatitis C-related hepatocellular carcinoma: a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study.BACKGROUND: Effective prophylactic therapies have not been established for hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence.Peretinoin represents one novel option for patients with hepatitis C virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCV-HCC), and it was tested in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.METHODS: Patients with curative therapy were assigned to one of the following regimens: peretinoin 600, 300 mg/day, or placebo for up to 96 weeks.The primary outcome was recurrence-free survival (RFS).RESULTS: Of the 401 patients initially enrolled, 377 patients were analyzed for efficacy.The RFS rates in the 600-mg group, the 300-mg group, and the placebo group were 71.9, 63.6, and 66.0 % at 1 year, and 43.7, 24.9, and 29.3 % at 3 years, respectively.The primary comparison of peretinoin (300 and 600-mg) with placebo was not significant (P = 0.434).The dose-response relationship based on the hypothesis that ""efficacy begins to increase at 600 mg/day"" was significant (P = 0.023, multiplicity-adjusted P = 0.048).The hazard ratios for RFS in the 600-mg group vs. the placebo group were 0.73 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.51-1.03] for the entire study period and 0.27 (95 % CI 0.07-0.96) after 2 years of the randomization.Common adverse events included ascites, increased blood pressure, headache, presence of urine albumin, and increased transaminases.CONCLUSIONS: Although the superiority of peretinoin to placebo could not be validated, 600 mg/day was shown to be the optimal dose, and treatment may possibly reduce the recurrence of HCV-HCC, particularly after 2 years.The efficacy and safety of peretinoin 600 mg/day should continue to be evaluated in further studies.",0,0,0,0

27114605,"Response to Cetuximab With or Without Irinotecan in Patients With Refractory Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Harboring the KRAS G13D Mutation: Australasian Gastro-Intestinal Trials Group ICECREAM Study.PURPOSE: RAS mutations predict lack of response to epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody therapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), but preclinical studies and retrospective clinical data suggest that patients with tumors harboring the exon 2 KRAS G13D mutation may benefit from cetuximab.We aimed to assess cetuximab monotherapy and cetuximab plus irinotecan in patients with molecularly selected (G13D mutation) chemotherapy-refractory mCRC in a randomized phase II trial of this rare molecular subtype.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with chemotherapy-refractory KRAS G13D mutation-positive mCRC who had progressed within 6 months of irinotecan therapy were randomly assigned to cetuximab 400 mg/m(2) loading dose and then 250 mg/m(2) once per week with or without irinotecan 180 mg/m(2) once every 2 weeks.The primary end point was 6-month progression-free survival; secondary end points were response rate, overall survival, quality of life, and toxicity.RESULTS: Fifty-one of 53 patients recruited over 2 years were eligible.The 6-month progression-free survival rate was 10% (95% CI, 2% to 26%) for cetuximab versus 23% (95% CI, 9% to 40%) for cetuximab plus irinotecan with a hazard ratio of 0.74 (95% CI, 0.42 to 1.32).Response and stable disease rates were 0% and 58% for monotherapy versus 9% and 70% for combination treatment, respectively.Overall survival and quality of life were similar; toxicities were higher with combination therapy.CONCLUSION: In patients with G13D-mutated chemotherapy-refractory mCRC, there was no statistically significant improvement in disease control at 6 months with either cetuximab monotherapy or cetuximab plus irinotecan.No responses were seen with single-agent cetuximab.The responses observed with the combination of cetuximab and irinotecan may reflect true drug synergy or persistent irinotecan sensitivity.The ICECREAM (Irinotecan Cetuximab Evaluation and Cetuximab Response Evaluation Among Patients with a G13D Mutation) study demonstrates the need to prospectively evaluate hypotheses that were previously supported by retrospective analyses and exemplifies the value of international collaboration in trials of rare molecular subtypes.",1,1,1,1
27149489,"Efficacy of Intravenous Lidocaine During Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection for Gastric Neoplasm: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Controlled Study.Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is an advanced therapy for early gastric neoplasm and requires sedation with adequate analgesia.Lidocaine is a short-acting local anesthetic, and intravenous lidocaine has been shown to have analgesic efficacy in surgical settings.The aim of this study was to assess the effects of intravenous lidocaine on analgesic and sedative requirements for ESD and pain after ESD.Sixty-six patients scheduled for ESD randomly received either intravenous lidocaine as a bolus of 1.5 mg/kg before sedation, followed by continuous infusion at a rate of 2 mg/kg/h during sedation (lidocaine group; n = 33) or the same bolus and infusion volumes of normal saline (control group; n = 33).Sedation was achieved with propofol and fentanyl.The primary outcome was fentanyl requirement during ESD.We recorded hemodynamics and any events during ESD and evaluated post-ESD epigastric and throat pain.Fentanyl requirement during ESD reduced by 24% in the lidocaine group compared with the control group (105 +/- 28 vs. 138 +/- 37 mug, mean +/- SD; P < 0.001).The lidocaine group reached sedation faster [40 (20-100) vs. 55 (30-120) s, median (range); P = 0.001], and incidence of patient movement during ESD decreased in the lidocaine group (3% vs. 26%, P = 0.026).Numerical rating scale for epigastric pain was significantly lower at 6 hours after ESD [2 (0-6) vs. 3 (0-8), median (range); P = 0.023] and incidence of throat pain was significantly lower in the lidocaine group (27% vs. 65%, P = 0.003).No adverse events associated with lidocaine were discovered.Administration of intravenous lidocaine reduced fentanyl requirement and decreased patient movement during ESD.Moreover, it alleviated epigastric and throat pain after ESD.Thus, we conclude that the use of intravenous adjuvant lidocaine is a new and safe sedative method during ESD.",0,0,0,0
29466786,"Long-Term Vitamin D Supplementation and the Effects on Recurrence and Metabolic Status of Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia Grade 2 or 3: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial.OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of vitamin D supplementation on the recurrence and metabolic status of patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or 3 (CIN2/3).METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was carried out among 58 women diagnosed with CIN2/3.Participants were randomly assigned into 2 groups to receive either 50,000 IU vitamin D3 (n = 29) or placebo (n = 29) every 2 weeks for 6 months.RESULTS: The recurrence rate of CIN1/2/3 was 18.5 and 48.1% in the vitamin D and placebo groups respectively (p = 0.02).When we excluded CIN1, the recurrence rate of CIN2/3 became nonsignificant.Vitamin D supplementation significantly decreased fasting plasma glucose (-7.8 +/- 9.2 vs. -1.1 +/- 8.6 mg/dL, p = 0.006) and insulin levels (-3.2 +/- 4.8 vs. -0.9 +/- 3.4 microIU/mL, p = 0.03), and significantly increased quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (0.01 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.002 +/- 0.01, p = 0.02) compared with the placebo.Additionally, there was a significant decrease in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (-815.3 +/- 1,786.2 vs. 717.5 +/- 1,827.3 ng/mL, p = 0.002) and a significant increase in total antioxidant capacity (113.4 +/- 137.4 vs. -53.7 +/- 186.7 mmol/L, p < 0.001) following the supplementation of vitamin D compared with the placebo.CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D3 supplementation for 6 months among women with CIN2/3 had beneficial effects on CIN1/2/3 recurrence and metabolic status; however, it did not affect CIN2/3 recurrence.",0,0,0,0
26822398,"Afatinib plus vinorelbine versus trastuzumab plus vinorelbine in patients with HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer who had progressed on one previous trastuzumab treatment (LUX-Breast 1): an open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Trastuzumab resistance is a key therapeutic challenge in metastatic breast cancer.We postulated that broader inhibition of ErbB receptors with afatinib would improve clinical outcomes compared with HER2 inhibition alone in patients who had progressed on previous trastuzumab treatment.LUX-Breast 1 compared afatinib plus vinorelbine with trastuzumab plus vinorelbine for such patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.METHODS: We did this open-label trial at 350 hospitals in 41 countries worldwide.We enrolled female patients with HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer who had progressed on or following adjuvant trastuzumab or first-line treatment of metastatic disease with trastuzumab.Participants were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive oral afatinib (40 mg/day) plus intravenous vinorelbine (25 mg/m(2) per week) or intravenous trastuzumab (2 mg/kg per week after 4 mg/kg loading dose) plus vinorelbine.Randomisation was done centrally and stratified by previous trastuzumab treatment (adjuvant vs first-line treatment), hormone receptor status (oestrogen receptor and progesterone receptor positive vs others), and region.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, assessed in the intention-to-treat population.This trial is closed to enrolment and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01125566.FINDINGS: Between Aug 26, 2010, and April 26, 2013, we enrolled 508 patients: 339 assigned to the afatinib group and 169 assigned to the trastuzumab group.Recruitment was stopped on April 26, 2013, after a benefit-risk assessment by the independent data monitoring committee was unfavourable for the afatinib group.Patients on afatinib plus vinorelbine had to switch to trastuzumab plus vinorelbine, afatinib monotherapy, vinorelbine monotherapy, or receive treatment outside of the trial.Median follow-up was 9.3 months (IQR 3.7-16.0).Median progression-free survival was 5.5 months (95% CI 5.4-5.6) in the afatinib group and 5.6 months (5.3-7.3) in the trastuzumab group (hazard ratio 1.10 95% CI 0.86-1.41; p=0.43).The most common drug-related adverse events of grade 3 or higher were neutropenia (190 [56%] of 337 patients in the afatinib group vs 102 [60%] of 169 patients in the trastuzumab group), leucopenia (64 [19%] vs 34 [20%]), and diarrhoea (60 [18%] vs none).INTERPRETATION: Trastuzumab-based therapy remains the treatment of choice for patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who had progressed on trastuzumab.FUNDING: Boehringer Ingelheim.",1,1,1,1
30241966,"Individualized Prediction of Menses Recovery After Chemotherapy for Early-stage Breast Cancer: A Nomogram Developed From UNICANCER PACS04 and PACS05 Trials.BACKGROUND: The likelihood of menses recovery varies greatly in premenopausal patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer.Quantifying this probability for each patient could better inform the chemotherapy discussion and individualize fertility counseling.We performed a pooled analysis of the PACS04 and PACS05 adjuvant randomized trials to develop a nomogram to estimate the probability of menses recovery at 3, 6, and 18 months after the end of adjuvant chemotherapy.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Women who were premenopausal and aged </= 50 years at randomization in the PACS04 and PACS05 trials were included in the present analysis.The primary endpoint was the probability of menses recovery within 18 months of chemotherapy completion.Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the association of each variable with the likelihood of menses resumption.A nomogram was developed to predict menses recovery at different intervals.RESULTS: The factors associated with menses recovery were assessed for 1210 patients.At a median follow-up of 90 months (range, 3-189 months), 342 of 1210 patients (28.2%) had recovered menses.The probability of menses recovery at 18 months was 25.5% (range, 23.0%-27.9%).After backward elimination, age, final body mass index, type of chemotherapy, and hormone therapy were selected to build the nomogram to predict the probability of menstrual resumption at 3, 6, and 18 months after chemotherapy.CONCLUSION: An accurate and individualized prediction of menses recovery is feasible for premenopausal patients eligible for adjuvant chemotherapy for early-stage breast cancer.Our nomogram will be externally validated in a large prospective cohort.",0,0,0,0
30902613,"Updated Efficacy and Safety Data and Impact of the EML4-ALK Fusion Variant on the Efficacy of Alectinib in Untreated ALK-Positive Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer in the Global Phase III ALEX Study.INTRODUCTION: At the prior data cutoff (February 9, 2017) the ALEX trial showed superior investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) for alectinib versus crizotinib in untreated, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive, advanced NSCLC (hazard ratio = 0.47, 95% confidence interval: 0.34-0.65, p < 0.001).The median PFS in the alectinib arm was not reached versus 11.1 months with crizotinib.Retrospective analyses suggest that the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 gene-ALK variant (EML4-ALK) may influence ALK-inhibitor treatment benefit.We present updated analyses, including exploratory subgroup analysis by EML4-ALK variant, after an additional 10 months' follow-up (cutoff December 1, 2017).METHODS: Patients were randomized to receive twice-daily alectinib, 600 mg, or crizotinib, 250 mg, until disease progression, toxicity, death, or withdrawal.PFS was determined by the investigators.Baseline plasma and tissue biomarker samples were analyzed by using hybrid-capture, next-generation sequencing to determine EML4-ALK variant.RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were balanced.Investigator-assessed PFS was prolonged with alectinib (stratified hazard ratio = 0.43, 95% confidence interval: 0.32-0.58).The median PFS times were 34.8 months with alectinib and 10.9 months with crizotinib.EML4-ALK fusions were detectable in 129 patient plasma samples and 124 tissue samples; variants 1, 2, and 3/ab did not affect PFS, objective response rate, or duration of response.Investigator-assessed PFS was longer for alectinib than for crizotinib across EML4-ALK variants 1, 2, and 3a/b in plasma and tissue.Despite longer treatment duration (27.0 months in the case of alectinib versus 10.8 months in the case of crizotinib), the safety of alectinib compared favorably with that of crizotinib.CONCLUSION: Alectinib continues to demonstrate superior investigator-assessed PFS versus crizotinib in untreated ALK-positive NSCLC, irrespective of EML4-ALK variant.",1,1,1,1
30216191,"Randomised trial of HPV self-sampling among non-attenders in the Slovenian cervical screening programme ZORA: comparing three different screening approaches.Background To overcome obstacles within the Slovenian organised cervical cancer screening programme, a randomised pilot study of human papillomavirus (HPV) self-sampling among non-attenders was performed, aiming to assess three different screening approaches.Participants and methods Non-attenders aged 30-64 years from two Slovenian regions were randomised to two HPV self-sampling groups-the opt-in (I1, n = 14.400) and the opt-out (I2, n = 9.556), with a control group (P, n = 2.600).Self-collected samples were analysed using the Hybrid Capture 2 assay.HPV-positive women were invited to a colposcopy.The overall and type-specific intention-to-screen response rates and histological outcomes with a positive predictive value (PPV) according to the women's age, the screening approach, the level of protection resulting from previous screening history, and the region of residence were assessed.Results Of the 26.556 women enrolled, 8.972 (33.8%) responded with self-sample for HPV testing and/or traditional cytology within one year of enrolment.Response rates were 37.7%, 34.0% and 18.4% (p < 0.050) for opt-out, opt-in and control groups.Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)2+ was diagnosed in 3.9/1.000, 3.4/1.000, and 3.1/1.000 women (p > 0.050), respectively.PPV of the HPV self-sampling was 12.0% and 9.6% for CIN2+ and CIN3+.The highest PPV was obtained in non-attenders in screening programme for more than 10-years and concordant results of HPV testing with 40.8% for CIN2+ and 38.8% for CIN3+.Conclusions The results of our study show that a high response to HPV self-sampling can be achieved also in an opt-in approach, if women are encouraged to choose between self-sampling at home and screening with gynaecologist.In addition, clinically important risk difference for a high-grade cervical lesion exists in the case of a positive result of HPV testing on self-collected samples, depending on the length of the interval since last screening.Stratified management of these women should be strongly considered.Women who were not screened with cytology for at least 10 years should be referred to immediate colposcopy for histology verification instead to delayed re-testing.",0,0,0,0

PgR and Ki67 expression were significantly reduced with all treatments (means were -34% to -45%, and -75% to -85%, respectively; all P = 0.0001), with no differences between groups.CONCLUSIONS: In this short-term study, all treatments reduced ER expression, although F and F + A showed greater reductions than A. No significant differences were detected between the treatment groups in terms of PgR and Ki67 expression.No additional reduction in tumor biomarkers with combination treatment was observed, suggesting that F + A is unlikely to have further clinical benefit over F alone.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00259090.",1,1,1,1
26724840,"Role of Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Prostate Cancer Screening: A Pilot Study Within the Goteborg Randomised Screening Trial.BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and targeted biopsies (TB) have shown potential to more accurately detect significant prostate cancer compared with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and systematic biopsies (SB).OBJECTIVE: To compare sequential screening (PSA+MRI) with conventional PSA screening.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Of 384 attendees in the 10th screening round of the Goteborg randomised screening trial, 124 men, median age 69.5 yr, had a PSA of >/= 1.8 ng/ml and underwent a prebiopsy MRI.Men with suspicious lesions on MRI and/or PSA >/= 3.0ng/ml were referred for biopsy.SB was performed blinded to MRI results and TB was performed in men with tumour-suspicious findings on MRI.Three screening strategies were compared (PSA >/= 3.0+SB; PSA >/= 3.0+MRI+TB and PSA >/= 1.8+MRI+TB).OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Cancer detection rates, sensitivity, and specificity were calculated per screening strategy and compared using McNemar's test.RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: In total, 28 cases of prostate cancer were detected, of which 20 were diagnosed in biopsy-naive men.Both PSA >/= 3.0+MRI and PSA >/= 1.8+MRI significantly increased specificity compared with PSA >/= 3.0+SB (0.92 and 0.79 vs 0.52; p<0.002 for both), while sensitivity was significantly higher for PSA >/= 1.8+MRI compared with PSA >/= 3.0+MRI (0.73 vs 0.46, p=0.008).The detection rate of significant cancer was higher with PSA >/= 1.8+MRI compared with PSA >/= 3.0+SB (5.9% vs 4.0%), while the detection rate of insignificant cancer was lowered by PSA >/= 3.0+MRI (0.3% vs 1.2%).The primary limitation of this study is the small sample of men.CONCLUSION: A screening strategy with a lowered PSA cut-off followed by TB in MRI-positive men seems to increase the detection of significant cancers while improving specificity.If replicated, these results may contribute to a paradigm shift in future screening.PATIENT SUMMARY: Major concerns in prostate-specific antigen screening are overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis.We evaluated whether prostate magnetic resonance imaging could improve the balance of benefits to harm in prostate cancer screening screening, and we found a promising potential of using magnetic resonance imaging in addition to prostate-specific antigen.",0,0,0,0

31398258,"Randomized controlled trial on the effect of an online decision aid for young female cancer patients regarding fertility preservation.STUDY QUESTION: Does the use of an online decision aid (DA) about fertility preservation (FP), in addition to standard counselling by a specialist in reproductive medicine, reduce decisional conflict compared to standard counselling alone?SUMMARY ANSWER: Female cancer patients who could make use of the online DA had a significantly lower short-term decisional conflict score.WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Nowadays, female cancer patients have several options for preserving fertility, but having to decide whether to opt for FP within a short time frame after cancer diagnosis and before the start of treatment is challenging.According to previous studies focussing mainly on breast cancer patients, decisional conflict among these women is high, and they have expressed the need for additional support.STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: The study was a randomized controlled trial including female cancer patients who were referred by their treating oncologist to a specialist in reproductive medicine for fertility counselling.Participants were randomly assigned to the control group (counselling only) or to the intervention group (counselling and additional use of the online DA immediately after counselling).Recruitment was ongoing from July 2016 to December 2017 at eight fertility centres in Switzerland and Germany.PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The online DA was developed by an interdisciplinary team of specialists in reproductive medicine, gynaecologists, oncologists and psychologists.Of 79 recruited participants, 59 completed the first assessment and could therefore be enrolled in the study.They were asked to complete an online questionnaire at three time points: at T1, after counselling (control group, n = 27) or after counselling and the additional use of the DA (intervention group, n = 24); at T2, 1 month later (N = 41: control group, n = 23; intervention group, n = 18); and at T3, 12 months later (N = 37: control group, n = 20; intervention group, n = 17).The survey comprised questions about fertility-related knowledge, attitude towards FP, willingness to undergo FP and socio-demographic data, as well as the decisional conflict and decisional regret scales.MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: All participants showed low decisional conflict scores.Women who used the online DA in addition to counselling (intervention group) showed a significantly lower total score on the Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS) compared to the control group at T1 (P = 0.008; M = 12.15, SD = 4.38; 95% CI, 3.35-20.95) and at T2 (P = 0.043; M = 9.35, SD = 4.48; 95% CI, 0.31-18.38).At T3, the mean total score of the DCS was still lower in the intervention group compared to the control group; however, this group difference was no longer significant (P = 0.199, M = 6.86, SD = 5.24; 95% CI, -3.78 to 17.51).The majority of participants had already made a decision regarding FP (yes or no) at T1 (72.5%): 91.7% in the intervention group compared to 55.6% in the control group (P = 0.014).Those who had decided already at T1 showed significantly lower decisional conflict (P = 0.007; M = 13.69, SD = 4.89; 95% CI, 3.86-23.52).The average number of DA sessions per user was 2.23, and 80.8% of the participants completed the DA's value clarification exercises.Participants in the intervention group were satisfied with the DA and would recommend it to other patients.LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The recruitment of participants was challenging because of the emotionally difficult situation patients were in.This led to the limited sample size for final analysis.Education levels were high in two-thirds of the participants.It is difficult to say whether the DA would be equally effective in women with a lower educational background.WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: There is evidence that the DA served as a helpful complement to the decision-making process for young female cancer patients qualifying for FP.This is, to our knowledge, the first randomized controlled trial evaluating a DA targeted at patients with several cancer types and in a language other than English (i.e. German).This study contributes to extending the range of the still limited number of DAs in the context of FP.STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): The study was supported by a research grant of the Swiss Cancer Research.The authors declare that no competing interests exist.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: Clinicaltrials.gov, trial no.

26761561,"Physical exercise for functional capacity, blood immune function, fatigue, and quality of life in high-risk prostate cancer patients during radiotherapy: a prospective, randomized clinical study.BACKGROUND: During radiotherapy (RT), prostate cancer (PCa) patients may report cancer related fatigue (CRF), which impairs functional capacity, psychological status, and quality of life (QoL).RT can induce cytokine responses that could play a role in mediating radiation toxicity by increasing inflammation.While it is known that physical exercise plays an important anti-inflammatory role in healthy adults, its specific anti-inflammatory effects in PCa patients with CRF have not yet been determined.AIM: Previous studies have shown that physical exercise in cancer patients undergoing RT improves cardiac fitness, muscle strength, and QoL, however it is still unknown how physical exercise affects inflammation and its specific consequences in PCa patients.Therefore, the purpose of this trial was to examine the effect of supervised physical exercise on inflammatory blood markers, as well as the relationship of these parameters with functional capacity, fatigue, and QoL in high-risk PCa patients undergoing RT.DESIGN: This was a prospective, two-arm randomized controlled clinical trial.SETTING: The study was performed in our outpatients center.POPULATION: Fifty-four high-risk PCa men were randomly allocated to two groups prior to undergoing RT.METHODS: Twenty-seven patients performed supervised, moderate-intensity physical exercise (exercise group; EG) and the other 27 formed a control group that carried out normal daily physical activity (usual group; UG).The following parameters were assessed before and after RT: functional capacity, changes in blood count variables and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL]-1beta, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha), fatigue, and QoL (using FACT-F score and EORTC questionnaires).RESULTS: No significant differences existed between the study groups at baseline assessment.After RT, there was a significant improvement in functional capacity (P<0.05) and a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokine levels (P>0.05) and fatigue (P<0.05) in the EG compared to the UG.Fatigue level was significantly higher in the UG (F[2.126]; P<0.05) after RT than before.Physical exercise had no effect on the correlation between inflammatory blood markers and functional capacity and fatigue scores provided by study participants.CONCLUSIONS: Regular, moderate-intensity physical exercise improves functional capacity, decreases the production of inflammatory markers and fatigue, and has a positive influence on QoL in high-risk PCa patients during RT.CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: This is one of the first studies to examine the effects of supervised exercise training on pro-inflammatory cytokine levels during RT in PCa patients by measuring functional capacity, fatigue, and QoL.",0,0,0,0
24119351,"Feasibility and acceptability of conducting a randomized clinical trial designed to improve interpretation of screening mammography.PURPOSE: To describe recruitment, enrollment, and participation in a study of US radiologists invited to participate in a randomized controlled trial of two continuing medical education (CME) interventions designed to improve interpretation of screening mammography.METHODS: We collected recruitment, consent, and intervention-completion information as part of a large study involving radiologists in California, Oregon, Washington, New Mexico, New Hampshire, North Carolina, and Vermont.Consenting radiologists were randomized to receive either a 1-day live, expert-led educational session; to receive a self-paced DVD with similar content; or to a control group (delayed intervention).The impact of the interventions was assessed using a preintervention-postintervention test set design.All activities were institutional review board approved and HIPAA compliant.RESULTS: Of 403 eligible radiologists, 151 of 403 (37.5%) consented to participate in the trial and 119 of 151 (78.8%) completed the preintervention test set, leaving 119 available for randomization to one of the two intervention groups or to controls.Female radiologists were more likely than male radiologists to consent to and complete the study (P = .03).Consenting radiologists who completed all study activities were more likely to have been interpreting mammography for 10 years or less compared to radiologists who consented and did not complete all study activities or did not consent at all.The live intervention group was more likely to report their intent to change their clinical practice as a result of the intervention compared to those who received the DVD (50% versus 17.6%, P = .02).The majority of participants in both interventions groups felt the interventions were a useful way to receive CME mammography credits.CONCLUSIONS: Community radiologists found interactive interventions designed to improve interpretative mammography performance acceptable and useful for clinical practice.This suggests CME credits for radiologists should, in part, be for examining practice skills.",0,0,0,0

23222000,"Obesity-related hormones and endometrial cancer among postmenopausal women: a nested case-control study within the B~FIT cohort.Endometrial cancer risk is strongly influenced by obesity, but the mechanisms of action remain unclear.Leptin and adiponectin, secreted from adipose tissue, reportedly play a role in such carcinogenic processes as cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and insulin regulation.In this case-control study, nested within the Breast and Bone Follow-up of the Fracture Intervention Trial (n=15,595), we assessed pre-diagnostic serum leptin, total adiponectin, and high-molecular-weight (HMW) adiponectin in relation to endometrial cancer among postmenopausal women.During the 10-year follow-up, 62 incident endometrial cases were identified and matched to 124 controls on age, geographical site, time of fasting blood draw at baseline (1992-1993), and trial participation status.Adipokines and C-peptide were measured by ELISA.Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated via conditional logistic regression, with exposures categorized in tertiles (T).Multivariable models considered C-peptide, BMI (kg/m(2)), and estradiol (E2) as potential confounders.Endometrial cancer risk was significantly associated with higher leptin levels, adjusted for E2 and C-peptide (OR(T3 vs T1)=2.96; 95% CI, 1.21-7.25; P trend <0.01).After further adjustment for BMI, the estimates were attenuated and the positive trend was no longer statistically significant (OR(T3 vs T1)=2.11; 95% CI, 0.69-6.44; P trend=0.18).No significant associations were observed with adiponectin or HMW adiponectin and endometrial cancer.Our findings with leptin suggest that the leptin-BMI axis might increase endometrial cancer risk through mechanisms other than estrogen-driven proliferation.Continued exploration of these pathways in larger prospective studies may help elucidate mechanisms underlying observed obesity-endometrial cancer associations.",0,0,0,0
31654838,"Patient-reported outcomes from the randomized phase III ALEX study of alectinib versus crizotinib in patients with ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer.OBJECTIVES: Alectinib demonstrated superior efficacy and a safety profile that compared favorably with crizotinib in treatment-naive ALK+ non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the phase III ALEX study.We present patient-reported outcomes (PROs) from ALEX to assess disease burden, treatment-related symptom tolerability, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) with alectinib versus crizotinib.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were randomized to receive alectinib 600 mg or crizotinib 250 mg twice daily until disease progression, death, or withdrawal.Pre-specified PRO endpoints were: mean change from baseline in symptoms, HRQoL, and functioning; and time to deterioration (TTD) in cough, dyspnea, chest pain, arm/shoulder pain, fatigue, and a composite of three symptoms (cough, dyspnea, chest pain).PRO data were collected using EORTC QLQ-C30 and LC13 questionnaires.Raw scores were standardized to a 0-100-point range, with a >/=10-point score change defined as clinically meaningful.TTD was defined as the time from randomization until confirmed clinically meaningful deterioration (i.e., a >/=10-point score change from baseline).RESULTS: Baseline completion rates and characteristics were balanced in the PRO-evaluable population (alectinib n = 100, 66%; crizotinib n = 97, 64%).On average, alectinib-treated patients reported clinically meaningful improvements in lung cancer symptoms for longer than crizotinib-treated patients.Between-treatment differences in lung cancer symptoms tended to favor alectinib from 11.1 months (45 weeks) onwards, around the time of median PFS with crizotinib (11.1 months).TTD in lung cancer symptoms was similar between treatment arms, despite longer duration of symptom improvement with alectinib; composite symptom endpoint (hazard ratio 1.10 [95% confidence interval: 0.72-1.68]).Duration of clinically meaningful improvement in HRQoL was longer with alectinib versus crizotinib (Week 88 vs. Week 68, respectively).Better patient-reported tolerability was observed with alectinib versus crizotinib on common treatment-related symptoms.CONCLUSION: PRO data support the superior efficacy and tolerability of alectinib relative to crizotinib demonstrated in the ALEX study.",1,1,1,1
23093232,"Is transnasal endoscope-assisted endoscopic submucosal dissection for gastric neoplasm useful in training beginners? A prospective randomized trial.BACKGROUND: The main problem in performing endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) of gastric neoplasms is that it is technically difficult, especially for beginners.METHODS: A total of 51 patients were randomly assigned to undergo transnasal endoscope-assisted or routine ESD performed by two endoscopists inexperienced in ESD while supervised by one expert.RESULTS: Total procedure time (p = 0.330), complete resection rate (p = 0.977), and complication rate (p = 0.157) were similar for the patients who underwent transnasal endoscope-assisted and routine ESD, but bleeding control time was significantly longer in the transnasal endoscope-assisted ESD group (p = 0.002).Three and six patients in the transnasal endoscope-assisted and routine ESD groups, respectively, were ""dropped out"" during the procedures (p = 0.291).The endoscopists tended to regard the traction with the transnasal endoscopeas more useful for large tumors (p = 0.062).Bleeding control in patients who underwent the transnasal endoscope-assisted ESD was significantly longer for patients with tumors located in the anterior wall, posterior wall, and lesser curvature of the stomach (p = 0.001).CONCLUSION: Transnasal endoscope-assisted ESD does not result in improved outcomes when performed by beginners, except for some large tumors.The traction method used by beginners was not superior to proper supervision and advice by an expert during ESD and allowing the expert to perform the procedure when the risk of complications is high or the procedure is delayed.",1,1,0,0

28743247,"A randomized phase II study of paclitaxel alone versus paclitaxel plus sorafenib in second- and third-line treatment of patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer (PASO).BACKGROUND: We conducted an open-label, randomized, two-arm multi-center study to assess the efficacy and safety of paclitaxel versus paclitaxel + sorafenib in patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer.METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive either paclitaxel monotherapy (80 mg/m(2)) weekly (3 weeks on, 1 week off) plus sorafenib 400 mg orally, twice a day taken continuously throughout 28 day cycles.Sorafenib dose was gradually escalated from a starting dose of 200 mg twice a day.The primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS).RESULTS: A pre-planned efficacy interim analysis was performed on the data of 60 patients, 30 patients in each treatment arm.Median PFS was estimated at 6.6 months (95% CI: 5.1 to 9.0) in patients randomized to single-agent paclitaxel (Arm A) and 5.6 months (95% CI: 3.8 to 6.5) in patients randomized to paclitaxel-sorafenib combination (Arm B) therapy.Contrary to the hypothesis, the treatment effect was statistically significant in favor of paclitaxel monotherapy (hazard ratio 1.80, 95% CI: 1.02 to 3.20; log-rank test P = 0.0409).It was decided to stop the trial early for futility.Median OS was also in favor of Arm A (20.7 months (95% CI: 16.4 to 26.7) versus 12.1 months (95% CI: 5.8 to 20.4) in Arm B. Clinical control was achieved in 28 patients (93.3%) in Arm A and in 21 patients 70.0% in Arm B. Overall response rate was met in 43.3% of patients in Arm A and in 40.0% in Arm B. Toxicities were increased in Arm B with higher rates of diarrhea, nausea, neutropenia, hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) and anorexia, Grad 3 and 4 toxicities were rare.CONCLUSIONS: In this pre-planned interim analysis, paclitaxel-sorafenib combination therapy was not found to be superior to paclitaxel monotherapy with regard to the primary end point, progression-free survival.The trial was therefore discontinued early.There was no indication of more favorable outcomes for combination therapy in secondary efficacy end points.As expected, the safety and toxicity profile of the combination therapy was less favorable compared to monotherapy.Overall, this trial did not demonstrate that adding sorafenib to second- or third-line paclitaxel provides any clinical benefit to patients with HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer.Cautious dosing using a sorafenib ramp up schedule might have contributed to negative results.TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered at EudraCT (No 2009-018025-73) and retrospectively registered at Clinical trials.gov on March 17, 2011 ( NCT01320111 ).",1,1,1,1

24123482,"Mediators of physical exercise for improvement in cancer survivors' quality of life.OBJECTIVE: Mediating mechanisms of a 12-week group-based exercise intervention on cancer survivors' quality of life (QoL) were examined to inform future exercise intervention development.METHODS: Two hundred nine cancer survivors >/= 3 months posttreatment (57% breast cancer) aged 49.5 (+/- 10.4) years were assigned to physical exercise (n = 147) or wait-list control (n = 62).QoL, fatigue, emotional distress, physical activity, general self-efficacy and mastery were assessed at baseline and post-intervention using questionnaires.Path analysis was conducted using Mplus to explore whether improved physical activity, general self-efficacy and mastery mediated the effects of exercise on fatigue and distress and consequently QoL. RESULTS: The intervention was associated with increased physical activity (beta = 0.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.14;0.59), general self-efficacy (beta = 2.41, 95%CI = 0.35;4.73), and mastery (beta = 1.75, 95%CI = 0.36;2.78).Further, the intervention had both a direct effect on fatigue (beta = -1.09, 95%CI = -2.12;0.01), and an indirect effect (beta = -0.54, 95%CI = -1.00;-0.21) via physical activity (beta = -0.29, 95%CI = -0.64;-0.07) and general self-efficacy (beta = -0.25, 95%CI = -0.61;-0.05).The intervention had a borderline significant direct effect on reduced distress (beta = -1.32, 95%CI = -2.68;0.11), and a significant indirect effect via increased general self-efficacy and mastery (beta = -1.06, 95%CI = -1.89;-0.38).Reductions in fatigue (beta = -1.33, 95%CI =-1.85;-0.83) and distress (beta = -0.86, 95%CI = -1.25;-0.52) were associated with improved QoL. Further, increased physical activity was directly associated with improved QoL (beta = 3.37, 95%CI = 1.01;5.54).CONCLUSION: The beneficial effect of group-based physical exercise on QoL was mediated by increased physical activity, general self-efficacy and mastery, and subsequent reductions in fatigue and distress.In addition to physical activity, future interventions should target self-efficacy and mastery.This may lead to reduced distress and fatigue, and consequently improved QoL of cancer survivors.",1,1,0,0

22705118,"Biweekly combination therapy with gemcitabine and carboplatin compared with gemcitabine monotherapy in elderly patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer: a randomized, phase-II study.INTRODUCTION: The strategy of chemotherapy in the elderly is controversial.We wanted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of biweekly gemcitabine and low-dose carboplatin combination therapy in elderly patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).METHODS: In this phase-II trial, chemotherapy-naive elderly patients (aged >/=76 years) with NSCLC were randomly treated with biweekly combination therapy with gemcitabine and carboplatin (1000 mg/m(2) gemcitabine and carboplatin at an area under the curve (AUC) of 3 on days 1 and 15, every 4 weeks) or gemcitabine monotherapy (1000 mg/m(2) on days 1, 8 and 15, every 4 weeks).The primary endpoint was overall response rate and analysis was based on intention-to-treat.RESULTS: Thirty-one patients were randomly assigned combination therapy and 30 were assigned monotherapy.The median age was 79.0 years.Response rate was 22.6% (95% confidence interval (CI): 11.4-39.8%) for biweekly combination therapy and 10.0% (95% CI: 3.5-25.6%) for monotherapy.Median progression-free survival in combination chemotherapy was 3.9 months (95% CI: 0.5-8.5 months), which was significantly longer that that in monotherapy (2.4 months, 95% CI: 0.5-6.7 months).The prevalence of hematological and non-hematological adverse events reaching grade 3/4 was not significantly different between combination therapy and monotherapy.CONCLUSIONS: Biweekly gemcitabine and low-dose carboplatin combination chemotherapy showed acceptable efficacy, toxicity, and tolerability in those aged >/=76 years with NSCLC.Further investigations with a large population are required to confirm our results.",1,1,1,0
26168782,"Converting from CT- to MRI-only-based target definition in radiotherapy of localized prostate cancer: A comparison between two modalities.PURPOSE: To investigate the conversion of prostate cancer radiotherapy (RT) target definition from CT-based planning into an MRI-only-based planning procedure.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using the CT- and MRI-only-based RT planning protocols, 30 prostate cancer patients were imaged in the RT fixation position.Two physicians delineated the prostate in both CT and T2-weighted MRI images.The CT and MRI images were coregistered based on gold seeds and anatomic borders of the prostate.The uncertainty of the coregistration, as well as differences in target volumes and uncertainty of contour delineation were investigated.Conversion of margins and dose constraints from CT- to MRI-only-based treatment planning was assessed.RESULTS: On average, the uncertainty of image coregistration was 0.4 +/- 0.5 mm (one standard deviation, SD), 0.9 +/- 0.8 mm and 0.9 +/- 0.9 mm in the lateral, anterior-posterior and base-apex direction, respectively.The average ratio of the prostate volume between CT and MRI was 1.20 +/- 0.15 (one SD).Compared to the CT-based contours, the MRI-based contours were on average 2-7 mm smaller in the apex, 0-1 mm smaller in the rectal direction and 1-4 mm smaller elsewhere.CONCLUSION: When converting from a CT-based planning procedure to an MRI-based one, the overall planning target volumes (PTV) are prominently reduced only in the apex.The prostate margins and dose constraints can be retained by this conversion.",0,0,0,0
28743247,"A randomized phase II study of paclitaxel alone versus paclitaxel plus sorafenib in second- and third-line treatment of patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer (PASO).BACKGROUND: We conducted an open-label, randomized, two-arm multi-center study to assess the efficacy and safety of paclitaxel versus paclitaxel + sorafenib in patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer.METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive either paclitaxel monotherapy (80 mg/m(2)) weekly (3 weeks on, 1 week off) plus sorafenib 400 mg orally, twice a day taken continuously throughout 28 day cycles.Sorafenib dose was gradually escalated from a starting dose of 200 mg twice a day.The primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS).RESULTS: A pre-planned efficacy interim analysis was performed on the data of 60 patients, 30 patients in each treatment arm.Median PFS was estimated at 6.6 months (95% CI: 5.1 to 9.0) in patients randomized to single-agent paclitaxel (Arm A) and 5.6 months (95% CI: 3.8 to 6.5) in patients randomized to paclitaxel-sorafenib combination (Arm B) therapy.Contrary to the hypothesis, the treatment effect was statistically significant in favor of paclitaxel monotherapy (hazard ratio 1.80, 95% CI: 1.02 to 3.20; log-rank test P = 0.0409).It was decided to stop the trial early for futility.Median OS was also in favor of Arm A (20.7 months (95% CI: 16.4 to 26.7) versus 12.1 months (95% CI: 5.8 to 20.4) in Arm B. Clinical control was achieved in 28 patients (93.3%) in Arm A and in 21 patients 70.0% in Arm B. Overall response rate was met in 43.3% of patients in Arm A and in 40.0% in Arm B. Toxicities were increased in Arm B with higher rates of diarrhea, nausea, neutropenia, hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) and anorexia, Grad 3 and 4 toxicities were rare.CONCLUSIONS: In this pre-planned interim analysis, paclitaxel-sorafenib combination therapy was not found to be superior to paclitaxel monotherapy with regard to the primary end point, progression-free survival.The trial was therefore discontinued early.There was no indication of more favorable outcomes for combination therapy in secondary efficacy end points.As expected, the safety and toxicity profile of the combination therapy was less favorable compared to monotherapy.Overall, this trial did not demonstrate that adding sorafenib to second- or third-line paclitaxel provides any clinical benefit to patients with HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer.Cautious dosing using a sorafenib ramp up schedule might have contributed to negative results.TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered at EudraCT (No 2009-018025-73) and retrospectively registered at Clinical trials.gov on March 17, 2011 ( NCT01320111 ).",1,1,1,1
31473189,"Accrual of older adults to cancer clinical trials led by the Canadian cancer trials group - Is trial design a barrier?BACKGROUND: Older adults (OA), aged 65years and over, are under-represented in studies.Strict exclusion criteria have been identified as a potential barrier to accrual of OA.This study aims to determine: 1) whether accrual of OA to trials led by the Canadian Cancer Trials Group (CCTG) has increased since 2003; 2) whether exclusion criteria have broadened over time; 3) whether exclusion criteria are associated with lower accrual of OA.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Phase III and randomized phase II CCTG-led trials initiated from 1990 onwards were included.Trial protocols were reviewed for exclusion criteria.Associations between trial characteristics and percentage of OA accrued were compared using multivariate linear regression modelling.The frequency of exclusion criteria in trials initiated pre- and post-2003 was compared using the Chi-Square test or Fisher exact test.RESULTS: Sixty-nine trials involving 34,957 patients were included.Accrual of OA to trials remained low compared to OA diagnosed with cancer in Canada (40.8% vs. 56.1%, p<.001).There was a small increase in the accrual of OA since 2003 (42.8% vs. 39.3%, p=.04).There was no relaxation of exclusion criteria over time.Studies initiated prior to 2003, breast cancer studies and studies with exclusion criteria based on renal dysfunction were associated with lower accrual of OA (p<.05).Central nervous system studies were associated with higher accrual of OA (p=.03).CONCLUSION: OA remain under-represented in trials.While there has been minimal change in exclusion criteria over time, renal dysfunction was the only exclusion criteria associated with lower accrual of OA.",0,0,0,0

31255586,"Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for Symptom Interference in Advanced Lung Cancer and Caregiver Distress: A Pilot Randomized Trial.CONTEXT: Advanced lung cancer patients typically have a poor prognosis and many symptoms that interfere with functioning, contributing to high rates of emotional distress in both patients and family caregivers.There remains a need for evidence-based interventions to improve functional outcomes and distress in this population.OBJECTIVES: This pilot trial examined the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of telephone-based Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) for symptomatic, advanced lung cancer patients and their distressed family caregivers.Primary outcomes were patient symptom interference with functioning and patient and caregiver distress.METHODS: Symptomatic, advanced lung cancer patients and distressed caregivers (n = 50 dyads) were randomly assigned to six sessions of ACT or an education/support condition.Patients completed measures of symptom interference and measures assessing the severity of fatigue, pain, sleep disturbance, and breathlessness.Patients and caregivers completed measures of distress and illness acceptance and struggle.RESULTS: The eligibility screening rate (51%) and retention rate (76% at six weeks postintervention) demonstrated feasibility.No group differences were found with respect to patient and caregiver outcomes.Both groups showed a small, significant decrease in struggle with the illness over the study period, but did not show meaningful change in other outcomes.CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that telephone-based ACT is feasible for many advanced lung cancer patients and caregivers, but may not substantially reduce symptom interference and distress.Low baseline levels of certain symptoms may have contributed to null findings.Next steps include applying ACT to specific, clinically meaningful symptom interference and varying intervention dose and modality.",0,0,0,0

23234763,"Adjuvant lapatinib for women with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer: a randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Worldwide, many patients with HER2-positive early stage breast cancer do not receive trastuzumab-the standard adjuvant treatment.We investigated the efficacy and safety of adjuvant lapatinib for patients with trastuzumab-naive HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer, started at any time after diagnosis.METHODS: This study was a placebo-controlled, multicentre, randomised phase 3 trial.Women outpatients from 405 [corrected] centres in 33 countries [corrected] with HER2-positive early-breast cancer who had previously received adjuvant chemotherapy but not trastuzumab were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive daily lapatinib (1500 mg) or daily placebo for 12 months.Randomisation was done with a computer-generated sequence, stratified by time since diagnosis, lymph node involvement at diagnosis, and tumour hormone-receptor status.Investigators, site staff, and patients were masked to treatment assignment.The primary endpoint was disease-free survival in the intention-to-treat population.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00374322.FINDINGS: Between August, 2006, and May, 2008, 3161 women were enrolled and 3147 were assigned to lapatinib (n=1571) or placebo (n=1576).After a median follow-up of 47.4 months (range 0.4-60.0) in the lapatinib group and 48.3 (0.7-61.3) in the placebo group, 210 (13%) disease-free survival events had occurred in the lapatinib group versus 264 (17%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.83, 95% CI 0.70-1.00; p=0.053).Central review of HER2 status showed that only 2490 (79%) of the randomised women were HER2-positive.157 (13%) of 1230 confirmed HER2-positive patients in the lapatinib group and in 208 (17%) of 1260 in the placebo group had a disease-free survival event (HR 0.82, 95% 0.67-1.00; p=0.04).Serious adverse events occurred in 99 (6%) of 1573 patients taking lapatinib and 77 (5%) of 1574 patients taking placebo, with higher incidences of grade 3-4 diarrhoea (97 [6%] vs nine [<1%]), rash (72 [5%] vs three [<1%]), and hepatobiliary disorders (36 [2%] vs one [<1%]).INTERPRETATION: Our data show that there was no significant difference in disease-free survival between groups when analysed in the intention-to-treat population.However, exploratory analyses restricted to patients who had HER2-positive disease confirmed by central fluorescence in-situ hybridisation review suggested marginal benefit with lapatinib in terms of disease-free survival.Thus lapatinib might be an option for women with HER2-positive breast cancer who do not or cannot receive adjuvant trastuzumab.FUNDING: GlaxoSmithKline.",1,1,1,1
28961845,"Borealis-1: a randomized, first-line, placebo-controlled, phase II study evaluating apatorsen and chemotherapy for patients with advanced urothelial cancer.Background: Five-year survival of patients with inoperable, advanced urothelial carcinoma treated with the first-line chemotherapy is 5%-15%.We assessed whether the Hsp27 inhibitor apatorsen combined with gemcitabine plus cisplatin (GC) could improve overall survival (OS) in these patients.Patients and methods: This placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase II trial randomized 183 untreated urothelial carcinoma patients (North America and Europe) to receive GC plus either placebo (N = 62), 600 mg apatorsen (N = 60), or 1000 mg apatorsen (N = 61).In the experimental arm, treatment included loading doses of apatorsen followed by up to six cycles of apatorsen plus GC.Patients receiving at least four cycles could continue apatorsen monotherapy as maintenance until progression or unacceptable toxicity.The primary end point was OS.Results: OS was not significantly improved in the single or combined 600- or 1000-mg apatorsen arms versus placebo [hazard ratio (HR), 0.86 and 0.90, respectively].Exploratory study of specific statistical modeling showed a trend for improved survival in patients with baseline poor prognostic features treated with 600 mg apatorsen compared with placebo (HR = 0.72).Landmark analysis of serum Hsp27 (sHsp27) levels showed a trend toward survival benefit for poor-prognosis patients in 600- and 1000-mg apatorsen arms who achieved lower area under the curve sHsp27 levels, compared with the placebo arm (HR = 0.45 and 0.62, respectively).Higher baseline circulating tumor cells (>/=5 cells/7.5 ml) was observed in patients with poor prognosis in correlation with poor survival.Treatment-emergent adverse events were manageable and more common in both apatorsen-treatment arms.Conclusions: Even though apatorsen combined with standard chemotherapy did not demonstrate a survival benefit in the overall study population, patients with poor prognostic features might benefit from this combination.Serum Hsp27 levels may act as a biomarker to predict treatment outcome.Further exploration of apatorsen in poor-risk patients is warranted.",1,1,1,1
24903230,"Effect of inspiration on airway dimensions measured in maximal inspiration CT images of subjects without airflow limitation.OBJECTIVES: To study the effect of inspiration on airway dimensions measured in voluntary inspiration breath-hold examinations.METHODS: 961 subjects with normal spirometry were selected from the Danish Lung Cancer Screening Trial.Subjects were examined annually for five years with low-dose CT.Automated software was utilized to segment lungs and airways, identify segmental bronchi, and match airway branches in all images of the same subject.Inspiration level was defined as segmented total lung volume (TLV) divided by predicted total lung capacity (pTLC).Mixed-effects models were used to predict relative change in lumen diameter (ALD) and wall thickness (AWT) in airways of generation 0 (trachea) to 7 and segmental bronchi (R1-R10 and L1-L10) from relative changes in inspiration level.RESULTS: Relative changes in ALD were related to relative changes in TLV/pTLC, and this distensibility increased with generation (p < 0.001).Relative changes in AWT were inversely related to relative changes in TLV/pTLC in generation 3--7 (p < 0.001).Segmental bronchi were widely dispersed in terms of ALD (5.7 +/- 0.7 mm), AWT (0.86 +/- 0.07 mm), and distensibility (23.5 +/- 7.7%).CONCLUSIONS: Subjects who inspire more deeply prior to imaging have larger ALD and smaller AWT.This effect is more pronounced in higher-generation airways.Therefore, adjustment of inspiration level is necessary to accurately assess airway dimensions.KEY POINTS: Airway lumen diameter increases and wall thickness decreases with inspiration.The effect of inspiration is greater in higher-generation (more peripheral) airways.Airways of generation 5 and beyond are as distensible as lung parenchyma.Airway dimensions measured from CT should be adjusted for inspiration level.",0,0,0,0

28972083,"Local Adjuvant Treatment with Low-Dose CpG-B Offers Durable Protection against Disease Recurrence in Clinical Stage I-II Melanoma: Data from Two Randomized Phase II Trials.Purpose: Although risk of recurrence after surgical removal of clinical stage I-II melanoma is considerable, there is no adjuvant therapy with proven efficacy.Here, we provide clinical evidence that a local conditioning regimen, aimed at immunologic arming of the tumor-draining lymph nodes, may provide durable protection against disease recurrence (median follow-up, 88.8 months).Experimental Design: In two randomized phase II trials, patients, diagnosed with stage I-II melanoma after excision of the primary tumor, received local injections at the primary tumor excision site within 7 days preceding re-excision and sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy of either a saline placebo (n = 22) or low-dose CpG type B (CpG-B) with (n = 9) or without (n = 21) low-dose GM-CSF.Results: CpG-B treatment was shown to be safe, to boost locoregional and systemic immunity, to be associated with lower rates of tumor-involved SLN (10% vs. 36% in controls, P = 0.04), and, at a median follow-up of 88.8 months, to profoundly improve recurrence-free survival (P = 0.008), even for patients with histologically confirmed (i.e., pathologic) stage I-II disease (P = 0.02).Conclusions: Potentially offering durable protection, local low-dose CpG-B administration in early-stage melanoma provides an adjuvant treatment option for a large group of patients currently going untreated despite being at considerable risk for disease recurrence.Once validated in a larger randomized phase III trial, this nontoxic immunopotentiating regimen may prove clinically transformative.Clin Cancer Res; 23(19); 5679-86.(c)2017 AACR.",0,0,0,0

All reported p-values are 2 sided.There were no statistically significant differences between two arms in most of the component of the EORTC QLQ-C30 and BR-23 (p > 0.05).There was no significant difference between two treatments (p = 0.6094 for QLQ-C30, p = 0.5516 for BR23) at baseline, and there did not exist significant change over the cycle (p = 0.0914 for QLQ-C30, p = 0.7981 for BR23).There was no significant interaction effect between treatment and cycle (p = 0.5543 for QLQ-C30.p = 0.5817 for BR23).Maintenance PG chemotherapy in patients with MBC achieving disease control with an initial six cycles of PG chemotherapy resulted in better PFS and OS compared to observation without impeding QoL.",0,0,0,0
30215676,"Alectinib versus crizotinib in treatment-naive anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive (ALK+) non-small-cell lung cancer: CNS efficacy results from the ALEX study.Background: The phase III ALEX study in patients with treatment-naive advanced anaplastic lymphoma kinase mutation-positive (ALK+) non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) met its primary end point of improved progression-free survival (PFS) with alectinib versus crizotinib.Here, we present detailed central nervous system (CNS) efficacy data from ALEX.Patients and methods: Overall, 303 patients aged >/=18 years underwent 1:1 randomization to receive twice-daily doses of alectinib 600 mg or crizotinib 250 mg.Brain imaging was conducted in all patients at baseline and every subsequent 8 weeks.End points (analyzed by subgroup: patients with/without baseline CNS metastases; patients with/without prior radiotherapy) included PFS, CNS objective response rate (ORR), and time to CNS progression.Results: In total, 122 patients had Independent Review Committee-assessed baseline CNS metastases (alectinib, n = 64; crizotinib, n = 58), 43 had measurable lesions (alectinib, n = 21; crizotinib, n = 22), and 46 had received prior radiotherapy (alectinib, n = 25; crizotinib, n = 21).Investigator-assessed PFS with alectinib was consistent between patients with baseline CNS metastases [hazard ratio (HR) 0.40, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.25-0.64] and those without (HR 0.51, 95% CI: 0.33-0.80, P interaction = 0.36).Similar results were seen in patients regardless of prior radiotherapy.Time to CNS progression was significantly longer with alectinib versus crizotinib and comparable between patients with and without baseline CNS metastases (P < 0.0001).CNS ORR was 85.7% with alectinib versus 71.4% with crizotinib in patients who received prior radiotherapy and 78.6% versus 40.0%, respectively, in those who had not.Conclusion: Alectinib demonstrated superior CNS activity and significantly delayed CNS progression versus crizotinib in patients with previously untreated, advanced ALK+ NSCLC, irrespective of prior CNS disease or radiotherapy.Clinical trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02075840.",1,1,1,1
23158059,"Chromosome damage and cell proliferation rates in in vitro irradiated whole blood as markers of late radiation toxicity after radiation therapy to the prostate.PURPOSE: In vitro irradiated blood samples from prostate cancer patients showing late normal tissue damage were examined for lymphocyte response by measuring chromosomal aberrations and proliferation rate.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients were selected from a randomized trial evaluating the optimal timing of dose-escalated radiation and short-course androgen deprivation therapy.Of 438 patients, 3% experienced grade 3 late radiation proctitis and were considered to be radiosensitive.Blood samples were taken from 10 of these patients along with 20 matched samples from patients with grade 0 proctitis.The samples were irradiated at 6 Gy and, along with control samples, were analyzed for dicentric chromosomes and excess fragments per cell.Cells in first and second metaphase were also enumerated to determine the lymphocyte proliferation rate.RESULTS: At 6 Gy, there were statistically significant differences between the radiosensitive and control cohorts for 3 endpoints: the mean number of dicentric chromosomes per cell (3.26 +/- 0.31, 2.91 +/- 0.32; P=.0258), the mean number of excess fragments per cell (2.27 +/- 0.23, 1.43 +/- 0.37; P<.0001), and the proportion of cells in second metaphase (0.27 +/- 0.10, 0.46 +/- 0.09; P=.0007).CONCLUSIONS: These results may be a valuable indicator for identifying radiosensitive patients and for tailoring radiation therapy.",0,0,0,0
