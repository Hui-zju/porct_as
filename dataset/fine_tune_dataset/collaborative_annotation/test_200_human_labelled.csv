21684626,"Randomized phase II study of gefitinib versus erlotinib in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who failed previous chemotherapy.PURPOSE: Gefitinib and erlotinib are potent EGFR TKIs, with antitumor activity.In this randomized, single-center, non-comparative phase II trial, the efficacy and safety of gefitinib and erlotinib was evaluated as the second-line therapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with locally advanced, metastatic stage IIIB/IV NSCLC who failed first-line chemotherapy and had either EGFR mutation or at least two out of three clinical factors associated with higher incidence of EGFR mutations (female, adenocarcinoma histology, and never-smoker) were eligible.RESULTS: A total of 96 (48 per arm) patients were randomly assigned to gefitinib- or erlotinib-arm, respectively.Baseline characteristics were well-balanced between the two arms.The response rates (RR) were 47.9% in the gefitinib arm and 39.6% in the erlotinib arm.Median PFS was 4.9 months (95% CI, 1.3-8.5) in the gefitinib arm and 3.1 months (95% CI, 0.0-6.4) in the erlotinib arm.The most common grade 3/4 toxicity was skin rash.Exploratory analyses showed that there was no significant difference in RR and PFS in the gefitinib arm compared to the erlotinib arm (RR (%) 47.9 vs. 39.6, p=0.269; median survival (months) 4.9 vs. 3.1, p=0.336).There was no significant difference in QOL between the two arms.CONCLUSION: Both gefitinib and erlotinib showed effective activity and tolerable toxicity profiles as second-line treatment for the selected population of NSCLC.We may consider conducting a phase III trial to directly compare the efficacy and toxicity between gefitinib and erlotinib in an enriched patient population.",1,1,1,1
21816640,"A non-comparative randomized phase II study of 2 doses of ATN-224, a copper/zinc superoxide dismutase inhibitor, in patients with biochemically recurrent hormone-naive prostate cancer.OBJECTIVE: ATN-224 (choline tetrathiomolybdate) is an oral Cu(2+)/Zn(2+)-superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) inhibitor with preclinical antitumor activity.We hypothesized that ATN-224 may induce antitumor effects as an antiangiogenic agent at low dose-levels while possessing direct antitumor activity at higher dose-levels.The objective of this study was to screen its clinical activity in patients with biochemically recurrent hormone-naive prostate cancer.METHODS: Biochemically-recurrent prostate cancer patients with prostate specific antigen doubling times (PSADT) < 12 months, no radiographic evidence of metastasis, and no hormonal therapy within 6 months (with serum testosterone levels > 150 ng/dl) were eligible.ATN-224 was administered at 2 dose-levels, 300 mg (n = 23) or 30 mg (n = 24) daily, by way of randomization.PSA progression was defined as a >/= 50% increase (and >5 ng/ml) in PSA from baseline or post-treatment nadir.Endpoints included the proportion of patients who were free of PSA progression at 24 weeks, changes in PSA slope/PSADT, and safety.The study was not powered to detect differences between the 2 treatment groups.RESULTS: At 24 weeks, 59% (95% CI 33%-82%) of men in the low-dose arm and 45% (95% CI 17%-77%) in the high-dose arm were PSA progression-free.Median PSA progression-free survival was 30 weeks (95% CI 21-40(+)) and 26 weeks (95% CI 24-39(+)) in the low-dose and high-dose groups, respectively.Pre- and on-treatment PSA kinetics analyses showed a significant mean PSA slope decrease (P = 0.006) and a significant mean PSADT increase (P = 0.032) in the low-dose arm only.Serum ceruloplasmin levels, a biomarker for ATN-224 activity, were lowered in the high-dose group, but did not correlate with PSA changes.CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose ATN-224 (30 mg daily) may have biologic activity in men with biochemically-recurrent prostate cancer, as suggested by an improvement in PSA kinetics.However, the clinical significance of PSA kinetics changes in this patient population remains uncertain.The absence of a dose-response effect also reduces enthusiasm, and there are currently no plans to further develop this agent in prostate cancer.",1,1,1,0
22002564,"The efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant chemotherapy +/- letrozole in postmenopausal women with locally advanced breast cancer: a randomized phase III clinical trial.This two-arm randomized clinical study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant concurrent chemotherapy and letrozole in postmenopausal women with locally advanced breast carcinoma.One hundred and one postmenopausal women aged 50-83 years with pathologically proven locally advanced (clinical stage T3, T4 and/or N2, N3) breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone (control arm, n = 51) or neoadjuvant chemotherapy concurrent with letrozole 2.5 mg (study arm, n = 50).Chemotherapy consisted of a median 4 (range 3-5) cycles of intravenous 5-fluorouracil 600 mg/m(2), doxorubicin 60 mg/m(2), and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2), every three weeks.All patients subsequently underwent modified radical mastectomy approximately two weeks after the last cycle of chemotherapy.Pathologic complete response rates were 25.5% and 10.2% in the study and the control group, respectively (P = 0.049).Similarly, clinical complete response rates were 27.6% and 10.2% in the study and the control group, respectively (P = 0.037).In the subgroup analysis of hormone receptor-positive cases, the complete response rates were more prominent in study group compared with control group.Common treatment-related side effects such as nausea, vomiting, bone marrow suppression, and mucositis were similar in both groups, but hot flush was more prevalent in study group compared with control group (P = 0.023).The addition of letrozole concurrently with neoadjuvant chemotherapy provides a higher clinical and pathologic response rates with acceptable toxicity compared with chemotherapy alone in postmenopausal women with locally advanced sensitive breast cancer.",1,1,1,0
22111942,"The long-term outcome of patients with polycystic liver disease treated with lanreotide.BACKGROUND: Polycystic liver disease (PLD) is a phenotypical expression of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and isolated polycystic liver disease.Somatostatin analogues, such as lanreotide, reduce polycystic liver volume.AIM: To establish long-term outcome and safety of lanreotide.METHODS: This was an open-label, observational extension study of a 6-month, randomised, placebo-controlled trial with lanreotide (120 mg/month) in PLD.The length of total treatment was 12 months.Primary endpoint was relative change in liver volume, as determined by CT-volumetry after 12 months of treatment.We offered patients a CT scan 6 months after stopping lanreotide.RESULTS: A total of 41/54 (76%) patients participated in the extension study.Liver volume decreased by 4% (IQR -8% to -1%) after 12 months of treatment.The greatest effect was observed during the first 6 months of treatment (decrease of 4% (IQR -6% to -1%)).Liver volume remained unchanged during the following 6 months.We found that liver volume increased by 4% (IQR 0-6%) 6 months after end of treatment (n = 22).CONCLUSIONS: Lanreotide reduces liver volume within the first 6 months of treatment and the beneficial effect is maintained in the following 6 months.Stopping results in recurrence of polycystic liver growth.This suggests that continuous use of lanreotide is needed to maintain its effect.",1,0,0,0
22112608,"A phase II study of aflibercept in patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer and symptomatic malignant ascites.OBJECTIVE: The recombinant fusion protein, aflibercept binds and neutralizes vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) A, B and placental growth factor (PlGF).Aflibercept inhibits ascites formation and reduces tumor burden in an ovarian cancer model.This open-label, single-arm, multicenter phase II study assessed the efficacy and safety of aflibercept in patients with advanced chemo-resistant epithelial ovarian cancer and symptomatic malignant ascites.METHODS: Patients who required >/=3 previous paracenteses at 1-4 paracenteses per month received intravenous aflibercept 4mg/kg every 2 weeks.The primary endpoint was repeat paracentesis response rate (RPRR), with response defined as at least a two-fold increase in time to repeat paracentesis compared with the baseline interval.RESULTS: Ten out of 16 enrolled patients achieved a response; the RPRR was 62.5% (95% CI 35.4%-84.8%).Aflibercept was considered effective based on a hypothesis that the RPRR was >/=60%.Median time to repeat paracentesis was 76.0 (95% CI 64.0-178.0) days, which was 4.5 times longer than the baseline interval (16.8 days).Median progression-free survival was 59.5 (95% CI 41.0-83.0) days.Twelve patients experienced adverse events considered related to aflibercept treatment including hypertension (7 patients), headache, anorexia, and dysphonia (3 patients each).Two patients experienced Grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events (Grade 3 hypertension and weight loss in one patient, Grade 3 intestinal perforation in one patient).CONCLUSION: Aflibercept 4mg/kg every 2 weeks was effective at controlling malignant ascites, reducing the interval between repeat paracenteses.The safety profile was consistent with that reported for anti-VEGF agents.",0,0,0,0
22285168,"Erlotinib versus standard chemotherapy as first-line treatment for European patients with advanced EGFR mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (EURTAC): a multicentre, open-label, randomised phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Erlotinib has been shown to improve progression-free survival compared with chemotherapy when given as first-line treatment for Asian patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with activating EGFR mutations.We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of erlotinib compared with standard chemotherapy for first-line treatment of European patients with advanced EGFR-mutation positive NSCLC.METHODS: We undertook the open-label, randomised phase 3 EURTAC trial at 42 hospitals in France, Italy, and Spain.Eligible participants were adults (> 18 years) with NSCLC and EGFR mutations (exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation in exon 21) with no history of chemotherapy for metastatic disease (neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy ending >/= 6 months before study entry was allowed).We randomly allocated participants (1:1) according to a computer-generated allocation schedule to receive oral erlotinib 150 mg per day or 3 week cycles of standard intravenous chemotherapy of cisplatin 75 mg/m(2) on day 1 plus docetaxel (75 mg/m(2) on day 1) or gemcitabine (1250 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 8).Carboplatin (AUC 6 with docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) or AUC 5 with gemcitabine 1000 mg/m(2)) was allowed in patients unable to have cisplatin.Patients were stratified by EGFR mutation type and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (0 vs 1 vs 2).The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) in the intention-to-treat population.We assessed safety in all patients who received study drug (>/= 1 dose).This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00446225.FINDINGS: Between Feb 15, 2007, and Jan 4, 2011, 174 patients with EGFR mutations were enrolled.One patient received treatment before randomisation and was thus withdrawn from the study; of the remaining patients, 86 were randomly assigned to receive erlotinib and 87 to receive standard chemotherapy.The preplanned interim analysis showed that the study met its primary endpoint; enrolment was halted, and full evaluation of the results was recommended.At data cutoff (Jan 26, 2011), median PFS was 9.7 months (95% CI 8.4-12.3) in the erlotinib group, compared with 5.2 months (4.5-5.8) in the standard chemotherapy group (hazard ratio 0.37, 95% CI 0.25-0.54; p < 0.0001).Main grade 3 or 4 toxicities were rash (11 [13%] of 84 patients given erlotinib vs none of 82 patients in the chemotherapy group), neutropenia (none vs 18 [22%]), anaemia (one [1%] vs three [4%]), and increased amino-transferase concentrations (two [2%] vs 0).Five (6%) patients on erlotinib had treatment-related severe adverse events compared with 16 patients (20%) on chemotherapy.One patient in the erlotinib group and two in the standard chemotherapy group died from treatment-related causes.INTERPRETATION: Our findings strengthen the rationale for routine baseline tissue-based assessment of EGFR mutations in patients with NSCLC and for treatment of mutation-positive patients with EGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitors.FUNDING: Spanish Lung Cancer Group, Roche Farma, Hoffmann-La Roche, and Red Tematica de Investigacion Cooperativa en Cancer.",1,1,1,1
22397392,"Use of dairy products, lactose, and calcium and risk of ovarian cancer - results from a Danish case-control study.BACKGROUND: A number of epidemiological studies have examined the association between use of dairy products and risk of ovarian cancer, but results are conflicting.Using data from a large Danish population-based case-control study we here further examined the association between dairy consumption, lactose, and calcium and risk of overall ovarian cancer and histological types of ovarian cancer.MATERIAL AND METHODS: In the period 1995-1999 we included 554 women with epithelial ovarian cancer and 1554 randomly selected age-matched controls (35-79 years).All women participated in a detailed personal interview that included questions about dairy consumption.Data were analysed using multiple logistic regression models.RESULTS: Total dairy intake was associated with ovarian cancer risk (OR = 1.11; 95% CI: 1.07-1.15 per 100 ml/day).The association was strongest for milk [OR = 1.14; 95% CI: 1.03-1.27 per glass (200 ml)/day], soured milk products [OR = 1.49; 95% CI: 1.22-1.81 per portion (250 ml)/day] and yoghurt [OR = 1.65; 95% CI: 1.22-2.23 per portion (250 ml)/day].In contrast, intake of cheese was associated with a decreased risk [OR = 0.70; 95% CI: 0.55-0.89 for > 1 portion (100 ml)/day compared with no intake].Intake of lactose, but not calcium, was also associated with an increased ovarian cancer risk (OR = 1.24; 95% CI: 1.10-1.40 per 10 g of lactose/day).Similar risk patterns were observed for the different histological types of ovarian cancer, indicating virtually identical aetiologies with regard to dairy intake, lactose, and calcium.CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that intake of dairy products is associated with a modest increased risk of ovarian cancer.In addition, ovarian cancer development was associated with lactose intake.",0,0,0,0
22493422,"Antitumor activity and safety of tivozanib (AV-951) in a phase II randomized discontinuation trial in patients with renal cell carcinoma.PURPOSE: The antitumor activity and safety of tivozanib, which is a potent and selective vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1, -2, and -3 inhibitor, was assessed in patients with advanced/metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC).PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this phase II, randomized discontinuation trial, 272 patients received open-label tivozanib 1.5 mg/d (one cycle equaled three treatment weeks followed by a 1-week break) orally for 16 weeks.Thereafter, 78 patients who demonstrated >/= 25% tumor shrinkage continued to take tivozanib, and 118 patients with less than 25% tumor change were randomly assigned to receive tivozanib or a placebo in a double-blind manner; patients with >/= 25% tumor growth were discontinued.Primary end points included safety, the objective response rate (ORR) at 16 weeks, and the percentage of randomly assigned patients who remained progression free after 12 weeks of double-blind treatment; secondary end points included progression-free survival (PFS).RESULTS: Of 272 patients enrolled onto the study, 83% of patients had clear-cell histology, 73% of patients had undergone nephrectomy, and 54% of patients were treatment naive.The ORR after 16 weeks of tivozanib treatment was 18% (95% CI, 14% to 23%).Of the 118 randomized patients, significantly more patients who were randomly assigned to receive double-blind tivozanib remained progression free after 12 weeks versus patients who received the placebo (49% v 21%; P = .001).Throughout the study, the ORR was 24% (95% CI, 19% to 30%), and the median PFS was 11.7 months (95% CI, 8.3 to 14.3 months) in the overall study population.The most common grade 3 and 4 treatment-related adverse event was hypertension (12%).CONCLUSION: Tivozanib was active and well tolerated in patients with advanced RCC.These data support additional development of tivozanib in advanced RCC.",1,1,1,0
22502942,"Addition of radiotherapy to long-term androgen deprivation in locally advanced prostate cancer: an open randomised phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Radiotherapy combined with androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) is superior to radiotherapy alone in localised prostate cancer; however, data comparing ADT alone are somewhat limited.OBJECTIVE: To compare 3-yr ADT plus radiotherapy with ADT alone in locally advanced prostate cancer patients.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A multicentre randomised open controlled phase 3 trial in 264 histologically confirmed T3-4 or pT3N0M0 prostate cancer patients randomised from March 2000 to December 2003.INTERVENTION: ADT (11.25mg subcutaneous depot injection of leuprorelin every 3 mo for 3 yr) plus external-beam radiotherapy or ADT alone.Flutamide (750 g/d) was administered for 1 mo.OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The primary objective was 5 yr progression-free survival (PFS) according to clinical or biologic criteria, using the American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology (ASTRO) and the newer (Phoenix) definition (nadir plus 2 ng/ml), by intention to treat.Secondary objectives included time to locoregional recurrence and distant metastases, and overall and disease-specific survival.Our Analyses: intent-to-treat analysis, multivariate analyses using a Cox model with a 5% threshold from univariate analysis, and Kaplan-Meier estimates.RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: ADT alone was administered to 130 patients and combined therapy to 133.With a median follow-up of 67 mo, 5-yr PFS was 60.9% for combined therapy versus 8.5% with ADT alone (ASTRO; p<0.0001), and 64.7% versus 15.4%, respectively, for Phoenix (p<0.0011).Locoregional progression was reported in 9.8% of combined-therapy patients versus 29.2% with ADT alone (p<0.0001) and metastatic progression in 3.0% versus 10.8%, respectively (p<0.018).Overall survival was 71.4% with combined therapy versus 71.5% with ADT alone; disease-specific survival was 93.2% versus 86.2%.Limitations included the relatively small population and a relatively short follow-up period.CONCLUSIONS: Combined therapy strongly favoured improved PFS, locoregional control, and metastasis-free survival.Longer follow-up is needed to assess the potential survival impact.",1,1,1,0
22523181,"A randomized trial of aerobic exercise and sleep quality in lymphoma patients receiving chemotherapy or no treatments.BACKGROUND: Patients with lymphoma experience sleep problems that may be managed with aerobic exercise but no previous study has examined this issue.METHODS: We randomized 122 patients with lymphoma to usual care (n = 62) or 12 weeks of supervised aerobic exercise training (AET; n = 60).Our primary sleep endpoint was global sleep quality assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).Secondary endpoints were the PSQI component scores.Planned subgroup analyses were also conducted.RESULTS: Intention-to-treat analyses indicated that AET resulted in a nonsignificant (P = 0.16) improvement in global sleep quality compared with usual care [mean group difference = -0.64; 95% confidence interval (CI), -1.56 to +0.27].In planned subgroup analyses, statistically significant or borderline significant interactions were identified for type of lymphoma (P(interaction) = 0.006), current treatment status (P(interaction) = 0.036), time since diagnosis (P(interaction) = 0.010), body mass index (P(interaction) = 0.075), and baseline sleep quality (P(interaction) = 0.041).Specifically, AET improved global sleep quality in patients with lymphoma who had indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (P = 0.001), were receiving chemotherapy (P = 0.013), were <2 years post-diagnosis (P = 0.005), were obese (P = 0.025), and were poor sleepers at baseline (P = 0.007).CONCLUSIONS: AET did not significantly improve sleep quality in this heterogeneous sample of patients with lymphoma; however, clinically identifiable subgroups appeared to benefit.Future exercise trials targeting these responsive subgroups are needed to confirm these findings.IMPACT: If replicated in larger and more focused trials, aerobic exercise may be an attractive option to manage sleep dysfunction in patients with cancer because of its favorable safety profile and other documented health benefits.",1,1,0,0
22534669,"Randomized phase II trial of first-line treatment with pemetrexed-cisplatin, followed sequentially by gefitinib or pemetrexed, in East Asian, never-smoker patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.INTRODUCTION: Treatment with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitors or chemotherapy have shown improved survival outcomes in East Asian, never-smoker patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).However, treatment sequence has not been optimized in patients with unknown EGFR mutation status.This trial compared first-line chemotherapy with pemetrexed (P)-cisplatin (C), followed by either gefitinib (G) or P maintenance.METHODS: East Asian, never-smoker, chemo-naive patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC, performance status </=1 and unknown EGFR mutation status were randomized 1:1 to receive 4 cycles of pemetrexed [500 mg/m(2)]+cisplatin [75 mg/m(2)] q3 weeks, followed by maintenance with either gefitinib [250 mg/d] (PC/G) or pemetrexed [500 mg/m(2)] q3 weeks and </=2 optional cycles of cisplatin (PC/P).The primary endpoint, progression-free survival (PFS), was calculated from randomization date.RESULTS: Between Feb and Nov 2007, 70 patients from China, Korea, and Taiwan were randomized and treated, among whom 59 patients (84.3%) had non-squamous NSCLC.Forty-nine patients (70.0%) completed the full sequential treatment (n=25 G; n=24 P).Median PFS was numerically longer for patients on PC/G (9.95 months) than those on PC/P (6.83 months; hazard ratio [HR]=0.53, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.27, 1.04).In contrast, median overall survival was numerically higher for patients on PC/P (HR=2.15, 95% CI=0.83, 5.60), though there was a high censoring rate.Response rate was similar in both arms.Treatment arms were similar for grade 3/4/5 toxicities.CONCLUSIONS: East Asian never-smoker patients with advanced NSCLC and unknown EGFR mutation status had improved PFS following treatment with first-line PC and sequential G.

22851563,"IGH@ translocations, CRLF2 deregulation, and microdeletions in adolescents and adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.PURPOSE: To determine the prevalence and prognostic impact of significant acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) -related genes: CRLF2 deregulation (CRLF2-d), IGH@ translocations (IGH@-t), and deletions of CDKN2A/B, IKZF1, PAX5, ETV6, RB1, BTG1, and EBF1 in adolescents and adults.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The cohort comprised 454 patients (age 15 to 60 years old) treated on the multicenter United Kingdom Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia Trial XII/Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 2993 trial (UKALLXII/ECOG2993) with Philadelphia-negative B-cell precursor ALL.Fluorescent in situ hybridization and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification were used to detect these genetic alterations.RESULTS: Twenty patients (5%) had CRLF2-d (P2RY8-CRLF2, n = 7; IGH@-CRLF2, n = 13), and 36 patients (8%) harbored an IGH@-t with a different partner gene.There was little overlap between IGH@-t, CRLF2-d, and established chromosomal abnormalities.Deletions of CDKN2A/B, IKZF1, PAX5, ETV6, RB1, BTG1, or EBF1 were prevalent with 101 (33%) of 304 patients harboring one and 102 (33%) harboring two or more alterations, occurring with varying frequency in all cytogenetic subgroups.The 5-year event-free survival, relapse-free survival (RFS), and overall survival (OS) rates for the whole cohort were 40%, 55%, and 43%, respectively.Patients with CRLF2-d, IGH@-t, and IKZF1 deletions were associated with an inferior outcome in univariate but not multivariate analysis.In particular, CRLF2-d patients had a lower RFS compared with other patients (30%), whereas those with IGH@-t or IKZF1 deletions had a lower OS (27% and 35%, respectively).CONCLUSION: CRLF2-d and IGH@-t represent distinct subtypes of adolescent and adult ALL.Deletions of key B-cell differentiation and cell cycle control genes are highly prevalent but vary in frequency by cytogenetic subgroup.CRLF2-d, IGH@-t, and IKZF1 deletions are associated with poor outcome in adolescent and adult ALL.",0,0,0,0
22879576,"Cancer-specific concerns and physical activity among recently diagnosed breast and prostate cancer survivors.BACKGROUND: Cancer treatment -related side effects may have a negative impact on quality of life among cancer survivors and may limit participation in physical activity (PA).HYPOTHESIS: Cancer-specific concerns will be reduced throughout a 10-month diet and exercise intervention among recently diagnosed cancer survivors.Additionally, participants reporting greater levels of PA will also report fewer cancer-specific concerns.STUDY DESIGN: This study is an exploratory analysis of 452 recently diagnosed, early-stage breast and prostate cancer survivors who participated in the FRESH START diet and exercise trial.Data were collected at baseline and 1-year follow-up.RESULTS: At baseline, chief concerns among prostate cancer survivors included ability to have an erection (mean score [standard deviation] = 1.0 [1.3]) and urinary frequency (2.5 [1.4]), whereas among breast cancer survivors, eminent concerns were not feeling sexually attractive (2.0 [1.3]) and worry about cancer in other members of their family (2.1 [1.3]).At 1 year, there was a significant improvement in cancer-specific concerns on breast cancer-specific concerns (P < .01) but not on prostate cancer-specific concerns.At baseline, women who were self-conscious about their dress had higher levels of PA, whereas men reporting issues with incontinence reported lesser increases in PA in response to the intervention.CONCLUSION: Cancer-specific concerns diminish over time, especially among breast cancer survivors.Among prostate cancer survivors, incontinence is a significant barrier that hinders benefit from PA interventions.Thus, there is a need either for medical interventions to ameliorate incontinence or for behavioral interventions to address this issue among survivors.",0,0,0,0
22894887,"A randomized, blinded study of the impact of intercessory prayer on spiritual well-being in patients with cancer.CONTEXT: Cochrane reviews have analyzed multiple studies on intercessory prayer that treatment teams had added to health interventions; however, the reviewers could draw no conclusions about the efficacy of prayer because the studies showed either positive or no effects and used different endpoints and methodologies.OBJECTIVE: The study intended to determine whether researchers could measure the impact of intercessory prayer on spiritual well-being.DESIGN: The research team conducted a randomized blinded trial of intercessory prayer added to normal cancer treatment with participants agreeing to complete quality of life (QOL) and spiritual well-being scales at baseline and 6 months later.The research team had shown previously that spiritual well-being is an important, unique domain in the assessment of QOL.Participants remained blinded to the randomization.Based on a previous study, the research team determined that the study required a sample of 1000 participants to detect small differences (P = .05, 2-tailed, 80% power).SETTING The research team performed this research at the Royal Adelaide Hospital Cancer Centre, South Australia, Australia.PARTICIPANTS: Participants were patients at the cancer center between June 2003 and May 2008.Of 999 participants with mixed diagnoses who completed the baseline questionnaires, 66.6% provided follow-up.The average age was 61 years, and most participants were married/de facto (living with partners), were Australians or New Zealanders living in Australia, and were Christian.Intervention The research team asked an external group offering Christian intercessory prayer to add the study's participants to their usual prayer lists.They received details about the participants, but this information was not sufficient to identify them.Outcome Measures The research team used the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Spiritual Well-being questionnaire to assess spiritual wellbeing and QOL.Results The intervention group showed significantly greater improvements over time for the primary endpoint of spiritual well-being as compared to the control group (P = .03, partial eta2 = .01).The study found a similar result for emotional well-being (P = .04, partial eta2 = .01) and functional well-being (P = .06, partial eta2 = .01).CONCLUSIONS: Participants with cancer whom the research team randomly allocated to the experimental group to receive remote intercessory prayer showed small but significant improvements in spiritual well-being.",1,1,0,0

23019151,"Radiation therapy following surgery for localized breast cancer: outcome prediction by classical prognostic factors and approximated genetic subtypes.The purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcome prediction power of classical prognostic factors along with surrogate approximation of genetic signatures (AGS) subtypes in patients affected by localized breast cancer (BC) and treated with postoperative radiotherapy.We retrospectively analyzed 468 consecutive female patients affected by localized BC with complete immunohistochemical and pathological information available.All patients underwent surgery plus radiotherapy.Median follow-up was 59 months (range, 6-132) from the diagnosis.Disease recurrences (DR), local and/or distant, and contralateral breast cancer (CBC) were registered and analyzed in relation to subtypes (luminal A, luminal B, HER-2, and basal), and classical prognostic factors (PFs), namely age, nodal status (N), tumor classification (T), grading (G), estrogen receptors (ER), progesterone receptors and erb-B2 status.Bootstrap technique for variable selection and bootstrap resampling to test selection stability were used.Regarding AGS subtypes, HER-2 and basal were more likely to recur than luminal A and B subtypes, while patients in the basal group were more likely to have CBC.However, considering PFs along with AGS subtypes, the optimal multivariable predictive model for DR consisted of age, T, N, G and ER.A single-variable model including basal subtype resulted again as the optimal predictive model for CBC.In patients bearing localized BC the combination of classical clinical variables age, T, N, G and ER was still confirmed to be the best predictor of DR, while the basal subtype was demonstrated to be significantly and exclusively correlated with CBC.",0,0,0,0
23154393,"Axillary dissection versus no axillary dissection in older patients with T1N0 breast cancer: 15-year results of a randomized controlled trial.OBJECTIVE: To assess the role of axillary dissection in older breast cancer patients with a clinically clear axilla.BACKGROUND: Axillary dissection, once standard treatment for breast cancer, is associated with considerable morbidity.It has been substituted by sentinel node biopsy with dissection only if the sentinel node is positive.We aimed to determine whether axillary surgery can be omitted in older women, thereby sparing them morbidity, without compromising long-term disease control.METHODS: We carried out a randomized clinical trial on 238 older (65-80 years) breast cancer patients, with clinically N0 disease of radiographic diameter 2 cm or less.Patients were randomized to quadrantectomy with or without axillary dissection.All received radiotherapy to the residual breast but not the axilla; all were prescribed tamoxifen for 5 years.Main outcome measures were overall survival and breast cancer mortality.We also assessed overt axillary disease in those who did not receive axillary dissection.RESULTS: After 15 years of follow-up, distant metastasis rate, overall survival, and breast cancer mortality in the axillary dissection and no axillary dissection arms were indistinguishable.The 15-year cumulative incidence of overt axillary disease in the no axillary dissection arm was only 6%.CONCLUSIONS: Older patients with early breast cancer and a clinically clear axilla treated by conservative surgery, postoperative radiotherapy, and adjuvant tamoxifen do not benefit from axillary dissection.This study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (ID NCT00002720).",1,1,1,0
23177515,"Efficacy and safety of regorafenib for advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumours after failure of imatinib and sunitinib (GRID): an international, multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Until now, only imatinib and sunitinib have proven clinical benefit in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST), but almost all metastatic GIST eventually develop resistance to these agents, resulting in fatal disease progression.We aimed to assess efficacy and safety of regorafenib in patients with metastatic or unresectable GIST progressing after failure of at least imatinib and sunitinib.METHODS: We did this phase 3 trial at 57 hospitals in 17 countries.Patients with histologically confirmed, metastatic or unresectable GIST, with failure of at least previous imatinib and sunitinib were randomised in a 2:1 ratio (by computer-generated randomisation list and interactive voice response system; preallocated block design (block size 12); stratified by treatment line and geographical region) to receive either oral regorafenib 160 mg daily or placebo, plus best supportive care in both groups, for the first 3 weeks of each 4 week cycle.The study sponsor, participants, and investigators were masked to treatment assignment.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS).At disease progression, patients assigned placebo could crossover to open-label regorafenib.Analyses were by intention to treat.This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01271712.RESULTS: From Jan 4, to Aug 18, 2011, 240 patients were screened and 199 were randomised to receive regorafenib (n=133) or matching placebo (n=66).Data cutoff was Jan 26, 2012.Median PFS per independent blinded central review was 4.8 months (IQR 1.4-9.2) for regorafenib and 0.9 months (0.9-1.8) for placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0.27, 95% CI 0.19-0.39; p<0.0001).After progression, 56 patients (85%) assigned placebo crossed over to regorafenib.Drug-related adverse events were reported in 130 (98%) patients assigned regorafenib and 45 (68%) patients assigned placebo.The most common regorafenib-related adverse events of grade 3 or higher were hypertension (31 of 132, 23%), hand-foot skin reaction (26 of 132, 20%), and diarrhoea (seven of 132, 5%).INTERPRETATION: The results of this study show that oral regorafenib can provide a significant improvement in progression-free survival compared with placebo in patients with metastatic GIST after progression on standard treatments.As far as we are aware, this is the first clinical trial to show benefit from a kinase inhibitor in this highly refractory population of patients.FUNDING: Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals.",1,1,1,0
23216985,"Breast ductal lavage for biomarker assessment in high risk women: rationale, design and methodology of a randomized phase II clinical trial with nimesulide, simvastatin and placebo.BACKGROUND: Despite positive results from large phase III clinical trials proved that it is possible to prevent estrogen-responsive breast cancers with selective estrogen receptor modulators and aromatase inhibitors, no significant results have been reached so far to prevent hormone non-responsive tumors.The Ductal Lavage (DL) procedure offers a minimally invasive method to obtain breast epithelial cells from the ductal system for cytopathologic analysis.Several studies with long-term follow-up have shown that women with atypical hyperplasia have an elevated risk of developing breast cancer.The objective of the proposed trial is to assess the efficacy and safety of a daily administration of nimesulide or simvastatin in women at higher risk for breast cancer, focused particularly on hormone non-responsive tumor risk.The primary endpoint is the change in prevalence of atypical cells and cell proliferation (measured by Ki67) in DL or fine needle aspirate samples, after 12 months of treatment and 12 months after treatment cessation.METHODS-DESIGN: From 2005 to 2011, 150 women with a history of estrogen receptor negative ductal intraepithelial neoplasia or lobular intraepithelial neoplasia or atypical hyperplasia, or unaffected subjects carrying a mutation of BRCA1 or with a probability of mutation >10% (according to BRCAPRO) were randomized to receive nimesulide 100mg/day versus simvastatin 20mg/day versus placebo for one year followed by a second year of follow-up.DISCUSSION: This is the first randomized placebo controlled trial to evaluate the role of DL to study surrogate endpoints biomarkers and the effects of these drugs on breast carcinogenesis.In 2007 the European Medicines Agency limited the use of systemic formulations of nimesulide to 15 days.According to the European Institute of Oncology Ethics Committee communication, we are now performing an even more careful monitoring of the study participants.Preliminary results showed that DL is a feasible procedure, the treatment is well tolerated and the safety blood tests do not show any significant liver toxicity.There is an urgent need to confirm in the clinical setting the potential efficacy of other compounds in contrasting hormone non-responsive breast cancer.This paper is focused on the methodology and operational aspects of the clinical trial.TRIAL REGISTRATION: (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01500577).",1,1,0,0

23433739,"Bendamustine plus rituximab versus CHOP plus rituximab as first-line treatment for patients with indolent and mantle-cell lymphomas: an open-label, multicentre, randomised, phase 3 non-inferiority trial.BACKGROUND: Rituximab plus chemotherapy, most often CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone), is the first-line standard of care for patients with advanced indolent lymphoma, and for elderly patients with mantle-cell lymphoma.Bendamustine plus rituximab is effective for relapsed or refractory disease.We compared bendamustine plus rituximab with CHOP plus rituximab (R-CHOP) as first-line treatment for patients with indolent and mantle-cell lymphomas.METHODS: We did a prospective, multicentre, randomised, open-label, non-inferiority trial at 81 centres in Germany between Sept 1, 2003, and Aug 31, 2008.Patients aged 18 years or older with a WHO performance status of 2 or less were eligible if they had newly diagnosed stage III or IV indolent or mantle-cell lymphoma.Patients were stratified by histological lymphoma subtype, then randomly assigned according to a prespecified randomisation list to receive either intravenous bendamustine (90 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 2 of a 4-week cycle) or CHOP (cycles every 3 weeks of cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m(2), doxorubicin 50 mg/m(2), and vincristine 1.4 mg/m(2) on day 1, and prednisone 100 mg/day for 5 days) for a maximum of six cycles.Patients in both groups received rituximab 375 mg/m(2) on day 1 of each cycle.Patients and treating physicians were not masked to treatment allocation.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, with a non-inferiority margin of 10%.Analysis was per protocol.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00991211, and the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices of Germany, BfArM 4021335.FINDINGS: 274 patients were assigned to bendamustine plus rituximab (261 assessed) and 275 to R-CHOP (253 assessed).At median follow-up of 45 months (IQR 25-57), median progression-free survival was significantly longer in the bendamustine plus rituximab group than in the R-CHOP group (69.5 months [26.1 to not yet reached] vs 31.2 months [15.2-65.7]; hazard ratio 0.58, 95% CI 0.44-0.74; p<0.0001).Bendamustine plus rituximab was better tolerated than R-CHOP, with lower rates of alopecia (0 patients vs 245 (100%) of 245 patients who recieved >/=3 cycles; p<0.0001), haematological toxicity (77 [30%] vs 173 [68%]; p<0.0001), infections (96 [37%] vs 127 [50%]); p=0.0025), peripheral neuropathy (18 [7%] vs 73 [29%]; p<0.0001), and stomatitis (16 [6%] vs 47 [19%]; p<0.0001).Erythematous skin reactions were more common in patients in the bendamustine plus rituximab group than in those in the R-CHOP group (42 [16%] vs 23 [9%]; p=0.024).INTERPRETATION: In patients with previously untreated indolent lymphoma, bendamustine plus rituximab can be considered as a preferred first-line treatment approach to R-CHOP because of increased progression-free survival and fewer toxic effects.FUNDING: Roche Pharma AG, Ribosepharm/Mundipharma GmbH.",1,1,1,0
23474344,"Do survivorship care plans impact patients' evaluations of care? A randomized evaluation with gynecologic oncology patients.OBJECTIVE: Despite recommendations from the Institute of Medicine regarding survivorship care plan (SCP) delivery to cancer patients, there have been few health service outcome evaluations thus far.METHODS: Gynecologic cancer survivors who were up to one-year post-treatment could participate in an evaluation assessing the health services provided and their perceptions of quality of care.A randomized, nested, cross-sectional design was used in a large group gynecologic oncology practice.Half (n=3) of the physicians were randomized to provide and discuss a SCP to patients during a follow-up visit, and the other half did not.Following their visits, all patients were informed that a health service evaluation of the practice was being conducted.Interested patients completed an anonymous 26-item survey assessing administrative, clinical, and educational health services, helpfulness of written materials, and perceptions of quality of care.RESULTS: Of the 121 survivors surveyed, 64 received SCPs and 57 were in the no-SCP condition.As a validity check, one question asked about educational materials received during the visit with an expected significant difference noted between conditions (X(2)=5.513, p=.019; more SCP patients reported receiving materials).However, there were no differences between conditions when patients rated health services (Fs>.37) or helpfulness of materials and perceptions of care (Fs>.19).CONCLUSIONS: Gynecologic oncology patients providing ratings of health services and satisfaction with care provided equivalent evaluations, regardless if they had/had not received a SCP from the physician.Thus, the need remains for further evaluations of SCPs if they are to be vehicles for improving health service outcomes.",1,1,0,0

Group V patients (50) with melanoma underwent a single-stage surgery--radical excision of the tumour with sentinel lymph node biopsy (study group ""V"").Group D patients (50) with melanoma underwent two-stage surgery; initially primary diagnostic excision of the tumour (0.5 cm from margins of the lesion) followed by a radical re-excision of the post-operative scar and sentinel lymph node biopsy (study group ""D"").RESULTS: Study groups ""V"" and ""D"" were tested for homogeneity with regard to age, melanoma thickness, location of melanoma, type of melanoma, and ulceration.The groups were found to be homogenous.The average number of removed sentinel lymph nodes in group ""D"" was 1.0 more than in group ""V"" (p < 0.05).The averages were 3.7 and 2.7 respectively with a SD of 1.8.The relationship between the SL node staining and type of surgery was (p < 0.05).49.6% stained radioactive sentinel lymphnodes at the time of surgery was found in group ""V"", while 33.9% in group ""D"".CONCLUSIONS: Using two different early-stage cutaneous melanoma management techniques significantly more sentinel lymph nodes (p = 0.006) were detected using the two-stage surgery approach.However, there was no significant difference between the two approaches regarding the number of sentinel lymph nodes with micrometastases that were detected and excised.",1,1,1,0
25109850,"Effects of priming with recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor on conditioning regimen for high-risk acute myeloid leukemia patients undergoing human leukocyte antigen-haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: a multicenter randomized controlled study in southwest China.HLA-haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (haplo-HSCT) is an effective and immediate treatment for high-risk acute myeloid leukemia (HR-AML) patients lacking matched donors.Relapse remains the leading cause of death for HR-AML patients after haplo-HSCT.Accordingly, the prevention of relapse remains a challenge in the treatment of HR-AML.In a multicenter randomized controlled trial in southwestern China, 178 HR-AML patients received haplo-HSCT with conditioning regimens involving recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) or non-rhG-CSF.The cumulative incidences of relapse and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), 2-year leukemia-free survival (LFS), and overall survival (OS) were evaluated.HR-AML patients who underwent the priming conditioning regimen with rhG-CSF had a lower relapse rate than those who were treated with non-rhG-CSF (38.2%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 28.1% to 48.3% versus 60.7%, 95% CI, 50.5% to 70.8%; P < .01).The cumulative incidences of acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, transplantation-related toxicity, and infectious complications appeared to be equivalent.In total, 53 patients in the rhG-CSF-priming group and 31 patients in the non-rhG-CSF-priming group were still alive at the median follow-up time of 42 months (range, 24 to 80 months).The 2-year probabilities of LFS and OS in the rhG-CSF-priming and non-rhG-CSF-priming groups were 55.1% (95% CI, 44.7% to 65.4%) versus 32.6% (95% CI, 22.8% to 42.3%) (P < .01) and 59.6% (95% CI, 49.4% to 69.7%) versus 34.8% (95% CI, 24.9% to 44.7%) (P < .01), respectively.Multivariate analyses indicated that the 2-year probability of LFS of patients who achieved complete remission (CR) before transplantation was better than that of patients who did not achieve CR.The 2-year probability of LFS of patients with no M4/M5/M6 subtype was better than that of patients with the M4/M5/M6 subtype in the G-CSF-priming group (67.4%; 95% CI, 53.8% to 80.9% versus 41.9%; 95% CI, 27.1% to 56.6%; P < .05).This study suggests that the rhG-CSF-priming conditioning regimen is an acceptable choice for HR-AML patients, especially for the patients with no M4/M5/M6 subtype who achieved CR before transplantation.",1,1,1,0
25146716,"Efficacy of a dual-ring wound protector for prevention of incisional surgical site infection after Whipple's procedure (pancreaticoduodenectomy) with preoperatively-placed intrabiliary stents: protocol for a randomised controlled trial.INTRODUCTION: Among surgical oncology patients, incisional surgical site infection is associated with substantially increased morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs.Moreover, while adults undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy with preoperative placement of an intrabiliary stent have a high risk of this type of infection, and wound protectors may significantly reduce its risk, no relevant studies of wound protectors yet exist involving this patient population.This study will evaluate the efficacy of a dual-ring wound protector for prevention of incisional surgical site infection among adults undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy with preoperatively-placed intrabiliary stents.METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study will be a parallel, dual-arm, randomised controlled trial that will utilise a more explanatory than pragmatic attitude.All adults (>/=18 years) undergoing a pancreaticoduodenectomy at the Foothills Medical Centre in Calgary, Alberta, Canada with preoperative placement of an intrabiliary stent will be considered eligible.Exclusion criteria will include patient age <18 years and those receiving long-term glucocorticoids.The trial will employ block randomisation to allocate patients to a commercial dual-ring wound protector (the Alexis Wound Protector) or no wound protector and the current standard of care.The main outcome measure will be the rate of surgical site infection as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria within 30 days of the index operation date as determined by a research assistant blinded to treatment allocation.Outcomes will be analysed by a statistician blinded to allocation status by calculating risk ratios and 95% CIs and compared using Fisher's exact test.ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This will be the first randomised trial to evaluate the efficacy of a dual-ring wound protector for prevention of incisional surgical site infection among patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy.Results of this study are expected to be available in 2016/2017 and will be disseminated using an integrated and end-of-grant knowledge translation strategy.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01836237.",0,0,0,0

25297900,"Impact of multifocal or multicentric disease on surgery and locoregional, distant and overall survival of 6,134 breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.BACKGROUND: The impact of tumor focality on type of surgery, local recurrence rate, and survival after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) for breast cancer is not fully understood.This study aimed to compare local recurrence-free survival (LRFS), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) according to focality stratified by type of surgery and pathologic complete response (pCR), with a focus on breast conservation.METHODS: Participants (n = 6,134) in the GeparTrio, GeparQuattro, and GeparQuinto trials with operable or locally advanced tumors receiving NACT were classified as having unifocal (1 lesion), multifocal (>/= 2 lesions in 1 quadrant), or multicentric (>/= 1 lesion in >/= 2 quadrants) disease.The study investigated LRFS, DFS, and OS according to focality stratified by type of surgery and pathologic complete response.RESULTS: The patients were classified as having unifocal (n = 4,733, 77.1 %), multifocal (n = 820, 13.4 %), or multicentric (n = 581, 9.5 %) tumors.The respective pCR rates were 19.4, 16.5, and 14.4 %.Breast conservation was performed for 71.6, 58.5, and 30 % of these patients, respectively (P < 0.001).The LRFS rate was 92.9 % for the unifocal, 95.1 % for the multifocal, and 90.4 % for the multicentric tumors (P = 0.002).The patients with multicentric tumors but not the patients with multifocal tumors had worse DFS (P < 0.001) and OS (P = 0.009) than the patients with unifocal tumors.However, LRFS, DFS, and OS were not inferior for the patients with multicentric or multifocal tumors if pCR was achieved or breast conservation was performed after NACT.CONCLUSION: Breast conservation is feasible for clinically multifocal or multicentric breast cancer patients who undergo NACT without worsening LRFS if tumor-free margins can be attained or if patients achieve a pCR.",0,0,0,0
25348002,"Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of calaspargase pegol Escherichia coli L-asparaginase in the treatment of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia: results from Children's Oncology Group Study AALL07P4.PURPOSE: Asparaginase is a critical agent used to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).Pegaspargase (SS-PEG), a pegylated form of Escherichia coli L-asparaginase with a succinimidyl succinate (SS) linker, is the first-line asparaginase product used in Children's Oncology Group (COG) ALL trials.Calaspargase pegol (SC-PEG) replaces the SS linker in SS-PEG with a succinimidyl carbamate linker, creating a more stable molecule.COG AALL07P4 was designed to determine the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic comparability of SC-PEG to SS-PEG in patients with newly diagnosed high-risk (HR) B-cell ALL.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 165 evaluable patients were randomly assigned at a 2:1 ratio to receive SC-PEG at 2,100 (SC-PEG2100; n = 69) or 2,500 IU/m(2) (SC-PEG2500; n = 42) versus SS-PEG 2,500 IU/m(2) (SS-PEG2500; n = 54) as part of an otherwise identical chemotherapy regimen.The groups were similar demographically, except more female patients received SC-PEG2500.RESULTS: The mean half-life of plasma asparaginase activity for both SC-PEG doses was approximately 2.5x longer than that of SS-PEG2500.The total systemic exposure, as defined by induction area under the curve from time 0 to 25 days, was greater with SC-PEG2500 than with SS-PEG2500 or SC-PEG2100.The proportion of patients with plasma asparaginase activity >/= 100 mIU/mL and >/= 400 mIU/mL was higher in patients who received SC-PEG as compared with SS-PEG2500.After one dose of pegylated asparaginase on induction day 4, plasma asparagine was undetectable for 11 days for SS-PEG2500 and 18 days for both SC-PEG groups.CONCLUSION: SC-PEG2500 achieves a significantly longer period of asparaginase activity above defined thresholds and asparagine depletion compared with SS-PEG2500 and has a comparable toxicity profile in children with HR B-cell ALL.",1,1,1,0
25354554,"The RAD51 135G>C polymorphism is related to the effect of adjuvant therapy in early breast cancer.PURPOSE: RAD51, a central player in the response to DNA damage, has been suspected to contribute to tumour resistance to therapy.A single-nucleotide polymorphism, RAD51 135G>C, in the untranslated region of the RAD51 gene elevates breast cancer risk among BRCA2 carriers.In this study, it was investigated whether this polymorphism is related to prognosis of breast cancer and RAD51 protein expression and whether it is indicative of resistance to radiotherapy or cyclophosphamide/methotrexate/5-fluorouracil (CMF) chemotherapy.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We genotyped 306 patients with early breast cancer, who were randomised to receive post-operative radiotherapy or CMF chemotherapy, for the RAD51 135G>C polymorphism.RAD51 protein expression was evaluated with immunohistochemistry.RESULTS: 15.4 % of the patients had at least one C-allele (three were C homozygotes).There was no correlation between genotype and protein expression.Patients who were G homozygotes benefitted from radiotherapy with decreased risk of local recurrences (RR = 0.32, 95 % C.I. 0.16-0.64, p = 0.001).CMF chemotherapy reduced the risk of distant recurrence for patients carrying at least one C-allele (RR = 0.29, 95 % C.I. 0.10-0.88, p = 0.03), whereas G homozygotes had no benefit from chemotherapy.There was a significant interaction between chemotherapy and genotype (p = 0.02).CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the RAD51 135G>C polymorphism predicts CMF chemotherapy effect in early breast cancer.",0,0,0,0

25649903,"Laparoscopic surgery contributes more to nutritional and immunologic recovery than fast-track care in colorectal cancer.BACKGROUND: Many clinical trials had repeatedly shown that fast-track perioperative care and laparoscopic surgery are both preferred in the treatment of colorectal cancer.But few studies were designed to explore the diverse biochemical impacts of the two counterparts on human immunologic and nutritional status.METHODS: Ninety-two cases of colorectal cancer patients meeting the inclusion criteria were randomized to four groups: laparoscopy with fast-track treatment (LAFT); open surgery with fast-track treatment (OSFT); laparoscopy with conventional treatment (LAC); open surgery with conventional treatment (OSC).Peripheral blood tests including nutritional factors (albumin, prealbumin, and transferrin), humoral immunologic factors (IgG, IgM, and IgA), and cellular immunologic factors (T and NK cells) were evaluated.Blood samples were collected preoperatively (baseline) and 12 and 96 h after surgery (indicated as POH12 and POH96, respectively).RESULTS: Albumin, transferrin, prealbumin, and IgG levels were the highest in the LAFT group for both POH12 and POH96 time intervals.Repeated measures (two-way ANOVA) indicated that the difference of albumin, transferrin, and IgG level were attributed to surgery type (P < 0.05) and not perioperative treatment (P > 0.05).Only in the laparoscopy-included groups, the relative albumin and IgG levels of POH96 were obviously higher than that of POH12.CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic surgery accelerated postoperative nutrition and immune levels rising again while fast-track treatment retarded the drop of postoperative nutrition and immune levels.Laparoscopic surgery might play a more important role than fast-track treatment in the earlier postoperative recovery of nutritional and immunologic status.Combined laparoscopic surgery with fast-track treatment provided best postoperative recovery of nutrition and immune status.These results should be further compared with the clinical outcomes of our FTMDT trial (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01080547).",1,1,0,0

26132306,"A randomized pilot study of dietary treatments for polycystic ovary syndrome in adolescents.BACKGROUND: Evidence is lacking to recommend one diet over another when treating polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).OBJECTIVES: To obtain preliminary data, comparing the impact of a low-glycaemic load (LGL) vs. low-fat (LF) diet on biochemical hyperandrogenism in overweight and obese adolescents with PCOS.To ascertain feasibility of recruiting study participants, in partnership with an adolescent clinic, and implementing dietary interventions.METHODS: Randomized controlled trial of 19 overweight and obese adolescents with PCOS and not using hormonal contraceptives (HCs).Interventions comprised nutrition education, dietary counselling and cooking workshops to foster adherence to a LGL (45% carbohydrate, 35% fat, 20% protein) or LF (55% carbohydrate, 25% fat, 20% protein) diet over 6 months.Serum bioavailable testosterone was the primary outcome.RESULTS: Sixteen (LGL, n = 7; LF, n = 9) participants completed the study.Body fat percentage decreased (P < 0.05) in response to the interventions, with no difference between the LGL and LF groups (-1.2% vs. -2.2%; P = 0.16).Bioavailable testosterone did not change for either group (-0.4 vs. -1.8 ng dL(-1) ; P = 0.35).Regarding feasibility, recruiting adolescents posed a challenge, and use of HCs was a main reason for ineligibility.Participants attended 5.9 of 6 in-person visits and 2.6 of 3 cooking workshops, completed 4.9 of 6 telephone counselling calls, and reported high satisfaction with the diets and cooking workshops (>/=8 on a 10-cm scale).CONCLUSIONS: Dietary interventions were beneficial for weight control but did not attenuate biochemical hyperandrogenism.Innovative strategies are needed to recruit adolescents for studies aimed at assessing independent effects of diet on features of PCOS.",1,0,0,0
26148314,"Resistance Exercise Reduces Body Fat and Insulin During Androgen-Deprivation Therapy for Prostate Cancer.PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To determine whether exercise could reduce biomarkers of cancer progression in prostate cancer survivors (PCSs) on androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT).DESIGN: Randomized, controlled trial.SETTING: Oregon Health and Science University School of Nursing.SAMPLE: 51 PCSs randomized to one year of resistance and impact training or a stretching control group.METHODS: The authors investigated changes in body composition and cancer-related biomarkers, and the influence of age and fat loss on changes in biomarkers.MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Body composition (total fat, trunk fat, and lean mass), insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1, and sex hormone-binding globulin.FINDINGS: In the 36 PCSs with baseline and 12-month data, total fat (p = 0.02) and trunk fat (p = 0.06) mass decreased in the training group compared to gains in controls.Loss of total and trunk fat each mediated the relationship between groups and one-year change in insulin (p < 0.05).Age moderated the insulin response to exercise where insulin reductions were smaller with increasing age (p = 0.03).CONCLUSIONS: Resistance and impact exercise may reduce body fat among PCSs undergoing ADT, in turn exerting an insulin-lowering effect.IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Nurses should counsel PCSs to exercise to reduce the risk of obesity and associated conditions, including cancer progression.",1,1,0,0
26149602,"Randomized controlled trial of irinotecan drug-eluting beads with simultaneous FOLFOX and bevacizumab for patients with unresectable colorectal liver-limited metastasis.BACKGROUND: Reports have demonstrated the superior activity of combining both irinotecan and oxaliplatin (FOLFOXIRI) therapy.An option for gaining similar benefits with less toxicity would be the administration of irinotecan through a hepatic artery approach.The aim of this study was to assess the response and adverse event rates for irinotecan drug-eluting beads (DEBIRI) with folinic acid, 5-fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) and bevacizumab as a first-line treatment for unresectable colorectal liver metastasis.METHODS: Patients with colorectal liver metastases were randomly assigned to modified FOLFOX (mFOLFOX) and bevacizumab or mFOLFOX6, bevacizumab, and DEBIRI (FOLFOX-DEBIRI).The primary endpoint was the response rate.The secondary endpoints were adverse events, the rate of conversion to resection, and progression-free survival.RESULTS: The intention-to-treat population comprised 70 patients: 10 patients in the pilot and then 30 patients randomly assigned to the FOLFOX-DEBIRI arm and 30 patients randomly assigned to the FOLFOX/bevacizumab arm.The 2 groups were similar with respect to the extent of liver involvement (30% vs 30%), but a greater percentage of patients in the FOLFOX-DEBIRI arm had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 1 or 2 (57% vs 31%) and extrahepatic disease (56% vs 32%, P = .02).The median numbers of chemotherapy cycles were similar (10 vs 9), and there were similar rates of grade 3/4 adverse events (54% for the FOLFOX-DEBIRI group vs 46% for the FOLFOX/bevacizumab group).The overall response rate was significantly greater in the FOLFOX-DEBIRI arm versus the FOLFOX/bevacizumab arm at 2 (78% vs 54%, P = .02), 4 (95% vs 70%, P = .03), and 6 months (76% vs 60%, P = .05).There was significantly more downsizing to resection in the FOLFOX-DEBIRI arm versus the FOLFOX/bevacizumab arm (35% vs 16%, P = .05), and there was improved median progression-free survival (15.3 vs 7.6 months).CONCLUSIONS: The simultaneous administration of mFOLFOX6 (with or without bevacizumab) and DEBIRI through the hepatic artery (FOLFOX-DEBIRI) is safe and does not cause treatment delays or increase the systemic toxicity of chemotherapy.This strategy leads to improved overall response rates, improved hepatic progression-free survival, and more durable overall progression-free survival in patients downsized to resection.",1,1,1,0
26169621,"BREATH: Web-Based Self-Management for Psychological Adjustment After Primary Breast Cancer--Results of a Multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial.PURPOSE: Early breast cancer survivors (BCSs) report high unmet care needs, and easily accessible care is not routinely available for this growing population.The Breast Cancer E-Health (BREATH) trial is a Web-based self-management intervention to support the psychological adjustment of women after primary treatment, by reducing distress and improving empowerment.PATIENTS AND METHODS: This multicenter, randomized, controlled, parallel-group trial evaluated whether care as usual (CAU) plus BREATH is superior to CAU alone.BREATH is delivered in sixteen fully automated weekly modules covering early survivorship issues.Two to 4 months post-treatment, BCSs were randomly assigned to receive CAU + BREATH (n = 70) or CAU alone (n = 80) using a stratified block design (ratio 1:1).Primary outcomes were distress (Symptom Checklist-90) and empowerment (Cancer Empowerment Questionnaire), assessed before random assignment (baseline, T0) and after 4 (T1), 6 (T2), and 10 months (T3) of follow-up.Statistical (analysis of covariance) and clinical effects (reliable change index) were tested in an intention-to-treat analysis (T0 to T1).Follow-up effects (T0 to T3) were assessed in assessment completers.RESULTS: CAU + BREATH participants reported significantly less distress than CAU-alone participants (-7.79; 95% CI, -14.31 to -1.27; P = .02) with a small-to-medium effect size (d = 0.33), but empowerment was not affected (-1.71; 95% CI, 5.20 to -1.79; P = .34).More CAU + BREATH participants (39 of 70 [56%]; 95% CI, 44.1 to 66.8) than CAU-alone participants (32 of 80 [40%]; 95% CI, 30.0 to 51.0) showed clinically significant improvement (P = .03).This clinical effect was most prominent in low-distress BCSs.Secondary outcomes confirmed primary outcomes.There were no between-group differences in primary outcomes during follow-up.CONCLUSION: Access to BREATH reduced distress among BCSs, but this effect was not sustained during follow-up.",1,1,0,0

26254169,"Excising Additional Margins at Initial Breast-Conserving Surgery (BCS) Reduces the Need for Re-excision in a Predominantly African American Population: A Report of a Randomized Prospective Study in a Public Hospital.BACKGROUND: Margin status is an important prognostic factor for local recurrence after breast conserving surgery (BCS) for breast cancer.We designed a prospective randomized trial to evaluate the effect of shave margins on positive margins and locoregional recurrence (LRR).METHODS: Patients were randomized to BCS or BCS with resection of 5 additional margins (BCS + M).Tumor margins were classified as negative [>2 mm for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS); >1 mm for invasive carcinoma] based on guidelines at the time of accrual.RESULTS: A total of 75 patients with stage 0-III breast cancer (76 samples) were randomized, mean age 59.6 years with median follow-up 39.5 months.Overall, 21 patients (27.6 %) had positive margins: 14 had undergone BCS and 7 BCS + M (p = 0.005).Of the 21 patients with positive margins, 19 had DCIS on final pathology (OR 7.56; 95 % CI 1.52-37.51).All patients with positive margins were offered re-excision; 11 had negative final margins after re-excision surgery.Overall, 6 patients (8.3 %) developed LRR with recurrence being more common in the BCS group when compared with the BCS + M group (17.2 vs 2.3 %; p = 0.025).CONCLUSIONS: Taking additional cavity shave margins at the time of initial excision resulted in a reduction in positive margin rate, a decrease in return to operating room for re-excision, and lower LRR.",1,1,1,0
26304900,"Impact of an Automatically Generated Cancer Survivorship Care Plan on Patient-Reported Outcomes in Routine Clinical Practice: Longitudinal Outcomes of a Pragmatic, Cluster Randomized Trial.PURPOSE: This study was conducted to longitudinally assess the impact of an automatically generated survivorship care plan (SCP) on patient-reported outcomes in routine clinical practice.Primary outcomes were patient satisfaction with information and care.Secondary outcomes included illness perceptions and health care use.METHODS: Twelve hospitals were randomly assigned to SCP care or usual care in a pragmatic, cluster randomized trial.Newly diagnosed patients with endometrial cancer completed questionnaires after diagnosis (n = 221; 75% response), 6 months (n = 158), and 12 months (n = 147).An SCP application was built in the Web-based ROGY (Registration System Oncological Gynecology).By clicking the SCP button, a patient-tailored SCP was generated.RESULTS: In the SCP care arm, 74% of patients received an SCP.They reported receiving more information about their treatment (mean [M] = 57, standard deviation [SD] = 20 v M = 47, SD = 24; P = .03), other services (M = 35, SD = 22 v M = 25, SD = 22; P = .03), and different places of care (M = 27, SD = 25 v M = 23, SD = 26; P = .04) than the usual care arm (scales, 0 to 100).However, there were no differences regarding satisfaction with information or care.Patients in the SCP care arm experienced more symptoms (M = 3.3, SD = 2.0 v M = 2.6, SD = 1.6; P = .03), were more concerned about their illness (M = 4.4, SD = 2.3 v M = 3.9, SD = 2.1; P = .03), were more affected emotionally (M = 4.0, SD = 2.2 v M = 3.7, SD = 2.2; P = .046), and reported more cancer-related contact with their primary care physician (M = 1.8, SD = 2.0 v M = 1.1, SD = 0.9; P = .003) than those in the usual care arm (scale, 1 to 10).These effects did not differ over time.CONCLUSION: The present trial showed no evidence of a benefit of SCPs on satisfaction with information and care.Furthermore, SCPs increased patients' concerns, emotional impact, experienced symptoms, and the amount of cancer-related contact with the primary care physician.Whether this may ultimately lead to more empowered patients should be investigated further.",1,1,0,0
26329135,"Associations between cruciferous vegetable intake and selected biomarkers among women scheduled for breast biopsies.OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between dietary cruciferous vegetable intake and selected tumour biomarkers for histone acetylation (H3K9ac, H3K18ac, HDAC3 and HDAC6), proliferation (Ki-67) and cell-cycle regulation (p21) from breast tissue.DESIGN: The study used baseline data of women recruited to participate in a clinical trial of sulforaphane supplement.Dietary cruciferous vegetable intake was collected through a validated Arizona Cruciferous Vegetable Intake Questionnaire.Breast tissue was obtained from biopsy samples.Spearman correlations were calculated between intake of specific cruciferous vegetables and biomarkers.Tissue biomarkers were log2-transformed to obtain approximate normality.Linear regression analyses were conducted to examine associations between cruciferous vegetable intake and biomarkers adjusting for age and use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.False discovery rate (FDR) was used to account for multiple comparisons.SETTING: Clinical trial baseline.SUBJECTS: Fifty-four women who had abnormal mammogram findings and were scheduled for breast biopsy.RESULTS: Mean intake of total cruciferous vegetables from all food sources was 81.7 (sd 57.3) g/d.Mean urinary total sulforaphane metabolites was 0.08 (sd 0.07) microm/mm creatinine.Total cruciferous vegetable intake was inversely associated with Ki-67 protein expression in breast ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) tissue (beta=-0.004; se=0.001; FDR q value=0.03), but not in benign or invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) tissue.No association was found for other biomarkers measured (HDAC3, HDAC6, H3K9, H3K18 and p21) in all tissues examined (benign, DCIS and IDC).CONCLUSIONS: The present study sought to provide additional evidence for the potential role of sulforaphane in histone acetylation and cell proliferation.Here, we report that total cruciferous vegetable intake is associated with decreased cell proliferation in breast DCIS tissue.",0,0,0,0
26341920,"Analysis of KRAS/NRAS Mutations in a Phase III Study of Panitumumab with FOLFIRI Compared with FOLFIRI Alone as Second-line Treatment for Metastatic Colorectal Cancer.PURPOSE: We evaluated the influence of RAS mutation status on the treatment effect of panitumumab in a prospective-retrospective analysis of a randomized, multicenter phase III study of panitumumab plus fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) versus FOLFIRI alone as second-line therapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC; ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT0039183).EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Outcomes were from the study's primary analysis.RAS mutations beyond KRAS exon 2 (KRAS exons 3, 4; NRAS exons 2, 3, 4; BRAF exon 15) were detected by bidirectional Sanger sequencing in wild-type KRAS exon 2 tumor specimens.Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were coprimary endpoints.RESULTS: The RAS ascertainment rate was 85%; 18% of wild-type KRAS exon 2 tumors harbored other RAS mutations.For PFS and OS, the hazard ratio (HR) for panitumumab plus FOLFIRI versus FOLFIRI alone more strongly favored panitumumab in the wild-type RAS population than in the wild-type KRAS exon 2 population [PFS HR, 0.70 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.54-0.91); P = 0.007 vs. 0.73 (95% CI, 0.59-0.90); P = 0.004; OS HR, 0.81 (95% CI, 0.63-1.03); P = 0.08 vs. 0.85 (95% CI, 0.70-1.04); P = 0.12].Patients with RAS mutations were unlikely to benefit from panitumumab.Among RAS wild-type patients, the objective response rate was 41% in the panitumumab-FOLFIRI group versus 10% in the FOLFIRI group.CONCLUSIONS: Patients with RAS mutations were unlikely to benefit from panitumumab-FOLFIRI and the benefit-risk of panitumumab-FOLFIRI was improved in the wild-type RAS population compared with the wild-type KRAS exon 2 population.These findings support RAS testing for patients with mCRC.Clin Cancer Res; 21(24); 5469-79.(c)2015 AACR.See related commentary by Salazar and Ciardiello, p. 5415.",0,0,0,0
26471036,"Cost-effectiveness simulation and analysis of colorectal cancer screening in Hong Kong Chinese population: comparison amongst colonoscopy, guaiac and immunologic fecal occult blood testing.BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of CRC screening strategies from the healthcare service provider perspective based on Chinese population.METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to compare the cost-effectiveness of recommended screening strategies including annual/biennial guaiac fecal occult blood testing (G-FOBT), annual/biennial immunologic FOBT (I-FOBT), and colonoscopy every 10 years in Chinese aged 50 year over a 25-year period.External validity of model was tested against data retrieved from published randomized controlled trials of G-FOBT.Recourse use data collected from Chinese subjects among staging of colorectal neoplasm were combined with published unit cost data ($USD in 2009 price values) to estimate a stage-specific cost per patient.Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were quantified based on the stage duration and SF-6D preference-based value of each stage.The cost-effectiveness outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) represented by costs per life-years (LY) and costs per QALYs gained.RESULTS: In base-case scenario, the non-dominated strategies were annual and biennial I-FOBT.Compared with no screening, the ICER presented $20,542/LYs and $3155/QALYs gained for annual I-FOBT, and $19,838/LYs gained and $2976/QALYs gained for biennial I-FOBT.The optimal screening strategy was annual I-FOBT that attained the highest ICER at the threshold of $50,000 per LYs or QALYs gained.CONCLUSION: The Markov model informed the health policymakers that I-FOBT every year may be the most effective and cost-effective CRC screening strategy among recommended screening strategies, depending on the willingness-to-pay of mass screening for Chinese population.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT02038283.",0,0,0,0
26603881,"Effect of inulin and fructo-oligosaccharide on the prevention of acute radiation enteritis in patients with gynecological cancer and impact on quality-of-life: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The pathogenesis of enteritis after abdominal radiotherapy (RT) is unknown, although changes in fecal microbiota may be involved.Prebiotics stimulate the proliferation of Lactobacillus spp and Bifidobacterium spp, and this may have positive effects on the intestinal mucosa during abdominal RT.SUBJECTS/METHODS: We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving patients with gynecological cancer who received abdominal RT after surgery.Patients were randomized to receive prebiotics or placebo.The prebiotic group received a mixture of fiber (50 inulin and 50% fructo-oligosaccharide), and the placebo group received 6 g of maltodextrin twice daily from 1 week before to 3 weeks after RT.The number of bowel movements and stool consistency was recorded daily.Diarrhea was evaluated according to the Common Toxicity Criteria of the National Cancer Institute.Stool consistency was assessed using the 7-point Bristol scale.Patients' quality-of-life was evaluated at baseline and at completion of RT using the EORTC-QLQ-C30 (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality-of-life Questionnaire C30) test.RESULTS: Thirty-eight women with a mean age of 60.3+/-11.8 years participated in the study.Both groups (prebiotic (n=20) and placebo (n=18)) were comparable in their baseline characteristics.The number of bowel movements per month increased in both groups during RT.The number of bowel movements per day increased in both groups.The number of days with watery stool (Bristol score 7) was lower in the prebiotic group (3.3+/-4.4 to 2.2+/-1.6) than in the placebo group (P=0.08).With respect to quality-of-life, the symptoms with the highest score in the placebo group were insomnia at baseline and diarrhea toward the end of the treatment.In the prebiotic group, insomnia was the symptom with the highest score at both assessments, although the differences were not statistically significant.CONCLUSIONS: Prebiotics can improve the consistency of stools in gynecologic cancer patients on RT.This finding could have important implications in the quality-of-life of these patients during treatment.",1,1,0,0
26672085,"Prospective Validation of Pooled Prognostic Factors in Women with Advanced Cervical Cancer Treated with Chemotherapy with/without Bevacizumab: NRG Oncology/GOG Study.PURPOSE: In the randomized phase III trial, Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) protocol 240, the incorporation of bevacizumab with chemotherapy significantly increased overall survival (OS) in women with advanced cervical cancer.A major objective of GOG-240 was to prospectively analyze previously identified pooled clinical prognostic factors known as the Moore criteria.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Potential negative factors included black race, performance status 1, pelvic disease, prior cisplatin, and progression-free interval <365 days.Risk categories included low-risk (0-1 factor), mid-risk (2-3 factors), and high-risk (4-5 factors).Each test of association was conducted at the 5% level of significance.Logistic regression and survival analysis was used to determine whether factors were prognostic or could be used to guide therapy.RESULTS: For the entire population (n = 452), high-risk patients had significantly worse OS (P < 0.0001).The HRs of death for treating with topotecan in low-risk, mid-risk, and high-risk subsets are 1.18 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.63-2.24], 1.11 (95% CI, 0.82-1.5), and 0.84 (95% CI, 0.50-1.42), respectively.The HRs of death for treating with bevacizumab in low-risk, mid-risk, and high-risk subsets are 0.96 (95% CI, 0.51-1.83; P = 0.9087), 0.673 (95% CI, 0.5-0.91; P = 0.0094), and 0.536 (95% CI, 0.32-0.905; P = 0.0196), respectively.CONCLUSIONS: This is the first prospectively validated scoring system in cervical cancer.The Moore criteria have real-world clinical applicability.Toxicity concerns may justify omission of bevacizumab in some low-risk patients where survival benefit is small.The benefit to receiving bevacizumab appears to be greatest in the moderate- and high-risk subgroups (5.8-month increase in median OS).Clin Cancer Res; 21(24); 5480-7.(c)2015 AACR.",0,0,0,0

27018037,"Risedronate may preserve bone microarchitecture in breast cancer survivors on aromatase inhibitors: A randomized, controlled clinical trial.UNLABELLED: This study provides preliminary evidence that risedronate not only preserves BMD but may also attenuate the loss of bone microarchitecture over 2years during a time of accelerated bone loss in post-menopausal breast cancer survivors on aromatase inhibitors.INTRODUCTION: Accelerated bone loss and elevated fracture risk are associated with the use of aromatase inhibitors (AIs) in women with breast cancer.We previously reported that the oral bisphosphonate, risedronate, can maintain bone mineral density (BMD) in the hip and spine over 2-years in post-menopausal breast cancer survivors on AIs.In this study, we examined whether oral bisphosphonates can also preserve bone microarchitecture as measured by the trabecular bone score (TBS) in this population.METHODS: This 2-year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial included postmenopausal women over age 55 with breast cancer on an AI who had low bone mass.Participants provided informed consent and were randomized to risedronate 35mg once weekly or placebo.We examined 12- and 24-month changes in spine TBS, analyzed using linear mixed models.RESULTS: One-hundred and nine women with a mean age of 70.5years were included in the analysis.In the placebo group, BMD declined at the spine and hip over the 24-month period but was preserved in the active treatment group (data previously reported).TBS declined in the placebo group by -2.1% and -2.3% at 12- and 24-months, respectively (p<0.005).The TBS percent change in bisphosphonate-treated patients was -0.9% and -1.3% at 12 and 24-months but did not reach statistical significance (p=0.24 and 0.14).The 12- and 24-month between-group differences were 0.9 (p=0.38) and 0.8 (p=0.44) percentage points.TBS change correlated with spine BMD changes in the placebo group at 12- and 24-months (r=0.33 and 0.34, p<0.01) but not in the active treatment group.CONCLUSION: The oral bisphosphonate risedronate preserves BMD and may attenuate loss of bone microarchitecture over 2years during a time of accelerated bone loss in breast cancer survivors on AIs, but more definitive evidence is needed.",1,1,0,0
27059593,"Advance care planning--a multi-centre cluster randomised clinical trial: the research protocol of the ACTION study.BACKGROUND: Awareness of preferences regarding medical care should be a central component of the care of patients with advanced cancer.Open communication can facilitate this but can occur in an ad hoc or variable manner.Advance care planning (ACP) is a formalized process of communication between patients, relatives and professional caregivers about patients' values and care preferences.It raises awareness of the need to anticipate possible future deterioration of health.ACP has the potential to improve current and future healthcare decision-making, provide patients with a sense of control, and improve their quality of life.METHODS/DESIGN: We will study the effects of the ACP program Respecting Choices on the quality of life of patients with advanced lung or colorectal cancer.In a phase III multicenter cluster randomised controlled trial, 22 hospitals in 6 countries will be randomised.In the intervention sites, patients will be offered interviews with a trained facilitator.In the control sites, patients will receive care as usual.In total, 1360 patients will be included.All participating patients will be asked to complete questionnaires at inclusion, and again after 2.5 and 4.5 months.If a patient dies within a year after inclusion, a relative will be asked to complete a questionnaire on end-of-life care.Use of medical care will be assessed by checking medical files.The primary endpoint is patients' quality of life at 2.5 months post-inclusion.Secondary endpoints are the extent to which care as received is aligned with patients' preferences, patients' evaluation of decision-making processes, quality of end-of-life care and cost-effectiveness of the intervention.A complementary qualitative study will be carried out to explore the lived experience of engagement with the Respecting Choices program from the perspectives of patients, their Personal Representatives, healthcare providers and facilitators.DISCUSSION: Transferring the concept of ACP from care of the elderly to patients with advanced cancer, who on average are younger and retain their mental capacity for a larger part of their disease trajectory, is an important next step in an era of increased focus on patient centered healthcare and shared decision-making.TRIAL REGISTRATION: International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number: ISRCTN63110516.Date of registration: 10/3/2014.",1,1,0,0

27864015,"Prediction of overall survival for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: development of a prognostic model through a crowdsourced challenge with open clinical trial data.BACKGROUND: Improvements to prognostic models in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer have the potential to augment clinical trial design and guide treatment strategies.In partnership with Project Data Sphere, a not-for-profit initiative allowing data from cancer clinical trials to be shared broadly with researchers, we designed an open-data, crowdsourced, DREAM (Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessments and Methods) challenge to not only identify a better prognostic model for prediction of survival in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer but also engage a community of international data scientists to study this disease.METHODS: Data from the comparator arms of four phase 3 clinical trials in first-line metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer were obtained from Project Data Sphere, comprising 476 patients treated with docetaxel and prednisone from the ASCENT2 trial, 526 patients treated with docetaxel, prednisone, and placebo in the MAINSAIL trial, 598 patients treated with docetaxel, prednisone or prednisolone, and placebo in the VENICE trial, and 470 patients treated with docetaxel and placebo in the ENTHUSE 33 trial.Datasets consisting of more than 150 clinical variables were curated centrally, including demographics, laboratory values, medical history, lesion sites, and previous treatments.Data from ASCENT2, MAINSAIL, and VENICE were released publicly to be used as training data to predict the outcome of interest-namely, overall survival.Clinical data were also released for ENTHUSE 33, but data for outcome variables (overall survival and event status) were hidden from the challenge participants so that ENTHUSE 33 could be used for independent validation.Methods were evaluated using the integrated time-dependent area under the curve (iAUC).The reference model, based on eight clinical variables and a penalised Cox proportional-hazards model, was used to compare method performance.Further validation was done using data from a fifth trial-ENTHUSE M1-in which 266 patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer were treated with placebo alone.FINDINGS: 50 independent methods were developed to predict overall survival and were evaluated through the DREAM challenge.The top performer was based on an ensemble of penalised Cox regression models (ePCR), which uniquely identified predictive interaction effects with immune biomarkers and markers of hepatic and renal function.Overall, ePCR outperformed all other methods (iAUC 0.791; Bayes factor >5) and surpassed the reference model (iAUC 0.743; Bayes factor >20).Both the ePCR model and reference models stratified patients in the ENTHUSE 33 trial into high-risk and low-risk groups with significantly different overall survival (ePCR: hazard ratio 3.32, 95% CI 2.39-4.62, p<0.0001; reference model: 2.56, 1.85-3.53, p<0.0001).The new model was validated further on the ENTHUSE M1 cohort with similarly high performance (iAUC 0.768).Meta-analysis across all methods confirmed previously identified predictive clinical variables and revealed aspartate aminotransferase as an important, albeit previously under-reported, prognostic biomarker.INTERPRETATION: Novel prognostic factors were delineated, and the assessment of 50 methods developed by independent international teams establishes a benchmark for development of methods in the future.The results of this effort show that data-sharing, when combined with a crowdsourced challenge, is a robust and powerful framework to develop new prognostic models in advanced prostate cancer.FUNDING: Sanofi US Services, Project Data Sphere.",0,0,0,0
28079776,"Enhanced Recovery Program and Length of Stay After Laparotomy on a Gynecologic Oncology Service: A Randomized Controlled Trial.OBJECTIVE:To estimate whether a rapid recovery program would reduce length of stay among patients undergoing laparotomy on a gynecologic oncology service.METHODS: We conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled trial comparing an enhanced recovery after surgery protocol with routine postoperative care among women undergoing laparotomy on the gynecologic oncology service.Protocol elements included: preoperative counseling, regional anesthesia, intraoperative fluid restriction, and early postoperative ambulation and feeding.A sample size of 50 per group (N=100) was planned to achieve 80% power to detect a two-day difference in our primary outcome, length of hospital stay; secondary outcomes included: total daily narcotics used, time to postoperative milestones, and complications.RESULTS: A total of 112 women were enrolled between 2013 and 2015.Nine patients did not undergo laparotomy and were excluded, leaving 52 and 51 patients in the control and intervention groups, respectively.There was no difference in length of stay between the two groups (median 3.0 in both groups; P=.36).Enhanced recovery after surgery patients used less narcotics on day 0 (10.0 compared with 5.5 morphine equivalents in the control and intervention arms, respectively, P=.09) and day 2 (10.0 compared with 7.5 morphine equivalents, respectively; P=.05); however, there was no statistically significant difference between groups in any of the secondary outcomes.Post hoc analysis based on actual anesthesia received also failed to demonstrate a difference in time to discharge.CONCLUSION: When compared with usual care, introducing a formal enhanced recovery after surgery protocol did not significantly reduce length of stay.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, https://clinicaltrials.gov, NCT01705288.",1,1,0,0
28122157,"Fidelity scorecard: evaluation of a caregiver-delivered symptom management intervention.AIM: To evaluate and quantify the intervention fidelity of a symptom management protocol through implementation of a scorecard, using an exemplar study of caregiver-delivered reflexology for people with breast cancer.BACKGROUND: Studies on caregiver-delivered symptom management interventions seldom include adequate information on protocol fidelity, contributing to potentially suboptimal provision of the therapeutic intervention, hindering reproducibility and generalizability of the results.DESIGN: Fidelity assessment of a 4-week intervention protocol in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with data collection between 2012 - 2016.METHODS: The National Institutes of Health Behaviour Change Consortium (NIH-BCC) conceptual model for intervention fidelity guided the study.The five NIH-BCC fidelity elements are: (1) dose; (2) provider training; (3) intervention delivery; (4) intervention receipt; and (5) enactment.To illustrate the elements, an intervention protocol was deconstructed and each element quantified using a newly developed fidelity scorecard.RESULTS: Mean scores and frequency distributions were derived for the scorecard elements.For dose, the mean number of sessions was 4.4, 96% used the correct intervention duration and 29% had 4 weeks with at least one session.Provider training was achieved at 80% of the maximum score, intervention delivery was 96%, intervention receipt was 99% and enactment indicated moderate adoption at 3.8 sessions per patient.The sample mean score was 15.4 out of 16, indicating the high overall fidelity.CONCLUSION: Research findings that include description of how fidelity is both addressed and evaluated are necessary for clinical translation.Clinicians can confidently recommend symptom management strategies to patients and caregivers when fidelity standards are explicitly reported and measured.",0,0,0,0
28224296,"EQ-5D-5L and SF-6D Utility Measures in Symptomatic benign Thyroid Nodules: Acceptability and Psychometric Evaluation.PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to examine the acceptability, validity, and reliability of the EuroQoL Five-Dimension Five-Level (EQ-5D-5L) and Short-Form Six-Dimension (SF-6D) health utility measures in patients with symptomatic benign thyroid nodules.METHODS: Data from a randomized controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02398721) of 294 patients with symptomatic benign thyroid nodules were utilized for this psychometric evaluation of health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) measurement.Three HR-QOL questionnaires-the generic 12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12v2), EQ-5D-5L, and SF-6D-were interviewer-administered at baseline and 2 weeks afterwards.Responses to SF-6D were transformed to SF-6D utility scores using a Hong Kong population scoring algorithm derived by standard gamble, whereas responses to EQ-5D-5L were mapped onto EQ-5D-3L response via interim mapping algorithms and then converted to EQ-5D-5L utility scores using a Chinese-specific value set.Construct validity was determined by evaluating Spearman correlation between SF-12v2 scores and utility scores.Two-week test-retest reliability was assessed using intra-class correlation coefficient.RESULTS: No significant (>15%) floor and ceiling effects were observed for SF-6D utility scores.The SF-6D utility scores had a moderate Spearman rank correlation with the SF-12v2 domain score providing evidence for adequate construct validity.The SF-6D utility scores showed good test-retest reliability (0.794; range 0.696-0.860).Better reliability was observed in SF-6D utility scores than in EQ-5D-5L utility scores.CONCLUSIONS: While the EQ-5D-5L instrument was less reproducible, the SF-6D instrument appeared to be an applicable, valid, and reliable measure in assessing the HR-QOL of Chinese patients with symptomatic benign thyroid nodules.The impact of utility score selection on the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of clinical interventions targeted to these patients needs further exploration.CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER AND REGISTRY: NCT02398721, ClinicalTrials.gov.",0,0,0,0
28257146,"Randomized controlled trial of neurofeedback on chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy: A pilot study.BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a significant problem for cancer patients, and there are limited treatment options for this often debilitating condition.Neuromodulatory interventions could be a novel modality for patients trying to manage CIPN symptoms; however, they are not yet the standard of care.This study examined whether electroencephalogram (EEG) neurofeedback (NFB) could alleviate CIPN symptoms in survivors.METHODS: This was a randomized controlled trial with survivors assigned to an NFB group or a wait-list control (WLC) group.The NFB group underwent 20 sessions of NFB, in which visual and auditory rewards were given for voluntary changes in EEGs.The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) worst-pain item was the primary outcome.The BPI, the Pain Quality Assessment Scale, and EEGs were collected before NFB and again after treatment.Outcomes were assessed with general linear modeling.RESULTS: Cancer survivors with CIPN (average duration of symptoms, 25.3 mo), who were mostly female and had a mean age of 62.5 years, were recruited between April 2011 and September 2014.One hundred percent of the participants starting the NFB program completed it (30 in the NFB group and 32 in the WLC group).The NFB group demonstrated greater improvement than the controls on the BPI worst-pain item (mean change score, -2.43 [95% confidence interval, -3.58 to -1.28] vs 0.09 [95% confidence interval, -0.72 to -0.90]; P =..001; effect size, 0.83).CONCLUSIONS: NFB appears to be effective at reducing CIPN symptoms.There was evidence of neurological changes in the cortical location and in the bandwidth targeted by the intervention, and changes in EEG activity were predictive of symptom reduction.Cancer 2017;123:1989-1997.

28279941,"Long-term outcome of the REMAGUS 02 trial, a multicenter randomised phase II trial in locally advanced breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy with or without celecoxib or trastuzumab according to HER2 status.BACKGROUND: The REMAGUS-02 multicenter randomised phase II trial showed that the addition to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) of trastuzumab in patients with localised HER2-positive breast cancer (BC) increased the pathological complete response (pCR) rate and that the addition of celecoxib in HER2-negative cases did not increase the pCR rate.We report here the long-term follow-up results for disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS).PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 2004 to 2007, 340 stage II-III BC patients were randomly assigned to receive neoadjuvant EC-T (four cycles of epirubicin-cyclophosphamide followed by four cycles of docetaxel) +/- celecoxib in HER2-negative cases (n = 220) and +/-trastuzumab in HER2-positive cases (n = 120).From September 2005, all patients with HER2-positive BC received adjuvant T (n = 106).RESULTS: Median follow-up was nearly 8 years (94.4 months, 20-127 m).In the HER2-negative subgroup, addition of celecoxib was not associated with a DFS benefit.Favourable factors were smaller tumour size, expression of progesterone receptor status (PgR) and pCR.In the HER2-positive population, neoadjuvant trastuzumab was not associated with a DFS benefit.Axillary pCR was the only prognostic factor associated with DFS in this group [HR = 0.44, 95% CI = 0.2-0.97], p = 0.035].To note, DFS and OS were significantly higher in the HER2-positive than in HER2-negative BC patients (HR = 0.58 [0.36-0.92], p = 0.021).CONCLUSION: Celecoxib combined with NAC provided neither pCR nor survival benefit in patients with HER2-negative BC.Absence of PgR is a major prognostic factor.Neoadjuvant trastuzumab increased pCR rates without translation into a DFS or OS benefit compared with adjuvant trastuzumab only.Axillary pCR could be a more relevant surrogate of survival than in the breast in HER2-positive population.A retrospective comparison shows that patients with HER2-positive tumours have a better outcome than HER2-negative BC patients showing the impact of trastuzumab on the natural history of BC.",1,1,1,1

29129894,"Motivating Mothers to Recommend Their 20-Year-Old Daughters Receive Cervical Cancer Screening: A Randomized Study.BACKGROUND: In Japan, the rate of cervical cancer screening is remarkably low, especially among women in their twenties and thirties, when cervical cancer is now increasing dramatically.The aim of this study was to test whether a modified government reminder for 20-year-old women to engage in cervical cancer screening, acting through maternal education and by asking for a maternal recommendation to the daughter to receive the screening, could increase their participation rate.METHODS: In two Japanese cities, 20-year-old girls who had not received their first cervical cancer screening before October of fiscal year 2014 were randomized into two study arms.One group of 1,274 received only a personalized daughter-directed reminder leaflet for cervical cancer screening.In the second group of 1,274, the daughters and their mothers received a combination package containing the same reminder leaflet as did the first group, plus an additional informational leaflet for the mother, which requested that the mother recommend that her daughter undergo cervical cancer screening.The subsequent post-reminder screening rates of these two study arms were compared.RESULTS: The cervical cancer screening rate of 20-year-old women whose mothers received the information leaflet was significantly higher than that for women who received only a leaflet for themselves (11% vs 9%, P = 0.0049).CONCLUSIONS: An intervention with mothers, by sending them a cervical cancer information leaflet with a request that they recommend that their daughter receive cervical cancer screening, significantly improved their daughters' screening rate.",1,0,0,0
29151359,"Osimertinib in Untreated EGFR-Mutated Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.BACKGROUND: Osimertinib is an oral, third-generation, irreversible epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) that selectively inhibits both EGFR-TKI-sensitizing and EGFR T790M resistance mutations.We compared osimertinib with standard EGFR-TKIs in patients with previously untreated, EGFR mutation-positive advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).METHODS: In this double-blind, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 556 patients with previously untreated, EGFR mutation-positive (exon 19 deletion or L858R) advanced NSCLC in a 1:1 ratio to receive either osimertinib (at a dose of 80 mg once daily) or a standard EGFR-TKI (gefitinib at a dose of 250 mg once daily or erlotinib at a dose of 150 mg once daily).The primary end point was investigator-assessed progression-free survival.RESULTS: The median progression-free survival was significantly longer with osimertinib than with standard EGFR-TKIs (18.9 months vs. 10.2 months; hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.46; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.37 to 0.57; P<0.001).The objective response rate was similar in the two groups: 80% with osimertinib and 76% with standard EGFR-TKIs (odds ratio, 1.27; 95% CI, 0.85 to 1.90; P=0.24).The median duration of response was 17.2 months (95% CI, 13.8 to 22.0) with osimertinib versus 8.5 months (95% CI, 7.3 to 9.8) with standard EGFR-TKIs.Data on overall survival were immature at the interim analysis (25% maturity).The survival rate at 18 months was 83% (95% CI, 78 to 87) with osimertinib and 71% (95% CI, 65 to 76) with standard EGFR-TKIs (hazard ratio for death, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.88; P=0.007 [nonsignificant in the interim analysis]).Adverse events of grade 3 or higher were less frequent with osimertinib than with standard EGFR-TKIs (34% vs. 45%).CONCLUSIONS: Osimertinib showed efficacy superior to that of standard EGFR-TKIs in the first-line treatment of EGFR mutation-positive advanced NSCLC, with a similar safety profile and lower rates of serious adverse events.(Funded by AstraZeneca; FLAURA ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02296125 .).",1,1,1,1
29254399,"Eighteen-year follow-up of the Goteborg Randomized Population-based Prostate Cancer Screening Trial: effect of sociodemographic variables on participation, prostate cancer incidence and mortality.OBJECTIVE: This study examined whether previously reported results, indicating that prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening can reduce prostate cancer (PC) mortality regardless of sociodemographic inequality, could be corroborated in an 18 year follow-up.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 1994, 20,000 men aged 50-64 years were randomized from the Goteborg population register to PSA screening or control (1:1) (study ID: ISRCTN54449243).Men in the screening group (n = 9950) were invited for biennial PSA testing up to the median age of 69 years.Prostate biopsy was recommended for men with PSA >/=2.5 ng/ml.Last follow-up was on 31 December 2012.RESULTS: In the screening group, 77% (7647/9950) attended at least once.After 18 years, 1396 men in the screening group and 962 controls had been diagnosed with PC [hazard ratio 1.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.39-1.64].Cumulative PC mortality was 0.98% (95% CI 0.78-1.22%) in the screening group versus 1.50% (95% CI 1.26-1.79%) in controls, an absolute reduction of 0.52% (95% CI 0.17-0.87%).The rate ratio (RR) for PC death was 0.65 (95% CI 0.49-0.87).To prevent one death from PC, the number needed to invite was 231 and the number needed to diagnose was 10. Systematic PSA screening demonstrated greater benefit in PC mortality for men who started screening at age 55-59 years (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.29-0.78) and men with low education (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.31-0.78).CONCLUSIONS: These data corroborate previous findings that systematic PSA screening reduces PC mortality and suggest that systematic screening may reduce sociodemographic inequality in PC mortality.",0,0,0,0
29501363,"Addition of the PARP inhibitor veliparib plus carboplatin or carboplatin alone to standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy in triple-negative breast cancer (BrighTNess): a randomised, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Although several randomised trials in patients with triple-negative breast cancer have shown that the addition of carboplatin, with or without poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, to neoadjuvant chemotherapy increases the likelihood of achieving a pathological complete response, the use of these therapies in this setting has remained controversial.The BrighTNess trial was designed to assess the addition of the PARP inhibitor veliparib plus carboplatin or carboplatin alone to standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy in triple-negative breast cancer.METHODS: We did a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (BrighTNess) across 145 sites in 15 countries.Patients aged 18 years and older with previously untreated histologically or cytologically confirmed clinical stage II-III triple-negative breast cancer, who were candidates for potentially curative surgery and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, were randomly assigned (2:1:1) by an interactive response technology system via permuted blocks (block size of four) within strata to receive one of three segment 1 regimens: paclitaxel (80 mg/m(2) intravenously weekly for 12 doses) plus carboplatin (area under the curve 6 mg/mL per min, intravenously every 3 weeks, for four cycles) plus veliparib (50 mg orally, twice a day); paclitaxel plus carboplatin plus veliparib placebo (twice a day); or paclitaxel plus carboplatin placebo (every 3 weeks for four cycles) plus veliparib placebo.Following segment 1, all patients were assigned to segment 2 in which they received doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide every 2-3 weeks for four cycles.Randomisation for segment 1 was stratified by germline BRCA mutation status, nodal stage, and planned schedule of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide administration.The primary endpoint was pathological complete response in breast and lymph nodes as determined by site pathologists following completion of neoadjuvant therapy.Efficacy analyses were done by intention to treat and safety analyses included all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment.These are the first results of an ongoing clinical trial; the data cutoff for the analyses presented was Dec 8, 2016.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02032277.FINDINGS: Between April 4, 2014, and March 18, 2016, 634 patients were randomly assigned: 316 to paclitaxel plus carboplatin plus veliparib, 160 to paclitaxel plus carboplatin, and 158 to paclitaxel alone.The proportion of patients who achieved a pathological complete response was higher in the paclitaxel, carboplatin, and veliparib group than in patients receiving paclitaxel alone (168 [53%] of 316 patients vs 49 [31%] of 158, p<0.0001), but not compared with patients receiving paclitaxel plus carboplatin (92 [58%] of 160 patients, p=0.36).Grade 3 or 4 toxicities, and serious adverse events were more common in patients receiving carboplatin, whereas veliparib did not substantially increase toxicity.The most common grade 3 or 4 events overall were neutropenia (352 [56%] of 628 patients), anaemia (180 [29%]), and thrombocytopenia (75 [12%]) through complete treatment, and febrile neutropenia (88 [15%] of 601 patients) during segment 2.The most common serious adverse events were febrile neutropenia (80 [13%] of 628 patients) and anaemia (20 [3%]).INTERPRETATION: Although the addition of veliparib and carboplatin to paclitaxel followed by doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide improved the proportion of patients with triple-negative breast cancer who achieved a pathological complete response, the addition of veliparib to carboplatin and paclitaxel did not.Increased toxicities with the addition of carboplatin (with or without veliparib) to paclitaxel were manageable and did not substantially affect treatment delivery of paclitaxel followed by doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide.Given the consistent results with previous studies, the addition of carboplatin appears to have a favourable risk to benefit profile and might be considered as a potential component of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for patients with high-risk, triple-negative breast cancer.FUNDING: AbbVie.",1,1,1,1

29587666,"Cost effectiveness analysis of afatinib versus pemetrexed-cisplatin for first-line treatment of locally advanced or metastatic EGFR mutation positive non-small-cell lung cancer from the Singapore healthcare payer's perspective.BACKGROUND: Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 85% of all lung cancers and is associated with a poor prognosis.Afatinib is an irreversible ErbB family blocker recommended in clinical guidelines as a first-line treatment for NSCLC which harbours an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation.The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of afatinib versus pemetrexed-cisplatin for first-line treatment of locally advanced or metastatic EGFR mutation positive NSCLC in Singapore.METHODS: A partitioned survival model with three health states (progression-free, progressive disease and death) was developed from a healthcare payer perspective.Survival curves from the LUX-Lung 3 trial (afatinib versus pemetrexed-cisplatin chemotherapy) were extrapolated beyond the trial period to estimate the underlying progression-free survival and overall survival parametric distributions.Rates of adverse reactions were also estimated from LUX-Lung 3 while health utilities from overseas were derived from the literature in the absence of local estimates.Direct costs were sourced from public healthcare institutions in Singapore.Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated over a 5 year time horizon.Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses and additional scenario analyses were conducted to explore the impact of uncertainties and assumptions on the cost-effectiveness results.RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, the ICER for afatinib versus pemetrexed-cisplatin was SG$137,648 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained and SG$109,172 per life-year gained.One-way sensitivity analysis showed the ICER was most sensitive to variations in the utility values, the cost of afatinib and time horizon.Scenario analyses showed that even reducing the cost of afatinib by 50% led to a high ICER which was unlikely to represent a cost-effective use of healthcare resources.CONCLUSIONS: Compared with pemetrexed-cisplatin, afatinib is not cost-effective as a first-line treatment for advanced EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC in Singapore.The findings from our study will be useful to inform local healthcare decision-making and resource allocations for NSCLC treatments, together with other considerations such as clinical effectiveness, safety and affordability of TKIs.",0,0,0,0
29602646,"Combination nivolumab and ipilimumab or nivolumab alone in melanoma brain metastases: a multicentre randomised phase 2 study.BACKGROUND: Nivolumab monotherapy and combination nivolumab plus ipilimumab increase proportions of patients achieving a response and survival versus ipilimumab in patients with metastatic melanoma; however, efficacy in active brain metastases is unknown.We aimed to establish the efficacy and safety of nivolumab alone or in combination with ipilimumab in patients with active melanoma brain metastases.METHODS: This multicentre open-label randomised phase 2 trial was done at four sites in Australia, in three cohorts of immunotherapy-naive patients aged 18 years or older with melanoma brain metastases.Patients with asymptomatic brain metastases with no previous local brain therapy were randomly assigned using the biased coin minimisation method, stratified by site, in a 30:24 ratio (after a safety run-in of six patients) to cohort A (nivolumab plus ipilimumab) or cohort B (nivolumab).Patients with brain metastases in whom local therapy had failed, or who had neurological symptoms, or leptomeningeal disease were enrolled in non-randomised cohort C (nivolumab).Patients in cohort A received intravenous nivolumab 1 mg/kg combined with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks for four doses, then nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks; patients in cohort B or cohort C received intravenous nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks.The primary endpoint was intracranial response from week 12.Primary and safety analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis in all patients who received at least one dose of the study drug.This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02374242, and is ongoing for the final survival analysis.FINDINGS: Between Nov 4, 2014, and April 21, 2017, 79 patients were enrolled; 36 in cohort A, 27 in cohort B, and 16 in cohort C. One patient in cohort A and two in cohort B were found to be ineligible and excluded from the study before receiving the study drug.At the data cutoff (Aug 28, 2017), with a median follow up of 17 months (IQR 8-25), intracranial responses were achieved by 16 (46%; 95% CI 29-63) of 35 patients in cohort A, five (20%; 7-41) of 25 in cohort B, and one (6%; 0-30) of 16 in cohort C. Intracranial complete responses occurred in six (17%) patients in cohort A, three (12%) in cohort B, and none in cohort C. Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 34 (97%) of 35 patients in cohort A, 17 (68%) of 25 in cohort B, and eight (50%) of 16 in cohort C. Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 19 (54%) patients in cohort A, four (16%) in cohort B, and two (13%) in cohort C. No treatment-related deaths occurred.INTERPRETATION: Nivolumab combined with ipilimumab and nivolumab monotherapy are active in melanoma brain metastases.A high proportion of patients achieved an intracranial response with the combination.Thus, nivolumab combined with ipilimumab should be considered as a first-line therapy for patients with asymptomatic untreated brain metastases.FUNDING: Melanoma Institute Australia and Bristol-Myers Squibb.",1,1,1,0
29617836,"Met Receptor Tyrosine Kinase and Chemoprevention of Oral Cancer.Background: We have previously shown that gene expression profiles of oral leukoplakia (OL) may improve the prediction of oral cancer (OC) risk.To identify new targets for prevention, we performed a systematic survey of transcripts associated with an increased risk of oral cancer and overexpressed in OC vs normal mucosa (NM).Methods: We used gene expression profiles of 86 patients with OL and available outcomes from a chemoprevention trial of OC and NM.MET expression was evaluated using immunohistochemistry in 120 OL patients, and its association with OC development was tested in multivariable analysis.Sensitivity to pharmacological Met inhibition was tested invitro in premalignant and OC cell lines (n = 33) and invivo using the 4-NQO model of oral chemoprevention (n = 20 mice per group).All statistical tests were two-sided.Results: The overlap of 693 transcripts associated with an increased risk of OC with 163 transcripts overexpressed in OC compared with NM led to the identification of 23 overlapping transcripts, including MET.MET overexpression in OL was associated with a hazard ratio of 3.84 (95% confidence interval = 1.59 to 9.27, P = .003) of developing OC.Met activation was found in OC and preneoplastic cell lines.Crizotinib activity in preneoplastic and OC cell lines was comparable.ARQ 197 was more active in preneoplastic compared with OC cell lines.In the 4-NQO model, squamous cell carcinoma, dysplasia, and hyperkeratosis were observed in 75.0%, 15.0%, and 10.0% in the control group, and in 25.0%, 70.0%, and 5.0% in the crizotinib group (P < .001).Conclusion: Together, these data suggest that MET activation may represent an early driver in oral premalignancy and a target for chemoprevention of OC.",0,0,0,0

30640653,"Interfascial block at the serratus muscle plane versus conventional analgesia in breast surgery: a randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In the context of opioid-sparing perioperative management, there is still little evidence from randomized controlled trials regarding the effectiveness of interfascial thoracic blocks.This study hypothesizes that receiving a serratus plane block reduces opioid requirements, pain scores, and rescue medication needs.METHODS: This double-blind, randomized controlled study was conducted on 60 adult females undergoing oncologic breast surgery.After general anesthesia, patients were randomly allocated to either conventional analgesia (control group, n=30) or single-injection serratus block with L-bupivacaine 0.25% 30mL (study group, n=30).First 24-hour total morphine consumption (primary outcome), pain scores at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours, time-to-first opioid rescue analgesia, and adverse effects were recorded.RESULTS: Median 24 hours' opioid dose was greater in the control group (median difference 9 mg (95% CI 4 to 14.5 mg); p<0.001).Proportional odds model showed that the study group has a lower probability of receiving opioid drugs (OR=0.26 (95% CI 0.10 to 0.68); p<0.001), while mastectomies have a higher probability of receiving them (OR=4.11 (95% CI 1.25 to 13.58); p=0.002).Pain scores in the study group were significantly lower throughout the follow-up period (p<0.001).Control group subjects needed earlier morphine rescue and had a higher risk of rescue dose requirement (p=0.002).CONCLUSIONS: Interfascial serratus plane block reduces opioid requirements and is associated with better pain scores and lower and later rescue analgesia needs in the first 24 hours, compared with conventional intravenous analgesia, in breast surgery.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT02905149.",1,1,0,0
30714092,"Aneuploidy in children with relapsed B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia: clinical importance of detecting a hypodiploid origin of relapse.Aneuploidy is common in paediatric B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL).Specific subgroups, such as high hyperdiploidy (>50 chromosomes or DNA Index >/=1.16) and hypodiploidy (<45 chromosomes), predict outcome of patients after primary treatment.Whether aneuploidy has a prognostic value for relapsed disease is yet to be determined.Using DNA index and centromere screening by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, we investigated aneuploidy in 413 children treated for first relapse of B-cell precursor ALL according to the ALL-REZ BFM 2002 protocol.Ten-year event-free survival of patients with high hyperdiploid relapses approached 70%, whereas it was only 40% in low hyperdiploid relapses.Three patients with apparent hyperdiploid relapse had TP53 mutations.In these cases, array-based allelotyping revealed a hypodiploid origin with absence of the hypodiploid founder clone (masked hypodiploidy).Collectively, patients with evident or masked hypodiploid relapses showed an extremely low event-free survival rate of 9%.Importantly, the current relapse risk stratification did not identify cases with masked hypodiploidy as high-risk patients, due to their favourable clinical presentation.In multivariate analysis, hypodiploidy proved to be an independent prognostic factor.This finding supports stratification of relapses with hypodiploid origin into high-risk arms in future trials or allocation of patients to alternative treatment approaches.",0,0,0,0

30813966,"Patterns of occurrence and implications of neratinib-associated diarrhea in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer: analyses from the randomized phase III ExteNET trial.BACKGROUND: We characterized patterns of occurrence and the impact of neratinib-associated diarrhea in the absence of protocol-directed antidiarrheal prophylaxis or a formal diarrhea management plan using data from Extended Adjuvant Treatment of Breast Cancer with Neratinib (ExteNET).METHODS: ExteNET is a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized phase III trial involving community-based and academic institutions in 40 countries.Women with HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer with prior standard primary therapy and trastuzumab-based (neo)adjuvant therapy were randomized to neratinib 240 mg/day or placebo for 12 months.Safety, a secondary outcome, was assessed using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria version 3.0.Health-related quality of life by diarrhea grade was assessed using Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B).RESULTS: Two thousand eight hundred sixteen women (1408 per group) were safety-evaluable.Grade 3 and 4 diarrhea occurred in 561 (39.8%) and 1 (0.1%) patients with neratinib versus 23 (1.6%) and 0 patients with placebo, respectively.In the neratinib group, 28.6% of patients had grade 3 events during month 1 decreasing to </= 6% after month 3.The median cumulative duration of grade 3/4 diarrhea with neratinib was 5 days (interquartile range, 2-9).Serious diarrheal events (n = 22, 1.6%) and diarrheal events requiring hospitalization (n = 20, 1.4%)were rare with neratinib.Changes in FACT-B total score by diarrhea grade in the neratinib group did not meet the threshold for clinically important differences.CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of antidiarrheal prophylaxis, neratinib-related diarrhea is short-lived and not associated with complications or long-term sequelae.This suggests that targeted preventive management with antidiarrheal prophylaxis early during neratinib treatment is appropriate.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00878709.Registered 9 April 2009.",1,1,0,0
30918134,"Circulating zinc-alpha2-glycoprotein is reduced in women with polycystic ovary syndrome, but can be increased by exenatide or metformin treatment.The study was to investigate circulating zinc-alpha2-glycoprotein (ZAG) concentrations in women with PCOS, and changes in ZAG levels after exenatide or metformin treatment.One hundred eighty-two women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) who met the 2003 Rotterdam diagnostic criteria and 150 controls without PCOS were recruited.We partitioned women with PCOS into groups according to body mass index or blood glucose concentrations, determined serum ZAG, anthropometric parameters, metabolic and endocrine indicators, and inflammatory markers, and statistically analyzed the results.Eighty-two overweight/obese subjects of the recruited women with PCOS were then randomly assigned to groups administered either 12 weeks of exenatide injection (10 mug b.i.d.) or oral metformin (1,000 mg b.i.d.).Circulating ZAG levels were determined after 12 weeks of treatment.The results showed that circulating ZAG was significantly lower in PCOS women than in healthy women (p < 0.01).Overweight/obese women and those with higher blood glucose levels had lower circulating ZAG.After 12 weeks of exenatide or metformin treatment, there were significant increases (p < 0.01) in circulating ZAG in both treatment groups (the exenatide baseline level was 46.54 +/- 2.38 ng/mL vs. 56.41 +/- 2.02 ng/mL after treatment, p < 0.01; metformin baseline was 47.81 +/- 2.14 ng/mL vs. 55.67 +/- 2.01 ng/mL after treatment, p < 0.01), however there was no statistical difference between the 2 treatments (p > 0.05).Circulating ZAG is closely related to PCOS and could be an important adipokine involved in the occurrence and development of PCOS.ZAG might possibly be applicable as a new observational indicator in the treatment of PCOS.",0,0,0,0
30998526,"A randomised controlled trial evaluating the effectiveness of Facebook compared to leaflets in raising awareness of melanoma and harmful sun-related behaviour among young adults.This study describes a randomised control trial investigating whether printed leaflets or social media are more effective in increasing knowledge of the risks of sun exposure and melanoma in people aged 18-29.The study participants were 18-29-year-old university students or graduates, recruited in London.A baseline level of knowledge was measured using the Skin Cancer and Sun Knowledge questionnaire.Study participants were then randomised into either a leaflet arm or Facebook arm.Identical information was delivered through a SunSafe campaign via either posted leaflets or Facebook during a 10-day exposure window.Following this, participants repeated the Skin Cancer and Sun Knowledge questionnaire.Following the SunSafe intervention, the mean knowledge score improved in both groups to a statistically significant degree (Facebook = 1.82, leaflets = 3.04, P < 0.001).Moreover, the improvement in knowledge score of the leaflet arm was statistically significantly greater than in the Facebook arm (95% confidence interval: 0.35-2.09, P = 0.0059).Participants of lighter skin colour demonstrated greater levels of knowledge about skin cancer and sun exposure at baseline (P = 0.005; P < 0.05).There was no correlation between sex and baseline knowledge (P = 0.7725).There was no significant effect of skin tone or sex on the knowledge change (P = 0.139 and 0.643).The findings suggest that printed information in the form of leaflets is more impactful in increasing knowledge than online platforms such as Facebook among a young adult demographic in the UK.These findings should be considered when designing public health campaigns, acting as a reminder to not neglect traditional media in health promotion.",1,0,0,0
31111509,"Parts greater than their sum: randomized controlled trial testing partitioned incentives to increase cancer screening.Promoting healthy behavior is a challenge for public health officials, especially in the context of asking patients to participate in preventive cancer screenings.Small financial incentives are sometimes used, but there is a little scientific basis to support a compelling description of the best-practice implementation of such incentives.We present a simple behavioral strategy based on mental accounting from prospect theory that maximizes the impact of incentives with no additional cost.We show how the partition of one incentive into two smaller incentives of equivalent total amount produces substantial behavioral changes, demonstrated in the context of colorectal cancer screening.In a randomized controlled trial, eligible patients aged 50-74 (n = 1652 patients) were allocated to receive either one euro10 incentive (upon completion of screening) or two euro5 incentives (at the beginning and at the end of screening).We show that cancer screening rates were dramatically increased by partitioning the financial incentive (61.1%), compared with a single installment at the end (41.4%).These results support the hedonic editing hypothesis from prospect theory, and underline the importance of implementing theoretically grounded healthcare interventions.Our results suggest that, when patient incentives are feasible, healthcare procedures should be framed as multistage events with smaller incentives offered at multiple points in time.",0,0,0,0

32083990,"Standard Anthracycline Based Versus Docetaxel-Capecitabine in Early High Clinical and/or Genomic Risk Breast Cancer in the EORTC 10041/BIG 3-04 MINDACT Phase III Trial.PURPOSE: MINDACT demonstrated that 46% of patients with early breast cancer at high clinical but low genomic risk on the basis of MammaPrint may safely avoid adjuvant chemotherapy.A second random assignment (R-C) compared docetaxel-capecitabine with an anthracycline-based regimen.PATIENTS AND METHODS: R-C randomly assigned patients 1:1 between standard anthracycline-based regimens, with or without taxanes (control) and experimental docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) intravenously plus oral capecitabine 825 mg/m(2) two times per day for 14 days (DC) every 3 weeks for 6 cycles.The primary end point was disease-free survival (DFS).Secondary end points included overall survival and safety.RESULTS: Of 2,832 patients, 1,301 (45%) were randomly assigned, and 97% complied with R-C assignment.In the control arm, 29.6% only received taxanes (0.5% of N0 patients).DFS events (n = 148) were much less than required (n = 422) as a result of a lower-than-expected accrual and event rate.At 5 years of median follow-up, DFS was not different between DC (n = 652) and control (n = 649; 90.7% [95% CI, 88% to 92.8%] v 88.8% [95% CI, 85.9% to 91.1%]; hazard ratio [HR], 0.83 [95% CI, 0.60 to 1.15]; P = .26).Overall survival (HR, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.54 to 1.53]) and DFS in the clinical high and genomic high-risk subgroup (86.1% v 88.1%; HR, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.58 to 1.21]) were similar in both arms.DC led to more grade 1 neuropathy (27.1% v 11.2%) and more grade 2 hand/foot syndrome (28.5% v 3.3%) and diarrhea (13.7% v 5.8%).Serious cardiac events occurred in 9 patients (control, n = 4; DC, n = 5).Fifty-three patients developed second cancers (control, n = 32; DC, n = 21; leukemia: 2 v 1).Five treatment-related deaths occurred (control, 2 [0.3%]; DC, 3 [0.5%]).CONCLUSION: Although underpowered, this second randomization in MINDACT did not show any improvement in outcome or safety with the use of DC compared with anthracycline-based chemotherapy.",1,1,1,0
32212089,"Prognostic Significance of VEGF and HIF-1 alpha in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Patients Receiving Sorafenib Versus Metformin Sorafenib Combination.BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major health problem.HCC burden has been increasing in Egypt in the past 10 years.Most HCC cases are diagnosed at an advanced stage with limited treatment options.Sorafenib is the standard therapy for advanced HCC, but the effectiveness is not satisfied.Metformin may decrease the risk of HCC development in diabetic patients, reduces tumor invasion, and augments sensitivity to sorafenib; however, safety and efficacy of combined treatment are still unclear.As HCC is characterized by high vascularity, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays an important role in vascularization, many studies questioned if VEGF and HIF-1 alpha could offer information about HCC response to sorafenib.We conducted this study to assess the benefits from adding metformin to HCC treatment, and appraise the role of VEGF and HIF-1 alpha in HCC prognosis.METHOD: This was a prospective, randomized study in which 80 advanced measurable patients consecutively treated with sorafenib plus metformin (arm A) or sorafenib alone (arm B), prognostic value of plasma, and tissue levels of VEGF and HIF-1 alpha were evaluated.RESULTS: We enrolled 61 men and 19 women with a median age of 60 years (range 49-68 years).Fifty-seven patients had Child-Pugh A while 23 had early B, the most common etiology of liver disease was hepatitis C (86%).Sixty percent of patients were diabetic.No significant difference was detected between arm A and arm B regarding response to treatment (p = 0.5), time to disease progression (p = 0.3), or overall survival (p = 0.6).Low VEGF and HIF-1 alpha plasma levels were significantly associated with better treatment response (p < 0.001 for both), and higher OS (p < 0.001).Patients with high expressions of VEGF and HIF in HCC tissue had significantly poor treatment outcome (p < 0.001, p = 0.03, respectively), and poor OS (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: No superior efficacy of adding metformin to sorafenib in HCC treatment.VEGF and HIF-1 alpha had promising prognostic value in HCC.",1,1,1,0

32375763,"ReNaApp: increasing the long-term effects of oncological rehabilitation through an application after medical rehabilitation (ReNaApp): a quasi-randomized longitudinal study of prospective design.BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the most common malignant disease in women.Compared with other cancer types, breast cancer has a higher survival rate.The majority of breast cancer patients are overstrained to implement cancer-specific recommendations relating to changes in health behaviour.Numerous epidemiological studies have shown a positive correlation between physical activity and quality of life as well as the course of disease during and after breast cancer treatment.However, many patients have difficulties integrating physical activity into their everyday lives due to cancer symptoms.To develop physical activity into a daily routine, an aftercare programme for breast cancer patients will be developed.In particular, the programme is structured in terms of the validated concept ""Neues Credo"".The basic concept is converted into a mobile application.METHODS: The study sample includes n = 740 rehabilitants (370 for the intervention group and for the control group) from five different rehab clinics in Northern Germany.The evaluation is as follows: a) Quasi-randomized, prospective longitudinal study (sequential study design).The intervention group receives a mobile application after rehabilitation, and the control group receives treatment as usual.The study evaluation is carried out through a questionnaire at three stages (at the beginning of the rehabilitation, at the end of the rehabilitation, and after 12 months).b) Qualitative analysis of interviews and focus groups in terms of feasibility and acceptance.c) Formative evaluation of the app.DISCUSSION: Above all, the aftercare programme ReNaApp increases the long-term effects of oncological rehabilitation.By documenting physical activity in ReNaApp, rehabilitants become more motivated to engage in physical activity in their everyday lives.Currently, there is no scientifically evaluated app for breast cancer patients in the German language.Thus, ReNaApp ensures an aftercare treatment for breast cancer patients with high-quality performance regardless of their place of residence.By adopting a participatory approach and a user-centred design, ReNaApp corresponds to the demands of the rehabilitants.TRIAL REGISTRATION: German Register of Clinical Trials, www.drks.de.Identifier: DRKS00019017; Registered: November 7th, 2019.Date and version identifier: April 17th 2020; vesion 2.",0,0,0,0
32387140,"Religious Coping in Cancer: A Quantitative Analysis of Expressive Writing Samples From Patients With Renal Cell Carcinoma.CONTEXT: Past religiosity/spirituality (R/S) research has mainly relied on self-report instruments, which may result in self-presentation and defensive biases.OBJECTIVES: To address these limitations, we reviewed the writing samples that were generated as part of an expressive writing (EW) trial, coded the samples for R/S content, and examined cross-sectional and prospective associations between R/S content and symptom and psychosocial outcomes.METHODS: Participants diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma who were randomized to the EW arm completed a standard writing protocol.Before randomization, they completed validated measures of R/S, depressive symptoms, social support, fatigue, and sleep disturbances and one, four, and 10 months after completing the intervention.Writing samples were coded for positive and negative religious coping (RC), and personal (e.g., private prayer) and collective (e.g., church attendance) religious engagement (RE).RESULTS: Of the 138 patients, 117 provided at least one writing sample, and 89% of participants made at least one R/S reference with 70% including at least one positive RC statement, and 45.3% revealed personal and 42.3% collective RE.Negative RC was rare (8%).Although positive RC and RE were significantly associated with the R/S Index (P < 0.01), negative RC was not.In prospective analyses, RE was associated with reduced cancer-related symptoms over time (P = 0.04), and negative RC was associated with increased psychological distress over time (P = 0.004).CONCLUSION: Behavioral coding of EW samples supported the literature suggesting that positive RC is common among patients with cancer.Although negative RC may be relatively rare, it may be associated with psychological distress.",0,0,0,0

33591469,"Long-term outcome of (neo)adjuvant zoledronic acid therapy in locally advanced breast cancer.PURPOSE: The role of zoledronic acid (ZOL), a bone-targeted bisphosphonate, in the treatment of patients with breast cancer remains an active area of study.Here, we report the long-term outcomes of a randomized placebo-controlled phase II clinical trial in which ZOL treatment was added to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in women with locally advanced breast cancer.METHODS: 120 women with clinical stage II-III (>/= T2 and/or >/= N1) newly diagnosed breast cancer were randomized to receive either 4 mg intravenous ZOL every 3 weeks for 1 year (17 total doses) beginning with the first dose of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, or chemotherapy alone.Clinical endpoints included time to recurrence (TTR), time to bone recurrence (TTBR), time to non-bone recurrence (TTNBR), breast cancer survival (BCS) and overall survival (OS).RESULTS: With a median follow-up interval of 14.4 years, there were no significant differences in any of the clinical endpoints studied between the control and ZOL groups in the overall study population.However, ER+/HER2- patients younger than age 45 who were treated with ZOL had significantly worse TTR and TTNBR with a trend towards worse TTBR, BCS and OS (TTR: P = 0.024, HR 6.05 [1.26-29.1]; TTNBR: P = 0.026, HR 6.94 [1.26-38.1]; TTBR: P = 0.054, HR 6.01 [0.97-37.1]; BCS: P = 0.138, HR 4.43 [0.62-31.7]; OS: P = 0.138, HR 4.43 [0.62-31.7]).These differences were not seen in older ER+/HER2- patients or triple-negative patients of any age.CONCLUSION: Addition of ZOL to neoadjuvant therapy did not significantly affect clinical outcomes in the overall study population but was associated with increased extra-skeletal recurrence and a trend towards worse survival in ER+/HER2- patients younger than age 45.These findings suggest caution when using zoledronic acid in young, premenopausal women with locally advanced breast cancer and warrant further investigation.Clinical Trial Registration Number NCT00242203, Date of Registration: 10/17/2005.",1,1,1,0
33608485,"Exercise intensity and markers of inflammation during and after (neo-) adjuvant cancer treatment.Exercise training has been hypothesized to lower the inflammatory burden for patients with cancer, but the role of exercise intensity is unknown.To this end, we compared the effects of high-intensity (HI) and low-to-moderate intensity (LMI) exercise on markers of inflammation in patients with curable breast, prostate and colorectal cancer undergoing primary adjuvant cancer treatment in a secondary analysis of the Phys-Can randomized trial (NCT02473003).Sub-group analyses focused on patients with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy.Patients performed 6 months of combined aerobic and resistance exercise on either HI or LMI during and after primary adjuvant cancer treatment.Plasma taken at baseline, immediately post-treatment and post-intervention was analyzed for levels of interleukin 1 beta (IL1B), IL6, IL8, IL10, tumor-necrosis factor alpha (TNFA) and C-reactive protein (CRP).Intention-to-treat analyses of 394 participants revealed no significant between-group differences.Regardless of exercise intensity, significant increases of IL6, IL8, IL10 and TNFA post-treatment followed by significant declines, except for IL8, until post-intervention were observed with no difference for CRP or IL1B.Subgroup analyses of 154 patients with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy revealed that CRP (estimated mean difference (95% CI): 0.59 (0.33; 1.06); P = 0.101) and TNFA (EMD (95% CI): 0.88 (0.77; 1); P = 0.053) increased less with HI exercise post-treatment compared to LMI.Exploratory cytokine co-regulation analysis revealed no difference between the groups.In patients with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy, HI exercise resulted in a lesser increase of CRP and TNFA immediately post-treatment compared to LMI, potentially protecting against chemotherapy-related inflammation.",0,0,0,0
33839443,"Prognostic value of D-dimer levels in patients with gastric cancer undergoing gastrectomy.BACKGROUND: Plasma D-dimer levels have been associated with tumor progression and oncological outcomes in several cancers.This study assessed the relationships of D-dimer levels with clinicopathological features and survival outcomes in patients with gastric cancer undergoing gastrectomy.METHODS: Data from 666 patients with gastric cancer who underwent gastrectomy between June 2012 and December 2015 were collected and analyzed; these data were acquired during a previous randomized clinical trial (PROTECTOR trial, NCT01448746).Optimal cut-off values of preoperative, immediate postoperative, postoperative-day 1, postoperative-day 4, and postoperative-day 30 D-dimer levels for predicting overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were determined using Contal and O'Quigley's method.The optimal cut-off value of the immediate postoperative D-dimer level for predicting OS was 3.33.Patients were divided into D-dimer high and low groups based on these cut-off values.RESULTS: High immediate postoperative D-dimer levels were significantly associated with advanced T stage and TNM stage (P = 0.001 and P = 0.006, respectively).OS and DFS were significantly lower for patients in the D-dimer high group than for patients in the D-dimer low group; this relationship was consistent for preoperative, immediate postoperative, postoperative-day 1, and postoperative-day 30 D-dimer levels.Multivariate analysis identified the immediate postoperative D-dimer level as an independent prognostic factor for OS (hazard ratio, 2.52; P = 0.010).CONCLUSIONS: Elevated immediate postoperative D-dimer level was predictive of poor long-term outcomes in patients with gastric cancer after gastrectomy.Immediate postoperative D-dimer levels may offer simple and inexpensive clinical decision-making guidance for patients with gastric cancer after gastrectomy.",0,0,0,0
33857412,"Adjuvant pembrolizumab versus placebo in resected stage III melanoma (EORTC 1325-MG/KEYNOTE-054): distant metastasis-free survival results from a double-blind, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 1325/KEYNOTE-054 trial assessed pembrolizumab versus placebo in patients with resected high-risk stage III melanoma.At 15-month median follow-up, pembrolizumab improved recurrence-free survival (hazard ratio [HR] 0.57 [98.4% CI 0.43-0.74], p<0.0001) compared with placebo, leading to its approval in the USA and Europe.This report provides the final results for the secondary efficacy endpoint, distant metastasis-free survival and an update of the recurrence-free survival results.METHODS: This double-blind, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial was done at 123 academic centres and community hospitals across 23 countries.Patients aged 18 years or older with complete resection of cutaneous melanoma metastatic to lymph node, classified as American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system, seventh edition (AJCC-7) stage IIIA (at least one lymph node metastasis >1 mm), IIIB, or IIIC (without in-transit metastasis), and with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 were eligible.Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) via a central interactive voice response system to receive intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg or placebo every 3 weeks for up to 18 doses or until disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity.Randomisation was stratified according to disease stage and region, using a minimisation technique, and clinical investigators, patients, and those collecting or analysing the data were masked to treatment assignment.The two coprimary endpoints were recurrence-free survival in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population and in patients with PD-L1-positive tumours.The secondary endpoint reported here was distant metastasis-free survival in the ITT and PD-L1-positive populations.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02362594, and EudraCT, 2014-004944-37.FINDINGS: Between Aug 26, 2015, and Nov 14, 2016, 1019 patients were assigned to receive either pembrolizumab (n=514) or placebo (n=505).At an overall median follow-up of 42.3 months (IQR 40.5-45.9), 3.5-year distant metastasis-free survival was higher in the pembrolizumab group than in the placebo group in the ITT population (65.3% [95% CI 60.9-69.5] in the pembrolizumab group vs 49.4% [44.8-53.8] in the placebo group; HR 0.60 [95% CI 0.49-0.73]; p<0.0001).In the 853 patients with PD-L1-positive tumours, 3.5-year distant metastasis-free survival was 66.7% (95% CI 61.8-71.2) in the pembrolizumab group and 51.6% (46.6-56.4) in the placebo group (HR 0.61 [95% CI 0.49-0.76]; p<0.0001).Recurrence-free survival remained longer in the pembrolizumab group 59.8% (95% CI 55.3-64.1) than the placebo group 41.4% (37.0-45.8) at this 3.5-year follow-up in the ITT population (HR 0.59 [95% CI 0.49-0.70]) and in those with PD-L1-positive tumours 61.4% (56.3-66.1) in the pembrolizumab group and 44.1% (39.2-48.8) in the placebo group (HR 0.59 [95% CI 0.49-0.73]).INTERPRETATION: Pembrolizumab adjuvant therapy provided a significant and clinically meaningful improvement in distant metastasis-free survival at a 3.5-year median follow-up, which was consistent with the improvement in recurrence-free survival.Therefore, the results of this trial support the indication to use adjuvant pembrolizumab therapy in patients with resected high risk stage III cutaneous melanoma.FUNDING: Merck Sharp & Dohme.",1,1,1,1

34378511,"The value of a comprehensive primary outcome - results of a negative randomized control trial in the non-muscle invasive bladder cancer population.INTRODUCTION American Urological Association (AUA) guidelines recommend intravesical chemotherapy to be given following transurethral resection of a bladder tumor.Prior studies have shown the benefit of mitomycin as well as gemcitabine.However, no study has compared the two agents.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was designed as an open label 1:1:1 randomized controlled trial, comparing intravesical mitomycin, gemcitabine and saline as a single intraoperative instillation immediately following transurethral resection of suspected bladder tumor.Primary endpoint was any grade >/= 3 events according to NCI CTCAE Version 4.03, this captures any return trip to the operating room for recurrence of cancer or other event (benign bladder/urethra).Secondary endpoints were progression free survival for urothelial cell carcinoma and adverse events.RESULTS: A total of 82 patients were enrolled and randomized, unfortunately the trial was suspended early due to protocol deviations.In an intention to treat analysis, freedom from grade > 3 events at 2 years was 74.8% in the no treatment arm, 51.0% in the mitomycin arm, and 56.0% in the gemcitabine arm (p = 0.81).Freedom from cancer recurrence for all patients was 62.3%.In the no treatment arm, it was 78.8%, and 50.7% and 63.6% in the mitomycin arm and gemcitabine arm respectively.(p = 0.28).In a univariate analysis, the only patient variable significantly associated with the primary outcome was pathologic T stage (p < 0.002).CONCLUSION: This study provides an example of a novel, patient centered primary outcome with the goal of determining which treatment paradigms provide the greatest oncologic and clinic benefit.",1,1,0,0
34515341,"Reflexology and meditative practices for symptom management among people with cancer: Results from a sequential multiple assignment randomized trial.Optimal sequencing of complementary therapies can help improve symptom management through nonpharmacological approaches.A 12-week sequential multiple assignment randomized trial comparing home-based reflexology and meditative practices on severity of fatigue and other symptoms was conducted among patients with cancer and their informal caregivers.Dyads were initially randomized to reflexology (N = 150), meditative practices (N = 150), or control (N = 47).If patient's fatigue did not improve (nonresponse) after 4 weeks of reflexology or meditative practices, the dyad was rerandomized to either add the other therapy or continue with the original therapy for weeks 5-8.Four decision rules (DRs) were compared: (1) Initiating reflexology, and if nonresponse on fatigue after 4 weeks, continue with reflexology for another 4 weeks, thus providing a higher dose; (2) Initiating reflexology, and if nonresponse on fatigue after 4 weeks, add meditative practices for the next 4 weeks; (3) Initiating meditative practices, and if nonresponse on fatigue after 4 weeks, continue meditative practices for another 4 weeks, thus providing a higher dose; and (4) Initiating meditative practices, and if nonresponse on fatigue after 4 weeks, add reflexology for the next 4 weeks.Symptoms were evaluated weekly using the M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI).Clinically, nurses can recommend either therapy since no differences were found among the 4 DRs, with the exception of lower severity for summed MDASI symptoms at week 8 for the use of reflexology only (DR-1) versus DR-2 (sequencing reflexology to meditative practices).Adding the other therapy for nonresponders after 4 weeks may not be warranted.",1,1,0,0
34582263,"A Randomized Controlled Trial Using Automated Technology for Improving Ototoxicity Monitoring in VA Oncology Patients.Purpose Determine the efficacy of ototoxicity monitoring (OM) administered as automated protocols with the Oto-ID mobile audiometer (automated ototoxicity monitoring [A-OM]), compared with usual care (UC) OM in cancer patients receiving cisplatin.Method Participants were patients (n = 46, mean age 64.7 years; range: 30-78 years) receiving cisplatin-based chemotherapy at the Department of Veterans Affairs Portland Health Care System.A randomized controlled trial contrasted A-OM and UC at up to three program evaluations (PEs) conducted by the study audiologist who was blinded to arm through PE1.PE1 occurred before randomization or oncology treatment; PE2 and PE3 occurred during and/or after treatment at 35 and 365 days postrandomization.The A-OM group (n = 24) used Oto-ID to screen their hearing before each cisplatin dose.Oto-ID results were sent to the study audiologist for interpretation, follow-up, and care coordination.The UC group (n = 22) received a consult for OM services through the audiology clinic.Outcomes included hearing shift near each patient's high-frequency hearing limit, revised hearing-handicap inventory score, and survival time from the start of treatment.Adherence to OM protocols, patients' use of aural rehabilitation services, and oncologists' treatment decisions were also examined.Results Ototoxicity was identified at a high overall rate (46% and 76% at 35 and 365 days, respectively, postrandomization).Adherence to monitoring prior to each cisplatin dose was 83.3% for those randomized to A-OM compared with 4.5% for UC.Randomization to A-OM was not associated with reduced ototoxic hearing shifts or self-reported hearing handicap relative to UC; neither did it compromise participants' survival.Half of participants in each arm accessed aural rehabilitation services.One in each arm had a documented ototoxicity-related cisplatin dose reduction.Conclusions Auditory impairment was an actionable concern for the participants and their oncology providers.A dedicated surveillance program using the Oto-ID's automated protocols improved adherence to OM recommendations over a traditional UC service delivery model.Supplemental Material https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.16649602.",1,1,0,0
34582670,"Long-Term Outcomes and Sites of Failure in Locally Advanced, Cervical Cancer Patients Treated by Concurrent Chemoradiation with or without Adjuvant Chemotherapy: ACTLACC Trial.OBJECTIVES: To evaluate sites of failure and long-term survival outcomes of locally advanced stage cervical cancer patients who had standard concurrent chemo-radiation (CCRT) versus those along with adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) after CCRT.METHODS: Patients aged 18-70 years who had FIGO stage IIB-IVA without para-aortic lymph node enlargement (excluding by International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) 2018 stage IIIC2r), The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scores 0-2, and non-aggressive histopathology were randomized to have CCRT with weekly cisplatin followed by observation (arm A) or ACT with paclitaxel plus carboplatin every 4 weeks for 3 cycles (arm B).RESULTS: From 2015-2017, 259 patients were evaluated.The majority of patients were in stage II and had squamous cell carcinoma with a median tumor size of 5 cm.After the median follow-up of 40.87 months, 17.1% of the patients in arm A and 12.3% of the patients in arm B experienced recurrences (p=0.280).Adding all events of failure (persistence/progression/recurrence), treatment failures tended to be lower in arm A than in arm B: 13.2 versus 21.5 % for loco-regional failure (p = 0.076) and 3.9 versus 6.9% for loco-regional failure and systemic failure (p = 0.278).On the other hand, systemic failure tended to be higher in arm A than in arm B: 13.2% versus 6.9% (p =0.094).The 5-year progression-free survival and 5-year overall survival of patients in both arms were not significantly different.CONCLUSIONS: ACT with paclitaxel plus carboplatin after CCRT did not improve response or survival of patients compared to CCRT alone.Although systemic failure tended to be lower in patients who had ACT after CCRT than those who had only CCRT, loco-regional failure with or without systemic failure tended to be higher.However, all of these differences were not statistically significant.",1,1,1,0
