25057173,"EGFR biomarkers predict benefit from vandetanib in combination with docetaxel in a randomized phase III study of second-line treatment of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.BACKGROUND: ZODIAC was a randomized phase III study of second-line treatment in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that evaluated the addition of vandetanib to docetaxel.The study showed a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival and objective response rate, but not in overall survival for unselected patients.This study evaluated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutation, copy number gain, and protein expression, and KRAS gene mutation, in pretreatment tumor samples as potential biomarkers predicting benefit from vandetanib as second-line treatment of NSCLC.PATIENTS AND METHODS: After progression following first-line chemotherapy, 1391 patients with locally advanced or metastatic (stage IIIB/IV) NSCLC were randomized 1 : 1 to receive vandetanib (100 mg/day) plus docetaxel (75 mg/m(2) every 21 days) or placebo plus docetaxel in the ZODIAC study.Archival tumor samples (n = 570) were collected from consenting patients (n = 958) for predefined, prospective biomarker analyses.RESULTS: Of evaluable samples, 14% were EGFR mutation positive, 35% were EGFR FISH positive, 88% were EGFR protein expression positive, and 13% were KRAS mutation positive.Compared with the overall study population, in which progression-free survival (PFS) [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.79] but not OS (HR = 0.91) were significantly improved with vandetanib, there was greater relative clinical benefit for patients with EGFR mutation-positive tumors [PFS HR 0.51, confidence interval (CI) 0.25-1.06 and OS HR 0.46, CI 0.14-1.57] and EGFR FISH-positive tumors (PFS HR 0.61, CI 0.39-0.94 and OS HR 0.48, CI 0.28-0.84).Similarly, patients with EGFR mutation or FISH-positive tumor samples who received vandetanib had an increased chance of objective tumor response (odds ratios 3.34, CI 0.8-13.89, and 3.90, CI 1.02-14.82, respectively).There did not appear to be benefit for vandetanib in patients with KRAS mutation-positive tumors.CONCLUSIONS: High EGFR gene copy number or activating EGFR mutations may identify patient subgroups who receive increased clinical benefit from vandetanib in combination with docetaxel in second-line NSCLC.CLINICALTRIALSGOV: NCT00312377.",1,1,1,1
22473163,"Multicenter randomized phase II clinical trial comparing neoadjuvant oxaliplatin, capecitabine, and preoperative radiotherapy with or without cetuximab followed by total mesorectal excision in patients with high-risk rectal cancer (EXPERT-C).PURPOSE: To evaluate the addition of cetuximab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy before chemoradiotherapy in high-risk rectal cancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with operable magnetic resonance imaging-defined high-risk rectal cancer received four cycles of capecitabine/oxaliplatin (CAPOX) followed by capecitabine chemoradiotherapy, surgery, and adjuvant CAPOX (four cycles) or the same regimen plus weekly cetuximab (CAPOX+C).The primary end point was complete response (CR; pathologic CR or, in patients not undergoing surgery, radiologic CR) in patients with KRAS/BRAF wild-type tumors.Secondary end points were radiologic response (RR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety in the wild-type and overall populations and a molecular biomarker analysis.RESULTS: One hundred sixty-five eligible patients were randomly assigned.Ninety (60%) of 149 assessable tumors were KRAS or BRAF wild type (CAPOX, n = 44; CAPOX+C, n = 46), and in these patients, the addition of cetuximab did not improve the primary end point of CR (9% v 11%, respectively; P = 1.0; odds ratio, 1.22) or PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.65; P = .363).Cetuximab significantly improved RR (CAPOX v CAPOX+C: after chemotherapy, 51% v 71%, respectively; P = .038; after chemoradiation, 75% v 93%, respectively; P = .028) and OS (HR, 0.27; P = .034).Skin toxicity and diarrhea were more frequent in the CAPOX+C arm.CONCLUSION: Cetuximab led to a significant increase in RR and OS in patients with KRAS/BRAF wild-type rectal cancer, but the primary end point of improved CR was not met.",1,1,1,1
24989892,"Association studies of Fcgamma receptor polymorphisms with outcome in HER2+ breast cancer patients treated with trastuzumab in NCCTG (Alliance) Trial N9831.Patients with HER2+ breast cancer treated with trastuzumab and chemotherapy have superior survival compared with patients treated with chemotherapy alone.Polymorphisms within FCGR2A and FCGR3A are associated with binding affinity of natural killer cells to the IgG1 portion of trastuzumab, and a polymorphism in FCGR2B (I232T) is associated with impaired regulatory activity.The association of these polymorphisms with clinical response among trastuzumab-treated patients is equivocal, with both positive and negative associations.We performed genotyping analysis on the FCGR3A V158F, FCGR2A R131H, and FCGR2B I232T polymorphisms in 1,325 patients from the N9831 clinical trial.Patients in arm A (N = 419) received chemotherapy only.Patients in arms B (N = 469) and C (N = 437) were treated with chemotherapy and trastuzumab (sequentially in arm B and concurrently in arm C).Using log-rank test and Cox proportional hazard models, we compared disease-free survival (DFS) among genotypic groups within pooled arms B/C. We found no differences in DFS between trastuzumab-treated patients who had the FCGR3A 158 V/V and/or FCGR2A 131 H/H high-affinity genotypes and patients without those genotypes.Furthermore, there was no significant interaction between FCGR3A and FCGR2A and treatment.However, there was a difference in DFS for FCGR2B I232T, with I/I patients deriving benefit from trastuzumab (P < 0.001), compared with the T carriers who did not (P = 0.81).The interaction between FCGR2B genotype and treatment was statistically significant (P = 0.03).Our analysis did not reveal an association between FcgammaR high-affinity genotypes and outcomes.However, it seems that the FCGR2B inhibitory gene may be predictive of adjuvant trastuzumab benefit.",0,0,0,0
23388205,"A preliminary exploration of the feasibility of offering men information about potential prostate cancer treatment options before they know their biopsy results.BACKGROUND: A small pre-test study was conducted to ascertain potential harm and anxiety associated with distributing information about possible cancer treatment options at the time of biopsy, prior to knowledge about a definitive cancer diagnosis.Priming men about the availability of multiple options before they have a confirmed diagnosis may be an opportunity to engage patients in more informed decision-making.METHODS: Men with an elevated PSA test or suspicious Digital Rectal Examination (DRE) who were referred to a urology clinic for a biopsy were randomized to receive either the clinic's usual care (UC) biopsy instruction sheet (n = 11) or a pre-biopsy educational (ED) packet containing the biopsy instruction sheet along with a booklet about the biopsy procedure and a prostate cancer treatment decision aid originally written for newly diagnosed men that described in detail possible treatment options (n = 18).RESULTS: A total of 62% of men who were approached agreed to be randomized, and 83% of the ED group confirmed they used the materials.Anxiety scores were similar for both groups while awaiting the biopsy procedure, with anxiety scores trending lower in the ED group: 41.2 on a prostate-specific anxiety instrument compared to 51.7 in the UC group (p = 0.13).ED participants reported better overall quality of life while awaiting biopsy compared to the UC group (76.4 vs. 48.5, p = 0.01).The small number of men in the ED group who went on to be diagnosed with cancer reported being better informed about the risks and side effects of each option compared to men diagnosed with cancer in the UC group (p = 0.07).In qualitative discussions, men generally reported they found the pre-biopsy materials to be helpful and indicated having information about possible treatment options reduced their anxiety.However, 2 of 18 men reported they did not want to think about treatment options until after they knew their biopsy results.CONCLUSIONS: In this small sample offering pre-biopsy education about potential treatment options was generally well received by patients, appeared to be beneficial to men who went on to be diagnosed, and did not appear to increase anxiety unnecessarily among those who had a negative biopsy.",0,0,0,0
21996087,"RT-PCR versus immunohistochemistry for correlation and quantification of ERCC1, BRCA1, TUBB3 and RRM1 in NSCLC.BACKGROUND: Customized chemotherapy is increasingly used in the management of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).However, the most reliable methodology to determine biomarker status is neither fully elucidated nor agreed upon.Accordingly, we evaluated the predictive efficiency of qRT-PCR and immunohistochemical analysis (IHC) on excision cross complementation group 1 (ERCC1), breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 (BRCA1), ribonucleotide reductase subunit M1 (RRM1) and class III beta-tubulin (TUBB3).PATIENTS AND METHODS: IHC and qRT-PCR on ERCC1, BRCA1, RRM1 and TUBB3 were performed on surgically resected tissue samples from NSCLC-patients included in a randomized trial.The median values of the biomarker expression dichotomized the population and were correlated to clinical endpoints.RESULTS: Representative tissue samples from 33 patients showed no significant correlations between mRNA and protein expression.Predictive impact was demonstrated for all four biomarkers, when assessed by IHC, and reached significance for overall survival in patients with ERCC1-negative (14.3 vs. 8.5 months, p=0.018) and TUBB3-negative (18.5 vs. 11.10, p=0.027) tumours, while this was not the case for qRT-PCR.CONCLUSIONS: IHC discriminated more effectively than qRT-PCR across four NSCLC-relevant biomarkers.The findings are further supported by the demonstrated lack of correlation between transcript and protein.",0,0,0,0
24960402,"A phase IIa dose-finding and safety study of first-line pertuzumab in combination with trastuzumab, capecitabine and cisplatin in patients with HER2-positive advanced gastric cancer.BACKGROUND: Pertuzumab plus trastuzumab provides a more comprehensive blockade of HER2 signalling than trastuzumab alone.Therefore, we conducted a phase IIa study of the pharmacokinetics and safety of pertuzumab plus trastuzumab and chemotherapy in advanced gastric cancer (aGC).METHODS: Patients received pertuzumab 840 mg for cycle 1 and 420 mg q3w for cycles 2-6 (Arm A) or pertuzumab 840 mg q3w for six cycles (Arm B).Trastuzumab, cisplatin and capecitabine were also given for six cycles, then trastuzumab q3w until disease progression or unmanageable toxicity.The co-primary endpoints were day 43 pertuzumab serum trough concentration (Cmin) and safety.RESULTS: Thirty patients were randomised.Mean pertuzumab Cmin at day 43 was 40.0 mug ml(-1) (s.d.: 17.3) in Arm A and 62.7 mug ml(-1) (29.1) in Arm B. Mean day 43 Cmin in Arm A was ~37% lower than that seen in metastatic breast cancer.The safety profiles were similar between arms and treatment was well tolerated.Partial responses were achieved by 86% and 55% of patients in Arms A and B, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the pharmacokinetic and safety data, the 840 mg q3w pertuzumab dose has been selected for a phase III study of pertuzumab, trastuzumab and chemotherapy in HER2-positive aGC.",1,1,1,1
23559149,"FOLFOX4 plus cetuximab administered weekly or every second week in the first-line treatment of patients with KRAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer: a randomized phase II CECOG study.BACKGROUND: This randomized phase II study investigated first-line chemotherapy plus cetuximab administered every second week in KRAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients received FOLFOX4 plus either standard weekly cetuximab (arm 1) or cetuximab (500 mg/m(2)) every second week (arm 2), until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.Primary end point was the objective response rate (ORR).Progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), disease control rate (DCR) and safety were also investigated.The study was not powered to establish non-inferiority, but aimed at the estimation of treatment differences.RESULTS: Of 152 randomized eligible patients, 75 were treated in arm 1 and 77 in arm 2; ORRs [53% versus 62%, odds ratio 1.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74-2.66], PFS [median 9.5 versus 9.2 months, hazard ratio (HR) 0.92, 95% CI 0.63-1.34], OS (median 25.8 versus 23.0 months, HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.56-1.30) and DCR (87%) were comparable.HRs adjusted for baseline factors were 1.01 and 0.99 for PFS and OS, respectively.Frequencies of grade 3/4 adverse events in arms 1 versus 2 were similar: most common were neutropenia (28% versus 34%) and rash (15% versus 17%).CONCLUSIONS: Activity and safety of FOLFOX4 plus either cetuximab administered weekly or every second week were similar.",1,1,1,1

24129868,"Effect of a web-based curriculum on primary care practice: basic skin cancer triage trial.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Primary care physicians (PCPs) are uniquely positioned to detect melanoma.Effective educational interventions targeted at PCPs may improve early melanoma detection.A previous in-person Basic Skin Cancer Triage (BSCT) 2-hour course demonstrated significant short-term improvement in provider practices, attitudes, ability, confidence, and knowledge.We conducted a randomized trial to test the efficacy of the BSCT course implemented as a web-based learning program, compared to a similar (control) web-based course on weight assessment.METHODS: We recruited a sample of 57 PCPs and 3,341 of their patients from four geographically diverse centers.Skin cancer control activities by PCPs were assessed by physician survey and by chart review and patient telephone interview about their recent visit to their PCP at baseline and at 1--2 months and 12 months after course completion.RESULTS: Some effect of intervention on skin cancer parameters was self-reported by physicians; this was not confirmed by patient survey or chart-extracted data.Rates of skin cancer control practices by PCPs were low across both groups before and after intervention.The positive changes in physician-reported behaviors (total body skin examination [TBSE]), intentions (discuss skin cancer detection), confidence (performing TBSE), office practices, and knowledge (58% skin versus 49% control) were neither matched by differences in practice reported by their patients, nor persisted in a longer term follow-up, hence may be attributable to physician recall bias due to the experience of the course or desire to please study investigators and were less dramatic as compared to our previously reported in-person BSCT intervention.Thus this approach by itself appears unlikely to result in improved PCP handling of skin cancer issues.CONCLUSIONS: Given previous success with our in-person course, the features required to make WBL a more effective tool for medical education must be further explored.",0,0,0,0
23871490,"2 years versus 1 year of adjuvant trastuzumab for HER2-positive breast cancer (HERA): an open-label, randomised controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Trastuzumab has established efficacy against breast cancer with overexpression or amplification of the HER2 oncogene.The standard of care is 1 year of adjuvant trastuzumab, but the optimum duration of treatment is unknown.We compared 2 years of treatment with trastuzumab with 1 year of treatment, and updated the comparison of 1 year of trastuzumab versus observation at a median follow-up of 8 years, for patients enrolled in the HERceptin Adjuvant (HERA) trial.METHODS: The HERA trial is an international, multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial comparing treatment with trastuzumab for 1 and 2 years with observation after standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy, adjuvant chemotherapy, or both in 5102 patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer.The primary endpoint was disease-free survival.The comparison of 2 years versus 1 year of trastuzumab treatment involved a landmark analysis of 3105 patients who were disease-free 12 months after randomisation to one of the trastuzumab groups, and was planned after observing at least 725 disease-free survival events.The updated intention-to-treat comparison of 1 year trastuzumab treatment versus observation alone in 3399 patients at a median follow-up of 8 years (range 0-10) is also reported.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00045032.FINDINGS: We recorded 367 events of disease-free survival in 1552 patients in the 1 year group and 367 events in 1553 patients in the 2 year group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.99, 95% CI 0.85-1.14, p=0.86).Grade 3-4 adverse events and decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction during treatment were reported more frequently in the 2 year treatment group than in the 1 year group (342 [20.4%] vs 275 [16.3%] grade 3-4 adverse events, and 120 [7.2%] vs 69 [4.1%] decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction, respectively).HRs for a comparison of 1 year of trastuzumab treatment versus observation were 0.76 (95% CI 0.67-0.86, p<0.0001) for disease-free survival and 0.76 (0.65-0.88, p=0.0005) for overall survival, despite crossover of 884 (52%) patients from the observation group to trastuzumab therapy.INTERPRETATION: 2 years of adjuvant trastuzumab is not more effective than is 1 year of treatment for patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer.1 year of treatment provides a significant disease-free and overall survival benefit compared with observation and remains the standard of care.FUNDING: F Hoffmann-La Roche (Roche).",1,1,1,1

And the secondary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR) and overall survival (OS).RESULTS: They were randomized into gefitinib arm (n = 25) and paclitaxel/carboplatin arm (n = 26).The median PFS was 4.2 months in gefitinib arm and 8.3 months in paclitaxel/carboplatin arm (P = 0.422); ORR 36.0% in gefitinib arm and 42.3% in paclitaxel/carboplatin arm (P = 0.645); Median OS 14.4 months in gefitinib arm and 15.0 months in paclitaxel/carboplatin arm (P = 0.290).Multifactorial Cox regression analysis showed that age (P = 0.004), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutation status (P = 0.012) and subsequent treatments (platinum-based chemotherapy, P = 0.001; EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), P = 0.005) were the significant predictors of OS.CONCLUSIONS: No significant differences exist in terms of efficacy and survival between first-line gefitinib and paclitaxel/carboplatin for Chinese patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma who are non-smokers or former light smokers.And age, EGFR gene mutation status and subsequent treatments are significant predictor of OS.However, first-line gefitinib should not be recommended for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients only based on clinical factors, due to a very small sample-size in our study.",1,1,1,1
22390720,"Value of immediate second resection of the tumor bed to improve the effectiveness of transurethral resection of bladder tumor.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Current guidelines recommend routine second transurethral resection (TUR) for accurate diagnosis and to prevent understaging of muscle-invasive bladder cancer.We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of immediate second resection of the tumor bed during initial TUR and its prognostic significance.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients (n=126) undergoing TUR were prospectively randomized to undergo (n=63) or not undergo (n=63) immediate second resection of the tumor bed after complete TUR.Second resection was repeated until muscularis propria (MP) was identified in the specimen and the depth of tumor invasion was inspected.The results of second resection were compared with final pathology results for diagnostic accuracy.Recurrence and progression rates were compared in the two groups, and factors affecting recurrence were evaluated.RESULTS: Patient age, sex distribution, number of tumors, pathologic T stage and grade were similar in the groups.MP was included in all TUR specimens in the immediate second resection group, compared with 41 of 63 (65.1%) in the nonsecond resection group.The concordance rate of second resection with final pathology was r=0.810 (P<0.01).The sensitivity and specificity of second resection for T(2) disease were 90.9% and 98.0%, respectively, and the positive and negative predictive values of second resection for T(2) disease were 90.0% and 96.2%, respectively.Among the 94 patients followed up, those in the second resection group had significantly higher 2-year recurrence-free survival rate (77.0% vs 45.8%, P=0.025), but there was no difference in progression-free survival rate.CONCLUSIONS: Immediate second resection of the tumor bed after complete TUR improves the effectiveness of resection by immediately confirming the presence of MP in the specimen and accurately differentiating muscle-invasive disease.The advantages of immediate second resection were precise prediction of final pathology results and reduced early recurrence.",0,0,0,0
25547902,"Intercalated Dosing Schedule of Erlotinib and Docetaxel as a Therapeutic Strategy to Avoid Antagonism and Optimize Its Benefits in Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer. A Randomized Phase II Clinical Trial.INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to assess whether an intercalated dosing schedule of erlotinib and docetaxel could avoid possible negative interactions and optimize the benefit obtained as second-line therapy in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A phase II randomized clinical trial was designed for advanced NSCLC patients in whom previous chemotherapy treatment had failed.The experimental arm with 33 patients consisted of erlotinib 150 mg/d orally, intermittent administration on days 2 to 16 every 21 days, combined with docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) every 21 days; the control arm with 35 patients consisted of erlotinib 150 mg/d orally, administered continuously.The study's primary end point was the proportion of patients who remained progression-free at 6 months in the 2 arms.RESULTS: The proportion of patients who remained progression-free at 6 months was of 5 patients (15%) in the intercalated arm and 3 patients (9%) in the erlotinib monotherapy arm respectively.Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 3.0 versus 2.1 months (hazard ratio [HR], 0.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.39-1.06; P = .086).Median overall survival (OS) was 7.5 and 5.2 months (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.41-1.19; P = .19).Disease control rates were 51.7% and 36.4%, respectively.No new safety signals were observed.CONCLUSION: Erlotinib and docetaxel with intermittent administration of erlotinib improved PFS, OS, and disease control rates compared with erlotinib alone.All of our results indicated that an intercalated dosing schedule of erlotinib and docetaxel could be more efficient than erlotinib treatment alone.Therefore, further studies should be developed in a larger number of patients.This study has shown the absence of antagonism between docetaxel and erlotinib when given in an intercalated fashion.",0,0,0,0

25582141,"Prognostic factors of survival in a randomized phase III trial (MPACT) of weekly nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine versus gemcitabine alone in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.BACKGROUND: nab-Paclitaxel in combination with gemcitabine has emerged as a new treatment option for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer (MPC), based on superiority over gemcitabine demonstrated in the phase III MPACT trial.Previously, Karnofsky performance status (KPS) score and the presence of liver metastases were shown to be predictive of survival with nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine treatment.This analysis sought to further explore the relationship between clinical characteristics and survival in the MPACT trial and to identify potential predictors of overall survival and progression-free survival in patients with MPC.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cox regression models adjusted for stratification factors and a stepwise multivariate analysis of prespecified baseline prognostic factors were performed.RESULTS: Treatment effect was significantly associated with survival, with a similar magnitude of reduction in risk of death compared with the previously reported primary analysis.Treatment effect consistently favored nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine across the majority of the prespecified factors.In addition to KPS score and presence of liver metastases, age and number of metastatic sites were independent prognostic factors of overall and progression-free survival.Baseline carbohydrate antigen 19-9 was not found to be an independent prognostic factor of survival in this analysis.CONCLUSION: The results of this analysis confirm broad utility of nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine for the treatment of MPC.In addition, these findings suggest that KPS score, presence of liver metastases, age, and number of metastatic sites are important predictors of survival that may be useful when making treatment decisions and designing future clinical trials.",0,0,0,0
22488038,"Prediction of overall survival through circadian rest-activity monitoring during chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer.The clinical relevance of circadian rhythm modifications in patients on chemotherapy is unknown.Even so, circadian parameter I<O before chemotherapy independently predicted overall survival.This study investigates the relevance of I<O measured during chemotherapy for survival and symptoms.The circadian rest-activity pattern was monitored for 3 days using a wristwatch actigraph while 77 patients were receiving a chemotherapy course within an international randomized Phase III trial.Treatment consisted of first-line chronomodulated or conventional delivery of 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin and oxaliplatin for metastatic colorectal cancer.I<O was computed as the percentage of minutes of activity counts in bed which were below the median of activity out of bed.Circadian disruption was defined by I<O equal to or less than 97.5%.Circadian disruption occurred in 39 patients (51%) on chemotherapy.It was associated with a significantly shorter overall survival, independently of other prognostic factors (multivariate Hazard Ratio: 2.12; p = 0.004).The median survival of patients with a robust circadian rhythm was 22.3 months as compared to 14.7 months in those with circadian disruption during chemotherapy.No toxicity was significantly associated with circadian disruption, but the incidence of grade >/= 2 fatigue and of body weight loss >/= 5% was two and threefold higher, respectively, in patients with disrupted circadian rhythm on chemotherapy.Chemotherapy disrupted circadian activity rhythm in nearly 50% of the patients.Circadian disruption on chemotherapy predicted for shorter overall survival.The prevention of chemotherapy-induced circadian disruption might reduce toxicity and improve efficacy in cancer patients.",0,0,0,0

(600 mg/m(2) day 1-28 of a 56-day cycle) for a maximum of 12 cycles (i.v.) or 12 months (p.o.).Indecisive patients were randomized.Toxicity was evaluated according to the NCI-CTC version 2.0.RESULTS: Twenty-five of 51 recruited patients completed therapy at the time of the planned interim analysis (median age, 75 years; range, 70-82).Median ECOG was 1, and median number of prior chemotherapy regimens was 2.A median number of 4 cycles (range, 1-12) were administered per patient.Anemia was the most common hematological toxicity (88 % of patients).Most frequent non-hematological toxicities were nausea (76 %), constipation (68 %), and fatigue (64 %).CONCLUSION: Treatment was generally well tolerated despite the fact that most patients suffered from multiple comorbidities and were heavily pretreated.There were no unexpected hematological or non-hematological toxicities.Based on this safety analysis, the next step of study recruitment was continued.",0,0,0,0
22494567,"Efficacy and safety of maintenance erlotinib in Asian patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer: a subanalysis of the phase III, randomized SATURN study.Maintenance therapy, commenced immediately after the completion of first-line chemotherapy, is a promising strategy for improving treatment outcomes in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).The global phase III SequentiAl Tarceva in UnResectable NSCLC (SATURN) study evaluated the efficacy and safety of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine-kinase inhibitor erlotinib as maintenance treatment in NSCLC patients without progression after first-line chemotherapy.We report a retrospective subanalysis of Asian patients enrolled in SATURN.Patients with advanced NSCLC with no evidence of progression after four cycles of chemotherapy were randomized to receive erlotinib 150 mg/day or placebo, until progressive disease or limiting toxicity.The co-primary endpoints of SATURN were progression-free survival (PFS) in all patients and in those with positive EGFR immunohistochemistry (IHC) status.Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), disease control rate, safety, quality of life (QoL) and biomarker analyses.In total, 126 patients from East and South-East Asian centers were randomized (14% of the intent-to-treat population): 88 from Korea, 28 from China and 10 from Malaysia; one patient was excluded from this analysis due to Indian ethnicity.PFS was significantly prolonged in the erlotinib treatment arm, both overall (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.57; p=0.0067) and in patients with EGFR IHC-positive disease (HR=0.50; p=0.0057).There was a trend towards an increase in OS, which reached statistical significance in the EGFR IHC-positive subgroup (p=0.0233).The overall response rate was significantly higher with erlotinib compared with placebo (24% versus 5%; p=0.0025).Erlotinib was generally well tolerated and had no negative impact on QoL in this subpopulation.The most common treatment-related adverse events were rash, diarrhea and pruritus.Erlotinib was effective and well tolerated in Asian patients, producing benefits consistent with those observed in the overall SATURN population.Maintenance treatment with erlotinib appears to be a useful option for the management of Asian patients with advanced NSCLC without progression after first-line chemotherapy.",1,1,1,1

23261355,"Risk of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia during follow-up in HPV-positive women according to baseline p16-INK4A results: a prospective analysis of a nested substudy of the NTCC randomised controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Immunostaining for p16-INK4A (henceforth p16) is a sensitive and specific method for detection of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) in women infected with human papillomavirus (HPV), but longitudinal data have not been obtained.We investigated the relation between p16 status and risk of CIN during 3 years of follow-up.METHODS: Women aged 25-60 years were enrolled between June 10, 2003, and Dec 31, 2004, in a multicentre randomised trial comparing HPV testing with cytology.HPV-positive women were referred for colposcopy and, in seven of nine centres, were tested for p16 overexpression by immunostaining.If no CIN was detected, these women were followed up at yearly intervals until clearance of HPV infection.The primary endpoint was histologically confirmed CIN of grade 2 or worse (CIN of grade 2 [CIN2], CIN of grade 3 [CIN3], or invasive cervical cancer) at recruitment or during follow-up.We calculated the absolute and relative risks by p16 status at recruitment.We also calculated the longitudinal sensitivity of p16 testing.Additionally, we assessed the relative sensitivity of an alternative strategy (referral to colposcopy and follow-up of only HPV-positive, p16-positive women) versus conventional cytology in two age groups.Percentages were weighted by the inverse of the tested fraction.The trial in which this study is nested is registered, number ISRCTN81678807.FINDINGS: Of 1042 HPV-positive women who were tested for p16 with no CIN detected during the first round of screening, 944 (91%) had further HPV tests.793 (84%) of these 944 were followed up until detection of CIN2 or worse, HPV infection clearance, or for at least 3 years.CIN2 or worse was detected during follow-up in more p16-positive women (31 of 365, 8.8% [95% CI 5.8-11.8]) than in p16-negative women (17 of 579, 3.7% [1.9-5.4]; relative risk [RR] 2.61 [95% CI 1.49-4.59]).RR was higher in women aged 35-60 years at recruitment (3.37 [1.39-8.15]) than in those aged 25-34 years (2.15 [1.00-4.61]), but age was not a significant modifier.CIN3 or worse was detected during follow-up in more p16-positive women (16 of 365, 4.4% [2.3-6.6]) than in p16-negative women (six of 579, 1.3% [0.2-2.3]; RR 3.90 [95% CI 1.57-9.68]).Longitudinal sensitivity of p16 testing for detection of CIN3 or worse during follow-up at all ages was 77.8% (95% CI 63.9-91.6).The relative sensitivity of the alternative strategy compared with conventional cytology was 2.08 (1.13-3.56) in women aged 35-60 years and 2.86 (1.28-5.36) in those aged 25-34 years.HPV-positive, p16-negative women aged 35-60 years had a higher cumulative risk of CIN3 or worse during recruitment or follow-up (2.0%, 95% CI 0.3-3.7) than did HPV-negative women (0.01%, 0-0.04) or those who were cytologically normal (0.04%, 0.02-0.09) at recruitment.INTERPRETATION: p16 overexpression is a marker for CIN2 or worse or for development of CIN2 or worse within 3 years in HPV-positive women, especially those aged 35-60 years.HPV-positive, p16-positive women need immediate colposcopy and, if the assessment is negative, annual follow-up.Immediate colposcopy can be avoided in HPV-positive, p16-negative women, who can be safely managed with repeat screening after 2-3 year intervals.FUNDING: European Union; Italian Ministry of Health; Regional Health Administrations of Piemonte, Tuscany, Veneto and Emilia Romagna; and Public Health Agency of Lazio Region.",0,0,0,0

24435414,"Long term duration of protective effect for HPV negative women: follow-up of primary HPV screening randomised controlled trial.OBJECTIVES: To assess whether the increased sensitivity of screening for human papillomavirus (HPV) may represent overdiagnosis and to compare the long term duration of protective effect against cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CIN2+) in HPV based and cytology based screening.DESIGN: 13 year follow-up of the Swedescreen randomised controlled trial of primary HPV screening.SETTING: Organised cervical screening programme in Sweden.PARTICIPANTS: 12,527 women aged 32-38 attending organised screening were enrolled and randomised to HPV and cytology double testing (intervention arm, n=6257) or to cytology only, with samples frozen for future HPV testing (control arm, n=6270).MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cumulative incidence of CIN2+ and CIN3+ (Kaplan Meier curves).Longitudinal test characteristics were calculated for cytology only, HPV testing only, and cytology and HPV testing combined, adjusting for censoring.RESULTS: The increased detection of CIN2+ in the intervention arm decreased over time.After six years, the cumulative incidence of CIN3+ was similar in both trial arms, and after 11 years the cumulative incidence of CIN2+ became similar in both arms.The longitudinal sensitivity of cytology for CIN2+ in the control arm at three years was similar to the sensitivity of HPV testing in the intervention arm at five years of follow-up: 85.94% (95% confidence interval 76.85% to 91.84%) v 86.40% (79.21% to 91.37%).The sensitivity of HPV screening for CIN3+after five years was 89.34% (80.10% to 94.58%) and for cytology after three years was 92.02% (80.59% to 96.97%).CONCLUSIONS: Over long term follow-up, the cumulative incidence of CIN2+ was the same for HPV screening and for cytology, implying that the increased sensitivity of HPV screening for CIN2+ reflects earlier detection rather than overdiagnosis.The low long term risks of CIN3+ among women who tested negative in HPV screening, support screening intervals of five years for such women.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00479375.",0,0,0,0
25057173,"EGFR biomarkers predict benefit from vandetanib in combination with docetaxel in a randomized phase III study of second-line treatment of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.BACKGROUND: ZODIAC was a randomized phase III study of second-line treatment in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that evaluated the addition of vandetanib to docetaxel.The study showed a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival and objective response rate, but not in overall survival for unselected patients.This study evaluated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutation, copy number gain, and protein expression, and KRAS gene mutation, in pretreatment tumor samples as potential biomarkers predicting benefit from vandetanib as second-line treatment of NSCLC.PATIENTS AND METHODS: After progression following first-line chemotherapy, 1391 patients with locally advanced or metastatic (stage IIIB/IV) NSCLC were randomized 1 : 1 to receive vandetanib (100 mg/day) plus docetaxel (75 mg/m(2) every 21 days) or placebo plus docetaxel in the ZODIAC study.Archival tumor samples (n = 570) were collected from consenting patients (n = 958) for predefined, prospective biomarker analyses.RESULTS: Of evaluable samples, 14% were EGFR mutation positive, 35% were EGFR FISH positive, 88% were EGFR protein expression positive, and 13% were KRAS mutation positive.Compared with the overall study population, in which progression-free survival (PFS) [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.79] but not OS (HR = 0.91) were significantly improved with vandetanib, there was greater relative clinical benefit for patients with EGFR mutation-positive tumors [PFS HR 0.51, confidence interval (CI) 0.25-1.06 and OS HR 0.46, CI 0.14-1.57] and EGFR FISH-positive tumors (PFS HR 0.61, CI 0.39-0.94 and OS HR 0.48, CI 0.28-0.84).Similarly, patients with EGFR mutation or FISH-positive tumor samples who received vandetanib had an increased chance of objective tumor response (odds ratios 3.34, CI 0.8-13.89, and 3.90, CI 1.02-14.82, respectively).There did not appear to be benefit for vandetanib in patients with KRAS mutation-positive tumors.CONCLUSIONS: High EGFR gene copy number or activating EGFR mutations may identify patient subgroups who receive increased clinical benefit from vandetanib in combination with docetaxel in second-line NSCLC.CLINICALTRIALSGOV: NCT00312377.",1,1,1,1
23021996,"The REDUCE Follow-Up Study: low rate of new prostate cancer diagnoses observed during a 2-year, observational, followup study of men who participated in the REDUCE trial.PURPOSE: The primary objective of the REDUCE (REduction by DUtasteride of prostate Cancer Events) Follow-Up Study was to collect data on the occurrence of newly diagnosed prostate cancers for 2 years beyond the 4-year REDUCE study.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The 4-year REDUCE study evaluated prostate cancer risk reduction in men taking dutasteride.This 2-year observational study followed men from REDUCE with a clinic visit shortly after study conclusion and with up to 2 annual telephone calls during which patient reported data were collected regarding prostate cancer events, chronic medication use, prostate specific antigen levels and serious adverse events.No study drug was provided and all biopsies during the 2-year followup were performed for cause.The primary objective was to collect data on the occurrence of new biopsy detectable prostate cancers.Secondary end points included assessment of Gleason score and serious adverse events.RESULTS: A total of 2,751 men enrolled in the followup study with numbers similar to those of the REDUCE former treatment groups (placebo and dutasteride).Few new prostate cancers were detected during the 2-year followup period in either former treatment group.A greater number of cancers were detected in the former dutasteride group than in the former placebo group (14 vs 7 cases).No Gleason score 8-10 prostate cancers were detected in either former treatment group based on central pathology review.No new safety issues were identified during the study.CONCLUSIONS: Two years of followup of the REDUCE study cohort demonstrated a low rate of new prostate cancer diagnoses in the former placebo and dutasteride treated groups.No new Gleason 8-10 cancers were detected.",0,0,0,0
24150234,"Abiraterone acetate in combination with prednisone for the treatment of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: U.S. Food and Drug Administration drug approval summary.On December 10, 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted full approval for a modified indication for abiraterone acetate (Zytiga tablets; Janssen Biotech, Inc.) in combination with prednisone for the treatment of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).The approval was based on clinical trial COU-AA-302, which randomly allocated asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients with chemotherapy-naive mCRPC and no visceral metastases to either abiraterone acetate plus prednisone (N = 546) or placebo plus prednisone (N = 542).The coprimary endpoints were radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) and overall survival (OS).The median rPFS was 8.3 months in the placebo arm and had not yet been reached in the abiraterone acetate arm {HR, 0.43 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.35-0.52]; P < 0.0001}. A prespecified interim analysis demonstrated an improvement in OS favoring the abiraterone acetate arm [HR, 0.79 (95% CI, 0.66-0.96)] but did not cross the O'Brien-Fleming boundary for statistical significance.Safety data confirmed the known adverse reaction profile of abiraterone acetate.Full approval was granted on the basis of a large magnitude of effect on rPFS, a favorable trend in OS, and internal consistency across multiple secondary endpoints and exploratory patient-reported pain data.This is the first drug approval for mCRPC to use rPFS as the primary endpoint.Importantly, this approval was granted in the context of a prior statistically significant OS benefit that formed the basis of the original April 28, 2011, approval of abiraterone acetate for patients with mCRPC who had received prior chemotherapy containing docetaxel.",0,0,0,0
