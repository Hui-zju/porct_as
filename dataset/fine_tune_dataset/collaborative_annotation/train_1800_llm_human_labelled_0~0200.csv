22456329,"Endostatin inhibits angiogenesis in hepatocellular carcinoma after transarterial chemoembolization.BACKGROUND/AIMS: This study aims to investigate the influence of endostatin on angiogenesis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after transarterial chemoembolization (TACE).METHODOLOGY: Ninety-five patients with HCC were enrolled.Twenty-six patients received initial liver resection without preoperative TACE (non-TACE), 24 received preoperative TACE without endostatin (TACE), 22 received endostatin (15mg/m2) right after TACE intravenously (TACE-V) and 23 received endostatin (15mg/m2) through the hepatic artery during TACE (TACE-A).TACE was performed using Gemcitabine 1000mg/m2 (emulsified with lipiodol, 10-12mL), cisplatin 40 mg/m2 and 5-fluorouracil 500mg/m2 through the hepatic artery feeding the tumor.Patients received liver resection 4 weeks after second course of TACE.RESULTS: The mean microvessel density (MVD) was 32.23+/-12.71, 57.46+/-18.38, 44.36+/-15.13 and 43.48+/-15.59 in non-TACE, TACE, TACE-V and TACE-A group respectively.The positive rate of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression was 46.15%, 91.67%, 77.27% and 73.91% in non-TACE, TACE, TACE-V and TACE-A groups, respectively.Compared to the non-TACE group, MVD and VEGF expression in TACE, TACE-V and TACE-A groups were significantly higher (p<0.05).MVD and VEGF expression in the TACE-V and TACE-A groups were significantly lower than in the TACE group (p<0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Endostatin could significantly repress angiogenesis in HCC after TACE by down-regulating expression of VEGF.",0,0,0,0
22473163,"Multicenter randomized phase II clinical trial comparing neoadjuvant oxaliplatin, capecitabine, and preoperative radiotherapy with or without cetuximab followed by total mesorectal excision in patients with high-risk rectal cancer (EXPERT-C).PURPOSE: To evaluate the addition of cetuximab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy before chemoradiotherapy in high-risk rectal cancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with operable magnetic resonance imaging-defined high-risk rectal cancer received four cycles of capecitabine/oxaliplatin (CAPOX) followed by capecitabine chemoradiotherapy, surgery, and adjuvant CAPOX (four cycles) or the same regimen plus weekly cetuximab (CAPOX+C).The primary end point was complete response (CR; pathologic CR or, in patients not undergoing surgery, radiologic CR) in patients with KRAS/BRAF wild-type tumors.Secondary end points were radiologic response (RR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety in the wild-type and overall populations and a molecular biomarker analysis.RESULTS: One hundred sixty-five eligible patients were randomly assigned.Ninety (60%) of 149 assessable tumors were KRAS or BRAF wild type (CAPOX, n = 44; CAPOX+C, n = 46), and in these patients, the addition of cetuximab did not improve the primary end point of CR (9% v 11%, respectively; P = 1.0; odds ratio, 1.22) or PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.65; P = .363).Cetuximab significantly improved RR (CAPOX v CAPOX+C: after chemotherapy, 51% v 71%, respectively; P = .038; after chemoradiation, 75% v 93%, respectively; P = .028) and OS (HR, 0.27; P = .034).Skin toxicity and diarrhea were more frequent in the CAPOX+C arm.CONCLUSION: Cetuximab led to a significant increase in RR and OS in patients with KRAS/BRAF wild-type rectal cancer, but the primary end point of improved CR was not met.",1,1,1,1
22565002,"Randomized phase II trial of everolimus in combination with tamoxifen in patients with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative metastatic breast cancer with prior exposure to aromatase inhibitors: a GINECO study.PURPOSE: Cross-talk between signal transduction pathways likely contributes to hormone resistance in metastatic breast cancer (mBC).Everolimus, an oral inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin, has restored sensitivity in endocrine-resistance models and shown anticancer activity in early-phase mBC clinical trials.This analysis evaluated efficacy and safety of everolimus in combination with tamoxifen in patients with mBC resistant to aromatase inhibitors (AIs).PATIENTS AND METHODS: This open-label, phase II study randomly assigned postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative, AI-resistant mBC to tamoxifen 20 mg/d plus everolimus 10 mg/d (n = 54) or tamoxifen 20 mg/d alone (n = 57).Randomization was stratified by primary and secondary hormone resistance.Primary end point was clinical benefit rate (CBR), defined as the percentage of all patients with a complete or partial response or stable disease at 6 months.No formal statistical comparison between groups was planned.RESULTS: The 6-month CBR was 61% (95% CI, 47 to 74) with tamoxifen plus everolimus and 42% (95% CI, 29 to 56) with tamoxifen alone.Time to progression (TTP) increased from 4.5 months with tamoxifen alone to 8.6 months with tamoxifen plus everolimus, corresponding to a 46% reduction in risk of progression with the combination (hazard ratio [HR], 0.54; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.81).Risk of death was reduced by 55% with tamoxifen plus everolimus versus tamoxifen alone (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.24 to 0.81).The main toxicities associated with tamoxifen plus everolimus were fatigue (72% v 53% with tamoxifen alone), stomatitis (56% v 7%), rash (44% v 7%), anorexia (43% v 18%), and diarrhea (39% v 11%).CONCLUSION: This study suggests that tamoxifen plus everolimus increased CBR, TTP, and overall survival compared with tamoxifen alone in postmenopausal women with AI-resistant mBC.",1,1,1,1
22184384,"Phase III trial comparing capecitabine plus cisplatin versus capecitabine plus cisplatin with concurrent capecitabine radiotherapy in completely resected gastric cancer with D2 lymph node dissection: the ARTIST trial.PURPOSE: The ARTIST (Adjuvant Chemoradiation Therapy in Stomach Cancer) trial was the first study to our knowledge to investigate the role of postoperative chemoradiotherapy therapy in patients with curatively resected gastric cancer with D2 lymph node dissection.This trial was designed to compare postoperative treatment with capecitabine plus cisplatin (XP) versus XP plus radiotherapy with capecitabine (XP/XRT/XP).PATIENTS AND METHODS: The XP arm received six cycles of XP (capecitabine 2,000 mg/m2 per day on days 1 to 14 and cisplatin 60 mg/m2 on day 1, repeated every 3 weeks) chemotherapy.The XP/XRT/XP arm received two cycles of XP followed by 45-Gy XRT (capecitabine 1,650 mg/m2 per day for 5 weeks) and two cycles of XP.RESULTS: Of 458 patients, 228 were randomly assigned to the XP arm and 230 to the XP/XRT/XP arm.Treatment was completed as planned by 75.4% of patients (172 of 228) in the XP arm and 81.7% (188 of 230) in the XP/XRT/XP arm.Overall, the addition of XRT to XP chemotherapy did not significantly prolong disease-free survival (DFS; P = .0862).However, in the subgroup of patients with pathologic lymph node metastasis at the time of surgery (n = 396), patients randomly assigned to the XP/XRT/XP arm experienced superior DFS when compared with those who received XP alone (P = .0365), and the statistical significance was retained at multivariate analysis (estimated hazard ratio, 0.6865; 95% CI, 0.4735 to 0.9952; P = .0471).CONCLUSION The addition of XRT to XP chemotherapy did not significantly reduce recurrence after curative resection and D2 lymph node dissection in gastric cancer.A subsequent trial (ARTIST-II) in patients with lymph node-positive gastric cancer is planned.",0,0,0,0
21750964,"Pathological complete response rates following different neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens for operable breast cancer according to ER status, in two parallel, randomized phase II trials with an adaptive study design (ECTO II).Sequential doxorubicin/paclitaxel (AT) followed by CMF treatment was shown to be an active neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen in the first European Cooperative Trial in Operable Breast Cancer (ECTO I trial).The aim of the current study (ECTO II) is to assess the complete pathological response (pCR) rate following three different anthracycline and taxane-containing neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens, with or without capecitabine (X).Patients with operable, invasive breast cancer > 2.0 cm in diameter, were randomized to AT-->CMF, AT-->CMX or AC-->TX regimens in two parallel, randomized, open-label, phase II trials (within a single study) in patients with estrogen receptor negative (ER-) and estrogen receptor positive (ER+) diseases, respectively.Exemestane was delivered concomitantly with neoadjuvant chemotherapy in ER+ tumors.Achievement of pCR was more common in ER- than ER+ women (45.3 vs. 10.4%).Capecitabine was only associated with a higher frequency of pCR in ER+ patients receiving AT-->CMX.Overall response rates (ORR) ranged from 88 to 97%, and this translated into high rates of breast-conserving surgery (67% of ER- patients and 72% of ER+ patients).All three regimens were well tolerated.Febrile neutropenia and gastrointestinal effects were the most common grade >/= 3 adverse events.As expected, the ECTO II study showed higher pCR rates in patients with ER- disease.Substituting capecitabine for fluorouracil (+/- methotrexate) in anthracycline/taxane-containing regimens appeared to be beneficial only in ER+ tumors.Translational studies investigating interactions between therapeutic agents and tumor biology are warranted to refine patient selection and improve the results of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.",0,0,0,0
22459260,"Supporting self-management of pain in cancer patients: methods and lessons learned from a randomized controlled pilot study.PURPOSE OF THE RESEARCH: The purposes of this paper are to describe the methods used and the knowledge gained during a pilot study that evaluated the effects of a self-management intervention for cancer pain, as well as the adaptations that were made for a larger clinical trial.METHODS AND SAMPLE: In a randomized controlled trial, the adapted German version of the PRO-SELF((c)) Plus Pain Control Program (PCP), a 10-week intervention to support self-management of pain in adult oncology outpatients and their family caregivers, was compared to attention control.Primary endpoints were average and worst pain measured at 6, 10, 14, and 22 weeks after enrollment.KEY RESULTS: A total of 39 patients (19 intervention, 20 control) were recruited over 18 months.During the study, inclusion criteria were expanded.Furthermore, the structured timing of the intervention visits was too static for a dynamic symptom like cancer pain.The intervention was expanded to include symptoms that severely impacted pain self-management including chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.CONCLUSIONS: Apart from the provision of information and skills building, coaching cancer patients across a complex treatment is an important function of an intervention to support pain self-management.The pilot study proved to be highly useful in order to adapt planned study procedures, to balance burden and benefit for participants, and to customize the intervention to patients' needs and abilities in order to enhance feasibility and effectiveness.Findings from this pilot study will be fully integrated in a larger randomized controlled trial.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT00920504.",0,0,0,0

23085153,"MAPPED study design: a 6 month randomised controlled study to evaluate the effect of dutasteride on prostate cancer volume using magnetic resonance imaging.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the percentage change in volume of prostate cancer, as assessed by T2-weighted MRI, following exposure to dutasteride (Avodart) 0.5mg daily for six months.PATIENTS AND METHODS: MRI in Primary Prostate cancer after Exposure to Dutasteride (MAPPED) is a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, supported by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK).Men with prostate cancer suitable for active surveillance (low-intermediate risk prostate cancer on biopsy), and a visible lesion on T2-weighted MRI of at least 0.2 cc, were eligible for consideration.Forty-two men were randomised to 6 months of daily dutasteride 0.5mg or placebo.Multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI) scans were performed at baseline, 3 and 6 months.The percentage changes in cancer volume over time will be compared between the dutasteride and placebo groups.Planned analyses will examine the association between tumour volume and characteristics (perfusion and contrast washout) as seen on mpMRI, HistoScan ultrasound and biopsy histopathology in both groups.DISCUSSION: MAPPED is the first randomised controlled trial to use mpMRI to look at the effect of dutasteride on the volume of prostate cancer.If dutasteride is shown to reduce the volume of prostate cancer, it might be considered as an adjunct for men on active surveillance.Analysis of the placebo arm will allow us to comment on the short-term natural variability of the MR appearance in men who are not receiving any treatment.CONCLUSION: MAPPED will evaluate the short-term effect of dutasteride on prostate cancer volume, as assessed by mpMRI, in men undergoing active surveillance for low or intermediate risk prostate cancer.The study completed recruitment in January 2012.",0,0,0,0
23158059,"Chromosome damage and cell proliferation rates in in vitro irradiated whole blood as markers of late radiation toxicity after radiation therapy to the prostate.PURPOSE: In vitro irradiated blood samples from prostate cancer patients showing late normal tissue damage were examined for lymphocyte response by measuring chromosomal aberrations and proliferation rate.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients were selected from a randomized trial evaluating the optimal timing of dose-escalated radiation and short-course androgen deprivation therapy.Of 438 patients, 3% experienced grade 3 late radiation proctitis and were considered to be radiosensitive.Blood samples were taken from 10 of these patients along with 20 matched samples from patients with grade 0 proctitis.The samples were irradiated at 6 Gy and, along with control samples, were analyzed for dicentric chromosomes and excess fragments per cell.Cells in first and second metaphase were also enumerated to determine the lymphocyte proliferation rate.RESULTS: At 6 Gy, there were statistically significant differences between the radiosensitive and control cohorts for 3 endpoints: the mean number of dicentric chromosomes per cell (3.26 +/- 0.31, 2.91 +/- 0.32; P=.0258), the mean number of excess fragments per cell (2.27 +/- 0.23, 1.43 +/- 0.37; P<.0001), and the proportion of cells in second metaphase (0.27 +/- 0.10, 0.46 +/- 0.09; P=.0007).CONCLUSIONS: These results may be a valuable indicator for identifying radiosensitive patients and for tailoring radiation therapy.",0,0,0,0

22473163,"Multicenter randomized phase II clinical trial comparing neoadjuvant oxaliplatin, capecitabine, and preoperative radiotherapy with or without cetuximab followed by total mesorectal excision in patients with high-risk rectal cancer (EXPERT-C).PURPOSE: To evaluate the addition of cetuximab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy before chemoradiotherapy in high-risk rectal cancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with operable magnetic resonance imaging-defined high-risk rectal cancer received four cycles of capecitabine/oxaliplatin (CAPOX) followed by capecitabine chemoradiotherapy, surgery, and adjuvant CAPOX (four cycles) or the same regimen plus weekly cetuximab (CAPOX+C).The primary end point was complete response (CR; pathologic CR or, in patients not undergoing surgery, radiologic CR) in patients with KRAS/BRAF wild-type tumors.Secondary end points were radiologic response (RR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety in the wild-type and overall populations and a molecular biomarker analysis.RESULTS: One hundred sixty-five eligible patients were randomly assigned.Ninety (60%) of 149 assessable tumors were KRAS or BRAF wild type (CAPOX, n = 44; CAPOX+C, n = 46), and in these patients, the addition of cetuximab did not improve the primary end point of CR (9% v 11%, respectively; P = 1.0; odds ratio, 1.22) or PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.65; P = .363).Cetuximab significantly improved RR (CAPOX v CAPOX+C: after chemotherapy, 51% v 71%, respectively; P = .038; after chemoradiation, 75% v 93%, respectively; P = .028) and OS (HR, 0.27; P = .034).Skin toxicity and diarrhea were more frequent in the CAPOX+C arm.CONCLUSION: Cetuximab led to a significant increase in RR and OS in patients with KRAS/BRAF wild-type rectal cancer, but the primary end point of improved CR was not met.",1,1,1,1
22065199,"Temozolomide plus radiotherapy for glioblastoma in a Canadian province: efficacy versus effectiveness and the impact of O6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase promoter methylation.BACKGROUND: Radiotherapy with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide has been the standard of care for newly diagnosed glioblastoma in adults since the pivotal trial by Roger Stupp and colleagues.The effectiveness of this regimen has not been evaluated in Canada.Additionally, the impact of O6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation on patient survival has not been confirmed.Hence, survival outcomes and MGMT predictive value were compared for the patients in Alberta versus the Stupp trial population.METHODS: Retrospective chart review of 215 adult glioblastoma patients who started radiotherapy and temozolomide between January 2007 and December 2010 at the Cross Cancer Institute (Edmonton, Alberta) or the Tom Baker Cancer Centre (Calgary, Alberta).RESULTS: In the Alberta population, median overall survival was 14.3 months (vs. 14.6 months in trial, p = NS) and median progression-free survival was 5.8 months (vs. 6.9 months in trial, p = NS).However, unlike the trial, the Alberta MGMT subgroup analysis for overall survival was not statistically significant, despite a hazard ratio of 0.65 in favor of the methylated group.More Alberta patients received corticosteroids (p < 0.0001) and fewer underwent complete resection (p = 0.0001) or a postprogression second surgery (p = 0.01) than the Stupp population, but characteristics were otherwise similar.CONCLUSION: Current practice in Alberta enables patients to achieve overall and progression-free survival similar to the clinical trial.Further follow-up is required to confirm the predictive value of the MGMT assay.Until that is clarified or better treatments are developed, it is reasonable to continue offering this treatment regimen to patients regardless of MGMT methylation status.",0,0,0,0
