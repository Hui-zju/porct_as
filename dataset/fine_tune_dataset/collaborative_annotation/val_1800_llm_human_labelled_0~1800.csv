33212557,"[Effect of open-lung ventilation strategy on oxygenation-impairment during laparoscopic colorectal cancer resection].Objective: After general anesthesia and mechanical ventilation for laparoscopic colorectal cancer resection, about 90% of patients would have different degrees of atelectasis.Authors speculated that an open-lung strategy (OLS) comprising moderate positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and intermittent recruitment maneuvers (RM) can reduce atelectrauma and thus reduce the incidence of oxygenation-impairment during low-tidal-volume ventilation for laparoscopic colorectal cancer resection.The purpose of this study was to verify this hypothesis and provide a better intraoperative ventilation scheme for laparoscopic colorectal cancer resection.Methods: This was a prospectively randomized controlled clinical trial which was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Sixth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University (2017ZSLYEC-002), and registered at the ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03160144).From January to July 2017, patients who underwent laparoscopic colorectal cancer resection, with age > 40 years, estimated pneumoperitoneum time >/= 1.5 h, pulse oxygen saturation >/= 92%, and risk grade for postoperative pulmonary complications >/= 2 were prospectively enrolled.The patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status >/= IV, body mass index >/= 30 kg/m(2), pneumonia, acute respiratory failure or sepsis within 1 month, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary bullae and progressive neuromuscular diseases, and those participating in other interventional clinical trials were excluded.The enrolled patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to the OLS group (with a PEEP of 6-8 cm H(2)O and intermittent RM), and the NOLS group (without using PEEP and RM).Partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO(2)) /fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO(2)) and shunt fraction (Q(S)/Q(T)) were calculated via arterial and central venous blood gas analysis performed at 0.5 h (T(1)), 1.5 h (T(2)) after pneumoperitoneum induction and at 20 min after admission to the recovery room.Driving pressure immediately before pneumoperitoneum induction (T(0)) and at T(2) were calculated via monitoring data.The primary outcome was oxygenation-impairment (PaO(2)/FiO(2) </= 300 mmHg) during mechanical ventilation.Results: In each group, 48 patients under general anesthesia and low-tidal-volume ventilation were included in the final analysis.During ventilation, the oxygenation-impairment occurred in 7 patients (14.6%) of OLS group and in 17 patients (35.4%) of NOLS group, whose difference was statistically significant between two groups (chi(2)=5.556, RR=0.31, 95%CI: 0.12 to 0.84, P=0.033).During ventilation, the patients in the OLS group had higher PaO(2)/FiO(2) [T(1): (427+/-103) mmHg vs. (366+/-109) mmHg, t=-2.826, P=0.006; T(2): (453+/-103) mmHg vs. (388+/-122) mmHg, t=-2.739, P=0.007], lower Q(S)/Q(T) [ T(1): (9.2+/-6.5) % vs. (12.6+/-7.7) %, t=2.322, P=0.022; T(2): (7.0+/-5.8)% vs.(10.9+/-9.2)%, t=2.408, P=0.019], and lower driving pressure [T(0): (6+/-3) cm H(2)O vs. (10+/-2) cm H(2)O, t=7.421, P<0.001; T(2): (13+/-3) cm H(2)O vs. (17+/-4) cm H(2)O, t=5.417, P<0.001] than those in the NOLS group, with stratistical differences in all comparisons.In recovery room, though PaO(2)/FiO(2) [(70.3+/-9.4) mmHg vs. (66.8+/-9.4) mmHg, P=0.082] was still higher and Q(S)/Q(T) [(18.6+/-8.3)% vs. (21.8+/-8.4)%, P=0.070] was still lower in the OLS group as compared to the NOLS group, the differences were not statistically significant (both P>0.05).Conclusion: The application of such an OLS during low-tidal-volume ventilation can greatly reduce the incidence of oxygenation-impairment in laparoscopic colorectal cancer resection, and such effect may last to the period of emergence from anesthesia.",0,0,0,0
22540955,"The impact of routine open nonsuction drainage on fluid accumulation after thyroid surgery: a prospective randomised clinical trial.BACKGROUND: Thyroid drains following thyroid surgery are routinely used despite minimal supportive evidence.Our aim in this study is to determine the impact of routine open drainage of the thyroid bed postoperatively on ultrasound-determined fluid accumulation at 24 hours.METHODS: We conducted a prospective randomised clinical trial on patients undergoing thyroid surgery.Patients were randomly assigned to a drain group (n = 49) or a no-drain group (n = 44) immediately prior to wound closure.Patients underwent a neck ultrasound on day 1 and day 2 postoperatively.After surgery, we evaluated visual analogue scale pain scores, postoperative analgesic requirements, self-reported scar satisfaction at 6 weeks and complications.RESULTS: There was significantly less mean fluid accumulated in the drain group on both day 1, 16.4 versus 25.1 ml (P-value = 0.005), and day 2, 18.4 versus 25.7 ml (P-value = 0.026), following surgery.We found no significant differences between the groups with regard to length of stay, scar satisfaction, visual analogue scale pain score and analgesic requirements.There were four versus one wound infections in the drain versus no-drain groups.This finding was not statistically significant (P = 0.154).No life-threatening bleeds occurred in either group.CONCLUSIONS: Fluid accumulation after thyroid surgery was significantly lessened by drainage.However, this study did not show any clinical benefit associated with this finding in the nonemergent setting.Drains themselves showed a trend indicating that they may augment infection rates.The results of this study suggest that the frequency of acute life-threatening bleeds remains extremely low following abandoning drains.We advocate abandoning routine use of thyroid drains.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN94715414.",0,0,0,0
31274231,"Final analysis of a phase I/IIa trial of the folate-binding protein-derived E39 peptide vaccine to prevent recurrence in ovarian and endometrial cancer patients.BACKGROUND: E39, an HLA-A2-restricted, immunogenic peptide derived from the folate-binding protein (FBP), is overexpressed in multiple malignancies.We conducted a phase I/IIa trial of the E39 + GM-CSF vaccine with booster inoculations of either E39 or E39' (an attenuated version of E39) to prevent recurrences in disease-free endometrial and ovarian cancer patients(pts).Here, we present the final 24-month landmark analysis.PATIENTS AND METHODS: HLA-A2 + patients receiving E39 + GM-CSF were included in the vaccine group (VG), and HLA-A2- pts (or HLA-A2 + patients refusing vaccine) were followed as the control group (CG).VG group received 6 monthly inoculations as the primary vaccine series (PVS) and were randomized to receive either E39 or E39' booster inoculations.Demographic, safety, immunologic, and disease-free survival (DFS) data were collected and evaluated.RESULTS: Fifty-one patients were enrolled; 29 in the VG and 22 in the CG.Fourteen patients received <1000 mug and 15 received 1000 mug of E39.There were no clinicopathologic differences between VG and CG or between dose groups.E39 was well tolerated.At the 24 months landmark, DFS was 55.5% (VG) vs 40.0% (CG), P = 0.339.Patients receiving 1000 mug and boosted patients also showed improved DFS (P < 0.03).DFS was improved in the 1000 mug group after treatment of primary disease (90.0% vs CG:42.9%, P = 0.007), but not in recurrent patients.In low-FBP expressing patients, DFS was 100.0% (1000 mug), 50.0% (<1000 mug), and 25.0% (CG), P = 0.029.CONCLUSIONS: This phase I/IIa trial reveals that E39 + GM-CSF is safe and may be effective in preventing recurrence in high-risk ovarian and endometrial cancer when optimally dosed (1000 mug) to FBP low patients being treated for primary disease.",1,1,1,0
29701043,"[Therapeutic effects on ovulation and reproduction promotion with acupuncture and clomiphene in polycystic ovary syndrome].OBJECTIVE: To compare the difference in the therapeutic effects on ovulation disorder in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) between the combined therapy of electroacupuncture and clomiphene and the single medication of clomiphene and to explore the effect mechanism.METHODS: A total of 80 patients of PCOS were randomized into an acupuncture plus medication group (40 cases) and a medication group (40 cases).In the medication group, since the 5th day of menstruation or medicine-withdrawal bleeding, clomiphene was prescribed for oral administration, continuously for 5 days.In the acupuncture plus medication group, the medication was the same as the medication group.Additionally, 30 min electroacupuncture (continuous wave, 2 Hz) was applied to Qihai (CV 6), Guanyuan (CV 4), Zigong (EX-CA 1), Dahe (KI 12), Sanyinjiao (SP 6), Zhongji (CV 3), Diji (SP 8), Shenshu (BL 23), Sanjiaoshu (BL 22) and Ciliao (BL 32), etc.The treatment started on the 5th day of menstruation or medicine-withdrawal bleeding, once every two days, 3 times a week.One cycle of menstruation or 1 month was taken as one course.The treatment cycles were 3 months in the two groups.The level of estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P) in the serum, the endometrial thickness and morphology, ovulation rate and clinical pregnancy rate, as well as the clinical therapeutic effects were compared after treatment in the two groups.RESULTS: Two cases were dropped out because the herbal medicine was taken simultaneously in the acupuncture plus medication group.In the medication group, the medication was discontinued in 3 cases due to gastrointestinal adverse reactions.The total effective rate was 86.8% (33/38) in the acupuncture plus medication group, better than 64.9% (24/37) in the medication group (P<0.05).The ovulation rate in the acupuncture plus medication group was higher than that in the medication group [(86.8%, 33/38) vs (64.9% 24/37), P<0.05].The pregnancy rate in the acupuncture plus medication group was higher than the medication group in tendency, without significant difference [21.1% (8/38) vs 16.2% (6/37), P>0.05].After treatment, the results of endometrial thickness and morphology (A-type rate) in the acupuncture plus medication group were better than those in the medication group (P<0.01, P<0.05).After treatment, regarding the levels of E2 and P in the serum in the window period of implantation, the results in the acupuncture plus medication group were higher remarkably than those in the medication group (both P<0.01).CONCLUSION: The combined intervention of electroacupuncture and clomiphene achieves the definite effects of ovulation and pregnancy promotion in PCOS.It remarkably increases the levels of E2 and P in the serum, the endometrial thickness and A-type rate.The therapeutic effects of the combined intervention are remarkably better than those of the simple application of clomiphene.This combined intervention is safe and tolerable for the adverse reactions.The effect mechanisms may be related to the improvements of estrogen, progestin and endometrial receptivity.",0,0,0,0
27220897,"Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography May Improve the Diagnostic Accuracy of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Localized Prostate Cancer.PURPOSE: Positron emission tomography using ligands targeting prostate specific membrane antigen has recently been introduced.Positron emission tomography imaging with (68)Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC has been shown to detect metastatic prostate cancer lesions at a high rate.In this study we compare multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and prostate specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography of the prostate with whole mount ex vivo prostate histopathology to determine the true sensitivity and specificity of these imaging modalities for detecting and locating tumor foci within the prostate.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a prospective clinical trial setting 20 patients with localized prostate cancer and a planned radical prostatectomy were recruited.All patients underwent multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography before surgery, and whole mount histopathology slides were directly compared to the images.European Society of Urogenital Radiology guidelines for reporting magnetic resonance imaging were used as a template for regional units of analysis.The uropathologist and radiologists were blinded to individual components of the study, and the final correlation was performed by visual and deformable registration analysis.RESULTS: A total of 50 clinically significant lesions were identified from the whole mount histopathological analysis.Based on regional analysis the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging were 44%, 94%, 81% and 76%, respectively.With prostate specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 49%, 95%, 85% and 88%, respectively.Prostate specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography yielded a higher specificity and positive predictive value.CONCLUSIONS: A significant proportion of cancers are potentially missed and underestimated by both imaging modalities.Prostate specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography may be used in addition to multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging to help improve local staging in those patients undergoing retropubic radical prostatectomy.",0,0,0,0

28322759,"Validation and Refinement of Prediction Models to Estimate Exercise Capacity in Cancer Survivors Using the Steep Ramp Test.OBJECTIVE: To further test the validity and clinical usefulness of the steep ramp test (SRT) in estimating exercise tolerance in cancer survivors by external validation and extension of previously published prediction models for peak oxygen consumption (Vo2peak) and peak power output (Wpeak).DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.SETTING: Multicenter.PARTICIPANTS: Cancer survivors (N=283) in 2 randomized controlled exercise trials.INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prediction model accuracy was assessed by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and limits of agreement (LOA).Multiple linear regression was used for model extension.Clinical performance was judged by the percentage of accurate endurance exercise prescriptions.RESULTS: ICCs of SRT-predicted Vo2peak and Wpeak with these values as obtained by the cardiopulmonary exercise test were .61 and .73, respectively, using the previously published prediction models.95% LOA were +/-705mL/min with a bias of 190mL/min for Vo2peak and +/-59W with a bias of 5W for Wpeak.Modest improvements were obtained by adding body weight and sex to the regression equation for the prediction of Vo2peak (ICC, .73; 95% LOA, +/-608mL/min) and by adding age, height, and sex for the prediction of Wpeak (ICC, .81; 95% LOA, +/-48W).Accuracy of endurance exercise prescription improved from 57% accurate prescriptions to 68% accurate prescriptions with the new prediction model for Wpeak.CONCLUSIONS: Predictions of Vo2peak and Wpeak based on the SRT are adequate at the group level, but insufficiently accurate in individual patients.The multivariable prediction model for Wpeak can be used cautiously (eg, supplemented with a Borg score) to aid endurance exercise prescription.",0,0,0,0
29030001,"The occurrence and characteristics of endoscopically unexpected malignant degeneration in large rectal adenomas.BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Large non-pedunculated rectal polyps are most commonly resected by endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) or transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM).Despite pre-procedural diagnostics, unexpected rectal cancer is incidentally encountered within the resected specimen.This study aimed to compare the diagnostic assessment and procedural characteristics of lesions with and without unexpected submucosal invasion.METHODS: A post-hoc analysis of a multicenter randomized trial (TREND study) was performed in which patients with a non-pedunculated rectal polyp of >/=3 cm without endoscopic suspicion of invasive growth were randomized between EMR and TEM.RESULTS: Unexpected rectal cancer was detected in 13% (27/203) of patients; 15 after EMR and 12 after TEM.Most consisted of low-risk T1 cancers (78%, n = 18).There were no differences in the diagnostic assessment between lesions with and without unexpected submucosal invasion.Diagnostic biopsies revealed similar rates of high-grade dysplasia (28% [7/25] vs 18% [26/144]).When compared with EMR of adenomas, EMR procedures of unexpected cancers had a lower success rate of submucosal lifting (60% vs 93%, P < .001), were more often assessed as endoscopically incomplete (33% vs 10%, P = .01), and were more frequently terminated prematurely (60% vs 8%, P = .001).CONCLUSIONS: Diagnostic assessment of large non-pedunculated rectal polyps revealed similar characteristics between unexpected cancers and adenomas.Unexpected cancers during EMR were non-lifting in 40%, endoscopically assessed as incomplete in 33%, and terminated prematurely in 60%.In treatment-naive patients, these factors should raise suspicion of malignancy and need discussion in a multidisciplinary team meeting for decision on further treatment strategies.",0,0,0,0
22699884,"A hospital-based work support intervention to enhance the return to work of cancer patients: a process evaluation.PURPOSE: To perform a process evaluation of a hospital-based work support intervention for cancer patients aimed at enhancing return to work and quality of life.The intervention involves the delivery of patient education and support at the hospital and involves the improvement of the communication between the treating physician and the occupational physician.In addition, the research team asked patient's occupational physician to organise a meeting with the patient and the supervisor to make a concrete gradual return-to-work plan.METHODS: Eligible were cancer patients treated with curative intent and who have paid work.Data were collected from patients assigned to the intervention group (N = 65) and from nurses who delivered the patient education and support at the hospital (N = 4) by means of questionnaires, nurses' reports, and checklists.Data were quantitatively and qualitatively analysed.RESULTS: A total of 47 % of all eligible patients participated.Nurses delivered the patient education and support in 85 % of the cases according to the protocol.In 100 % of the cases at least one letter was sent to the occupational physician.In 10 % of the cases the meeting with the patient, the occupational physician and the supervisor took place.Patients found the intervention in general very useful and nurses found the intervention feasible to deliver.CONCLUSIONS: We found that a hospital- based work support intervention was easily accepted in usual psycho-oncological care but that it proved difficult to involve the occupational physician.Patients were highly satisfied and nurses found the intervention feasible.",0,0,0,0

27869649,"Randomized trial of calcipotriol combined with 5-fluorouracil for skin cancer precursor immunotherapy.BACKGROUND: Actinic keratosis is a precursor to cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.Long treatment durations and severe side effects have limited the efficacy of current actinic keratosis treatments.Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is an epithelium-derived cytokine that induces a robust antitumor immunity in barrier-defective skin.Here, we investigated the efficacy of calcipotriol, a topical TSLP inducer, in combination with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) as an immunotherapy for actinic keratosis.METHODS: The mechanism of calcipotriol action against skin carcinogenesis was examined in genetically engineered mouse models.The efficacy and safety of 0.005% calcipotriol ointment combined with 5% 5-FU cream were compared with Vaseline plus 5-FU for the field treatment of actinic keratosis in a randomized, double-blind clinical trial involving 131 participants.The assigned treatment was self-applied to the entirety of the qualified anatomical sites (face, scalp, and upper extremities) twice daily for 4 consecutive days.The percentage of reduction in the number of actinic keratoses (primary outcome), local skin reactions, and immune activation parameters were assessed.RESULTS: Calcipotriol suppressed skin cancer development in mice in a TSLP-dependent manner.Four-day application of calcipotriol plus 5-FU versus Vaseline plus 5-FU led to an 87.8% versus 26.3% mean reduction in the number of actinic keratoses in participants (P < 0.0001).Importantly, calcipotriol plus 5-FU treatment induced TSLP, HLA class II, and natural killer cell group 2D (NKG2D) ligand expression in the lesional keratinocytes associated with a marked CD4+ T cell infiltration, which peaked on days 10-11 after treatment, without pain, crusting, or ulceration.CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate the synergistic effects of calcipotriol and 5-FU treatment in optimally activating a CD4+ T cell-mediated immunity against actinic keratoses and, potentially, cancers of the skin and other organs.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02019355.FUNDING: Not applicable (investigator-initiated clinical trial).",1,0,0,0

24129868,"Effect of a web-based curriculum on primary care practice: basic skin cancer triage trial.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Primary care physicians (PCPs) are uniquely positioned to detect melanoma.Effective educational interventions targeted at PCPs may improve early melanoma detection.A previous in-person Basic Skin Cancer Triage (BSCT) 2-hour course demonstrated significant short-term improvement in provider practices, attitudes, ability, confidence, and knowledge.We conducted a randomized trial to test the efficacy of the BSCT course implemented as a web-based learning program, compared to a similar (control) web-based course on weight assessment.METHODS: We recruited a sample of 57 PCPs and 3,341 of their patients from four geographically diverse centers.Skin cancer control activities by PCPs were assessed by physician survey and by chart review and patient telephone interview about their recent visit to their PCP at baseline and at 1--2 months and 12 months after course completion.RESULTS: Some effect of intervention on skin cancer parameters was self-reported by physicians; this was not confirmed by patient survey or chart-extracted data.Rates of skin cancer control practices by PCPs were low across both groups before and after intervention.The positive changes in physician-reported behaviors (total body skin examination [TBSE]), intentions (discuss skin cancer detection), confidence (performing TBSE), office practices, and knowledge (58% skin versus 49% control) were neither matched by differences in practice reported by their patients, nor persisted in a longer term follow-up, hence may be attributable to physician recall bias due to the experience of the course or desire to please study investigators and were less dramatic as compared to our previously reported in-person BSCT intervention.Thus this approach by itself appears unlikely to result in improved PCP handling of skin cancer issues.CONCLUSIONS: Given previous success with our in-person course, the features required to make WBL a more effective tool for medical education must be further explored.",0,0,0,0

25833781,"Dietary modifications, weight loss, and changes in metabolic markers affect global DNA methylation in Hispanic, African American, and Afro-Caribbean breast cancer survivors.BACKGROUND: Lower levels of global DNA methylation in tissue and blood have been associated with increased cancer risk.Conversely, cross-sectional analyses of healthier lifestyle patterns have been associated with higher levels of global DNA methylation.OBJECTIVE: In this trial, we explored the associations between changes in lifestyle modifications (diet, weight loss), metabolic markers, and global epigenetic biomarkers in white blood cells.METHODS: Study participants were Hispanic, African American, and Afro-Caribbean overweight and sedentary female breast cancer survivors (n = 24) who participated in a larger randomized, crossover, pilot study of a 6-mo weight loss intervention and who had available blood specimens.Anthropometric measures, a food-frequency questionnaire, and peripheral blood were collected at baseline, 6 mo, and 12 mo.Plasma samples were analyzed for metabolic markers (insulin, glucose).We measured DNA methylation of long interspersed nucleotide element 1 (LINE-1) and satellite 2 by pyrosequencing and MethyLight, respectively, and global DNA methylation by the luminometric methylation assay (LUMA).RESULTS: DNA methylation of LINE-1 was statistically significantly elevated at 6 mo [75.5% vs. 78.5% (P < 0.0001)] and 12 mo [75.5% vs. 77.7% (P < 0.0001)], compared to baseline.Over a 12-mo period, changes in percentage body fat and plasma glucose concentrations were positively associated with LINE-1 DNA methylation (beta = 0.19, P = 0.001) and LUMA DNA methylation levels (beta = 0.24, P = 0.02), respectively.Similarly, 12-mo changes in dietary measures such as vegetable (beta = 0.009, P = 0.048), protein (beta = 0.04, P = 0.001), and total caloric (beta = 0.05, P = 0.01) intake were positively associated with changes in LUMA DNA methylation, as was intake of fruit positively associated with changes in LINE-1 DNA methylation (beta = 0.004, P = 0.02).CONCLUSIONS: Our hypothesis-generating results suggest that lifestyle modifications may be associated with changes in global DNA methylation detectable at 6 and 12 mo.These biomarkers may be useful intermediate biomarkers to use in future intervention trials.This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00811824.",0,0,0,0
27114605,"Response to Cetuximab With or Without Irinotecan in Patients With Refractory Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Harboring the KRAS G13D Mutation: Australasian Gastro-Intestinal Trials Group ICECREAM Study.PURPOSE: RAS mutations predict lack of response to epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody therapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), but preclinical studies and retrospective clinical data suggest that patients with tumors harboring the exon 2 KRAS G13D mutation may benefit from cetuximab.We aimed to assess cetuximab monotherapy and cetuximab plus irinotecan in patients with molecularly selected (G13D mutation) chemotherapy-refractory mCRC in a randomized phase II trial of this rare molecular subtype.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with chemotherapy-refractory KRAS G13D mutation-positive mCRC who had progressed within 6 months of irinotecan therapy were randomly assigned to cetuximab 400 mg/m(2) loading dose and then 250 mg/m(2) once per week with or without irinotecan 180 mg/m(2) once every 2 weeks.The primary end point was 6-month progression-free survival; secondary end points were response rate, overall survival, quality of life, and toxicity.RESULTS: Fifty-one of 53 patients recruited over 2 years were eligible.The 6-month progression-free survival rate was 10% (95% CI, 2% to 26%) for cetuximab versus 23% (95% CI, 9% to 40%) for cetuximab plus irinotecan with a hazard ratio of 0.74 (95% CI, 0.42 to 1.32).Response and stable disease rates were 0% and 58% for monotherapy versus 9% and 70% for combination treatment, respectively.Overall survival and quality of life were similar; toxicities were higher with combination therapy.CONCLUSION: In patients with G13D-mutated chemotherapy-refractory mCRC, there was no statistically significant improvement in disease control at 6 months with either cetuximab monotherapy or cetuximab plus irinotecan.No responses were seen with single-agent cetuximab.The responses observed with the combination of cetuximab and irinotecan may reflect true drug synergy or persistent irinotecan sensitivity.The ICECREAM (Irinotecan Cetuximab Evaluation and Cetuximab Response Evaluation Among Patients with a G13D Mutation) study demonstrates the need to prospectively evaluate hypotheses that were previously supported by retrospective analyses and exemplifies the value of international collaboration in trials of rare molecular subtypes.",1,1,1,1
28578704,"Dietary supplementation with n-3-fatty acids in patients with pancreatic cancer and cachexia: marine phospholipids versus fish oil - a randomized controlled double-blind trial.BACKGROUND: Like many other cancer patients, most pancreatic carcinoma patients suffer from severe weight loss.As shown in numerous studies with fish oil (FO) supplementation, a minimum daily intake of 1.5 g n-3-fatty acids (n-3-FA) contributes to weight stabilization and improvement of quality of life (QoL) of cancer patients.Given n-3-FA not as triglycerides (FO), but mainly bound to marine phospholipids (MPL), weight stabilization and improvement of QoL has already been seen at much lower doses of n-3-FA (0,3 g), and MPL were much better tolerated.The objective of this double-blind randomized controlled trial was to compare low dose MPL and FO formulations, which had the same n-3-FA amount and composition, on weight and appetite stabilization, global health enhancement (QoL), and plasma FA-profiles in patients suffering from pancreatic cancer.METHODS: Sixty pancreatic cancer patients were included into the study and randomized to take either FO- or MPL supplementation.Patients were treated with 0.3 g of n-3-fatty acids per day over six weeks.Since the n-3-FA content of FO is usually higher than that of MPL, FO was diluted with 40% of medium chain triglycerides (MCT) to achieve the same capsule size in both intervention groups and therefore assure blinding.Routine blood parameters, lipid profiles, body weight, and appetite were measured before and after intervention.Patient compliance was assessed through a patient diary.Quality of life and nutritional habits were assessed with validated questionnaires (EORTC-QLQ-C30, PAN26).Thirty one patients finalized the study protocol and were analyzed (per-protocol-analysis).RESULTS: Intervention with low dose n-3-FAs, either as FO or MPL supplementation, resulted in similar and promising weight and appetite stabilization in pancreatic cancer patients.MPL capsules were slightly better tolerated and showed fewer side effects, when compared to FO supplementation.CONCLUSION: The similar effects between both interventions were unexpected but reliable, since the MPL and FO formulations caused identical increases of n-3-FAs in plasma lipids of included patients after supplementation.The effects of FO with very low n-3-FA content might be explained by the addition of MCT.The results of this study suggest the need for further investigations of marine phospholipids for the improvement of QoL of cancer patients, optionally in combination with MCT.",0,0,0,0
28961826,"Whole brain radiotherapy after stereotactic radiosurgery or surgical resection among patients with one to three brain metastases and favorable prognoses: a secondary analysis of EORTC 22952-26001.Background: The absence of a survival benefit for whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) among randomized trials has been attributed to a competing risk of death from extracranial disease.We re-analyzed EORTC 22952 to assess the impact of WBRT on survival for patients with controlled extracranial disease or favorable prognoses.Patients and methods: We utilized Cox regression, landmark analysis, and the Kaplan-Meier method to evaluate the impact of WBRT on survival accounting for (i) extracranial progression as a time-dependent covariate in all patients and (ii) diagnosis-specific graded prognostic assessment (GPA) score in patients with primary non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Results: A total of 329 patients treated per-protocol were included for analysis with a median follow up of 26 months.One hundred and fifteen (35%) patients had no extracranial progression; 70 (21%) patients had progression <90 days, 65 (20%) between 90 and 180 days, and 79 (24%) patients >180 days from randomization.There was no difference in the model-based risk of death in the WBRT group before [hazard ratio (HR) (95% CI)=0.70 (0.45-1.11), P = 0.133), or after [HR (95% CI)=1.20 (0.89-1.61), P = 0.214] extracranial progression.Among 177 patients with NSCLC, 175 had data available for GPA calculation.There was no significant survival benefit to WBRT among NSCLC patients with favorable GPA scores [HR (95% CI)=1.10 (0.68-1.79)] or unfavorable GPA scores [HR (95% CI)=1.11 (0.71-1.76)].Conclusions: Among patients with limited extracranial disease and one to three brain metastases at enrollment, we found no significant survival benefit to WBRT among NSCLC patients with favorable GPA scores or patients with any histology and controlled extracranial disease status.This exploratory analysis of phase III data supports the practice of omitting WBRT for patients with limited brain metastases undergoing SRS and close surveillance.Clinical Trials Number: NCT00002899.",0,0,0,0

34896444,"Colorectal cancer patients advocating screening to their siblings: a randomized behavioral intervention.BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Siblings of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients are at increased risk of developing CRC, but screening rates remain low.Through a randomized behavioral intervention, this study aimed to determine whether patients can advocate screening to their siblings using a tailored educational package.METHODS: CRC survivors were recruited and randomized into relaying either tailored materials (intervention group) or existing national screening guidelines (control group) to their siblings.Siblings could respond to the study team if they were interested in learning about CRC screening.Study outcomes were patient advocacy rates (number of patients who had successfully contacted at least 1 eligible sibling) between groups and the proportion of eligible siblings who responded.RESULTS: Between May 2017 and March 2021, 219 CRC patients were randomized to the intervention (n = 110) and control (n = 109) groups.Patient advocacy rates were high and did not differ significantly between groups.However, only 14.3% of eligible siblings (n = 85) responded to the study team.Siblings of patients from the intervention group were more likely to respond (adjusted odds ratio, 1.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-3.0; P < .05).Moreover, after controlling for potential confounders, siblings aged >/=60 years were significantly less likely to respond (adjusted odds ratio, .3; 95% confidence interval, .1-.7; P < .01).CONCLUSIONS: CRC patients are willing advocates of screening, and siblings contacted by patients from the intervention group were also more likely to reach out to the study team.However, overall sibling response rates were low despite advocacy, suggesting that patient-led advocacy should at best be used as an adjunct to other, multipronged CRC screening promotion modalities.",0,0,0,0
22964475,"A randomized clinical trial of the effects of supplemental calcium and vitamin D3 on the APC/beta-catenin pathway in the normal mucosa of colorectal adenoma patients.APC/beta-catenin pathway perturbation is a common early event in colorectal carcinogenesis and is affected by calcium and vitamin D in basic science studies.To assess the effects of calcium and vitamin D on adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), beta-catenin, and E-cadherin expression in the normal appearing colorectal mucosa of sporadic colorectal adenoma patients, we conducted a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled 2 x 2 factorial clinical trial.Pathology-confirmed colorectal adenoma cases were treated with 2 g/day elemental calcium and/or 800 IU/day vitamin D(3) versus placebo over 6 months (N = 92; 23/group).Overall APC, beta-catenin, and E-cadherin expression and distributions in colon crypts in normal-appearing rectal mucosa biopsies were detected by standardized automated immunohistochemistry and quantified by image analysis.In the vitamin D(3)-supplemented group relative to placebo, the proportion of APC in the upper 40% of crypts (Phih APC) increased 21% (P = 0.01), beta-catenin decreased 12% (P = 0.18), E-cadherin increased 72% (P = 0.03), and the Phih APC/beta-catenin ratio (APC/beta-catenin score) increased 31% (P = 0.02).In the calcium-supplemented group Phih APC increased 10% (P = 0.12), beta-catenin decreased 15% (P = 0.08), and the APC/beta-catenin score increased 41% (P = 0.01).In the calcium/vitamin D(3)-supplemented group, beta-catenin decreased 11% (P = 0.20), E-cadherin increased 51% (P = 0.08), and the APC/beta-catenin score increased 16% (P = 0.26).These results support (i) that calcium and vitamin D modify APC, beta-catenin, and E-cadherin expression in humans in directions hypothesized to reduce risk for colorectal neoplasms, (ii) calcium and vitamin D as potential chemopreventive agents against colorectal neoplasms, and (iii) the potential of APC, beta-catenin, and E-cadherin expression as modifiable, preneoplastic risk biomarkers for colorectal neoplasms.",0,0,0,0

29045554,"Veliparib with temozolomide or carboplatin/paclitaxel versus placebo with carboplatin/paclitaxel in patients with BRCA1/2 locally recurrent/metastatic breast cancer: randomized phase II study.Background: Homologous recombination defects in BRCA1/2-mutated tumors result in sensitivity to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors, which interfere with DNA damage repair.Veliparib, a potent poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor, enhanced the antitumor activity of platinum agents and temozolomide in early phase clinical trials.This phase II study examined the safety and efficacy of intermittent veliparib with carboplatin/paclitaxel (VCP) or temozolomide (VT) in patients with BRCA1/2-mutated breast cancer.Patients and methods: Eligible patients >/=18 years with locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer and a deleterious BRCA1/2 germline mutation were randomized 1 : 1 : 1 to VCP, VT, or placebo plus carboplatin/paclitaxel (PCP).Primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS); secondary end points included overall survival (OS) and overall response rate (ORR).Results: Of 290 randomized patients, 284 were BRCA+, confirmed by central laboratory.For VCP versus PCP, median PFS was 14.1 and 12.3 months, respectively [hazard ratio (HR) 0.789; 95% CI 0.536-1.162; P = 0.227], interim median OS 28.3 and 25.9 months (HR 0.750; 95% CI 0.503-1.117; P = 0.156), and ORR 77.8% and 61.3% (P = 0.027).For VT (versus PCP), median PFS was 7.4 months (HR 1.858; 95% CI 1.278-2.702; P = 0.001), interim median OS 19.1 months (HR 1.483; 95% CI 1.032-2.131; P = 0.032), and ORR 28.6% (P < 0.001).Safety profile was comparable between carboplatin/paclitaxel arms.Adverse events (all grades) of neutropenia, anemia, alopecia, and neuropathy were less frequent with VT versus PCP.Conclusion: Numerical but not statistically significant increases in both PFS and OS were observed in patients with BRCA1/2-mutated recurrent/metastatic breast cancer receiving VCP compared with PCP.The addition of veliparib to carboplatin/paclitaxel significantly improved ORR.There was no clinically meaningful increase in toxicity with VCP versus PCP.VT was inferior to PCP.An ongoing phase III trial is evaluating VCP versus PCP, with optional continuation single-agent therapy with veliparib/placebo if chemotherapy is discontinued without progression, in this patient population.Clinical trial information: NCT01506609.",1,1,1,1
33651099,"End-of-treatment PET/CT predicts PFS and OS in DLBCL after first-line treatment: results from GOYA.GOYA was a randomized phase 3 study comparing obinutuzumab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) vs standard-of-care rituximab plus CHOP in patients with previously untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).This retrospective analysis of GOYA aimed to assess the association between progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) with positron emission tomography (PET)-based complete response (CR) status.Overall, 1418 patients were randomly assigned to receive 8 21-day cycles of obinutuzumab (n = 706) or rituximab (n = 712) plus 6 or 8 cycles of CHOP.Patients received a mandatory fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose-PET/computed tomography scan at baseline and end of treatment.After a median follow-up of 29 months, the numbers of independent review committee-assessed PFS and OS events in the entire cohort were 416 (29.3%) and 252 (17.8%), respectively.End-of-treatment PET CR was highly prognostic for PFS and OS according to Lugano 2014 criteria (PFS: hazard ratio [HR], 0.26; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.19-0.38; P < .0001; OS: HR, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.08-0.17; P < .0001), irrespective of international prognostic index score and cell of origin.In conclusion, the results from this prospectively acquired large cohort corroborated previously published data from smaller sample sizes showing that end-of-treatment PET CR is an independent predictor of PFS and OS and a promising prognostic marker in DLBCL.Long-term survival analysis confirmed the robustness of these data over time.Additional meta-analyses including other prospective studies are necessary to support the substitution of PET CR for PFS as an effective and practical surrogate end point.This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT01287741.",0,0,0,0
30088226,"The Effect of Counseling on Breast Cancer Awareness in Rural Iranian Women: a Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial.In a community such as Iran where late presentation is predominant and the majority of breast cancer patients are diagnosed at advanced stages of the disease, there is an urgent need for improving the level of awareness about breast cancer and early detection measures.Given that rural residents are at higher risk for late diagnosis of breast cancer because they have less education, income, and access to advanced screening technologies, this study was conducted to determine the effect of counseling on breast cancer awareness of rural Iranian women.This randomized clinical trial was conducted on 60 rural women from the Abish Ahmad area in northwestern Iran in 2017.The randomized cluster method was used for sampling.From 20 rural health houses and centers, about one third were selected randomly.From the six selected clusters, three were randomly allocated as the control group and three as the intervention group.Using convenience sampling, 30 women between the ages of 40 and 69 were selected from the control group and 30 from the intervention group.The intervention group attended six group counseling sessions.Data was gathered using a demographic and obstetrical information questionnaire and breast cancer awareness measures.The chi-square, independent t test and ANCOVA by controlling for the baseline scores were used to analyze the data.After counseling, the mean knowledge about breast cancer score was significantly higher in the intervention group than in the control group (adjusted mean difference, 17.02; confidence interval (CI) 95%, 15.44 to 18.59; p < 0.001).The mean barriers to breast cancer screening score showed a significant decrease in the intervention group compared to the control group (AMD, - 1.74; 95% CI - 3.12 to - 0.36, p < 0.001).After intervention, the frequency of breast self-exam showed a significant difference between groups (p < 0.001); but for confidence about noticing breast changes, no significant difference was observed between groups (p = 0.08).Group counseling had a significant effect on enhancing breast cancer awareness of rural Iranian women, except for confidence about noticing breast changes.",0,0,0,0
33186365,"Advance care planning in patients with advanced cancer: A 6-country, cluster-randomised clinical trial.BACKGROUND: Advance care planning (ACP) supports individuals to define, discuss, and record goals and preferences for future medical treatment and care.Despite being internationally recommended, randomised clinical trials of ACP in patients with advanced cancer are scarce.METHODS AND FINDINGS: To test the implementation of ACP in patients with advanced cancer, we conducted a cluster-randomised trial in 23 hospitals across Belgium, Denmark, Italy, Netherlands, Slovenia, and United Kingdom in 2015-2018.Patients with advanced lung (stage III/IV) or colorectal (stage IV) cancer, WHO performance status 0-3, and at least 3 months life expectancy were eligible.The ACTION Respecting Choices ACP intervention as offered to patients in the intervention arm included scripted ACP conversations between patients, family members, and certified facilitators; standardised leaflets; and standardised advance directives.Control patients received care as usual.Main outcome measures were quality of life (operationalised as European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer [EORTC] emotional functioning) and symptoms.Secondary outcomes were coping, patient satisfaction, shared decision-making, patient involvement in decision-making, inclusion of advance directives (ADs) in hospital files, and use of hospital care.In all, 1,117 patients were included (442 intervention; 675 control), and 809 (72%) completed the 12-week questionnaire.Patients' age ranged from 18 to 91 years, with a mean of 66; 39% were female.The mean number of ACP conversations per patient was 1.3.Fidelity was 86%.Sixteen percent of patients found ACP conversations distressing.Mean change in patients' quality of life did not differ between intervention and control groups (T-score -1.8 versus -0.8, p = 0.59), nor did changes in symptoms, coping, patient satisfaction, and shared decision-making.Specialist palliative care (37% versus 27%, p = 0.002) and AD inclusion in hospital files (10% versus 3%, p < 0.001) were more likely in the intervention group.A key limitation of the study is that recruitment rates were lower in intervention than in control hospitals.CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that quality of life effects were not different between patients who had ACP conversations and those who received usual care.The increased use of specialist palliative care and AD inclusion in hospital files of intervention patients is meaningful and requires further study.Our findings suggest that alternative approaches to support patient-centred end-of-life care in this population are needed.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN registry ISRCTN63110516.",0,0,0,0
25940277,"Does a decision aid for prostate cancer affect different aspects of decisional regret, assessed with new regret scales? A randomized, controlled trial.OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate new regret scales and examine whether a decision aid affects different aspects of regret in the treatment choice for prostate cancer.METHODS: This was a multicentre trial (three sites) with imbalanced randomization (1 : 2).From 2008 to 2011, patients with localized prostate cancer were randomized 1 : 2 to usual care (N = 77) or usual care plus a decision aid presenting risks and benefits of different treatments (N = 163).The treatments were surgery and (external or interstitial) radiotherapy.Regret was assessed before, and 6 and 12 months after treatment, using the Decisional regret scale by Brehaut et al. (Medical Decision Making, 23, 2003, 281), and three new scales focusing on process, option and outcome regret.The relation between decision aid and regret was analysed by anova.RESULTS: The concurrent validity of the new regret scales was confirmed by correlations between regret and anxiety, depression, decision evaluation scales and health-related quality of life.With a decision aid, patient participation was increased (P = 0.002), but regret was not.If anything, in patients with serious morbidity the decision aid resulted in a trend to less option regret and less Brehaut regret (P = 0.075 and P = 0.061, with effect sizes of 0.35 and 0.38, respectively).Exploratory analyses suggest that high-risk patients benefitted most from the decision aid.CONCLUSION: The new regret scales may be of value in distinguishing separate aspects of regret.In general, regret was not affected by the decision aid.In patients with serious morbidity, a trend to lower option regret with a decision aid was observed.",0,0,0,0
31808538,"Serratus plane block for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery major lung resection: a randomized controlled trial.OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of 2 different analgesic approaches on pain, postoperative rehabilitation exercises and rescue analgesics of 2 groups of patients undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) major lung resection for cancer.METHODS: A total of 94 patients undergoing a VATS major lung resection were randomly allocated to 2 groups: the control group received intravenous and oral (i.e. systemic) analgesics while the intervention group received systemic analgesics plus pre-emptive serratus plane block.Pain perception was recorded until drainage removal or until 2 p.m. of postoperative day (POD) 3.In particular, the primary end point was defined as the peak pain perception on POD 1 (in the time frame between 6 a.m. and 2 p.m.).Secondary end points were the number of forced inspiration manoeuvers during rehabilitative incentive spirometry on POD 1 and 2 and the overall number of rescue analgesics requested by patients.RESULTS: Serratus plane block provided a better pain control between 6 a.m. and 2 p.m. of POD 1 (Numeric Rating Scale 1.7 vs 3.5; P < 0.001).Patients in the intervention group performed more forced inspiration manoeuvers at a mean higher volume during incentive spirometry (8.9 vs 7, P < 0.001, and 1010 vs 865 ml, P = 0.02).They required fewer rescue doses of analgesics (0.57 vs 1.1; P = 0.008).CONCLUSIONS: Serratus plane block provided a better pain control, entailing a better performance during postoperative rehabilitation exercises in terms of duration and quality of incentive spirometry.It diminished the patient's need for rescue analgesics during the early postoperative period.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT03134729.",0,0,0,0

30911274,"Prognostic significance of serum soluble DR5 levels in small-cell lung cancer.The death receptor 5 (DR5) is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily that can transduce the apoptosis signal in cells.This study assessed serum levels of soluble death receptor 5 (sDR5) in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients compared with those in healthy controls.Clinicopathological features of patients, treatment responses, and overall survival of patients were also recorded and analyzed.The sDR5 levels were analyzed using ELISA in 50 healthy controls and 82 SCLC patients before and after first-line chemotherapy.The statistical data showed that pre-treatment levels of serum sDR5 in SCLC patients were higher than those of healthy controls (P<0.001).Pre-treatment levels of serum sDR5 were significantly associated with smoking history of patients, Veterans Administration Lung Study Group (VALSG) stage, tumor size, and lymph node (N) metastasis (P=0.028, 0.001, 0.028, and 0.01, respectively).After treatment with the first-line chemotherapy, the post-treatment levels of serum sDR5 were obviously decreased (P<0.001), and correlated with treatment responses (P<0.001), although there was no significant difference in their pretreatment sDR5 levels (P=0.62).Cox proportional hazard analysis demonstrated that the post-treatment levels of serum sDR5, VALSG stage, and PS status were all independent predictors for overall survival of patients.The results from the current study indicate that serum level of sDR5 could be further confirmed as a biomarker to predict treatment responses and survival of SCLC patients.",0,0,0,0
31813636,"Long-term primary results of accelerated partial breast irradiation after breast-conserving surgery for early-stage breast cancer: a randomised, phase 3, equivalence trial.BACKGROUND: Whole-breast irradiation after breast-conserving surgery for patients with early-stage breast cancer decreases ipsilateral breast-tumour recurrence (IBTR), yielding comparable results to mastectomy.It is unknown whether accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) to only the tumour-bearing quadrant, which shortens treatment duration, is equally effective.In our trial, we investigated whether APBI provides equivalent local tumour control after lumpectomy compared with whole-breast irradiation.METHODS: We did this randomised, phase 3, equivalence trial (NSABP B-39/RTOG 0413) in 154 clinical centres in the USA, Canada, Ireland, and Israel.Adult women (>18 years) with early-stage (0, I, or II; no evidence of distant metastases, but up to three axillary nodes could be positive) breast cancer (tumour size </=3 cm; including all histologies and multifocal breast cancers), who had had lumpectomy with negative (ie, no detectable cancer cells) surgical margins, were randomly assigned (1:1) using a biased-coin-based minimisation algorithm to receive either whole-breast irradiation (whole-breast irradiation group) or APBI (APBI group).Whole-breast irradiation was delivered in 25 daily fractions of 50 Gy over 5 weeks, with or without a supplemental boost to the tumour bed, and APBI was delivered as 34 Gy of brachytherapy or 38.5 Gy of external bream radiation therapy in 10 fractions, over 5 treatment days within an 8-day period.Randomisation was stratified by disease stage, menopausal status, hormone-receptor status, and intention to receive chemotherapy.Patients, investigators, and statisticians could not be masked to treatment allocation.The primary outcome of invasive and non-invasive IBTR as a first recurrence was analysed in the intention-to-treat population, excluding those patients who were lost to follow-up, with an equivalency test on the basis of a 50% margin increase in the hazard ratio (90% CI for the observed HR between 0.667 and 1.5 for equivalence) and a Cox proportional hazard model.Survival was assessed by intention to treat, and sensitivity analyses were done in the per-protocol population.This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00103181.FINDINGS: Between March 21, 2005, and April 16, 2013, 4216 women were enrolled.2109 were assigned to the whole-breast irradiation group and 2107 were assigned to the APBI group.70 patients from the whole-breast irradiation group and 14 from the APBI group withdrew consent or were lost to follow-up at this stage, so 2039 and 2093 patients respectively were available for survival analysis.Further, three and four patients respectively were lost to clinical follow-up (ie, survival status was assessed by phone but no physical examination was done), leaving 2036 patients in the whole-breast irradiation group and 2089 in the APBI group evaluable for the primary outcome.At a median follow-up of 10.2 years (IQR 7.5-11.5), 90 (4%) of 2089 women eligible for the primary outcome in the APBI group and 71 (3%) of 2036 women in the whole-breast irradiation group had an IBTR (HR 1.22, 90% CI 0.94-1.58).The 10-year cumulative incidence of IBTR was 4.6% (95% CI 3.7-5.7) in the APBI group versus 3.9% (3.1-5.0) in the whole-breast irradiation group.44 (2%) of 2039 patients in the whole-breast irradiation group and 49 (2%) of 2093 patients in the APBI group died from recurring breast cancer.There were no treatment-related deaths.Second cancers and treatment-related toxicities were similar between the two groups.2020 patients in the whole-breast irradiation group and 2089 in APBI group had available data on adverse events.The highest toxicity grade reported was: grade 1 in 845 (40%), grade 2 in 921 (44%), and grade 3 in 201 (10%) patients in the APBI group, compared with grade 1 in 626 (31%), grade 2 in 1193 (59%), and grade 3 in 143 (7%) in the whole-breast irradiation group.INTERPRETATION: APBI did not meet the criteria for equivalence to whole-breast irradiation in controlling IBTR for breast-conserving therapy.Our trial had broad eligibility criteria, leading to a large, heterogeneous pool of patients and sufficient power to detect treatment equivalence, but was not designed to test equivalence in patient subgroups or outcomes from different APBI techniques.For patients with early-stage breast cancer, our findings support whole-breast irradiation following lumpectomy; however, with an absolute difference of less than 1% in the 10-year cumulative incidence of IBTR, APBI might be an acceptable alternative for some women.FUNDING: National Cancer Institute, US Department of Health and Human Services.",0,0,0,0

31792878,"Oral morphine drops for prompt relief of breathlessness in patients with advanced cancer-a randomized, double blinded, crossover trial of morphine sulfate oral drops vs. morphine hydrochloride drops with ethanol (red morphine drops).PURPOSE: Episodic breathlessness is frequent in palliative cancer patients.Opioids are the only pharmacological agents with sufficient evidence in treatment.In Denmark, the main recommendation is red morphine drops (RMD), an off-label solution of morphine, ethanol, and red color (cochenille) described since 1893 (Pharmacopoea Danica).In 2015, the Danish Medicines Agency increased focus on off-label medicines and recommended registered morphine drops without ethanol instead.However, our palliative patients told us that RMD was better.For that reason, we conducted a clinical trial to clarify any perceived difference between the two types of drops.METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double blinded, crossover trial.Patients were asked to perform standardized activity (2-min walk) aiming to provoke breathlessness.Primary endpoint (breathlessness NRS) and secondary endpoints (saturation, pulse, respiratory frequency) were measured before (t = 0) and after test medicine at t = 1, t = 3, t = 5, t = 10, and t = 20 min.After 2-4 days (washout period), the patients repeated the test, receiving the alternative drops in a blinded setup (crossover).RESULTS: In the first 3 min, the relative drop in breathlessness for morphine drops with ethanol (RMD) was significant more than for morphine drops without ethanol.We found no significant difference in secondary endpoints.CONCLUSIONS: A conclusion could be that ethanol might facilitate morphine absorption in the mouth.Our results needs further research of opioid absorption in the mouth as well as trials, testing morphine vs. more lipophilic opioids.The RMD drops are cheap, easy to use, and noninvasive and keep the patient independent of health care professionals.",0,0,0,0

27433356,"Race or Resource? BMI, Race, and Other Social Factors as Risk Factors for Interlimb Differences among Overweight Breast Cancer Survivors with Lymphedema.Introduction.High BMI is a risk factor for upper body breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) onset.Black cancer survivors are more likely to have high BMI than White cancer survivors.While observational analyses suggest up to 2.2 times increased risk of BCRL onset for Black breast cancer survivors, no studies have explored race or other social factors that may affect BCRL severity, operationalized by interlimb volume difference (ILD).Materials and Methods.ILD was measured by perometry for 296 overweight (25 > BMI < 50) Black (n = 102) or White (n = 194) breast cancer survivors (>6 months from treatment) in the WISER Survivor trial.Multivariable linear regression examined associations between social and physical factors and ILD.Results.Neither Black race (-0.26, p = 0.89) nor BMI (0.22, p = 0.10) was associated with ILD.Attending college (-4.89, p = 0.03) was the strongest factor associated with ILD, followed by having more lymph nodes removed (4.75, p = 0.01), >25% BCRL care adherence (4.10, p = 0.01), and years since treatment (0.55, p < 0.001).Discussion.Neither race nor BMI was associated with ILD among overweight cancer survivors.Education, a proxy for resource level, was the strongest factor associated with greater ILD.Tailoring physical activity and weight loss interventions designed to address BCRL severity by resource rather than race should be considered.",0,0,0,0

32352505,"Efficacy of Nivolumab and AVD in Early-Stage Unfavorable Classic Hodgkin Lymphoma: The Randomized Phase 2 German Hodgkin Study Group NIVAHL Trial.Importance: In early-stage unfavorable classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), conventional therapy induces high cure rates but also relevant acute and long-term toxic effects.Nivolumab is well tolerated and highly effective in relapsed/refractory cHL but has not been adequately studied in first-line treatment of early-stage cHL.The NIVAHL trial evaluated nivolumab in this setting with the aim to develop a highly effective yet tolerable systemic therapy to ultimately mitigate morbidity in patients who survive cHL.Objective: To evaluate efficacy of 2 experimental nivolumab-based first-line treatment strategies in patients with early-stage unfavorable cHL.Design, Setting, and Participants: This was an open-label, multicenter, phase 2 randomized clinical trial, open between April 2017 and October 2018.The trial took place at 35 trial centers across Germany, ranging from academic centers to private offices.Eligibility was defined by age 18 to 60 years, cHL confirmed by expert pathology review, early-stage unfavorable disease by German Hodgkin Study Group criteria (stage I to II with risk factor[s]), and absence of serious concomitant disease or organ dysfunction.Among 110 enrolled patients, 109 were eligible.Interventions: Systemic therapy, per random assignment (1:1) to either concomitant treatment with 4 cycles of nivolumab and doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (N-AVD) or sequential treatment with 4 doses of nivolumab, 2 cycles of N-AVD, and 2 cycles of AVD at standard doses, followed by 30-Gy involved-site radiotherapy.Main Outcomes and Measures: Complete remission (CR) rate after study treatment, aiming at excluding a CR rate of 80% or lower via a 2-sided 95% CI for each treatment group.Results: Of 109 patients included in this study, 65 (59.6%) were women, and the median (range) age was 27 (18-60) years.At interim staging after 2 cycles of N-AVD or 4 doses of nivolumab monotherapy, 54 of 54 (100%) and 49 of 51 (96%) response-eligible patients, respectively, achieved an objective response, with CR in 47 (87%) and 26 (51%) patients, respectively.Among 101 patients eligible for primary end point analysis, 46 of 51 (90%; 95% CI, 79%-97%) patients receiving concomitant therapy and 47 of 50 (94%; 95% CI, 84%-99%) patients receiving sequential therapy achieved CR after study treatment.With a median follow-up of 13 months, 12-month progression-free survival was 100% for patients receiving concomitant treatment and 98% (95% CI, 95%-100%) for patients receiving sequential therapy.Conclusions and Relevance: Both strategies combining nivolumab and AVD are feasible and resulted in high remission rates.Despite narrowly missing the efficacy benchmark in the concomitant group, the excellent 12-month progression-free survival and the unexpectedly high CR rate after 4 doses of nivolumab monotherapy warrant further evaluation of this approach in the first-line treatment of patients with early-stage cHL.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03004833.",0,0,0,0
33545710,"Generalized approach for radiotherapy treatment planning by optimizing projected health outcome: preliminary results for prostate radiotherapy patients.Research in cancer care increasingly focuses on survivorship issues, e.g. managing disease- and treatment-related morbidity and mortality occurring during and after treatment.This necessitates innovative approaches that consider treatment side effects in addition to tumor cure.Current treatment-planning methods rely on constrained iterative optimization of dose distributions as a surrogate for health outcomes.The goal of this study was to develop a generally applicable method to directly optimize projected health outcomes.We developed an outcome-based objective function to guide selection of the number, angle, and relative fluence weight of photon and proton radiotherapy beams in a sample of ten prostate-cancer patients by optimizing the projected health outcome.We tested whether outcome-optimized radiotherapy (OORT) improved the projected longitudinal outcome compared to dose-optimized radiotherapy (DORT) first for a statistically significant majority of patients, then for each individual patient.We assessed whether the results were influenced by the selection of treatment modality, late-risk model, or host factors.The results of this study revealed that OORT was superior to DORT.Namely, OORT maintained or improved the projected health outcome of photon- and proton-therapy treatment plans for all ten patients compared to DORT.Furthermore, the results were qualitatively similar across three treatment modalities, six late-risk models, and 10 patients.The major finding of this work was that it is feasible to directly optimize the longitudinal (i.e. long- and short-term) health outcomes associated with the total (i.e. therapeutic and stray) absorbed dose in all of the tissues (i.e. healthy and diseased) in individual patients.This approach enables consideration of arbitrary treatment factors, host factors, health endpoints, and times of relevance to cancer survivorship.It also provides a simpler, more direct approach to realizing the full beneficial potential of cancer radiotherapy.",0,0,0,0

23562353,"Influence of DNA copy number and mRNA levels on the expression of breast cancer related proteins.For a panel of cancer related proteins, the aim was to shed light on which molecular level the expression of each protein was mainly regulated in breast tumors, and to investigate whether differences in regulation were reflected in different molecular subtypes.DNA, mRNA and protein lysates from 251 breast tumor specimens were analyzed using appropriate microarray technologies.Data from all three levels were available for 52 proteins selected for their known involvement in cancer, primarily through the PI3K/Akt pathway.For every protein, in cis Spearman rank correlations between the three molecular levels were calculated across all samples and within each intrinsic gene expression subtype, enabling 63 comparisons altogether due to multiple gene probes matching to single proteins.Subtype-specific relationships between the three molecular levels were studied by calculating the variance of subtype-specific correlation and differences between overall and average subtype-specific correlation.The findings were validated in an external dataset comprising 703 breast tumor specimens.The proteins were sorted into four groups based on the calculated rank correlation values between the three molecular levels.Group A consisted of eight proteins with significant correlation between DNA copy number levels and mRNA expression, and between mRNA expression and protein expression (Bonferroni adjusted p < 0.05).Group B consisted of 14 proteins with significant correlation between mRNA expression and protein expression.Group C consisted of 15 proteins with significant correlation between copy number levels and mRNA expression.For the remaining 25 proteins (group D), no significant correlations was observed.Stratification of tumors according to intrinsic subtype enabled identification of positive correlations between copy number levels, mRNA and protein expression that were undetectable when considering the entire sample set.Protein pairings that either demonstrated high variance in correlation values between subtypes, or between subtypes and the total dataset were studied in particular.The protein expression of cleaved caspase 7 was most highly expressed, and correlated highest to CASP7 gene expression within the basal-like subtype, accompanied by the lowest amounts of hsa-miR-29c.Luminal A-like subtype demonstrated highest amounts of hsa-miR-29c (a miRNA with a putative target sequence in CASP7 mRNA), low expression of cleaved caspase 7 and low correlation to CASP7 gene expression.Such pattern might be an indication of hsa-miR-29c miRNA functioning as a repressor of translation of CASP7 within the luminal-A subtype.Across the entire cohort no correlation was found between CCNB1 copy number and gene expression.However, within most gene intrinsic subtypes, mRNA and protein expression of cyclin B1 was found positively correlated to copy number data, suggesting that copy number can affect the overall expression of this protein.Aberrations of cyclin B1 copy number also identified patients with reduced overall survival within each subtype.Based on correlation between the three molecular levels, genes and their products could be sorted into four groups for which the expression was likely to be regulated at different molecular levels.Further stratification suggested subtype-specific regulation that was not evident across the entire sample set.",0,0,0,0

29904989,"Psychosocial mediators of dietary change among Hispanic/Latina breast cancer survivors in a culturally tailored dietary intervention.OBJECTIVE: To examine psychosocial mediators of the effect of a culturally tailored dietary intervention on dietary change among Hispanic/Latina breast cancer survivors.METHODS: Hispanic/Latina breast cancer survivors (n = 70) were randomized to receive either a 12-week theory-based and culturally tailored dietary change program (intervention group, n = 34), or standard-of-care printed recommendations (control group, n = 36) (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01414062).Fruit/vegetable intake (F/V), % calories from fat, and hypothesized psychosocial mediators were assessed at baseline, 6 and 12 months.Analysis of covariance assessed intervention effects on psychosocial mediators at 6 and 12 months.Mediation analysis using the bootstrap method evaluated the indirect intervention effects on dietary intake at 6 and 12 months through changes in psychosocial mediators at 6 and 12 months.RESULTS: Compared with controls, at 6 and 12 months, the intervention group reported greater improvements in stages of change (P < .001, P < .001, respectively), self-efficacy (P = .009, P = .002, respectively), snack preference for F/snack preference for F/V (P = .045, P = .002, respectively); at 12 months, the intervention group reported a decrease in chance-oriented external locus of control (P = .02).At 6 months, mediation analysis showed that the intervention effect was associated with an increase of 1.0 (95% CI, -0.1-2.4) serving/day of F/V, compared with the control group, although no indirect effect through the hypothesized psychosocial mediators was observed.At 12 months, the intervention was associated with an increase in 0.5 serving/day F/V through improved taste/snack preference for F/V at 6 and 12 months (95% CIs, 0.1-1.3, 0.0-1.4, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: Future programs can target improving taste/snack preference for F/V to promote dietary change in Hispanic/Latina breast cancer survivors.",0,0,0,0
27381209,"Protocol of the Australasian Malignant Pleural Effusion-2 (AMPLE-2) trial: a multicentre randomised study of aggressive versus symptom-guided drainage via indwelling pleural catheters.INTRODUCTION: Malignant pleural effusions (MPEs) can complicate most cancers, causing dyspnoea and impairing quality of life (QoL).Indwelling pleural catheters (IPCs) are a novel management approach allowing ambulatory fluid drainage and are increasingly used as an alternative to pleurodesis.IPC drainage approaches vary greatly between centres.Some advocate aggressive (usually daily) removal of fluid to provide best symptom control and chance of spontaneous pleurodesis.Daily drainages however demand considerably more resources and may increase risks of complications.Others believe that MPE care is palliative and drainage should be performed only when patients become symptomatic (often weekly to monthly).Identifying the best drainage approach will optimise patient care and healthcare resource utilisation.METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A multicentre, open-label randomised trial.Patients with MPE will be randomised 1:1 to daily or symptom-guided drainage regimes after IPC insertion.Patient allocation to groups will be stratified for the cancer type (mesothelioma vs others), performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group status 0-1 vs >/=2), presence of trapped lung (vs not) and prior pleurodesis (vs not).The primary outcome is the mean daily dyspnoea score, measured by a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS) over the first 60 days.Secondary outcomes include benefits on physical activity levels, rate of spontaneous pleurodesis, complications, hospital admission days, healthcare costs and QoL measures.Enrolment of 86 participants will detect a mean difference of VAS score of 14 mm between the treatment arms (5% significance, 90% power) assuming a common between-group SD of 18.9 mm and a 10% lost to follow-up rate.ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Sir Charles Gairdner Group Human Research Ethics Committee has approved the study (number 2015-043).Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at scientific meetings.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ACTRN12615000963527; Pre-results.",0,0,0,0

33592176,"A comparison of sunitinib with cabozantinib, crizotinib, and savolitinib for treatment of advanced papillary renal cell carcinoma: a randomised, open-label, phase 2 trial.BACKGROUND: MET (also known as hepatocyte growth factor receptor) signalling is a key driver of papillary renal cell carcinoma (PRCC).Given that no optimal therapy for metastatic PRCC exists, we aimed to compare an existing standard of care, sunitinib, with the MET kinase inhibitors cabozantinib, crizotinib, and savolitinib for treatment of patients with PRCC.METHODS: We did a randomised, open-label, phase 2 trial done in 65 centres in the USA and Canada.Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with metastatic PRCC who had received up to one previous therapy (excluding vascular endothelial growth factor-directed and MET-directed agents).Patients were randomly assigned to receive sunitinib, cabozantinib, crizotinib, or savolitinib, with stratification by receipt of previous therapy and PRCC subtype.All drug doses were administered orally: sunitinib 50 mg, 4 weeks on and 2 weeks off (dose reductions to 37.5 mg and 25 mg allowed); cabozantinib 60 mg daily (reductions to 40 mg and 20 mg allowed); crizotinib 250 mg twice daily (reductions to 200 mg twice daily and 250 mg once daily allowed); and savolitinib 600 mg daily (reductions to 400 mg and 200 mg allowed).Progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary endpoint.Analyses were done in an intention-to-treat population, with patients who did not receive protocol therapy excluded from safety analyses.This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02761057.FINDINGS: Between April 5, 2016, and Dec 15, 2019, 152 patients were randomly assigned to one of four study groups.Five patients were identified as ineligible post-randomisation and were excluded from these analyses, resulting in 147 eligible patients.Assignment to the savolitinib (29 patients) and crizotinib (28 patients) groups was halted after a prespecified futility analysis; planned accrual was completed for both sunitinib (46 patients) and cabozantinib (44 patients) groups.PFS was longer in patients in the cabozantinib group (median 9.0 months, 95% CI 6-12) than in the sunitinib group (5.6 months, 3-7; hazard ratio for progression or death 0.60, 0.37-0.97, one-sided p=0.019).Response rate for cabozantinib was 23% versus 4% for sunitinib (two-sided p=0.010).Savolitinib and crizotinib did not improve PFS compared with sunitinib.Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 31 (69%) of 45 patients receiving sunitinib, 32 (74%) of 43 receiving cabozantinib, ten (37%) of 27 receiving crizotinib, and 11 (39%) of 28 receiving savolitinib; one grade 5 thromboembolic event was recorded in the cabozantinib group.INTERPRETATION: Cabozantinib treatment resulted in significantly longer PFS compared with sunitinib in patients with metastatic PRCC.FUNDING: National Institutes of Health and National Cancer Institute.",0,0,0,0
32416251,"Time course and management of key adverse events during the randomized phase III SOLAR-1 study of PI3K inhibitor alpelisib plus fulvestrant in patients with HR-positive advanced breast cancer.BACKGROUND: Alpelisib (alpha-selective phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor) plus fulvestrant is approved in multiple countries for men and postmenopausal women with PIK3CA-mutated, hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative advanced breast cancer following progression on or after endocrine therapy.A detailed understanding of alpelisib's safety profile should inform adverse event (AE) management and enhance patient care.PATIENTS AND METHODS: AEs in the phase III SOLAR-1 trial were assessed in patients with and without PIK3CA mutations.The impact of protocol-specified AE-management recommendations was evaluated, including an amendment to optimize hyperglycemia and rash management.RESULTS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive fulvestrant plus alpelisib (n = 284) or placebo (n = 287).The most common grade 3/4 AEs with alpelisib were hyperglycemia (grade 3, 32.7%; grade 4, 3.9%), rash (grade 3, 9.9%), and diarrhea (grade 3, 6.7%).Median time to onset of grade >/=3 toxicity was 15 days (hyperglycemia, based on fasting plasma glucose), 13 days (rash), and 139 days (diarrhea).Metformin alone or in combination with other antidiabetic agents was used by most patients (87.1%) with hyperglycemia.Preventive anti-rash medication resulted in lower incidence (any grade, 26.7% versus 64.1%) and severity of rash (grade 3, 11.6% versus 22.7%) versus no preventative medication.Discontinuations due to grade >/=3 AEs were lower following more-detailed AE management guidelines (7.9% versus 18.1% previously).Patients with PIK3CA mutations had a median alpelisib dose intensity of 248 mg/day.Median progression-free survival with alpelisib was 12.5 and 9.6 months for alpelisib dose intensities of >/=248 mg/day and <248 mg/day, respectively, compared with 5.8 months with placebo.CONCLUSIONS: Hyperglycemia and rash occurred early during alpelisib treatment, while diarrhea occurred at a later time point.Early identification, prevention, and intervention, including concomitant medications and alpelisib dose modifications, resulted in less severe toxicities.Reductions in treatment discontinuations and improved progression-free survival at higher alpelisib dose intensities support the need for optimal AE management.CLINICALTRIALS.GOV ID: NCT02437318.",1,1,1,1

26200278,"Cabazitaxel Versus Topotecan in Patients with Small-Cell Lung Cancer with Progressive Disease During or After First-Line Platinum-Based Chemotherapy.INTRODUCTION: Patients with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) typically respond well to initial chemotherapy.However, relapse invariably occurs, and topotecan, the only approved second-line treatment option, has limited efficacy.Taxanes have activity in SCLC, and cabazitaxel is a second-generation taxane with potential for enhanced activity in chemorefractory malignancies.METHODS: Patients with SCLC who relapsed after initial platinum-based chemotherapy were randomly assigned to receive cabazitaxel 25 mg/m every 21 days or topotecan 1.5 mg/m on days 1-5 every 21 days.Two patient subgroups, defined by chemosensitive and chemo-resistant/refractory disease, were assessed in combination and separately.RESULTS: The safety profile of cabazitaxel and topotecan was consistent with previous studies, and despite considerable toxicity in both arms, no new safety concerns were identified.Patients receiving cabazitaxel had inferior progression-free survival compared with topotecan (1.4 versus 3.0 months, respectively; two-sided p < 0.0001; hazard ratio = 2.17, 95% confidence interval = 1.563-3.010), and results were similar in both the chemosensitive and chemorefractory subgroups.No complete responses were observed in either arm, and no partial responses were observed in the cabazitaxel group.The partial response rate in the topotecan arm was 10%.Median overall survival was 5.2 months in the cabazitaxel arm and 6.8 months in the topotecan arm (two-sided p = 0.0125; hazard ratio = 1.57, 95% confidence interval = 1.10-2.25).CONCLUSION: Cabazitaxel, a next-generation taxane, had inferior efficacy when compared with standard-dose topotecan in the treatment of relapsed SCLC.Topotecan remains a suboptimal therapy, and continued efforts to develop improved second-line treatments are warranted.",0,0,0,0
34463630,"Usefulness of Smartphone Apps for Improving Nutritional Status of Pancreatic Cancer Patients: Randomized Controlled Trial.BACKGROUND: Approximately 80% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients suffer from anorexia, weight loss, and asthenia.Most PDAC patients receive chemotherapy, which often worsens their nutritional status owing to the adverse effects of chemotherapy.Malnutrition of PDAC patients is known to be associated with poor prognosis; therefore, nutritional management during chemotherapy is a key factor influencing the outcome of the treatment.Mobile apps have the potential to provide readily accessible nutritional support for patients with PDAC.OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a mobile app-based program, Noom, in patients receiving chemotherapy for PDAC.METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 40 patients who were newly diagnosed with unresectable PDAC from a single university-affiliated hospital in South Korea, and randomly assigned them into a Noom user group (n=20) and a non-Noom user group (n=20).The 12-week in-app interventions included meal and physical activity logging as well as nutritional education feedback from dietitians.The non-Noom user group did not receive any nutrition intervention.The primary outcomes were the changes in the nutritional status and quality of life (QoL) from the baseline to 12 weeks.The secondary outcomes included the changes in the skeletal muscle index (SMI) from the baseline to 12 weeks.The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Core Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) and the Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA) were used as paper questionnaires to assess the QoL and nutritional status of the patients.Intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were conducted.Regarding the study data collection time points, we assessed the nutritional status and QoL at the baseline (T0), and at 4 (T1), 8 (T2), and 12 (T3) weeks.Abdominal computed tomography (CT) imaging was conducted at the baseline and after 8 weeks for tumor response and SMI evaluation.The skeletal muscle area (cm(2)) was calculated using routine CT images.The cross-sectional areas (cm(2)) of the L3 skeletal muscles were analyzed.RESULTS: Between February 2017 and January 2018, 48 patients were assessed for eligibility.Totally 40 patients with pancreatic cancer were included by random allocation.Only 17 participants in the Noom user group and 16 in the non-Noom user group completed all follow-ups.All the study participants showed a significant improvement in the nutritional status according to the PG-SGA score regardless of Noom app usage.Noom users showed statistically significant improvements on the global health status (GHS) and QoL scales compared to non-Noom users, based on the EORTC QLQ (P=.004).The SMI decreased in both groups during chemotherapy (Noom users, 49.08+/-12.27 cm(2)/m(2) to 46.08+/-10.55 cm(2)/m(2); non-Noom users, 50.60+/-9.05 cm(2)/m(2) to 42.97+/-8.12 cm(2)/m(2)).The decrement was higher in the non-Noom user group than in the Noom user group, but it was not statistically significant (-13.96% vs. -3.27%; P=.11).CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study demonstrates that a mobile app-based approach is beneficial for nutritional and psychological support for PDAC patients receiving chemotherapy.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04109495; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04109495.",0,0,0,0
21699645,"Usefulness of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) rise as a marker of prostate cancer in men treated with dutasteride: lessons from the REDUCE study.OBJECTIVES: To determine if dutasteride-treated men can be monitored safely and adequately for prostate cancer based on data from the Reduction by Dutasteride in Prostate Cancer Events (REDUCE) study.To analyse whether the use of treatment-specific criteria for repeat biopsy maintains the usefulness of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level for detecting high grade cancers.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The REDUCE study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled investigation of whether dutasteride (0.5 mg/day) reduced the risk of biopsy-detectable prostate cancer in men with a previous negative biopsy.The usefulness of PSA was evaluated using biopsy thresholds defined by National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines in the placebo group and any rise in PSA from nadir (the lowest PSA level achieved while in the study) in the dutasteride group.The number of cancers detected on biopsy in the absence of increased/suspicious PSA level as well as sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for high grade prostate cancer detection were analysed by treatment group.Prostate cancer pathological characteristics were compared between men who did and did not meet biopsy thresholds.RESULTS: Of 8231 men randomized, 3305 (dutasteride) and 3424 (placebo) underwent at least one prostate biopsy during the study and were included in the analysis.If only men meeting biopsy thresholds underwent biopsy, 25% (47/191) of Gleason 7 and 24% (7/29) of Gleason 8-10 cancers would have been missed in the dutasteride group, and 37% (78/209) of Gleason 7 and 22% (4/18) Gleason 8-10 cancers would have been missed in the placebo group.In both groups, the incidence of Gleason 7 and Gleason 8-10 cancers generally increased with greater rises in PSA.Sensitivity of PSA kinetics was higher and specificity was lower for the detection of Gleason 7-10 cancers in men treated with dutasteride vs placebo.Men with Gleason 7 and Gleason 8-10 cancer meeting biopsy thresholds had greater numbers of positive cores, percent core involvement, and biopsy cancer volume vs men not meeting thresholds.CONCLUSION: Using treatment-specific biopsy thresholds, the present study shows that the ability of PSA kinetics to detect high grade prostate cancer is maintained with dutasteride compared with placebo in men with a previous negative biopsy.The sensitivity of PSA kinetics with dutasteride was similar to (Gleason 8-10) or higher than (Gleason 7-10) the placebo group; however, biopsy decisions based on a single increased PSA measurement from nadir in the dutasteride group resulted in a lower specificity compared with using a comparable biopsy threshold in the placebo group, indicating the importance of confirmation of PSA measurements.",0,0,0,0

29722789,"The importance of jointly analyzing treatment administration and toxicity associated with targeted therapies: a case study of regorafenib in soft tissue sarcoma patients.Background: Different methods have been proposed to analyze adverse events (AEs) associated with targeted therapies.While these AEs lead to dose adjustments for many patients, conventional reporting methods do not take drug administration into consideration.This paper underlines the importance of jointly reporting AEs and drug administration using prevalence, and proposes a complementary approach to reporting.Patients and methods: The prevalence method estimates the probability of progression-free patients being in a particular health state (state 1: AEs with full dose; state 2: AEs with reduced dose; state 3: no AEs with reduced dose) at different time points.To take into account the impact of dose adjustments on efficacy, the weighted prevalence method can be used by assigning utility weights to the different health states.The benefit of these methods was illustrated using data from a phase II trial of regorafenib.Results: Only 4.6% of progression-free patients developed mucositis/stomatitis (grade >/=2) at 3 months.The prevalence of patients not experiencing this AE but whose dose was reduced or treatment interrupted was 58.1%.The weighted prevalence of the regorafenib toxicity profile and dose reduction was higher in the control arm.Conclusion: This case study confirms the importance of jointly analyzing AEs and drug administration.The weighted prevalence approach is an average score that incorporates the dimension of drug administration into AE assessment.This can be helpful for regulatory agencies as well as for clinicians to evaluate the benefit-risk ratio of therapies in their treatment choice.Clinical trial: NCT01900743.",0,0,0,0

33385757,"Examining the effects of problematic alcohol use on cigarette abstinence in recently diagnosed cancer patients enrolled in a cessation trial: A secondary analysis.AIMS: Among people with cancer, dual alcohol and tobacco use increases risk for morbidity and mortality.Most smoking cessation clinical trials with this patient population have excluded individuals with problematic alcohol use.This investigation examined whether problematic alcohol use affects smoking cessation in cancer patients.METHODS: Mixed-methods secondary analysis of data from the Smokefree Support Study, a randomized-controlled trial examining the efficacy of Intensive (IT; n = 153) vs. Standard Treatment (ST; n = 150) for smoking cessation in newly diagnosed cancer patients.Problematic alcohol use was assessed at enrollment using the Cut-Down-Annoyed-Guilty-Eye-Opener (CAGE), weekly frequency of alcohol use and binge drinking measures.Alcohol use was categorized as: no current alcohol use, moderate and problematic use.The primary outcome was biochemically-confirmed cigarette abstinence at 6-months.A subset of patients (n = 72) completed qualitative exit-interviews.RESULTS: Among all participants, biochemically-confirmed cigarette abstinence rates were 25% (n = 32), 28% (n = 27), and 36% (n = 20) for participants reporting no current alcohol use, moderate use, and problematic use, respectively (p = 0.33).In logistic regression analysis, neither problematic alcohol use (AOR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.35-2.67, p = .94) nor the problematic use by study arm interaction (AOR = 2.22, 95% CI = 0.59-8.39, p = .24) were associated with biochemically-confirmed 6-month abstinence.Qualitatively, participants reported that drinking alcohol triggers urges to smoke.CONCLUSION: Newly diagnosed cancer patients reporting problematic alcohol use were not less likely to quit smoking than those without.Additional research is needed to investigate whether problematic alcohol users may benefit from smoking and alcohol behavior change interventions at the time of cancer diagnosis.",0,0,0,0
26442791,"Shared Medical Decision Making in Lung Cancer Screening: Experienced versus Descriptive Risk Formats.BACKGROUND: Annual lung cancer screening using low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) scans is associated with a survival benefit, but it is also associated with potential harm.Unlike descriptive probability formats, experienced tasks have been shown to decrease perceptions of rare events.The objective of this study was to compare descriptive versus experienced probability formats on patients' knowledge, beliefs, endorsement of screening for heavy smokers, and preference (choice predisposition) to undergo screening.METHODS: A total of 276 patients attending an outpatient pulmonary practice were randomized to learn about screening using 1 of 3 formats: numbers only, numbers + icon arrays, numbers + a set of slides illustrating LDCT scans of 250 people in random order that displayed the number of normal scans, false-positive lung nodules, cancers found leading to a life saved, and cancers found leading to death despite treatment.RESULTS: Knowledge differed between the 3 formats (P= 0.001), with participants randomized to the numbers + icon array format having the highest knowledge score.Beliefs were more favorable among participants randomized to the numbers + experienced format compared with the numbers + icon array format (difference between means [95% confidence interval]= 1.6 [0.4-2.8]).Differences in participants' endorsement of screening (P= 0.4) and choice predisposition (P= 0.6) across probability format mirrored those of beliefs but were not statistically significant.DISCUSSION: Contrary to what we expected, the experienced format increased propensity toward screening compared with the numbers + icon array format, as indicated by more favorable beliefs and nonsignificant trends toward stronger choice predisposition and endorsement.Experienced risk formats may not be a practical approach to improve risk communication for patients deciding whether or not to undergo annual lung cancer screening.",0,0,0,0
22830463,"Sirolimus and secondary skin-cancer prevention in kidney transplantation.BACKGROUND: Transplant recipients in whom cutaneous squamous-cell carcinomas develop are at high risk for multiple subsequent skin cancers.Whether sirolimus is useful in the prevention of secondary skin cancer has not been assessed.METHODS: In this multicenter trial, we randomly assigned transplant recipients who were taking calcineurin inhibitors and had at least one cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma either to receive sirolimus as a substitute for calcineurin inhibitors (in 64 patients) or to maintain their initial treatment (in 56).The primary end point was survival free of squamous-cell carcinoma at 2 years.Secondary end points included the time until the onset of new squamous-cell carcinomas, occurrence of other skin tumors, graft function, and problems with sirolimus.RESULTS: Survival free of cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma was significantly longer in the sirolimus group than in the calcineurin-inhibitor group.Overall, new squamous-cell carcinomas developed in 14 patients (22%) in the sirolimus group (6 after withdrawal of sirolimus) and in 22 (39%) in the calcineurin-inhibitor group (median time until onset, 15 vs. 7 months; P=0.02), with a relative risk in the sirolimus group of 0.56 (95% confidence interval, 0.32 to 0.98).There were 60 serious adverse events in the sirolimus group, as compared with 14 such events in the calcineurin-inhibitor group (average, 0.938 vs. 0.250).There were twice as many serious adverse events in patients who had been converted to sirolimus with rapid protocols as in those with progressive protocols.In the sirolimus group, 23% of patients discontinued the drug because of adverse events.Graft function remained stable in the two study groups.CONCLUSIONS: Switching from calcineurin inhibitors to sirolimus had an antitumoral effect among kidney-transplant recipients with previous squamous-cell carcinoma.These observations may have implications concerning immunosuppressive treatment of patients with cutaneous squamous-cell carcinomas.(Funded by Hospices Civils de Lyon and others; TUMORAPA ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00133887.).",0,0,0,0
31987974,"Derivation of Dose/Volume Constraints for the Anorectum from Clinician- and Patient-Reported Outcomes in the CHHiP Trial of Radiation Therapy Fractionation.PURPOSE: The CHHiP trial randomized 3216 men with localized prostate cancer (1:1:1) to 3 radiation therapy fractionation schedules: 74 Gy in 37 fractions over 7.4 weeks; 60 Gy in 20 fractions over 4 weeks; and 57 Gy in 19 fractions over 3.8 weeks.Literature-based dose constraints were applied with arithmetic adjustment for the hypofractionated arms.This study aimed to derive anorectal dose constraints using prospectively collected clinician-reported outcomes (CROs) and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and to assess the added predictive value of spatial dose metrics.METHODS AND MATERIALS: A case-control study design was used; 7 CRO and 5 PRO bowel symptoms were evaluated.Cases experienced a moderate or worse symptom 1 to 5 years after-radiation therapy and did not have the symptom before radiation therapy.Controls did not experience the symptom at baseline or between 1 to 5 years after radiation therapy.The anorectum was recontoured from the anal verge to the rectosigmoid junction; dose/volume parameters were extracted.Univariate logistic regression, atlases of complication indices, and bootstrapped receiver-operating-characteristic analysis (1000 replicates, balanced outcomes) were used to derive dose constraints for the whole cohort (hypofractionated schedules were converted to 2-Gy equivalent schedules using alpha/beta = 3 Gy) and separate hypofractionated/conventional fractionation cohorts.Only areas under the curve with 95% confidence interval lower limits >0.5 were considered statistically significant.Any constraint derived in <95% to 99% of bootstraps was excluded.RESULTS: Statistically significant dose constraints were derived for CROs but not PROs.Intermediate to high doses were important for rectal bleeding, whereas intermediate doses were important for increased bowel frequency, fecal incontinence, and rectal pain.Spatial dose metrics did not improve prediction of CROs or PROs.A new panel of dose constraints for hypofractionated schedules to 60 Gy or 57 Gy are V20Gy <85%, V30Gy <57%, V40Gy <38%, V50Gy <22%, and V60Gy <0.01%.CONCLUSIONS: Dose constraints differed among symptoms, indicating potentially different pathogenesis of radiation-induced side effects.Derived dose constraints were stricter than those used in CHHiP and may reduce bowel symptoms after radiation therapy.",0,0,0,0
34074815,"Tip-in Endoscopic Mucosal Resection for 15- to 25-mm Colorectal Adenomas: A Single-Center, Randomized Controlled Trial (STAR Trial).INTRODUCTION: One-piece endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) for lesions >15 mm is still unsatisfactory, and attempted 1-piece EMR for lesions >25 mm can increase perforation risk.Therefore, modifications to ensure 1-piece EMR of 15- to 25-mm lesions would be beneficial.The aim of this study was to investigate whether Tip-in EMR, which anchors the snare tip within the submucosal layer, increases en bloc resection for 15- to 25-mm colorectal lesions compared with EMR.METHODS: In this prospective randomized controlled trial, patients with nonpolypoid colorectal neoplasms of 15-25 mm in size were recruited and randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to undergo Tip-in EMR or standard EMR, stratified by age, sex, tumor size category, and tumor location.The primary endpoint was the odds ratio of en bloc resection adjusted by location and size category.Adverse events and procedure time were also evaluated.RESULTS: We analyzed 41 lesions in the Tip-in EMR group and 41 lesions in the EMR group.En bloc resection was achieved in 37 (90.2%) patients undergoing Tip-in EMR and 30 (73.1%) who had EMR.The adjusted odds ratio of en bloc resection in Tip-in EMR vs EMR was 3.46 (95% confidence interval: 1.06-13.6, P = 0.040).The Tip-in EMR and EMR groups did not differ significantly in adverse event rates (0% vs 4.8%) or median procedure times (7 vs 5 minutes).DISCUSSION: In this single-center randomized controlled trial, we found that Tip-in EMR significantly improved the en bloc resection rate for nonpolypoid lesions 15-25 mm in size, with no increase in adverse events or procedure time.",0,0,0,0
30128855,"Qigong intervention for breast cancer survivors with complaints of decreased cognitive function.PURPOSE: The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the feasibility of an 8-week Qigong intervention to improve objectively and subjectively assessed cognitive function in breast cancer survivors who were 2 months to 8 years post completion of chemotherapy and radiation therapy.METHODS: A randomized, single-blind, three-arm intervention pilot was conducted to compare Qigong to gentle exercise and survivorship support.Feasibility was measured by recruitment, group session attendance, and adherence to home practice for the two exercise groups.Changes in self-report and objectively measured cognitive function were compared between the three groups from baseline (T1) to completion of the intervention (T2) and 4 weeks post intervention (T3).RESULTS: Fifty participants consented (83% of desired sample) with an overall attrition rate of 28%.Attrition was highest for the gentle exercise group (50%).Group attendance adherence ranged from 44 to 67%.The a priori established rate of 75% weekly attendance was not achieved, nor was the goal of 75% adherence to home practice for the two exercise groups (7 to 41%).Self-report of cognitive function improved most for the Qigong group (p = .01).Improvement was demonstrated for the Trail Making A (gentle exercise, p = .007) and F-A-S verbal fluency (support group, p = .02) tests.Qigong participants reported the most reduction of distress (p = .02).CONCLUSIONS: The study results suggest that mindfulness-based exercise may be superior to gentle exercise alone or survivorship support for improving self-report of cognitive function and distress after treatment for breast cancer.The mindfulness component may enhance the positive impact of exercise on cognitive function.",0,0,0,0

34896904,"Probiotic supplement attenuates chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment in patients with breast cancer: a randomised, double-blind, and placebo-controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) is highly prevalent in patients with cancer and is associated with poor outcomes and quality of life.To date, the management of CRCI remains a clinical challenge.Herein, we aim to determine the preventive effects of probiotics on CRCI development and underlying mechanisms.METHODS: We conducted a randomised, double-blind and placebo-controlled trial (ChiCTR-INQ-17014181) of 159 patients with breast cancer and further investigated the underlying mechanism in a pre-clinical setting.From 2018 to 2019, patients with breast cancer (Stage I-III) who needed adjuvant chemotherapy were screened, enrolled and randomly assigned to receive either probiotics or placebo (three capsules, twice/day) during chemotherapy.Their cognition, anxiety and depression were assessed with well-established assays; their plasma biomarkers, metabolites and faecal microbiota compositions were measured.In addition, the systemic effects of the metabolites found in the clinical trial on long-term potentiation, synapse injury, oxidative stress and glial activation were assessed in rats.RESULTS: Probiotics supplement significantly decreased the incidence of CRCI, improved the allover cognitive functions, changed the gut microbial composition and modulated nine plasma metabolite changes.Among these metabolites, p-Mentha-1,8-dien-7-ol, Linoelaidyl carnitine and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid were negatively correlated with the occurrence of CRCI.Furthermore, probiotics supplement increased plasma p-Mentha-1,8-dien-7-ol in rats.Administration of exogenous p-Mentha-1,8-dien-7-ol significantly alleviated chemotherapy-induced long-term potentiation impairment, synapse injury, oxidative stress and glial activation in the hippocampus of rats.CONCLUSION: Our data indicated that probiotics supplement prevents the occurrence of CRCI in patients with breast cancer via modulating plasma metabolites, including p-Mentha-1,8-dien-7-ol.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR-INQ-17014181) [http://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.aspx?proj=24294].",1,1,0,0
28812132,"Bowel preparation in CT colonography: Is diet restriction necessary? A randomised trial (DIETSAN).OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether diet restriction affects quality of colon cleansing and patient tolerance during reduced bowel preparation for CT colonography (CTC).METHODS: Asymptomatic and symptomatic patients were enrolled in this pragmatic, single-centre, randomised trial.All patients were randomly assigned (1:1 ratio, blocks of ten) to receive a reduced bowel preparation and faecal tagging with (Diet-Restriction-Group [DR]) or without (No-Diet-Restriction-Group [NDR]) dietary restriction.Five readers performed a blinded subjective image analysis, by means of 4-point Likert-scales from 0 (highest score) to 3 (worst score).Endpoints were the quality of large bowel cleansing and tolerance to the assigned bowel preparation regimen.The trial is registered at ClinicalTrial.gov (URomLSDBAL1).RESULTS: Ninety-five patients were randomly allocated to treatments (48 in NDR-group, 47 in DR-group).Both groups resulted in optimal colon cleansing.The mean residual stool (0.22, 95%CI 0.00-0.44) and fluid burden (0.39, 95%CI 0.25-0.53) scores for patients in DR-group were similar to those in patients in NDR-group (0.25, 95%CI 0.03-0.47 [p = 0.82] and 0.49, 95%CI 0.30-0.67 [p = 0.38], respectively).Tolerance was significantly better in NDR-group.CONCLUSION: A reduced bowel preparation in association with faecal tagging and without any dietary restriction demonstrated optimal colon cleansing effectiveness for CTC, providing better patient compliance compared with dietary restriction.KEY POINTS: * Dietary restriction in reduced bowel preparation regimen can be avoided. *The quality of colon cleansing is not affected by dietary restriction.* The quality of faecal tagging is not affected by dietary restriction.* Avoidance of dietary restriction improves patients' tolerance for CTC.",0,0,0,0
23547084,"Associations between cigarette smoking status and colon cancer prognosis among participants in North Central Cancer Treatment Group Phase III Trial N0147.PURPOSE: By using data from North Central Cancer Treatment Group Phase III Trial N0147, a randomized adjuvant trial of patients with stage III colon cancer, we assessed the relationship between smoking and cancer outcomes, disease-free survival (DFS), and time to recurrence (TTR), accounting for heterogeneity by patient and tumor characteristics.PATIENTS AND METHODS Before random assignment to infusional fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) or FOLFOX plus cetuximab, 1,968 participants completed a questionnaire on smoking history and other risk factors.Cox models assessed the association between smoking history and the primary trial outcome of DFS (ie, time to recurrence or death), as well as TTR, adjusting for other clinical and patient factors.The median follow-up was 3.5 years among patients who did not experience events.RESULTS: Compared with never-smokers, ever smokers experienced significantly shorter DFS (3-year DFS proportion: 70% v 74%; hazard ratio [HR], 1.21; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.42).This association persisted after multivariate adjustment (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.49).There was significant interaction in this association by BRAF mutation status (P = .03): smoking was associated with shorter DFS in patients with BRAF wild-type (HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.11 to 1.66) but not BRAF mutated (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.50 to 1.29) colon cancer.Smoking was more strongly associated with poorer DFS in those with KRAS mutated versus KRAS wild-type colon cancer (HR, 1.50 [95% CI, 1.12 to 2.00] v HR, 1.09 [95% CI, 0.85 to 1.39]), although interaction by KRAS mutation status was not statistically significant (P = .07).Associations were comparable in analyses of TTR.CONCLUSION: Overall, smoking was significantly associated with shorter DFS and TTR in patients with colon cancer.These adverse relationships were most evident in patients with BRAF wild-type or KRAS mutated colon cancer.",0,0,0,0
28675067,"Postoperative neoadjuvant temozolomide before radiotherapy versus standard radiotherapy in patients 60 years or younger with anaplastic astrocytoma or glioblastoma: a randomized trial.INTRODUCTION: A pilot study of temozolomide (TMZ) given before radiotherapy (RT) for anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) and glioblastoma (GBM) resulted in prolonged survival compared to historical controls receiving RT alone.We therefore investigated neoadjuvant TMZ (NeoTMZ) in a randomized trial.During enrollment, concomitant and adjuvant radio-chemotherapy with TMZ became standard treatment.The trial was amended to include concurrent TMZ.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients, after surgery for GBM or AA, age </=60 years and performance status (PS) 0-2, were randomized to either 2-3 cycles of TMZ, 200 mg/m(2) days 1-5 every 28 days, followed by RT 60 Gy in 30 fractions or RT only.Patients without progressive disease after two TMZ cycles, received the third cycle.From March 2005, TMZ 75 mg/m(2) was administered daily concomitant with RT.TMZ was recommended first-line treatment at progression.Primary endpoint was overall survival and secondary safety.RESULTS: The study closed prematurely after enrolling 144 patients, 103 with GBM and 41 with AA.Median age was 53 years (range 24-60) and 89 (62%) were male.PS was 0-1 for 133 (92%) patients, 53 (37%) had complete surgical resection and 18 (12%) biopsy.Ninety-two (64%) received TMZ concomitant with RT.Seventy-two (50%) were randomized to neoadjuvant treatment.For the overall study population survival was 20.3 months for RT and 17.7 months for NeoTMZ (p = .76), this not reaching the primary objective.For the preplanned subgroup analysis, we found that NeoTMZ AA patients had a median survival of 95.1 months compared to 35.2 months for RT (p = .022).For patients with GBM, no difference in survival was observed (p = .10).MGMT and IDH status affected outcome.CONCLUSIONS: No advantage of NeoTMZ was noted for the overall study population or subgroup of GBM, while NeoTMZ resulted in 5 years longer median survival for patients diagnosed as AA.",0,0,0,0
22335737,"Semuloparin for thromboprophylaxis in patients receiving chemotherapy for cancer.BACKGROUND: Patients receiving chemotherapy for cancer are at increased risk for venous thromboembolism.Limited data support the clinical benefit of antithrombotic prophylaxis.METHODS: In this double-blind, multicenter trial, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of the ultra-low-molecular-weight heparin semuloparin for prevention of venous thromboembolism in patients receiving chemotherapy for cancer.Patients with metastatic or locally advanced solid tumors who were beginning to receive a course of chemotherapy were randomly assigned to receive subcutaneous semuloparin, 20 mg once daily, or placebo until there was a change of chemotherapy regimen.The primary efficacy outcome was the composite of any symptomatic deep-vein thrombosis, any nonfatal pulmonary embolism, and death related to venous thromboembolism.Clinically relevant bleeding (major and nonmajor) was the main safety outcome.RESULTS: The median treatment duration was 3.5 months.Venous thromboembolism occurred in 20 of 1608 patients (1.2%) receiving semuloparin, as compared with 55 of 1604 (3.4%) receiving placebo (hazard ratio, 0.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.21 to 0.60; P<0.001), with consistent efficacy among subgroups defined according to the origin and stage of cancer and the baseline risk of venous thromboembolism.The incidence of clinically relevant bleeding was 2.8% and 2.0% in the semuloparin and placebo groups, respectively (hazard ratio, 1.40; 95% CI, 0.89 to 2.21).Major bleeding occurred in 19 of 1589 patients (1.2%) receiving semuloparin and 18 of 1583 (1.1%) receiving placebo (hazard ratio, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.55 to 1.99).Incidences of all other adverse events were similar in the two study groups.CONCLUSIONS: Semuloparin reduces the incidence of thromboembolic events in patients receiving chemotherapy for cancer, with no apparent increase in major bleeding.(Funded by Sanofi; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00694382.).",0,0,0,0
28159846,"Standardised versus individualised multiherb Chinese herbal medicine for oligomenorrhoea and amenorrhoea in polycystic ovary syndrome: a randomised feasibility and pilot study in the UK.OBJECTIVES: To explore feasibility of a randomised study using standardised or individualised multiherb Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) for oligomenorrhoea and amenorrhoea in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), to pilot study methods and to obtain clinical data to support sample size calculations.DESIGN: Prospective, pragmatic, randomised feasibility and pilot study with participant and practitioner blinding.SETTING: 2 private herbal practices in the UK.PARTICIPANTS: 40 women diagnosed with PCOS and oligomenorrhoea or amenorrhoea following Rotterdam criteria.INTERVENTION: 6 months of either standardised CHM or individualised CHM, 16 g daily taken orally as a tea.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Our primary objective was to determine whether oligomenorrhoea and amenorrhoea were appropriate as the primary outcome measures for the main study.Estimates of treatment effects were obtained for menstrual rate, body mass index (BMI), weight and hirsutism.Data were collected regarding safety, feasibility and acceptability.RESULTS: Of the 40 participants recruited, 29 (72.5%) completed the study.The most frequently cited symptoms of concern were hirsutism, weight and menstrual irregularity.Statistically significant improvements in menstrual rates were found at 6 months within group for both standardised CHM (mean difference (MD) 0.18+/-0.06, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.29; p=0.0027) and individualised CHM (MD 0.27+/-0.06, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.39; p<0.001), though not between group (p=0.26).No improvements were observed for BMI nor for weight in either group.Improvements in hirsutism scores found within group for both groups were not statistically significant between group (p=0.09).Liver and kidney function and adverse events data were largely normal.Participant feedback suggests changing to tablet administration could facilitate adherence.CONCLUSIONS: A CHM randomised controlled trial for PCOS is feasible and preliminary data suggest that both individualised and standardised multiherb CHMs have similar safety profiles and clinical effects on promoting menstrual regularity.These data will inform the design of a study in primary care that will incorporate an appropriate control.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN 31072075; Results.",1,0,0,0
25066875,"Prostate capsule sparing versus nerve sparing radical cystectomy for bladder cancer: results of a randomized, controlled trial.PURPOSE: Prostate capsule sparing and nerve sparing cystectomies are alternative procedures for bladder cancer that may decrease morbidity while achieving cancer control.However, to our knowledge the comparative effectiveness of these approaches has not been established.We evaluated functional and oncologic outcomes in patients undergoing these procedures.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a single institution trial in patients with bladder cancer in whom transurethral prostatic urethral biopsy and transrectal prostate biopsy were negative.Men were randomized to prostate capsule sparing or nerve sparing cystectomy with neobladder creation and stratified by Sexual Health Inventory for Men score (greater than 21 vs 21 or less).Our primary end point was 12-month overall urinary function as measured by Bladder Cancer Index.Secondary end points included sexual function, cancer control and complications.RESULTS: A total of 40 patients were enrolled in the study with 20 patients in each arm.Urinary function at 12 months decreased by 13 and 28 points in the prostate capsule and nerve sparing groups, respectively (p = 0.10).Sexual function followed a similar pattern (p = 0.06).There was no difference in recurrence-free, metastasis-free or overall survival (each p >0.05).The rate of incidentally detected prostate cancer was similar (p = 0.15).CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides a randomized comparison of prostate capsule sparing and nerve sparing cystectomy techniques.We found no difference in functional or oncologic outcomes between the 2 approaches, although our study was underpowered due to a lack of patient accrual.",0,0,0,0
26715229,"Long-Term Effects of Two Formats of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia Comorbid with Breast Cancer.STUDY OBJECTIVES: The goal of this randomized controlled trial, conducted in breast cancer patients, was to assess the long-term efficacy of a video-based cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (VCBT-I), as compared to a professionally administered intervention (PCBT-I) and to a no-treatment group (CTL).An earlier report revealed that, at posttreatment, VCBT-I patients showed significantly greater sleep improvements than CTL, but that PCBT-I produced superior effects than VCBT-I on some sleep and secondary outcomes.In this report, long-term effects are compared.METHODS: Two hundred forty-two women with breast cancer and with insomnia symptoms or using hypnotic medications participated to this three-arm randomized controlled trial: (1) PCBT-I (n = 81); (2) VCBT-I (n = 80); or (3) no treatment (CTL; n = 81) group.PCBT-I was composed of six weekly, individual sessions of approximately 50 min, whereas VCBT-I comprised a 60-min animated video and six booklets.RESULTS: Study measures (sleep and secondary variables) were administered at pretreatment and posttreatment, and at a 3-, 6-, and 12-mo follow-up.Treatment gains were well sustained at follow-up in both PCBT-I and VCBT-I. As at posttreatment, the remission rate of insomnia at follow-up was greater in PCBT-I than in VCBT-I, which was greater than in CTL.CONCLUSIONS: Although face-to-face therapy remains the optimal format to efficaciously administer CBT for insomnia in cancer patients, a minimal intervention, such as the video-based intervention tested in this study, produces significant and sustainable treatment effects.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00674830.",1,1,0,0

24560287,"A comparison of two methods for estimating DCE-MRI parameters via individual and cohort based AIFs in prostate cancer: a step towards practical implementation.Multi-parametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging, and specifically Dynamic Contrast Enhanced (DCE) MRI, play increasingly important roles in detection and staging of prostate cancer (PCa).One of the actively investigated approaches to DCE MRI analysis involves pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling to extract quantitative parameters that may be related to microvascular properties of the tissue.It is well-known that the prescribed arterial blood plasma concentration (or Arterial Input Function, AIF) input can have significant effects on the parameters estimated by PK modeling.The purpose of our study was to investigate such effects in DCE MRI data acquired in a typical clinical PCa setting.First, we investigated how the choice of a semi-automated or fully automated image-based individualized AIF (iAIF) estimation method affects the PK parameter values; and second, we examined the use of method-specific averaged AIF (cohort-based, or cAIF) as a means to attenuate the differences between the two AIF estimation methods.Two methods for automated image-based estimation of individualized (patient-specific) AIFs, one of which was previously validated for brain and the other for breast MRI, were compared.cAIFs were constructed by averaging the iAIF curves over the individual patients for each of the two methods.Pharmacokinetic analysis using the Generalized kinetic model and each of the four AIF choices (iAIF and cAIF for each of the two image-based AIF estimation approaches) was applied to derive the volume transfer rate (K(trans)) and extravascular extracellular volume fraction (ve) in the areas of prostate tumor.Differences between the parameters obtained using iAIF and cAIF for a given method (intra-method comparison) as well as inter-method differences were quantified.The study utilized DCE MRI data collected in 17 patients with histologically confirmed PCa.Comparison at the level of the tumor region of interest (ROI) showed that the two automated methods resulted in significantly different (p<0.05) mean estimates of ve, but not of K(trans).Comparing cAIF, different estimates for both ve, and K(trans) were obtained.Intra-method comparison between the iAIF- and cAIF-driven analyses showed the lack of effect on ve, while K(trans) values were significantly different for one of the methods.Our results indicate that the choice of the algorithm used for automated image-based AIF determination can lead to significant differences in the values of the estimated PK parameters.K(trans)estimates are more sensitive to the choice between cAIF/iAIF as compared to ve, leading to potentially significant differences depending on the AIF method.These observations may have practical consequences in evaluating the PK analysis results obtained in a multi-site setting.",0,0,0,0
26502987,"School-based brief psycho-educational intervention to raise adolescent cancer awareness and address barriers to medical help-seeking about cancer: a cluster randomised controlled trial.OBJECTIVES: Raising cancer awareness and addressing barriers to help-seeking may improve early diagnosis.The aim was to assess whether a psycho-educational intervention increased adolescents' cancer awareness and addressed help-seeking barriers.METHODS: This was a cluster randomised controlled trial involving 2173 adolescents in 20 schools.The intervention was a 50-min presentation delivered by a member of Teenage Cancer Trust's (UK charity) education team.Schools were stratified by deprivation and roll size and randomly allocated to intervention/control conditions within these strata.Outcome measures were the number of cancer warning signs and cancer risk factors recognised, help-seeking barriers endorsed and cancer communication.Communication self-efficacy and intervention fidelity were also assessed.RESULTS: Regression models showed significant differences in the number of cancer warning signs and risk factors recognised between intervention and control groups.In intervention schools, the greatest increases in recognition of cancer warning signs at 6-month follow-up were for unexplained weight loss (from 44.2% to 62.0%) and change in the appearance of a mole (from 46.3% to 70.7%), up by 17.8% and 24.4%, respectively.Greatest increases in recognition of cancer risk factors were for getting sunburnt more than once as a child (from 41.0% to 57.6%) and being overweight (from 42.7% to 55.5%), up by 16.6% and 12.8%, respectively.Regression models showed that adolescents in intervention schools were 2.7 times more likely to discuss cancer at 2-week follow-up compared with the control group.No differences in endorsement of barriers to help-seeking were observed.CONCLUSIONS: School-based brief psycho-educational interventions are easy to deliver, require little resource and improve cancer awareness.(c) 2015 The Authors.Psycho-Oncology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",0,0,0,0

34086740,"Digitalization of adverse event management in oncology to improve treatment outcome-A prospective study protocol.The occurrence of adverse events frequently accompanies tumor treatments.Side effects should be detected and treated as soon as possible to maintain the best possible treatment outcome.Besides the standard reporting system Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), physicians have recognized the potential of patient-reporting systems.These are based on a more subjective description of current patient reporting symptoms.Patient-reported symptoms are essential to define the impact of a given treatment on the quality of life and the patient's wellbeing.They also act against an underreporting of side effects which are paramount to define the actual value of a treatment for the individual patient.Here, we present a study protocol for a clinical trial that assesses the potential of a smartphone application for CTCAE conform symptom reporting and tracking that is adjusted to the standard clinical reporting system rather than symptom oriented descriptive trial tools.The presented study will be implemented in two parts, both lasting over six months.The first part will assess the feasibility of the application with 30 patients non-randomly divided into three equally-sized age groups (<55years, 55-75years, >75years).In the second part 36 other patients will be randomly assigned to two groups, one reporting using the smartphone and one not.This prospective second part will compare the impact of smartphone reported adverse events regarding applied therapy doses and quality of life to those of patients receiving standard care.We aim for early detection and treatment of adverse events in oncological treatment to improve patients' safety and outcomes.For this purpose, we will capture frequent adverse events of chemotherapies, immunotherapies, or other targeted therapies with our smartphone application.The presented trial is registered at the U.S. National Library of Medicine ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04493450) on July 30, 2020.",0,0,0,0
23261355,"Risk of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia during follow-up in HPV-positive women according to baseline p16-INK4A results: a prospective analysis of a nested substudy of the NTCC randomised controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Immunostaining for p16-INK4A (henceforth p16) is a sensitive and specific method for detection of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) in women infected with human papillomavirus (HPV), but longitudinal data have not been obtained.We investigated the relation between p16 status and risk of CIN during 3 years of follow-up.METHODS: Women aged 25-60 years were enrolled between June 10, 2003, and Dec 31, 2004, in a multicentre randomised trial comparing HPV testing with cytology.HPV-positive women were referred for colposcopy and, in seven of nine centres, were tested for p16 overexpression by immunostaining.If no CIN was detected, these women were followed up at yearly intervals until clearance of HPV infection.The primary endpoint was histologically confirmed CIN of grade 2 or worse (CIN of grade 2 [CIN2], CIN of grade 3 [CIN3], or invasive cervical cancer) at recruitment or during follow-up.We calculated the absolute and relative risks by p16 status at recruitment.We also calculated the longitudinal sensitivity of p16 testing.Additionally, we assessed the relative sensitivity of an alternative strategy (referral to colposcopy and follow-up of only HPV-positive, p16-positive women) versus conventional cytology in two age groups.Percentages were weighted by the inverse of the tested fraction.The trial in which this study is nested is registered, number ISRCTN81678807.FINDINGS: Of 1042 HPV-positive women who were tested for p16 with no CIN detected during the first round of screening, 944 (91%) had further HPV tests.793 (84%) of these 944 were followed up until detection of CIN2 or worse, HPV infection clearance, or for at least 3 years.CIN2 or worse was detected during follow-up in more p16-positive women (31 of 365, 8.8% [95% CI 5.8-11.8]) than in p16-negative women (17 of 579, 3.7% [1.9-5.4]; relative risk [RR] 2.61 [95% CI 1.49-4.59]).RR was higher in women aged 35-60 years at recruitment (3.37 [1.39-8.15]) than in those aged 25-34 years (2.15 [1.00-4.61]), but age was not a significant modifier.CIN3 or worse was detected during follow-up in more p16-positive women (16 of 365, 4.4% [2.3-6.6]) than in p16-negative women (six of 579, 1.3% [0.2-2.3]; RR 3.90 [95% CI 1.57-9.68]).Longitudinal sensitivity of p16 testing for detection of CIN3 or worse during follow-up at all ages was 77.8% (95% CI 63.9-91.6).The relative sensitivity of the alternative strategy compared with conventional cytology was 2.08 (1.13-3.56) in women aged 35-60 years and 2.86 (1.28-5.36) in those aged 25-34 years.HPV-positive, p16-negative women aged 35-60 years had a higher cumulative risk of CIN3 or worse during recruitment or follow-up (2.0%, 95% CI 0.3-3.7) than did HPV-negative women (0.01%, 0-0.04) or those who were cytologically normal (0.04%, 0.02-0.09) at recruitment.INTERPRETATION: p16 overexpression is a marker for CIN2 or worse or for development of CIN2 or worse within 3 years in HPV-positive women, especially those aged 35-60 years.HPV-positive, p16-positive women need immediate colposcopy and, if the assessment is negative, annual follow-up.Immediate colposcopy can be avoided in HPV-positive, p16-negative women, who can be safely managed with repeat screening after 2-3 year intervals.FUNDING: European Union; Italian Ministry of Health; Regional Health Administrations of Piemonte, Tuscany, Veneto and Emilia Romagna; and Public Health Agency of Lazio Region.",0,0,0,0

31209957,"Periprostatic nerve block alone versus combined with perineal pudendal nerve block or intrarectal local anesthesia during transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy: A prospective randomized controlled trial.OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacy, safety and cost of combinations of perineal pudendal nerve block + periprostatic nerve block and intrarectal local anesthesia + periprostatic nerve block with the standard technique (periprostatic nerve block).METHODS: The study was designed as a randomized prospective controlled trial.Patients with elevated serum prostate-specific antigen values (prostate-specific antigen >/=4 ng/mL) and/or abnormal digital rectal examination findings were included in the study.Patients with anorectal diseases, chronic prostatitis, previous history of prostate biopsy and anorectal surgery were excluded from the study.A total of 148 patients (group 1 [periprostatic nerve block], n = 48; group 2 [intrarectal local anesthesia + periprostatic nerve block], n = 51; group 3 [perineal pudendal nerve block + periprostatic nerve block], n = 49) were included in the final analysis.Pain during insertion and manipulation of the transrectal ultrasound probe was recorded as visual analog scale 1, pain during penetration of the biopsy needle into the prostate and sampling was recorded as visual analog scale 2, and pain during the entire procedure recorded as visual analog scale 3.RESULTS: The mean visual analog scale 1 score was significantly lower in group 3, when compared with group 1 and group 2 (P < 0.001).There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of the mean visual analog scale 2 score.The mean visual analog scale 3 score was significantly lower in group 3 when compared with other groups (P < 0.001).The total cost for transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy in the intrarectal local anesthesia + periprostatic nerve block group was significantly higher than the other two groups.CONCLUSIONS: The combination of perineal pudendal nerve block and periprostatic nerve block provides more effective pain control than intrarectal local anesthesia plus periprostatic nerve block and periprostatic nerve block alone, with similar complication rates and without increasing cost.",0,0,0,0
25604851,"Randomized multicenter phase III study of a modified docetaxel and cisplatin plus fluorouracil regimen compared with cisplatin and fluorouracil as first-line therapy for advanced or locally recurrent gastric cancer.BACKGROUND: The V325 study showed that docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil (DCF) prolonged overall survival (OS) of patients with advanced gastric cancer, but with a high incidence of dose-limiting toxicities.We investigated the efficacy and safety of a modified DCF (mDCF) regimen for Chinese patients with advanced gastric cancer.METHODS: Untreated advanced gastric cancer patients randomly received docetaxel and cisplatin at 60 mg/m(2) (day 1) followed by fluorouracil at 600 mg/m(2)/day (days 1-5; mDCF regimen) or cisplatin at 75 mg/m(2) (day 1) followed by fluorouracil at 600 mg/m(2)/day (days 1-5; CF) every 3 weeks.The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS).The secondary end points were OS, overall response rate (ORR), time-to-treatment failure (TTF), and safety.RESULTS: In total, 243 patients were randomized to treatment (mDCF regimen 121; CF 122).Compared with CF, the mDCF regimen significantly improved PFS and OS: the median PFS was 7.2 and 4.9 months, respectively [hazard ratio (HR) 0.58, log-rank P = 0.0008], and the median OS was 10.2 and 8.5 months, respectively (HR = 0.71, P = 0.0319).Additionally, the mDCF regimen improved the parameters used as secondary objectives: the ORR was 48.7% with the mDCF regimen versus 33.9% with CF (P = 0.0244); the median TTF was 3.4 months with the mDCF regimen and 2.4 months with CF (HR = 0.67, P = 0.0027).Grade 3 and grade 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 77.3 % of patients who received the mDCF regimen versus 46.1% of patients who received CF (P < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: The mDCF regimen, compared with CF, significantly prolonged PFS and OS and enhanced ORR of Chinese patients with advanced gastric cancer.The mDCF regimen achieved efficacy comparable to that of DCF but with fewer toxicities, which is appropriate for the Chinese population.",1,1,1,0
29546523,"The effectiveness of solution-focused brief therapy for psychological distress among Chinese parents of children with a cancer diagnosis: a pilot randomized controlled trial.PURPOSE: Given the critical role of parental care for pediatric cancer patients, this pilot study evaluated the feasibility and effectiveness of a hospital-based solution-focused brief therapy (SFBT) intervention for reducing psychological distress among parents of pediatric cancer patients in China.Differences between treatment and active control (AC) groups were assessed on dimensions of psychological distress.Parents' level of hope was also assessed.METHODS: Participants (N = 44) were randomly assigned to SFBT or AC.Parents received four sessions of SFBT twice a week delivered by graduate-level hospital social workers.Pre- and post-intervention assessments measured change in distress (depression, anxiety, and somatization symptoms) of parents as well as their level of hope.RESULTS: Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) indicated the SFBT group had better outcomes than the AC group on overall distress of somatic, anxiety, depression symptoms and level of hope.Within- and between-group treatment effects reported significantly greater effect of the SFBT group than of the AC group.CONCLUSIONS: Considering the inherent limits of a pilot feasibility study, results suggest that SFBT is a feasible, culturally compatible, and promising intervention for alleviating distress among Chinese parents of children with cancer.Additional comprehensive trials are needed to draw more definitive conclusions.RELEVANCE: SFBT may be beneficial for improving the critical support systems of parents of pediatric cancer patients.Thus, SFBT may have the potential to enhance children's well-being during cancer treatment and recovery.",0,0,0,0
24241787,"Circulating hormones and breast cancer risk in premenopausal women: a randomized trial of low-dose tamoxifen and fenretinide.Tamoxifen and fenretinide have been extensively studied and exhibit breast cancer-preventing activity.We aimed to assess their effect on sex hormones, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and retinol, and their association with mammographic density (MD) and breast cancer events.In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, premenopausal women at risk for breast cancer were randomized to tamoxifen 5 mg/day, fenretinide, both agents, or placebo for 2 years.We measured MD and circulating concentrations of follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol, progesterone, testosterone, androstenedione, dehydro-epiandrosteronesulfate, prolactin, SHBG, and retinol at baseline and on yearly intervals.The associations with breast cancer events were evaluated through competing risk and Cox regression survival models.Low-dose tamoxifen markedly and enduringly increased SHBG, whereas the increases in testosterone, estradiol, and prolactin and reduction in LH weakened after 1 year.Fenretinide increased testosterone and androstenedione and decreased retinol.MD correlated directly with SHBG and inversely with retinol.After a median follow-up of 12 years, the 10-year cumulative incidence of breast cancer events was 37 % in women with SHBG </= 59.3 nmol/L, 22 % in women with SHBG between 59.3 and 101 nmol/L, and 19 % in women with SHBG > 101 nmol/L (P = 0.018).The difference among SHBG tertiles remained statistically significant at multivariable analysis: HR = 2.26 (95 % CI 1.04, 4.89) for the lowest versus the highest tertile.We conclude that low-dose tamoxifen or fenretinide exhibits favorable hormonal profiles as single agents, further supporting their administration for prevention of breast cancer in premenopause.Notably, SHBG levels were inversely associated with breast neoplastic events.",1,1,0,0
27041692,"Blood graft cellular composition and posttransplant outcomes in myeloma patients mobilized with or without low-dose cyclophosphamide: a randomized comparison.BACKGROUND: Autologous stem cell transplantation is a standard treatment in multiple myeloma (MM).Blood grafts are usually collected after mobilization with granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) alone or in a combination with cyclophosphamide (CY).There is limited knowledge of the possible effects of different mobilization regimens on blood graft characteristics and posttransplant outcomes.STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Thirty-eight patients with MM were included in this study.The patients were randomly assigned at registration to mobilization with either low-dose CY plus G-CSF (Arm A) or G-CSF alone (Arm B) and received three cycles of lenalidomide, bortetzomib, and dexamethasone induction.Flow cytometry analysis of lymphocyte subsets in the blood grafts after cryopreservation was performed.Hematologic and immune recovery were evaluated up to 12 months posttransplant.RESULTS: The blood grafts in Arm A contained significantly more CD34+ cells but in Arm B there was a greater proportion of CD34+CD38- cells and higher numbers of T and B lymphocytes as well as natural killer (NK) cells.The engraftment was comparable but lymphocyte count at 15 days posttransplant was higher in Arm B (0.8 x 10(9) /L vs. 0.5 x 10(9) /L, p = 0.033).At 3 and 6 months posttransplant the total number of NK cells was also higher in G-CSF-mobilized patients.There was no difference in progression-free survival between the study arms.CONCLUSION: CY plus G-GSF yields more CD34+ cells but seems to diminish lymphocyte and NK cell counts in the grafts and hampers immune recovery after transplantation.Thus G-CSF alone might be a preferred mobilization method due to more rapid immune recovery posttransplant.",0,0,0,0
30610781,"Combination versus sequential paclitaxel plus gemcitabine as first-line chemotherapy for women with metastatic breast cancer: a prospective randomized phase II study.PURPOSE: Paclitaxel (T) plus gemcitabine (G) is an active concomitant combination for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer (MBC).However, the efficacy of sequential administration of these two drugs is unclear.This randomized phase II study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of T and G administered either as a concomitant or as a sequential regimen in patients with MBC.METHODS: Patients with MBC (n=66) were randomized to either receive 6 cycles of concomitant T and G or 4 cycles of T followed by 4 cycles of G, as first line chemotherapy.With no progression, the arms would switch to maintenance with paclitaxel.Progression free survival (PFS) was defined as the primary endpoint; secondary endpoints were the overall response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), and toxicity.In total, 33 patients were randomized to the concomitant or sequential arms.Patient characteristics were well balanced.The median number of chemotherapy cycles was 6 for the concomitant arm and 8 for the sequential arm.RESULTS: No significant difference was observed in terms of PFS, ORR, and OS.Only 13 (39.4%) patients progressed in the sequential arm.Although there was no significant difference between the two arms (p=0.056),the sequential arm had a remarkable trend of longer PFS than the concomitant arm.Toxicities were manageable and similar in both arms.The incidence of neutropenia was significantly higher in the concomitant arm (90.9%) than in the sequential arm (60.6%).Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was not significantly different between the two arms.CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant and sequential treatment with paclitaxel and gemcitabine had no significant difference in terms of PFS.",0,0,0,0
28961845,"Borealis-1: a randomized, first-line, placebo-controlled, phase II study evaluating apatorsen and chemotherapy for patients with advanced urothelial cancer.Background: Five-year survival of patients with inoperable, advanced urothelial carcinoma treated with the first-line chemotherapy is 5%-15%.We assessed whether the Hsp27 inhibitor apatorsen combined with gemcitabine plus cisplatin (GC) could improve overall survival (OS) in these patients.Patients and methods: This placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase II trial randomized 183 untreated urothelial carcinoma patients (North America and Europe) to receive GC plus either placebo (N = 62), 600 mg apatorsen (N = 60), or 1000 mg apatorsen (N = 61).In the experimental arm, treatment included loading doses of apatorsen followed by up to six cycles of apatorsen plus GC.Patients receiving at least four cycles could continue apatorsen monotherapy as maintenance until progression or unacceptable toxicity.The primary end point was OS.Results: OS was not significantly improved in the single or combined 600- or 1000-mg apatorsen arms versus placebo [hazard ratio (HR), 0.86 and 0.90, respectively].Exploratory study of specific statistical modeling showed a trend for improved survival in patients with baseline poor prognostic features treated with 600 mg apatorsen compared with placebo (HR = 0.72).Landmark analysis of serum Hsp27 (sHsp27) levels showed a trend toward survival benefit for poor-prognosis patients in 600- and 1000-mg apatorsen arms who achieved lower area under the curve sHsp27 levels, compared with the placebo arm (HR = 0.45 and 0.62, respectively).Higher baseline circulating tumor cells (>/=5 cells/7.5 ml) was observed in patients with poor prognosis in correlation with poor survival.Treatment-emergent adverse events were manageable and more common in both apatorsen-treatment arms.Conclusions: Even though apatorsen combined with standard chemotherapy did not demonstrate a survival benefit in the overall study population, patients with poor prognostic features might benefit from this combination.Serum Hsp27 levels may act as a biomarker to predict treatment outcome.Further exploration of apatorsen in poor-risk patients is warranted.",1,1,1,1
29502856,"Differences between palpable and nonpalpable tumors in early-stage, hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.BACKGROUND: We compared characteristics and outcomes of palpable versus nonpalpable, hormone-sensitive, early-stage breast cancers.METHODS: Patients from the North American Fareston vs. Tamoxifen Adjuvant (NAFTA) trial were divided into palpable (n=513) and nonpalpable (n=1063) tumor groups.Differences in pathological features, loco-regional therapy, disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed.RESULTS: Patients with palpable tumors were older, had larger tumors, and higher rates of lymph-node involvement.The tumors were more likely to be poorly differentiated, of high nuclear grade, and display lymphovascular invasion.After mean followup of 59 months, DFS and OS were significantly lower for palpable than nonpalpable tumors (DFS 93.5% vs. 98.4%, p<0.001, OS 88.5% vs. 95.6%, p<0.001).Controlling for age, size and nodal status, palpability was an independent factor for DFS (OR=2.56; 95%CI, 1.37-4.79, p=0.003) and OS (OR=2.12; 95%CI, 1.38-3.28, p<0.001).CONCLUSIONS: In a group of hormone-sensitive, mostly postmenopausal early-stage breast cancer patients, palpable tumors were more likely to have more aggressive features and metastatic potential, which translated in to a higher incidence of breast cancer-related events and worse overall survival.",1,1,1,0

27383814,"Effect of Triclosan-Coated Suture and Antibiotic Prophylaxis on Infection and Recurrence after Karydakis Flap Repair for Pilonidal Disease: A Randomized Parallel-Arm Double-Blinded Clinical Trial.BACKGROUND: Pilonidal sinus disease was first described by Mayo in 1833 as ""a cyst that contains hair."" Although surgical treatment of the lesions can have successful outcomes, it also can be associated with relatively high rates of post-operative infectioins and recurrence.Many studies have demonstrated that triclosan-coated sutures (TCS) decrease surgical site infections.OBJECTIVE: The goal of this randomized parallel-arm double-blind clinical trial was to investigate the ability of antibiotic prophylaxis, and secondarily of antibiotic-coated sutures, to prevent post-operative infections in the surgical management of pilonidal sinus disease.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The initial trial protocol aimed to compare early infections in patients who did and did not undergo antibiotic prophylaxis (AP(+) vs. AP(-)).A secondary goal was to compare the effects of TCS and conventional sutures (CS) on early infectious complication rates in the two groups.The AP(-) arm had to be terminated prematurely because of an unacceptably high rate of infectious complications.RESULTS: A total of 80 micro-organisms were recovered from 74 patients (69.8%).Methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most common isolates (30%).The most frequently detected anaerobic micro-organism was Actinomyces israelii (7.5%).The TCS and CS groups had similar rates of micro-organism growth (65.8% vs. 75.0%).There was no significant difference in the occurrence of wound dehiscence.Over the six-month follow-up, there were two recurrences, both in the TCS group.The difference was not significant.CONCLUSIONS: We believe that antibiotic prophylaxis is necessary in patients scheduled for Karydakis flap repair.In our study, TCS tended to be associated with a lower rate of infection, but this trend did not achieve statistical significance.Anaerobic micro-organisms dominated the infective isolates.",0,0,0,0

34241688,"The combination of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography with blue dye for sentinel lymph node detection in clinically negative node breast cancer.PURPOSE: The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the value of the combination of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) and blue dye (BD) for SLN detection in patients with clinically negative node breast cancer.METHODS: Patients with clinically negative node breast cancer were randomized into two cohorts for SLN biopsy (SLNB): the combination method cohort using CEUS and BD together, and the single BD method cohort.Standard axillary lymph node dissection was performed if any of the SLNs confirmed positive by pathology.The identification rate, the number of SLNs removed and recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates were evaluated between two cohorts.In addition, we assessed the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, false-negative rate of CEUS for diagnosis of SLNs based on patterns of CEUS enhancement.RESULTS: 144 consecutive patients with clinically negative node breast cancer were randomized into two cohorts.Each cohort consisted of 72 cases.In the combination method cohort, contrast-enhanced lymphatic vessels were clearly visualized and SLNs were accurately localized in 72 cases.The identification rate and the mean number of SLNs detected by the combination method were 100% (72/72) and 3.26 (1-9), respectively.In contrast, in the single BD method cohort, SLNs in 69 cases were successfully identified.The identification rate and the mean number of SLNs using BD alone were 95.8% (69/72) and 2.21 (1-4), respectively.According to patterns of CEUS enhancement, the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and the FNR of CEUS for SLN diagnosis were 69.2%, 96.6%, 91.7%, and 30.8%, respectively.After a median follow-up of 50 months for the combination method cohort and 51 months for the blue dye alone cohort, five patients in the combination method cohort and nine in the blue dye alone cohort had recurrence.RFS rates showed no significant difference (P = 0.26) between two cohorts.CONCLUSION: The combination of CEUS and BD is more effective than BD alone for SLNB in clinically negative node patients with an identification rate as high as 100%.Use of BD and CEUS in combination may provide the possibility of a non-radioactive alternative method for SLNB in centers without access to radioisotope.",1,1,0,0
26153513,"Joint symptoms and health-related quality of life in postmenopausal women with breast cancer who completed 5 years of anastrozole.PURPOSE: To assess the joint symptoms and the impact on patients' health-related quality of life (HRQOL) due to5 years of anastrozole from the baseline data in the N-SAS BC 05 trial, a randomized clinical trial was designed to assess the efficacy of 5 additional years of anastrozole among women with breast cancer.METHODS: Joint symptoms and HRQOL were evaluated using an original questionnaire for joint symptoms, the Short Form 36-item Health Survey (SF-36), the EuroQol EQ-5D-3L, and a subscale of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Endocrine Symptoms (FACT-ES).RESULTS: Baseline joint symptom and HRQOL data were collected from 330 patients between November 2007 and March 2010.Joint pain and joint stiffness were reported by 61.6 and 59.1 % of patients, respectively, although these symptoms did not affect the activities of daily living in 96.0 and 97.9 % of patients, respectively.Joint pain was reported in the knee by 61.0 % of patients and in the hand by 36.0 % of patients.Joint stiffness mainly affected the hand (67.9 %), especially the proximal interphalangeal joint, and typically occurred upon waking up or in the morning.Most SF-36 domains had good average scores, although slight decreases in physical functioning and role-physical were observed (compared to the national standard scores).The mean EQ-5D utility score was 0.86, and the total FACT-ES subscale score was 62.2/76.CONCLUSIONS: After 5 years of anastrozole, many of the patients reported joint pain and stiffness in mainly the hand and knee with mild symptoms and good HRQOL.",0,0,0,0
22674191,"Goserelin and bicalutamide treatments alter the expression of microRNAs in the prostate.BACKGROUND: Although endocrine therapy has been used for decades, its influence on the expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) in clinical tissue specimens has not been analyzed.Moreover, the effects of the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion on the expression of miRNAs in hormone naive and endocrine-treated prostate cancers are poorly understood.METHODS: We used clinical material from a neoadjuvant trial consisting of 28 men treated with goserelin (n = 8), bicalutamide (n = 9), or no treatment (n = 11) for 3 months prior to radical prostatectomy.Freshly frozen specimens were used for microarray analysis of 723 human miRNAs.Specific miRNA expression in cancer, benign epithelium and stromal tissue compartments was predicted with an in silico Bayesian modeling tool.RESULTS: The expression of 52, 44, and 34 miRNAs was affected >1.4-fold by the endocrine treatment in the cancer, non-malignant epithelium, and stromal compartments, respectively.Of the 52 miRNAs, only 10 were equally affected by the two treatment modalities in the cancer compartment.Twenty-six of the 52 genes (50%) showed AR binding sites in their proximity in either VCaP or LNCaP cell lines.Forty-seven miRNAs were differentially expressed in TMPRSS2:ERG fusion positive compared with fusion negative cases.Endocrine treatment reduced the differences between fusion positive and negative cases.CONCLUSIONS: Goserelin treatment and bicalutamide treatment mostly affected the expression of different miRNAs.The effect clearly varied in different tissue compartments.TMPRSS2:ERG fusion positive and negative cases showed differential expression of miRNAs, and the difference was diminished by androgen ablation.",0,0,0,0
32910709,"Hypofractionated Versus Standard Fractionated Radiotherapy in Patients With Early Breast Cancer or Ductal Carcinoma In Situ in a Randomized Phase III Trial: The DBCG HYPO Trial.PURPOSE: Given the poor results using hypofractionated radiotherapy for early breast cancer, a dose of 50 Gy in 25 fractions (fr) has been the standard regimen used by the Danish Breast Cancer Group (DBCG) since 1982.Results from more recent trials have stimulated a renewed interest in hypofractionation, and the noninferiority DBCG HYPO trial (ClincalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00909818) was designed to determine whether a dose of 40 Gy in 15 fr does not increase the occurrence of breast induration at 3 years compared with a dose of 50 Gy in 25 fr.PATIENTS AND METHODS: One thousand eight hundred eighty-two patients > 40 years of age who underwent breast-conserving surgery for node-negative breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) were randomly assigned to radiotherapy at a dose of either 50 Gy in 25 fr or 40 Gy in 15 fr.The primary end point was 3-year grade 2-3 breast induration assuming noninferiority regarding locoregional recurrence.RESULTS: A total of 1,854 consenting patients (50 Gy, n = 937; 40 Gy, n = 917) were enrolled from 2009-2014 from eight centers.There were 1,608 patients with adenocarcinoma and 246 patients with DCIS.The 3-year rates of induration were 11.8% (95% CI, 9.7% to 14.1%) in the 50-Gy group and 9.0% (95% CI, 7.2% to 11.1%) in the 40-Gy group (risk difference, -2.7%; 95% CI, -5.6% to 0.2%; P = .07).Systemic therapies and radiotherapy boost did not increase the risk of induration.Telangiectasia, dyspigmentation, scar appearance, edema, and pain were detected at low rates, and cosmetic outcome and patient satisfaction with breast appearance were high with either no difference or better outcome in the 40-Gy cohort compared with the 50-Gy cohort.The 9-year risk of locoregional recurrence was 3.3% (95% CI, 2.0% to 5.0%) in the 50-Gy group and 3.0% (95% CI, 1.9% to 4.5%) in the 40-Gy group (risk difference, -0.3%; 95% CI, -2.3% to 1.7%).The 9-year overall survival was 93.4% (95% CI, 91.1% to 95.1%) in the 50-Gy group and 93.4% (95% CI, 91.0% to 95.2%) in the 40-Gy group.The occurrence of radiation-associated cardiac and lung disease was rare and not influenced by the fractionation regimen.CONCLUSION: Moderately hypofractionated breast irradiation of node-negative breast cancer or DCIS did not result in more breast induration compared with standard fractionated therapy.Other normal tissue effects were minimal, with similar or less frequent rates in the 40-Gy group.The 9-year locoregional recurrence risk was low.",1,1,1,0
27743922,"Prognosis of patients with peritoneal metastatic colorectal cancer given systemic therapy: an analysis of individual patient data from prospective randomised trials from the Analysis and Research in Cancers of the Digestive System (ARCAD) database.BACKGROUND: Patients with peritoneal metastatic colorectal cancer have reduced overall survival compared with patients with metastatic colorectal cancer without peritoneal involvement.Here we further investigated the effect of the number and location of metastases in patients receiving first-line systemic chemotherapy.METHODS: We analysed individual patient data for previously untreated patients enrolled in 14 phase 3 randomised trials done between 1997 and 2008.Trials were included if protocols explicitly pre-specified and solicited for patients with peritoneal involvement in the trial data collection process or had done a formal peritoneum-focused review of individual pre-treatment scans.We used stratified multivariable Cox models to assess the prognostic associations of peritoneal metastatic colorectal cancer with overall survival and progression-free survival, adjusting for other key clinical-pathological factors (age, sex, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score, primary tumour location [colon vs rectum], previous treatment, and baseline BMI).The primary endpoint was difference in overall survival between populations with and without peritoneal metastases.FINDINGS: Individual patient data were available for 10 553 patients.9178 (87%) of 10 553 patients had non-peritoneal metastatic colorectal cancer (4385 with one site of metastasis, 4793 with two or more sites of metastasis), 194 (2%) patients had isolated peritoneal metastatic colorectal cancer, and 1181 (11%) had peritoneal metastatic colorectal cancer and other organ involvement.These groups were similar in age, ethnic origin, and use of targeted treatment.Patients with peritoneal metastatic colorectal cancer were more likely than those with non-peritoneal metastatic colorectal cancer to be women (565 [41%] of 1371 vs 3312 [36%] of 9169 patients; p=0.0003), have colon primary tumours (1116 [84%] of 1334 patients vs 5603 [66%]; p<0.0001), and have performance status of 2 (136 [10%] vs 521 [6%]; p<0.0001).We recorded a higher proportion of patients with mutated BRAF in patients with peritoneal-only (eight [18%] of 44 patients with available data) and peritoneal metastatic colorectal cancer with other sites of metastasis (34 [12%] of 289), compared with patients with non-peritoneal metastatic colorectal cancer (194 [9%] of 2230; p=0.028 comparing the three groups).Overall survival (adjusted HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.63-0.91; p=0.003) was better in patients with isolated non-peritoneal sites than in those with isolated peritoneal metastatic colorectal cancer.Overall survival of patients with two of more non-peritoneal sites of metastasis (adjusted HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.86-1.25, p=0.69) and those with peritoneal metastatic colorectal cancer plus one other site of metastasis (adjusted HR 1.10, 95% CI 0.89-1.37, p=0.37) was similar to those with isolated peritoneal metastases.Compared with patients with isolated peritoneal metastases, those with peritoneal metastases and two or more additional sites of metastasis had the shortest survival (adjusted HR 1.40; CI 1.14-1.71; p=0.0011).INTERPRETATION: Patients with peritoneal metastatic colorectal cancer have significantly shorter overall survival than those with other isolated sites of metastases.In patients with several sites of metastasis, poor survival is a function of both increased number of metastatic sites and peritoneal involvement.The pattern of metastasis and in particular, peritoneal involvement, results in prognostic heterogeneity of metastatic colorectal cancer.FUNDING: None.",0,0,0,0
22715124,"Effects of self-directed stress management training and home-based exercise on quality of life in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy: a randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Research has shown that self-directed stress management training improves mental well-being in patients undergoing chemotherapy.The present study extends this work by evaluating separate and combined effects of stress management training and home-based exercise.METHOD: Following assessment of mental and physical well-being, depression, anxiety, exercise, and stress reduction activity before chemotherapy started, patients were randomized to stress management training (SM), exercise (EX), combined stress management and exercise (SMEX), or usual care only (UCO).Outcomes were reassessed 6 and 12 weeks after chemotherapy started.Significance testing of group-by-time interactions in 286 patients who completed all assessments was used to evaluate intervention efficacy.RESULTS: Interaction effects for mental and physical well-being scores were not significant.Depression scores yielded a linear interaction comparing UCO and SMEX (p = 0.019), with decreases in SMEX but not UCO.Anxiety scores yielded a quadratic interaction comparing UCO and SMEX (p = 0.049), with trends for changes in SMEX but not UCO.Additional analyses yielded quadratic interactions for exercise activity comparing UCO and SMEX (p = 0.022), with positive changes in SMEX but not UCO, and for stress management activity comparing UCO and SM (p < 0.001) and UCO and SMEX (p = 0.013), with positive changes in SM and SMEX but not UCO.CONCLUSION: Only the combined intervention yielded effects on quality of life outcomes, and these were limited to anxiety and depression.These findings are consistent with evidence that only the combined intervention yielded increases in both exercise and stress management activity.Future research should investigate ways to augment this intervention to enhance its benefits.",0,0,0,0

24162448,"A randomized controlled trial of diet and physical activity in BRCA mutation carriers.High serum levels of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) are associated with an increased risk of sporadic breast cancer (BC).Furthermore, insulin and markers of insulin resistance, such as abdominal obesity, high blood glucose, high serum testosterone and metabolic syndrome, may affect both BC incidence and prognosis.We hypothesized that all these factors might be relevant also for hereditary BC, due to a deleterious mutation of BRCA genes.Epidemiological observation suggested that weight, energy intake (usually associated with higher bio-availability of growth factors) and physical activity may be relevant in BRCA mutation carriers.Mechanistic studies hypothesized a functional interaction between BRCA genes and the IGF-I system.We have provided some evidence that high serum levels of IGF-I are associated with a significantly increased penetrance.We are recruiting a larger cohort of BRCA mutation carriers in order to test potential modulators of penetrance and prognosis.Within this cohort, we have planned a randomized controlled trial to test whether moderate calorie and protein restriction, together with physical activity, decrease IGF-I. Eligible study subjects are women with or without BC, aged 18-70, with a proven deleterious BRCA mutation, and without metastases.All the women will receive recommendations for the dietary prevention of cancer.The women will be then randomized into an active life-style intervention group and into a control group that will receive only the baseline recommendations.We expect to significantly reduce IGF-I in the intervention group.This trial and the subsequent cohort follow-up might open up primary prevention options for genetic BC.",0,0,0,0

Rates of grade 3/4 adverse events were 51.9%, 93.9%, and 60.0% in arms A, B, and C, respectively.VEN + BR led to increased toxicity and lower dose intensity of BR than in arm C, but efficacy was similar.Optimizing dose and schedule to maintain BR dose intensity may improve efficacy and tolerability of VEN + BR, while VEN + R data warrant further study.This study was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT02187861.",0,0,0,0
32529467,"A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of B-cell lymphoma 2 homology 3 mimetic gossypol combined with docetaxel and cisplatin for advanced non-small cell lung cancer with high expression of apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1.Background Overexpression of apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) is an important cause of poor chemotherapeutic efficacy in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.Gossypol, a new inhibitor of APE1, in combination with docetaxel and cisplatin is believed to improve the efficacy of chemotherapy for advanced NSCLC with high APE1 expression.Methods Sixty-two patients were randomly assigned to two groups.Thirty-one patients in the experimental group received 75 mg/m(2) docetaxel and 75 mg/m(2) cisplatin on day 1 with gossypol administered at 20 mg once daily on days 1 to 14 every 21 days.The control group received placebo with the same docetaxel and cisplatin regimen.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS); secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), response rate, and toxicity.Results There were no significant differences in PFS and OS between the experimental group and the control group.The median PFS (mPFS) in the experimental and control groups was 7.43 and 4.9 months, respectively (HR = 0.54; p = 0.06), and the median OS (mOS) was 18.37 and 14.7 months, respectively (HR = 0.68; p = 0.27).No significant differences in response rate and serious adverse events were found between the groups.Conclusion The experimental group had a better mPFS and mOS than did the control group, though no significant difference was observed.Because the regimen of gossypol combined with docetaxel and cisplatin was well tolerated, future studies with larger sample sizes should be performed.",1,1,1,1
26620555,"A safety study of transumbilical single incision versus conventional laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) is an emerging minimally invasive surgery to reduce abdominal incisions.However, despite the increasing clinical application of SILS, no evidence from large-scale, randomized controlled trials is available for assessing the feasibility, short-term safety, oncological safety, and potential benefits of SILS compared with conventional laparoscopic surgery (CLS) for colorectal cancer.METHODS/DESIGN: This is a single-center, open-label, noninferiority, randomized controlled trial.A total of 198 eligible patients will be randomly assigned to transumbilical single incision plus one port laparoscopic surgery (SILS plus one) group or to a CLS group at a 1:1 ratio.Patients ranging in age from 18 to 80 years with rectosigmoid cancer diagnosed as cT1-4aN0-2 M0 and a tumor size no larger than 5 cm are considered eligible.The primary endpoint is early morbidity, as evaluated by an independent investigator.Secondary outcomes include operative outcomes (operative time, estimated blood loss, and incision length), pathologic outcomes (tumor size, length of proximal and distal resection margins, and number of harvested lymph nodes), postoperative inflammatory and immune responses (white blood cells [WBC], neutrophil percentage [NE %], C-reactive protein [CRP], interleukin-6 [IL-6], and tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-alpha]), postoperative recovery (time to first ambulation, flatus, liquid diet, soft diet, and duration of hospital stay), pain intensity, body image and cosmetic assessment, 3-year disease free survival (DFS), and 5-year overall survival (OS).Follow-up visits are scheduled for 1 and 3 months after surgery, then every 3 months for the first 2 years and every 6 months for the next 3 years.DISCUSSION: This trial will provide valuable clinical evidence for the objective assessment of the feasibility, safety, and potential benefits of SILS plus one compared with CLS for the radical resection of rectosigmoid cancer.The hypothesis is that SILS plus one is feasible for the radical resection of rectosigmoid cancer and offers short-term safety and long-term oncological safety comparable to that of CLS, and that SILS plus one offers better cosmetic results and faster convalescence compared to CLS.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02117557 (registered on 16 April 2014).",0,0,0,0

33373276,"Augmented Reduced-Intensity Regimen Does Not Improve Postallogeneic Transplant Outcomes in Acute Myeloid Leukemia.PURPOSE: Reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens have extended the curative potential of allogeneic stem-cell transplantation to older adults with high-risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplasia (MDS) but are associated with a high risk of disease relapse.Strategies to reduce recurrence are urgently required.Registry data have demonstrated improved outcomes using a sequential transplant regimen, fludarabine/amsacrine/cytarabine-busulphan (FLAMSA-Bu), but the impact of this intensified conditioning regimen has not been studied in randomized trials.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred forty-four patients (median age, 59 years) with high-risk AML (n = 164) or MDS (n = 80) were randomly assigned 1:1 to a fludarabine-based RIC regimen or FLAMSA-Bu.Pretransplant measurable residual disease (MRD) was monitored by flow cytometry (MFC-MRD) and correlated with outcome.RESULTS: There was no difference in 2-year overall survival (hazard ratio 1.05 [85% CI, 0.80 to 1.38] P = .81) or cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) (hazard ratio 0.94 [95%CI, 0.60 to 1.46] P = .81) between the control and FLAMSA-Bu arms.Detectable pretransplant MFC-MRD was associated with an increased CIR (2-year CIR 41.0% v 20.0%, P = .01) in the overall trial cohort with a comparable prognostic impact when measured by an unsupervised analysis approach.There was no evidence of interaction between MRD status and conditioning regimen intensity for relapse or survival.Acquisition of full donor T-cell chimerism at 3 months abrogated the adverse impact of pretransplant MRD on CIR and overall survival.CONCLUSION: The intensified RIC conditioning regimen, FLAMSA-Bu, did not improve outcomes in adults transplanted for high-risk AML or MDS regardless of pretransplant MRD status.Our data instead support the exploration of interventions with the ability to accelerate acquisition of full donor T-cell chimerism as a tractable strategy to improve outcomes in patients allografted for AML.",1,1,1,0

29466786,"Long-Term Vitamin D Supplementation and the Effects on Recurrence and Metabolic Status of Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia Grade 2 or 3: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial.OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of vitamin D supplementation on the recurrence and metabolic status of patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or 3 (CIN2/3).METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was carried out among 58 women diagnosed with CIN2/3.Participants were randomly assigned into 2 groups to receive either 50,000 IU vitamin D3 (n = 29) or placebo (n = 29) every 2 weeks for 6 months.RESULTS: The recurrence rate of CIN1/2/3 was 18.5 and 48.1% in the vitamin D and placebo groups respectively (p = 0.02).When we excluded CIN1, the recurrence rate of CIN2/3 became nonsignificant.Vitamin D supplementation significantly decreased fasting plasma glucose (-7.8 +/- 9.2 vs. -1.1 +/- 8.6 mg/dL, p = 0.006) and insulin levels (-3.2 +/- 4.8 vs. -0.9 +/- 3.4 microIU/mL, p = 0.03), and significantly increased quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (0.01 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.002 +/- 0.01, p = 0.02) compared with the placebo.Additionally, there was a significant decrease in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (-815.3 +/- 1,786.2 vs. 717.5 +/- 1,827.3 ng/mL, p = 0.002) and a significant increase in total antioxidant capacity (113.4 +/- 137.4 vs. -53.7 +/- 186.7 mmol/L, p < 0.001) following the supplementation of vitamin D compared with the placebo.CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D3 supplementation for 6 months among women with CIN2/3 had beneficial effects on CIN1/2/3 recurrence and metabolic status; however, it did not affect CIN2/3 recurrence.",0,0,0,0
32780661,"Hypofractionated Versus Conventional Fractionated Radiotherapy After Breast-Conserving Surgery in the Modern Treatment Era: A Multicenter, Randomized Controlled Trial From China.PURPOSE: No randomized trials have compared hypofractionated radiotherapy (HFRT) with conventional fractionated radiotherapy (CFRT) after breast-conserving surgery in the Asian population.This study aimed to determine whether a 3.5-week schedule of HFRT is noninferior to a standard 6-week schedule of CFRT in China.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients from 4 Chinese institutions who had undergone breast-conserving surgery and had T1-2N0-3 invasive breast cancers participated this study.Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) using a computer-generated central randomization schedule, without stratification, to receive whole-breast irradiation with or without nodal irradiation, followed by tumor-bed boost, either at a dose of 50 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks with a boost of 10 Gy in five fractions over 1 week (CFRT) or 43.5 Gy in 15 fractions over 3 weeks with a boost of 8.7 Gy in three daily fractions (HFRT).The primary endpoint was 5-year local recurrence (LR), and a 5% margin of 5-year LR was used to establish noninferiority.RESULTS: Between August 2010 and November 2015, 734 patients were assigned to the HFRT (n = 368) or CFRT (n = 366) group.At a median follow-up of 73.5 months (interquartile range, 60.5-91.4 months), the 5-year cumulative incidence of LR was 1.2% in the HFRT group and 2.0% in the CFRT group (hazard ratio, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.20 to 1.88; P = .017 for noninferiority).There were no significant differences in acute and late toxicities, except that the HFRT group had less grade 2-3 acute skin toxicity than the CFRT group (P = .019).CONCLUSION: CFRT and HFRT with a tumor-bed boost may have similar low LR and toxicity.",0,0,0,0
24214881,"Vitamin D-binding protein, circulating vitamin D and risk of renal cell carcinoma.Cell culture experiments suggest that vitamin D may inhibit renal carcinogenesis, but human studies of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], the accepted measure of vitamin D status, and kidney cancer have been null.Limited research has examined the role of circulating vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) in the association between 25(OH)D and disease risk, and it is unclear whether free 25(OH)D in circulation is a better measure of effective exposure, or if DBP may independently impact outcomes.We conducted a nested case-control analysis within the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention (ATBC) Study to examine whether circulating DBP concentration was prospectively associated with risk of renal cell carcinoma, and whether it modified the association with 25(OH)D. Renal cell carcinoma cases (n = 262) were matched 1:1 to controls on age (+/-1 year) and date of blood collection (+/- 30 days).We estimated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of renal cell carcinoma risk by quartiles of 25(OH)D, DBP and the molar ratio of 25(OH)D:DBP, a proxy for free circulating 25(OH)D. Men with higher DBP concentrations were at significantly decreased risk of kidney cancer (Q4 vs. Q1: OR = 0.17, 95% CI = 0.08-0.33; p-trend < 0.0001), a finding unchanged by adjustment for 25(OH)D. Although we observed no association with total 25(OH)D, we found slightly increased risk with higher levels of estimated free 25(OH)D [Q4 vs. Q1 of the 25(OH)D:DBP ratio, OR = 1.61, 95% CI = 0.95-2.73; p-trend = 0.09].The strong protective association observed between higher circulating DBP concentration and kidney cancer risk requires replication but suggests a vitamin D-independent influence of DBP.",0,0,0,0

32902856,"Preventing smoking relapse in patients with cancer: A randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Abstaining from smoking after a cancer diagnosis is critical to mitigating the risk of multiple adverse health outcomes.Although many patients with cancer attempt to quit smoking, the majority relapse.The current randomized controlled trial evaluated the efficacy of adapting an evidence-based smoking relapse prevention (SRP) intervention for patients with cancer.METHODS: The trial enrolled 412 patients newly diagnosed with cancer who had recently quit smoking.Participants were randomized to usual care (UC) or SRP.Participants in the UC group received the institution's standard of care for treating tobacco use.Participants in the SRP group in addition received a targeted educational DVD plus a validated self-help intervention for preventing smoking relapse.The primary outcome was smoking abstinence at 2 months, 6 months, and 12 months.RESULTS: Abstinence rates for participants in the SRP and UC groups were 75% versus 71% at 2 months and 69% versus 64% at 6 months (Ps > .20).At 12 months, abstinence rates among survivors were 68% for those in the SRP group and 63% for those in the UC group (P = .38).Post hoc analyses revealed that across 2 months and 6 months, patients who were married/partnered were more likely to be abstinent after SRP than UC (P = .03).CONCLUSIONS: A smoking relapse prevention intervention did not reduce relapse rates overall, but did appear to have benefited those participants who had the social support of a partner.Future work is needed to extend this effect to the larger population of patients.",0,0,0,0
34450102,"Long-term survival of patients with mantle cell lymphoma after autologous haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation in first remission: a post-hoc analysis of an open-label, multicentre, randomised, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Autologous haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) in first remission is the current standard treatment in fit patients with mantle cell lymphoma.In this long-term follow-up study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of autologous HSCT versus interferon alfa maintenance after chemotherapy without or with rituximab in patients with primary advanced-stage mantle cell lymphoma.METHODS: We did a post-hoc, long-term analysis of an open-label, multicentre, randomised, phase 3 trial done in 121 participating hospitals or practices across six European countries.Patients who were aged 18-65 years with previously untreated stage III-IV mantle cell lymphoma and an ECOG performance score of 0-2 were eligible for participation.Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either myeloablative radiochemotherapy (fractionated total body irradiation with 12 Gy/day 6-4 days before autologous HSCT and cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg per day intravenously 3-2 days before autologous HSCT) followed by autologous HSCT (the autologous HSCT group) or interferon alfa maintenance (the interferon alfa maintenance group; 6 x 10(6) IU three times a week subcutaneously until progression) after completion of CHOP-like induction therapy (cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m(2) intravenously on day 1, doxorubicin 50 mg/m(2) intravenously on day 1, vincristine 1.4 mg/m(2) [maximum 2 mg] intravenously on day 1, and prednisone 100 mg/m(2) orally on days 1-5; repeated every 21 days for up to 6 cycles) without or with rituximab (375 mg/m(2) intravenously on day 0 or 1 of each cycle; R-CHOP).The primary outcome was progression-free survival from end of induction until progression or death among patients who had a remission and the secondary outcome was overall survival from the end of induction until death from any cause.We did comparisons of progression-free survival and overall survival according to the intention-to-treat principle between both groups among responding patients and explored efficacy in subgroups according to induction treatment without or with rituximab.Hazard ratios (HRs) were adjusted for the mantle cell lymphoma international prognostic index (MIPI) numerical score, and in the total group also for rituximab use (adjusted HR [aHR]).This trial was started before preregistration was implemented and is therefore not registered, recruitment is closed, and this is the final evaluation.FINDINGS: Between Sept 30, 1996, and July 1, 2004, 269 patients were randomly assigned to receive either autologous HSCT or interferon alfa maintenance therapy.The median follow-up was 14 years (IQR 10-16), with the intention-to-treat population consisting of 174 patients (93 [53%] in the autologous HSCT group and 81 [47%] in the interferon alfa maintenance group) who responded to induction therapy.The median age was 55 years (IQR 47-60), and R-CHOP was used in 68 (39%) of 174 patients.The median progression-free survival was 3.3 years (95% CI 2.5-4.3) in the autologous HSCT group versus 1.5 years (1.2-2.0) in the interferon alfa maintenance group (log-rank p<0.0001; aHR 0.50 [95% CI 0.36-0.69]).The median overall survival was 7.5 years (95% CI 5.7-12.0) in the autologous HSCT group versus 4.8 years (4.0-6.6) in the interferon alfa maintenance group (log-rank p=0.019; aHR 0.66 [95% CI 0.46-0.95]).For patients treated without rituximab, the progression-free survival adjusted HR for autologous HSCT versus interferon alfa was 0.40 (0.26-0.61), in comparison to 0.72 (0.42-1.24) for patients treated with rituximab.For overall survival, the adjusted hazard ratio for HSCT versus interferon alfa was 0.52 (0.33-0.82) without rituximab and 1.05 (0.55-1.99) for patients who received rituximab.INTERPRETATION: Our results confirm the long-term efficacy of autologous HSCT to treat mantle cell lymphoma established in the pre-rituximab era.The suggested reduced efficacy after immunochemotherapy supports the need for its re-evaluation now that antibody maintenance, high-dose cytarabine, and targeted treatments have changed the standard of care for patients with mantle cell lymphoma.FUNDING: Deutsche Krebshilfe, the European Community, and the Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung, Kompetenznetz Maligne Lymphome.",0,0,0,0
33616652,"Addition of lenalidomide to intensive treatment in younger and middle-aged adults with newly diagnosed AML: the HOVON-SAKK-132 trial.Lenalidomide, an antineoplastic and immunomodulatory drug, has therapeutic activity in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but definitive studies about its therapeutic utility have been lacking.In a phase 3 study, we compared 2 induction regimens in newly diagnosed patients age 18 to 65 years with AML: idarubicine-cytarabine (cycle 1) and daunorubicin and intermediate-dose cytarabine (cycle 2) without or with lenalidomide (15 mg orally on days 1-21).One final consolidation cycle of chemotherapy or autologous stem cell transplantation (auto-SCT) or allogeneic SCT (allo-SCT) was provided according to a prognostic risk and minimal residual disease (MRD)-adapted approach.Event-free survival (EFS; primary end point) and other clinical end points were assessed.A second random assignment in patients in complete response or in complete response with incomplete hematologic recovery after cycle 3 or auto-SCT involved 6 cycles of maintenance with lenalidomide (10 mg on days 1-21) or observation.In all, 392 patients were randomly assigned to the control group, and 388 patients were randomly assigned to lenalidomide induction.At a median follow-up of 41 months, the study revealed no differences in outcome between the treatments (EFS, 44% +/- 2% standard error and overall survival, 54% +/- 2% at 4 years for both arms) although in an exploratory post hoc analysis, a lenalidomide benefit was suggested in SRSF2-mutant AML.In relation to the previous Dutch-Belgian Hemato-Oncology Cooperative Group and Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research (HOVON-SAKK) studies that used a similar 3-cycle regimen but did not pursue an MRD-guided approach, these survival estimates compare markedly more favorably.MRD status after cycle 2 lost prognostic value in intermediate-risk AML in the risk-adjusted treatment context.Maintenance with lenalidomide showed no apparent effect on relapse probability in 88 patients randomly assigned for this part of the study.",1,1,1,0
25577838,"[Functional outcomes of transvesical single-site versus extraperitoneal laparoscopic radical prostatectomy for low-risk prostate cancer].OBJECTIVE: To compare the perioperative data, pathological results and functional outcomes of transvesical single- site laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (TVSSLRP) with those of nerve-sparing extraperitoneal laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (nsELRP) in the treatment of low-risk prostate cancer (PCa).METHODS: Fifty patients with low-risk organ-confined PCa were randomly assigned to two groups of equal number to receive TVSSLRP and nsELRP, respectively.Comparisons were made between the two groups of patients in such demographic and baseline data as age, comorbidity, body mass index (BMI), serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA), prostate volume, bioptic Gleason score, clinical stage, IIEF-5 score, nocturnal penile tumescence (NPT), penile brachial index (PBI), and penile arterial blood flow velocity as well as in such surgery-related parameters as operation duration, blood loss, blood transfusion, intraoperative complications, positive surgical margin, catheterization time, hospital stay, and postoperative Gleason score, pathologic stage, urinal pad use, PSA level, IIEF-5 score, NPT, PBI and PABFV.RESULTS: All the operations were successfully performed.There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups either in the demographic and baseline data or in intraoperative blood loss, blood transfusion rate, complications, and positive surgical margin.No intraoperative complications and positive surgical margins were found in either group.Compared with nsELRP, TVSSLRP achieved a significantly shorter operation duration ([151.46 +/- 40.68] min vs [105.92 +/- 26.21] min, P <0.05), catheterization time ([13.01 +/- 1.64] d vs [11.24 +/- 1.17] d, P <0.05), and hospital stay ([15.76 +/- 4.65] d vs [12.92 +/- 4.29] d, P <0.05).On the first day and at 1, 3 and 6 months after catheter removal, the urinary continence rates in the TVSSLRP and nsELRP groups were 84% vs 52% (P <0.05), 100% vs 84%, 100% vs 96%, and 100% vs 96%, respectively; and at 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery, the erectile potency rates were 48% vs 28% (P <0.05), 64% vs 52%, and 76% vs 68%, respectively, with an IIEF-5 score >/= 18, all evidently higher in the TVSSLRP than in the nsELRP group.The penile brachial index and arterial blood flow velocity of the two groups of patients exhibited no significant differences before and after surgery, nor did postoperative complications (grade II) between the TVSSLRP and nsELRP groups (32% vs 40%, P >0.05).The Gleason score and pathologic stage were increased after surgery, but with remarkable differences between the two groups (P >0.05).No biochemical recurrence was found in either group during a 12-month follow-up.CONCLUSION: With the advantages of safety and rapid postoperative recovery, both TVSSLRP and nsELRP are feasible for the treatment of low-risk organ-confined PCa, but the former may achieve an earlier recovery of urinary continence and erectile function than the latter.",0,0,0,0
25873295,"An Exploratory Study of the Effects of Mind-Body Interventions Targeting Sleep on Salivary Oxytocin Levels in Cancer Survivors.Cancer survivors experience high levels of distress, associated with a host of negative psychological states, including anxiety, depression, and fear of recurrence, which often lead to sleep problems and reduction in quality of life (QOL) and well-being.As a neuropeptide hormone associated with affiliation, calmness, and well-being, oxytocin may be a useful biological measure of changes in health outcomes in cancer survivors.In this exploratory study, which comprised a subset of participants from a larger study, we evaluated (a) the feasibility and reliability of salivary oxytocin (sOT) levels in cancer survivors and (b) the effects of 2 sleep-focused mind-body interventions, mind-body bridging (MBB) and mindfulness meditation (MM), compared with a sleep hygiene education (SHE) control, on changes in sOT levels in 30 cancer survivors with self-reported sleep disturbance.Interventions were conducted in 3 sessions, once per week for 3 weeks.Saliva samples were collected at baseline, postintervention (~1 week after the last session), and at the 2-month follow-up.In this cancer survivor group, we found that intra-individual sOT levels were fairly stable across the 3 time points, of about 3 months' duration, and mean baseline sOT levels did not differ between females and males and were not correlated with age.Correlations between baseline sOT and self-report measures were weak; however, several of these relationships were in the predicted direction, in which sOT levels were negatively associated with sleep problems and depression and positively associated with cancer-related QOL and well-being.Regarding intervention effects on sOT, baseline-subtracted sOT levels were significantly larger at postintervention in the MBB group as compared with those in SHE.In this sample of cancer survivors assessed for sOT, at postintervention, greater reductions in sleep problems were noted for MBB and MM compared with that of SHE, and increases in mindfulness and self-compassion were observed in the MBB group compared with those in SHE.The findings in this exploratory study suggest that sOT may be a reliable biological measure over time that may provide insight into the effects of mind-body interventions on health outcomes in cancer survivors.",0,0,0,0

30058942,"Efficacy of a Media Literacy Intervention for Indoor Tanning Prevention.Indoor tanning leads to melanoma, the fifth most common cancer in the USA.The highest rate of indoor tanning is among young women whose exposure to tanned images in the media is linked to protanning attitudes.This study evaluated the efficacy of a media literacy intervention for reducing young women's indoor tanning.Intervention participants analyzed the content and functions of the media influencing protanning attitudes and produced counter-messages to help themselves and peers resist harmful media effects.The message production was of two types: digital argument production or digital story production.The control group received assessments only.This three-group randomized design involved 26 sorority chapters and 247 members in five Midwestern states where indoor tanning is prevalent.At 2- and 6-month follow-up assessments, those in the two intervention conditions were less likely to be indoor tanners (p = .033) and reported lower indoor tanning intentions (p = .002) compared to those in the control condition.No difference between the two intervention groups was found for behavior.Although the argument group exhibited slightly weaker indoor tanning intentions than the story group, the difference was not significant.The results provide the first evidence of the efficacy of a media literacy intervention for indoor tanning reduction.Implications for participative engagement interventions are discussed.",0,0,0,0
27098427,"Disease progression in recurrent glioblastoma patients treated with the VEGFR inhibitor axitinib is associated with increased regulatory T cell numbers and T cell exhaustion.BACKGROUND: Recurrent glioblastoma is associated with a poor overall survival.Antiangiogenic therapy results in a high tumor response rate but has limited impact on survival.Immunotherapy has emerged as an efficient treatment modality for some cancers, and preclinical evidence indicates that anti-VEGF(R) therapy can counterbalance the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment.METHODS: We collected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of patients with recurrent glioblastoma treated in a randomized phase II clinical trial comparing the effect of axitinib with axitinib plus lomustine and analyzed the immunophenotype of PBMC, the production of cytokines and expression of inhibitory molecules by circulating T cells.RESULTS: PBMC of 18 patients were collected at baseline and at 6 weeks after initiation of study treatment.Axitinib increased the number of naive CD8(+) T cells and central memory CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells and reduced the TIM3 expression on CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells.Patients diagnosed with progressive disease on axitinib had a significantly increased number of regulatory T cells and an increased level of PD-1 expression on CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells.In addition, reduced numbers of cytokine-producing T cells were found in progressive patients as compared to patients responding to treatment.CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that axitinib treatment in patients with recurrent glioblastoma has a favorable impact on immune function.At the time of acquired resistance to axitinib, we documented further enhancement of a preexisting immunosuppression.Further investigations on the role of axitinib as potential combination partner with immunotherapy are necessary.",0,0,0,0

20835926,"Palliative stenting with or without radiotherapy for inoperable esophageal carcinoma: a randomized trial.BACKGROUND: A majority of patients with esophageal cancer present with inoperable disease and require rapid and long-lasting palliation of dysphagia.STUDY AIM: To compare the duration of relief of dysphagia in patients with inoperable esophageal cancer treated with esophageal stenting alone or a combination of esophageal stenting and external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), and to assess overall survival, treatment-related complications, and quality of life (QOL) in the two groups.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with inoperable esophageal cancer and with high grade dysphagia were randomized to receive esophageal stenting with self-expandable metal stent (Ultraflex) alone (Group I), versus a combination of stenting followed by EBRT (30 gray in ten divided fractions over 2 weeks) (Group II).Dysphagia relief, overall survival, QOL (using European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30, version 3), and treatment-related complications were assessed in the two groups.RESULTS: From April 2007 to March 2009, 84 patients were randomized to receive esophageal stent alone (42 patients) or a combination of stent and EBRT (42 patients).The two groups were comparable in demographics, tumor characteristics, indications for palliative treatment, and pretreatment dysphagia score.Dysphagia scores improved significantly in both groups following stent insertion.However, dysphagia relief was more sustained in Group II than in Group I (7 vs. 3 months, p = 0.002).Overall median survival was significantly higher in Group II than in Group I (180 vs. 120 days, p = 0.009).Addition of radiotherapy following stenting prolonged the mean dysphagia-free survival (118.6 +/- 55.8 vs. 96.8 +/- 43.0 days, p = 0.054).There was significant improvement in all QOL parameters at 1 week after stenting.The QOL, however, significantly declined immediately after radiotherapy.There was no treatment-related mortality, and the incidence of complications was similar in the two groups.CONCLUSION: Post-stenting EBRT effectively prolongs duration of dysphagia relief and improves overall survival in inoperable esophageal cancer.",1,1,0,0
34357781,"E2112: Randomized Phase III Trial of Endocrine Therapy Plus Entinostat or Placebo in Hormone Receptor-Positive Advanced Breast Cancer. A Trial of the ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group.PURPOSE: Endocrine therapy resistance in advanced breast cancer remains a significant clinical problem that may be overcome with the use of histone deacetylase inhibitors such as entinostat.The ENCORE301 phase II study reported improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) with the addition of entinostat to the steroidal aromatase inhibitor (AI) exemestane in advanced hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: E2112 is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III study that enrolled men or women with advanced HR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer whose disease progressed after nonsteroidal AI.Participants were randomly assigned to exemestane 25 mg by mouth once daily and entinostat (EE) or placebo (EP) 5 mg by mouth once weekly.Primary end points were PFS by central review and OS.Secondary end points included safety, objective response rate, and lysine acetylation change in peripheral blood mononuclear cells between baseline and cycle 1 day 15.RESULTS: Six hundred eight patients were randomly assigned during March 2014-October 2018.Median age was 63 years (range 29-91), 60% had visceral disease, and 84% had progressed after nonsteroidal AI in metastatic setting.Previous treatments included chemotherapy (60%), fulvestrant (30%), and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (35%).Most common grade 3 and 4 adverse events in the EE arm included neutropenia (20%), hypophosphatemia (14%), anemia (8%), leukopenia (6%), fatigue (4%), diarrhea (4%), and thrombocytopenia (3%).Median PFS was 3.3 months (EE) versus 3.1 months (EP; hazard ratio = 0.87; 95% CI, 0.67 to 1.13; P = .30).Median OS was 23.4 months (EE) versus 21.7 months (EP; hazard ratio = 0.99; 95% CI, 0.82 to 1.21; P = .94).Objective response rate was 5.8% (EE) and 5.6% (EP).Pharmacodynamic analysis confirmed target inhibition in entinostat-treated patients.CONCLUSION: The combination of exemestane and entinostat did not improve survival in AI-resistant advanced HR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer.",1,1,1,1
25701170,"Orteronel plus prednisone in patients with chemotherapy-naive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (ELM-PC 4): a double-blind, multicentre, phase 3, randomised, placebo-controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Orteronel is an investigational, partially selective inhibitor of CYP 17,20-lyase in the androgen signalling pathway, a validated therapeutic target for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.We assessed orteronel in chemotherapy-naive patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.METHODS: In this phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we recruited patients with progressive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and no previous chemotherapy from 324 study centres (ie, hospitals or large urologic or group outpatient offices) in 43 countries.Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 400 mg orteronel plus 5 mg prednisone twice daily or placebo plus 5 mg prednisone twice daily.Randomisation was done centrally with an interactive voice response system and patients were stratified by region (Europe, North America, and not Europe or North America) and the presence or absence of radiographic disease progression at baseline.The two primary endpoints were radiographic progression-free survival and overall survival, determined in the intention-to-treat population.This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01193244.FINDINGS: From Oct 31, 2010, to June 29, 2012, 2353 patients were assessed for eligibility.Of those, 1560 were randomly assigned to receive either orteronel plus prednisone (n=781) or placebo plus prednisone (n=779).The clinical cutoff date for the final analysis was Jan 15, 2014 (with 611 deaths).Median follow-up for radiographic progression-free survival was 8.4 months (IQR 3.7-16.6).Median radiographic progression-free survival was 13.8 months (95% CI 13.1-14.9) with orteronel plus prednisone and 8.7 months (8.3-10.9) with placebo plus prednisone (hazard ratio [HR] 0.71, 95% CI 0.63-0.80; p<0.0001).After a median follow-up of 20.7 months (IQR 14.2-25.4), median overall survival was 31.4 months (95% CI 28.6-not estimable) with orteronel plus prednisone and 29.5 months (27.0-not estimable) with placebo plus prednisone (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.79-1.08; p=0.31).The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events were increased lipase (137 [17%] of 784 patients in the orteronel plus prednisone group vs 14 [2%] of 770 patients in the placebo plus prednisone group), increased amylase (77 [10%] vs nine [1%]), fatigue (50 [6%] vs 14 [2%]), and pulmonary embolism (40 [5%] vs 27 [4%]).Serious adverse events were reported in 358 [46%] patients receiving orteronel plus prednisone and in 292 [38%] patients receiving placebo plus prednisone.INTERPRETATION: In chemotherapy-naive patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, radiographic progression-free survival was prolonged with orteronel plus prednisone versus placebo plus prednisone.However, no improvement was noted in the other primary endpoint, overall survival.Orteronel plus prednisone was associated with increased toxic effects compared with placebo plus prednisone.On the basis of these and other data, orteronel is not undergoing further development in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.FUNDING: Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc, a wholly owned subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited.",1,1,1,0

33504909,"Comparison of deep and moderate neuromuscular blockade in microwave ablation of liver tumours: a randomized-controlled clinical trial.Microwave ablation (MWA) is gaining popularity for the treatment of small primary hepatocellular carcinoma and metastatic lesions especially if patients are not candidates for surgical resection.Deep neuromuscular blockade (DMB) is perceived to improve surgical working conditions compared to moderate neuromuscular blockade (MMB) but no studies have examined the same benefits in MWA of liver tumours.This study aimed to compare the clinical outcomes of DMB and MMB in MWA of liver tumours in terms of liver excursion, performance scores by the interventional radiologists and patients, requirements of additional muscle relaxants and complications.50 patients were recruited and 45 patients (22 in MMB group, 23 in DMB group) completed the study.The mean liver excursion for the MMB group (1.42 +/- 1.83 mm) was significantly higher than the DMB group (0.26 +/- 0.38 mm) (p = 0.001).The mean Leiden-Surgical Rating Scale (L-SRS) rated by the two interventional radiologists were 4.5 +/- 0.59 and 3.6 +/- 0.85 for the DMB and MMB groups, respectively (p = 0.01).There was also statistically significant difference on patient satisfaction scores (0-10: Extremely Dissatisfied-Extremely Satisfied) between DMB (8.74 +/- 1.1) and MMB (7.86 +/- 1.25) groups (p = 0.01).5 patients from MMB group and none from DMB group required bolus relaxant during the MWA procedure.Adverse events were also noted to be more severe in the MMB group.In conclusion, DMB significantly reduced liver excursion and movement leading to improved accuracy, safety and success in ablating liver tumour.",0,0,0,0
33607312,"Efficacy and Safety of Rovalpituzumab Tesirine Compared With Topotecan as Second-Line Therapy in DLL3-High SCLC: Results From the Phase 3 TAHOE Study.INTRODUCTION: DLL3, an atypical Notch ligand, is expressed in SCLC tumors but is not detectable in normal adult tissues.Rovalpituzumab tesirine (Rova-T) is an antibody-drug conjugate containing a DLL3-targeting antibody tethered to a cytotoxic agent pyrrolobenzodiazepine by means of a protease-cleavable linker.The efficacy and safety of Rova-T compared with topotecan as second-line therapy in patients with SCLC expressing high levels of DLL3 (DLL3-high) was evaluated.METHODS: The TAHOE study was an open-label, two-to-one randomized, phase 3 study comparing Rova-T with topotecan as second-line therapy in DLL3-high advanced or metastatic SCLC.Rova-T (0.3 mg/kg) was administered intravenously on day 1 of a 42-day cycle for two cycles, with two additional cycles available to patients who met protocol-defined criteria for continued dosing.Topotecan (1.5 mg/m(2)) was administered intravenously on days 1 to 5 of a 21-day cycle.The primary end point was overall survival (OS).RESULTS: Patients randomized to Rova-T (n = 296) and topotecan (n = 148) were included in the efficacy analyses.The median age was 64 years, and 77% had the extensive disease at initial diagnosis.The median OS (95% confidence interval) was 6.3 months (5.6-7.3) in the Rova-T arm and 8.6 months (7.7-10.1) in the topotecan arm (hazard ratio, 1.46 [95% confidence interval: 1.17-1.82]).An independent data monitoring committee recommended that enrollment be discontinued because of the shorter OS observed with Rova-T compared with topotecan.Safety profiles for both drugs were consistent with previous reports.CONCLUSIONS: Compared with topotecan, which is the current standard second-line chemotherapy, Rova-T exhibited an inferior OS and higher rates of serosal effusions, photosensitivity reaction, and peripheral edema in patients with SCLC.A considerable unmet therapeutic need remains in this population.",1,1,1,1
34029455,"Androgen replacement therapy for cancer-related symptoms in male: result of prospective randomized trial (ARTFORM study).BACKGROUND: Hypogonadism associated with cancer is reported to cause cachexia and a variety of physical and psychological symptoms.This study aims to evaluate whether androgen replacement therapy can improve cancer-related symptoms in male advanced cancer patients.METHODS: An investigator-initiated, prospective, and randomized controlled study was conducted.Patients with low serum testosterone levels (total or free testosterone levels were <2.31 ng/mL or <11.8 pg/mL, respectively) were randomly assigned to the control or testosterone enanthate administration (testosterone group) groups.Testosterone enanthate was injected into the muscle tissue at a dose of 250 mg every 4 weeks (baseline, week 4, and week 8).Differences in quality of life questionnaires and cachexia-related serum protein levels between groups were assessed.RESULTS: This study enrolled and randomized 106 and 81 patients, respectively.Moreover, 41 and 40 patients were in the control and testosterone groups, respectively.Although no significant differences in the change of subscales and total scores in Functional Assessment of Anorexia/Cachexia Treatment were noted from the baseline between the two groups, the testosterone group showed a significantly better change in the 'unhappiness' item of the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System at week 12 compared with baseline versus the control group (-1.4 and 0.0 points, respectively; mean, P = 0.007).No significant differences exist in the change of serum interleukin-6 and insulin-like growth factor-1 levels at week 12 from the baseline between the control and testosterone groups.Consequently, the testosterone group significantly inhibited the change in serum tumour necrotic factor-alpha level at week 12 from the baseline compared with the control group (+0.4 and +0.1 pg/mL, respectively; mean, P = 0.005).CONCLUSIONS: Although testosterone enanthate did not improve most of the items in health-related quality of life questionnaires, testosterone enanthate induced a significantly better change in the 'unhappiness' item at week 12 compared with the control.Testosterone enanthate may be a potential treatment option for male advanced cancer patients.",0,0,0,0
21996087,"RT-PCR versus immunohistochemistry for correlation and quantification of ERCC1, BRCA1, TUBB3 and RRM1 in NSCLC.BACKGROUND: Customized chemotherapy is increasingly used in the management of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).However, the most reliable methodology to determine biomarker status is neither fully elucidated nor agreed upon.Accordingly, we evaluated the predictive efficiency of qRT-PCR and immunohistochemical analysis (IHC) on excision cross complementation group 1 (ERCC1), breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 (BRCA1), ribonucleotide reductase subunit M1 (RRM1) and class III beta-tubulin (TUBB3).PATIENTS AND METHODS: IHC and qRT-PCR on ERCC1, BRCA1, RRM1 and TUBB3 were performed on surgically resected tissue samples from NSCLC-patients included in a randomized trial.The median values of the biomarker expression dichotomized the population and were correlated to clinical endpoints.RESULTS: Representative tissue samples from 33 patients showed no significant correlations between mRNA and protein expression.Predictive impact was demonstrated for all four biomarkers, when assessed by IHC, and reached significance for overall survival in patients with ERCC1-negative (14.3 vs. 8.5 months, p=0.018) and TUBB3-negative (18.5 vs. 11.10, p=0.027) tumours, while this was not the case for qRT-PCR.CONCLUSIONS: IHC discriminated more effectively than qRT-PCR across four NSCLC-relevant biomarkers.The findings are further supported by the demonstrated lack of correlation between transcript and protein.",0,0,0,0
27615399,"Extended mortality results for ovarian cancer screening in the PLCO trial with median 15years follow-up.BACKGROUND: The Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial originally reported no mortality benefit of ovarian cancer screening after a median of 12.4years of follow-up.The UKCTOCS screening trial failed to show a statistically significant mortality reduction in the primary analysis but reported an apparent increased mortality benefit in trial years 7-14 compared to 0-7.Here we report an updated analysis of PLCO with extended mortality follow-up.METHODS: Participants were randomized from 1993 to 2001 at ten U.S. centers to an intervention or usual care arm.Intervention arm women were screened for ovarian cancer with annual trans-vaginal ultrasound (TVU) (4years) and CA-125 (6years), with a fixed cutoff at 35U/mL for CA-125.The original follow-up period was for up to 13years (median follow-up 12.4years); in this analysis follow-up for mortality was extended by up to 6years.RESULTS: 39,105 (intervention) and 39,111 (usual care) women were randomized, of which 34,253 and 34,304, respectively, had at least one ovary at baseline.Median follow-up was 14.7years in each arm and maximum follow-up 19.2years in each arm.A total of 187 (intervention) and 176 (usual care) deaths from ovarian cancer were observed, for a risk-ratio of 1.06 (95% CI: 0.87-1.30).Risk-ratios were similar for study years 0-7 (RR=1.04), 7-14 (RR=1.06) and 14+ (RR=1.09).The risk ratio for all-cause mortality was 1.01 (95% CI: 0.97-1.05).Ovarian cancer specific survival was not significantly different across trial arms (p=0.16).CONCLUSION: Extended follow-up of PLCO indicated no mortality benefit from screening for ovarian cancer with CA-125 and TVU.",0,0,0,0

32171426,"Pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and docetaxel for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (CLEOPATRA): end-of-study results from a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study.BACKGROUND: CLEOPATRA was a phase 3 study comparing the efficacy and safety of pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and docetaxel with placebo, trastuzumab, and docetaxel in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.In the primary analysis and subsequent reports, progression-free and overall survival were significantly improved in the pertuzumab group compared with the placebo group.Here, we report the end-of-study analysis of CLEOPATRA.METHODS: This was a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial that was done at 204 centres in 25 countries.Eligible patients were 18 years or older, had HER2-positive, metastatic breast cancer, had not received previous chemotherapy or biological treatment for their metastatic disease, and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1.All study drugs were given intravenously, every 3 weeks.Patients were assigned to receive either pertuzumab or placebo at a loading dose of 840 mg, and 420 mg thereafter; plus trastuzumab at 8 mg/kg loading dose and 6 mg/kg thereafter; and docetaxel at 75 mg/m(2), escalating to 100 mg/m(2) if tolerated.Pertuzumab or placebo and trastuzumab were given until disease progression; docetaxel was given for six cycles, or longer at the investigators' discretion.Randomisation (1:1) was done by use of an interactive voice-response system and was stratified by geographical region (Asia, Europe, North America, or South America) and previous treatment (previous adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy vs none).The primary endpoint was independent review facility-assessed progression-free survival, which has been reported previously.Since the confirmatory overall survival analysis had also occurred before this prespecified end-of-study analysis, analyses presented here are descriptive.Overall survival analyses were based on the intention-to-treat population with crossover patients analysed in the placebo group; analyses were not adjusted for crossover to the pertuzumab group and are likely to be conservative.Safety analyses were based on treatment received; crossover patients were counted in the placebo group up to the day before first pertuzumab dose.This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00567190.FINDINGS: Between Feb 12, 2008, and July 7, 2010, 1196 patients were assessed for eligibility, of whom 808 were enrolled and randomly assigned.402 patients were assigned to receive docetaxel plus trastuzumab plus pertuzumab, and 406 patients were assigned to receive docetaxel plus trastuzumab plus placebo.Clinical cutoff for this analysis was Nov 23, 2018.Between July 2012 and clinical cutoff, 50 patients crossed from the placebo to the pertuzumab group.Median follow-up was 99.9 months in the pertuzumab group (IQR 92.9-106.4) and 98.7 months (90.9-105.7) in the placebo group.Median overall survival was 57.1 months (95% CI 50-72) in the pertuzumab group and 40.8 months (36-48) in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0.69, 95% CI 0.58-0.82); 8-year landmark overall survival rates were 37% (95% CI 31-42) in the pertuzumab group and 23% (19-28) in the placebo group.The most common grade 3-4 adverse event was neutropenia (200 [49%] of 408 patients in the pertuzumab group, 183 [46%] of 396 patients in the placebo group).Five (1%) of 408 patients in the pertuzumab group and six (2%) of 396 patients in the placebo group had treatment-related deaths.One new serious adverse event suggestive of congestive heart failure (pertuzumab group) and one new symptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction (post-crossover) occurred since the previous analysis.INTERPRETATION: Our analysis shows that the previously observed improvements in overall survival with pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and docetaxel versus placebo, trastuzumab, and docetaxel were maintained after a median of more than 8 years of follow-up.The long-term safety and cardiac safety profiles of pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and docetaxel were maintained in the overall safety population and within crossover patients.HER2-targeted therapy has changed the natural history of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, with the dual blockade of pertuzumab and trastuzumab, with docetaxel, demonstrating an 8-year landmark overall survival rate of 37%.FUNDING: F Hoffmann-La Roche and Genentech.",1,1,1,1
22855579,"Thalidomide in total therapy 2 overcomes inferior prognosis of myeloma with low expression of the glucocorticoid receptor gene NR3C1.PURPOSE: Because dexamethasone remains a key component of myeloma therapy, we wished to examine the impact of baseline and relapse expression levels of the glucocorticoid receptor gene NR3C1 on survival outcomes in the context of treatment with or without thalidomide.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We investigated the clinical impact of gene expression profiling (GEP)-derived expression levels of NR3C1 in 351 patients with GEP data available at baseline and in 130 with data available at relapse, among 668 subjects accrued to total therapy 2 (TT2).RESULTS: Low NR3C1 expression levels had a negative impact on progression-free survival (PFS; HR, 1.47; P = 0.030) and overall survival (OS; HR, 1.90; P = 0.002) in the no-thalidomide arm.Conversely, there was a significant clinical benefit of thalidomide for patients with low receptor levels (OS: HR, 0.54; P = 0.015; PFS: HR, 0.54; P = 0.004), mediated most likely by thalidomide's upregulation of NR3C1.In the context of both baseline and relapse parameters, post-relapse survival (PRS) was adversely affected by low NR3C1 levels at relapse in a multivariate analysis (HR, 2.61; P = 0.012).CONCLUSION: These findings justify the inclusion of NR3C1 expression data in the work-up of patients with myeloma as it can significantly influence the choice of therapy and, ultimately, OS.The identification of an interaction term between thalidomide and NR3C1 underscores the importance of pharmacogenomic studies in the systematic study of new drugs.",0,0,0,0

34097005,"Early and late morbidity of local excision after chemoradiotherapy for rectal cancer.BACKGROUND: Local excision (LE) after chemoradiotherapy is a new option in low rectal cancer, but morbidity has never been compared prospectively with total mesorectal excision (TME).Early and late morbidity were compared in patients treated either by LE or TME after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for rectal cancer.METHOD: This was a post-hoc analysis from a randomized trial.Patients with clinical T2/T3 low rectal cancer with good response to the chemoradiotherapy and having either LE, LE with eventual completion TME, or TME were considered.Early (1 month) and late (2 years) morbidities were compared between the three groups.RESULTS: There were no deaths following surgery in any of the three groups.Early surgical morbidity (20 per cent LE versus 36 per cent TME versus 43 per cent completion TME, P = 0.025) and late surgical morbidity (4 per cent versus 33 per cent versus 57 per cent, P < 0.001) were significantly lower in the LE group than in the TME or the completion TME group.of LE, was associated with the lowest rate of early (10 versus 18 versus 21 per cent, P = 0.217) and late medical morbidities (0 versus 7 versus 7 per cent, P = 0.154), although this did not represent a significant difference between the groups.The severity of overall morbidity was significantly lower at 2 years after LE compared with TME or completion TME (4 versus 28 versus 43 per cent grade 3-5, P < 0.001).CONCLUSION: The rate of surgical complications after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in the LE group was half that of TME group at 1 month and 10 times lower at 2 years.LE is a safe approach for organ preservation and should be considered as an alternative to watch-and-wait in complete clinical responders and to TME in subcomplete responders.",0,0,0,0
30063901,"While women await surgery for type I endometrial cancer, depot medroxyprogesterone acetate reduces tumor glandular cellularity.BACKGROUND: Multiple population-level studies have demonstrated an adverse effect of long wait times to surgery on survival for women with endometrial cancer.Other retrospective and nonrandomized prospective studies have shown that preoperative administration of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate decreases tumor glandular cellularity, which may be a surrogate marker for clinically meaningful tumor response.OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether preoperative injection with depot medroxyprogesterone acetate decreases tumor glandular cellularity when compared to placebo injection in women awaiting hysterectomy for endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia or type I endometrial cancer, and to determine whether depot medroxyprogesterone acetate injection affects quality of life while waiting for surgery.STUDY DESIGN: This was a double-blind, randomized controlled trial of 400-mg depot medroxyprogesterone acetate injection or 0.9% saline injection at the preoperative visit.Patients with recent use of progesterone analogs were excluded.A sample size of 76 patients (38 per arm) was calculated to detect a 20% difference in decreased glandular cellularity between arms.Pathologic characteristics including the primary outcome, tumor glandular cellularity, from patients' diagnostic biopsies were reviewed by 2 dedicated gynecologic pathologists and compared to posttreatment hysterectomy specimens.On the night prior to surgery, patients completed the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Endometrial Survey (Version 4) to report quality of life while waiting for surgery.In comparing characteristics between the intervention and control groups, t tests were used for continuous variables, and chi(2) or Fisher exact tests were used where appropriate for categorical data.RESULTS: From March 2015 through March 2016, 148 women were screened and 76 patients were enrolled.In all, 38 patients were randomized to and received depot medroxyprogesterone acetate injection and 38 were randomized to and received placebo injection.Demographics were similar between groups.Patients who received depot medroxyprogesterone acetate injection experienced a larger decrease in tumor glandular cellularity (mean change -64 [-31.8%] vs -14 [-5.5%] cells per quarter high-powered field in depot medroxyprogesterone acetate vs placebo groups, P = .002).This effect was most pronounced in women waiting >/=3 weeks for surgery.Several additional histologic and immunohistochemical markers of tumor differentiation and decreased cell proliferation were more pronounced in the depot medroxyprogesterone acetate group than in the placebo group.There were no significant differences in quality of life between groups on the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Endometrial Survey.Only 5.3% of patients who were approached declined to participate due to concerns regarding an intramuscular injection.CONCLUSION: Administration of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate prior to surgery for type I endometrial cancers caused greater tumor effect than placebo injection.Injection of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate was acceptable to and well tolerated by patients.Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate may represent a meaningful bridge to surgery in women who can expect long wait times.",0,0,0,0

25881805,"The Impact of Husbands' Prostate Cancer Diagnosis and Participation in a Behavioral Lifestyle Intervention on Spouses' Lives and Relationships With Their Partners.BACKGROUND: A prostate cancer diagnosis affects the patient and his spouse.Partners of cancer patients are often the first to respond to the demands related to their husband's illness and thus are likely to be the most supportive individuals available to the patients.It is therefore important to examine how spouses react and handle their husband's prostate cancer diagnosis.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore how the prostate cancer diagnosis and the participation in their partners' behavioral lifestyle intervention program influenced the spouses' life, their relationship with their partner, and how they handle the situation.METHODS: Interviews were recorded with 8 spouses of potential low-risk prostate cancer patients on active surveillance as part of a clinical self-management lifestyle trial.RESULTS: We identified 3 phases that the spouses went through: feeling insecure about their situation, coping strategies to deal with these insecurities, and feeling reassured.CONCLUSIONS: The framework of a clinical trial should include mobilizing spousal empowerment so that they can take on an active and meaningful role in relation to their husband's disease.The observations here substantiate that the framework of active surveillance in combination with a lifestyle intervention in 1 specific prostate cancer clinical trial can mobilize spousal empowerment.IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Creating well-designed clinical patient programs that actively involve the spouse appears to promote empowerment (meaning, self-efficacy, positive impact, and self-determination) in spouses.Spousal participation in clinical patient programs can give spouses relief from anxieties while recognizing them as a vital support for their husband.",0,0,0,0

23031619,"Breast density as indicator for the use of mammography or MRI to screen women with familial risk for breast cancer (FaMRIsc): a multicentre randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: To reduce mortality, women with a family history of breast cancer often start mammography screening at a younger age than the general population.Breast density is high in over 50% of women younger than 50 years.With high breast density, breast cancer incidence increases, but sensitivity of mammography decreases.Therefore, mammography might not be the optimal method for breast cancer screening in young women.Adding MRI increases sensitivity, but also the risk of false-positive results.The limitation of all previous MRI screening studies is that they do not contain a comparison group; all participants received both MRI and mammography.Therefore, we cannot empirically assess in which stage tumours would have been detected by either test.The aim of the Familial MRI Screening Study (FaMRIsc) is to compare the efficacy of MRI screening to mammography for women with a familial risk.Furthermore, we will assess the influence of breast density.METHODS/DESIGN: This Dutch multicentre, randomized controlled trial, with balanced randomisation (1:1) has a parallel grouped design.Women with a cumulative lifetime risk for breast cancer due to their family history of >/=20%, aged 30-55 years are eligible.Identified BRCA1/2 mutation carriers or women with 50% risk of carrying a mutation are excluded.Group 1 receives yearly mammography and clinical breast examination (n = 1000), and group 2 yearly MRI and clinical breast examination, and mammography biennially (n = 1000).Primary endpoints are the number and stage of the detected breast cancers in each arm.Secondary endpoints are the number of false-positive results in both screening arms.Furthermore, sensitivity and positive predictive value of both screening strategies will be assessed.Cost-effectiveness of both strategies will be assessed.Analyses will also be performed with mammographic density as stratification factor.DISCUSSION: Personalized breast cancer screening might optimize mortality reduction with less over diagnosis.Breast density may be a key discriminator for selecting the optimal screening strategy for women < 55 years with familial breast cancer risk; mammography or MRI.These issues are addressed in the FaMRIsc study including high risk women due to a familial predisposition.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Netherland Trial Register NTR2789.",1,1,0,0
22674529,"A phase 3 study of induction treatment with concurrent chemoradiotherapy versus chemotherapy before surgery in patients with pathologically confirmed N2 stage IIIA nonsmall cell lung cancer (WJTOG9903).BACKGROUND: This study sought to ascertain whether induction-concurrent radiotherapy added to chemotherapy could improve the survival of patients undergoing surgery for stage IIIA N2 nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC).METHODS: Patients with pathologically proven N2 disease were randomized to receive either induction chemotherapy (docetaxel 60 mg/m(2) and carboplatin AUC [area under the receiver operating characteristic curve] = 5 for 2 cycles) plus concurrent radiation therapy (40 Gy) followed by surgery (CRS arm) or induction chemotherapy followed by surgery (CS arm).They subsequently underwent pulmonary resection when possible.RESULTS: Sixty patients were randomly assigned between December 2000 and August 2005.The study was prematurely terminated in January 2006 because of slow accrual.The most common toxicity was grade 3 or 4 leukopenia in 92.9% of patients in the CRS arm and 46.4% in the CS arm.Induction therapy was generally well tolerated, and there were no treatment-related deaths in either arm.Downstaging in the CS arm and CRS arm was 21% and 40%, respectively.The progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in the CS arm were 9.7 months and 29.9 months (PFS, hazard ratio [HR] = 0.68, P = .187), and those in the CRS arm were 12.4 months and 39.6 months (OS, HR = 0.77, P = .397), respectively.The PFS with and without downstaging was 55.0 and 9.4 months, respectively (HR = 3.39, P = .001).The OS with and without downstaging was 63.3 and 29.5 months, respectively (HR = 2.62, P = .021).CONCLUSIONS: The addition of radiotherapy to induction chemotherapy conferred better local control without significant adverse events.Tumor downstaging is important for prolonging the OS in patients with stage IIIA (N2) NSCLC.",1,1,1,0
25581207,"Colorectal adenomas and diabetes: implications for disease prevention.AIM: This study assessed the baseline type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) risk status among overweight patients with screen-detected colorectal adenomas and explored the implications of the findings for preventative practice.METHOD: Participants aged between 50 and 74 years (73% of whom were men) were recruited from four Scottish health boards and assessed for diabetes risk.Participants were categorized as at 'high' diabetes risk if glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) was between 6.0 and 6.4% or fasting plasma glucose (FPG) was between 5.5 and 6.9 mmol/l and as potentially undiagnosed T2DM when HbA1c >/= 6.5% or FPG >/= 7 mmol/l.Secondary outcome measures included anthropometric measurements, blood pressure and the plasma lipid profile.The tests were repeated at 12 months and diabetes risk categories were reassessed following intervention procedures.RESULTS: Forty-seven (14.3%) of the 329 participants had a preexisting diagnosis of T2DM.Of the remainder with complete biochemistry results (n = 250), 19 (7.6%) were classified as having potentially undiagnosed T2DM and 125 (50.0%) as being at high risk of developing diabetes.More than a quarter of participants in all categories had raised waist circumference, hypertension and plasma lipids, indicative of raised cardiovascular risk.At 12 months' follow-up, the diabetes risk category diminished in 20% of the intervention group vs 11% in the controls [OR 2.26 (95% CI 1.03-4.96)].CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that a diagnosis of adenoma in overweight patients provides a health service opportunity for diabetes assessment, prevention and management in a high-risk population at a potentially teachable moment.",0,0,0,0

29943097,"Evaluation of the effects of sensorimotor exercise on physical and psychological parameters in breast cancer patients undergoing neurotoxic chemotherapy.INTRODUCTION: Breast cancer is the most common cancer disease of women in industrialized countries.Neurotoxic chemotherapy drugs are known to harm peripheral nerves and cause a chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN).CIPN is one of the most common adverse events associated with Paclitaxel chemotherapy and may remain present long after the termination of chemotherapy.Thus, it reduces the patients' quality of life (QoL) both during chemotherapy and onwards, and can impose a danger on breast cancer survivors due to an increased risk of falling and fall-related injuries.METHODS: The aim of this randomized-controlled trial (RCT) (n = 36) (IG: intervention group, n = 17) (CG: control group, n = 19) was to determine whether sensorimotor exercises have a positive effect on physical and psychological parameters in breast cancer patients undergoing neurotoxic chemotherapy (Paclitaxel).RESULTS: As a result, we were able to show significant improvements in postural stability in monopedal stance [left leg 16.17 +/-3.67 vs. 21.55 +/- 5.33 (p < 0.001) and right leg 15.14 +/- 2.30 vs. 20.85 +/- 5.05 (p < 0.001)] and in bipedal stance [T1 vs. T0, - 0.49 (IG) vs. + 1.14 (CG) p = 0.039].DISCUSSION: These results in posturography correlate with the clinical presentation with intervention group patients scoring significantly better on the Fullerton Advanced Balance Scale [37.71 +/- 2.73 vs. 34.47 +/- 3.98 (p = 0.004)].Moderate strength training successfully prevented a strength loss in the IG that was remarkable in the CG (- 1.60 vs. 0.60, p = 0.029).Concerning the psychological parameters assessed via EORTC- and MFI-questionnaires, no significant improvements were found.CONCLUSION: Future studies should focus on the correlation of clinical and posturometry findings and subjective QOL such as the long-term-development of CIPN.",0,0,0,0

22669453,"Tumor budding is an independent predictor of outcome in AJCC/UICC stage II colorectal cancer.BACKGROUND: In colorectal cancer, the morphology of the invasive tumor margin may reflect aggressiveness of tumor growth, thus providing important prognostic information.The tumor growth pattern according to Jass and the extent of tumor budding were analyzed in patients with American Joint Committee on Cancer/Union for International Cancer Control (AJCC/UICC) stage II disease.METHODS: Tumors of 120 randomly selected patients with AJCC/UICC stage II disease were retrospectively reviewed for tumor growth pattern (expanding vs. infiltrating) and the extent of tumor budding, with high-grade budding reflecting presence of 10 or more budding foci scattered at the invasive tumor margin.Progression-free and cancer-specific survivals were determined by the Kaplan-Meier method.For multivariable analysis, Cox's proportional hazards regression models were performed.RESULTS: The infiltrating growth pattern was significantly associated with histological subtype and lymphovascular invasion, while high-grade budding was significantly associated with tumor grade and lymphovascular invasion.High-grade budding, but not the infiltrating growth pattern, was significantly associated with outcome in univariable analysis.Cox's proportional hazards regression models proved tumor budding to be an independent predictor of disease progression (hazard ratio 3.91, 95 % confidence interval 1.3-11.77; P = 0.02) and cancer-related death (hazard ratio 5.90, 95 % confidence interval 1.62-21.51; P = 0.007).The combination of infiltrating growth pattern and high-grade budding did not have a stronger prognostic significance than tumor budding alone.CONCLUSIONS: Tumor budding independently predicted patient outcome in patients with AJCC/UICC stage II colorectal cancer and may therefore be used for accurate prognostication, patient counseling, and design of clinical trials by using integrated multimodal therapy.",0,0,0,0
33052757,"ARTSCAN III: A Randomized Phase III Study Comparing Chemoradiotherapy With Cisplatin Versus Cetuximab in Patients With Locoregionally Advanced Head and Neck Squamous Cell Cancer.PURPOSE: We performed an open-label randomized controlled phase III study comparing treatment outcome and toxicity between radiotherapy (RT) with concomitant cisplatin versus concomitant cetuximab in patients with locoregionally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC; stage III-IV according to the Union for International Cancer Control TNM classification, 7th edition).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eligible patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive either intravenous cetuximab 400 mg/m(2) 1 week before start of RT followed by 250 mg/m(2)/wk, or weekly intravenous cisplatin 40 mg/m(2), during RT.RT was conventionally fractionated.Patients with T3-T4 tumors underwent a second random assignment 1:1 between standard RT dose 68.0 Gy to the primary tumor or dose escalation to 73.1 Gy.Primary end point was overall survival (OS) evaluated using adjusted Cox regression analysis.Secondary end points were locoregional control, local control with dose-escalated RT, pattern of failure, and adverse effects.RESULTS: Study inclusion was prematurely closed after an unplanned interim analysis when 298 patients had been randomly assigned.At 3 years, OS was 88% (95% CI, 83% to 94%) and 78% (95% CI, 71% to 85%) in the cisplatin and cetuximab groups, respectively (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.63; 95% CI, 0.93 to 2.86; P = .086).The cumulative incidence of locoregional failures at 3 years was 23% (95% CI, 16% to 31%) compared with 9% (95% CI, 4% to 14%) in the cetuximab versus the cisplatin group (Gray's test P = .0036).The cumulative incidence of distant failures did not differ between the treatment groups.Dose escalation in T3-T4 tumors did not increase local control.CONCLUSION: Cetuximab is inferior to cisplatin regarding locoregional control for concomitant treatment with RT in patients with locoregionally advanced HNSCC.Additional studies are needed to identify possible subgroups that still may benefit from concomitant cetuximab treatment.",0,0,0,0

23222500,"When does an episode of care for cancer begin?BACKGROUND: Little is known about the medical care resources devoted to diagnosing and treating cancer-related symptoms before a definitive cancer diagnosis.Previous research using SEER-Medicare data to measure incremental costs and utilization associated with cancer started with the date of diagnosis.We hypothesized that health care use increases before diagnosis of a new primary cancer.METHODS: We used a longitudinal case-control design to estimate incremental medical care utilization rates.Cases were 121,293 persons enrolled between January 2000 and December 2008 with >/=1 primary cancers.We selected 522,839 controls randomly from among all health plan members who had no tumor registry evidence of cancer before January 2009, and we frequency matched controls to cancer cases on a 5:1 ratio by age group, sex, and having health plan eligibility in the year of diagnosis of the index cancer case.Utilization data were extracted for all cases and controls for the period 2000 to 2008 from standardized distributed data warehouses.To determine when and the extent to which patterns of medical care use change preceding a cancer diagnosis, we compute hospitalization rates, hospital days, emergency department visits, same-day surgical procedures, ambulatory medical office visits, imaging procedures, laboratory tests, and ambulatory prescription dispensings per 1000 persons per month within integrated delivery systems.RESULTS: One- to 3-fold increases in monthly utilization rates were observed during the 3 to 5 months before a cancer diagnosis, compared with matched noncancer control groups.This pattern was consistent for both aged and nonaged cancer patients.Aged cancer patients had higher utilization rates than nonaged cancer patients throughout the year before a cancer diagnosis.CONCLUSIONS: The prediagnosis phase is a resource-intensive component of cancer care episodes and should be included in cost of cancer estimates.More research is needed to determine whether reliable prognostic markers can be identified as the start of a cancer episode before a pathology-based diagnosis.",0,0,0,0

33027722,"Hysteroscopic versus cervical injection for sentinel node detection in endometrial cancer: A multicenter prospective randomised controlled trial from the Multicenter Italian Trials in Ovarian cancer (MITO) study group.AIM: During the last years, the role of sentinel lymph node mapping (SLNM) for endometrial cancer (EC) surgical treatment has increased in popularity.However, several controversies remain about different technical steps of SLNM.Thus, a randomised control trial was designed to compare cervical (CI) and hysteroscopic (HI) indocyanine green (ICG) injection for SLNM of newly diagnosed EC undergoing surgical staging.The primary end-point of the study was to compare these two techniques in terms of para-aortic detection rate.METHODS: Patients with apparent stage I or II histologically confirmed EC undergoing surgery were included in the study.This randomised trial distinguished patients in two study groups according to two different techniques of ICG SLNM: CI versus HI injection.Patients who met the inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to CI or HI injection in a 1:1 ratio.The central randomisation system allocated patient randomisation numbers sequentially in the order in which the patients were enrolled.This randomised trial was not blinded for either patients or the surgeons.RESULTS: From March 2017 until April 2019, a total of 165 patients were randomised in this study: 85 (51.5%) in the CI group and 80 (48.5%) in the HI group.After randomisation, 14 (8.5%) patients were excluded from the study.Finally, 151 patients were included in the analysis: 82 (54.3%) in the CI group and 69 (45.7%) in the HI group.Hysteroscopy injection shows an ability to detect Sentinel nodes (SNLs) in the para-aortic area of about 10% greater compared with CI injection, although this difference did not reach statistical significance.The HI technique was superior in detecting isolated para-aortic SLNs (5.8% Versus 0%).The CI injection was correlated with higher SLN detection rates at the pelvic level compared with HI injection.Pelvic and overall detection was higher in the CI group.CONCLUSIONS: The present study supports the adoption of CI instead of HI injection because the former allows better identification of sentinel nodes (especially in the pelvic area).Detection of SLN in the para-aortic area was slightly higher in patients receiving a HI injection, but the difference with the CI route was not statistically significant.",0,0,0,0
34344355,"A proof-of-concept sub-study exploring feasibility and preliminary evidence for the role of physical activity on neural activity during executive functioning tasks among young adults after cancer treatment.BACKGROUND: Executive functioning (EF) deficits are troubling for adolescents and young adults (AYAs) after cancer treatment.Physical activity (PA) may enhance neural activity underlying EF among older adults affected by cancer.Establishing whether PA enhances neural activity among AYAs is warranted.As part of a two-arm, mixed-methods pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT), this proof-of-concept sub-study sought to answer the following questions: (1) is it feasible to use neuroimaging with EF tasks to assess neural activity changes following a 12-week PA intervention? And (2) is there preliminary evidence that a 12-week PA intervention enhances neural activity among AYAs after cancer treatment?METHODS: AYAs in the pilot RCT were approached for enrollment into this sub-study.Those who were eligible and enrolled, completed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with EF tasks (letter n-back, Go/No Go) pre- and post-PA intervention.Sub-study enrollment, adherence to scheduled fMRI scans, outliers, missing data, and EF task performance data were collected.Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics, blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) analyses, and paired sample t-tests.RESULTS: Nine eligible participants enrolled into this sub-study; six attended scheduled fMRI scans.One outlier was identified and was subsequently removed from the analytical sample.Participants showed no differences in EF task performance from pre- to post-PA intervention.Increases in neural activity in brain regions responsible for motor control, information encoding and processing, and decision-making were observed post-PA intervention (p < 0.05; n = 5).CONCLUSIONS: Findings show that fMRI scans during EF tasks detected neural activity changes (as assessed by the BOLD signal) from pre- to post-PA intervention.Results thus suggest future trials confirming that PA enhances neural activity underlying EF are needed, though feasibility issues require careful consideration to ensure trial success.TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov, NCT03016728.Registered January 11, 2017, clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03016728.",0,0,0,0

31654838,"Patient-reported outcomes from the randomized phase III ALEX study of alectinib versus crizotinib in patients with ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer.OBJECTIVES: Alectinib demonstrated superior efficacy and a safety profile that compared favorably with crizotinib in treatment-naive ALK+ non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the phase III ALEX study.We present patient-reported outcomes (PROs) from ALEX to assess disease burden, treatment-related symptom tolerability, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) with alectinib versus crizotinib.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were randomized to receive alectinib 600 mg or crizotinib 250 mg twice daily until disease progression, death, or withdrawal.Pre-specified PRO endpoints were: mean change from baseline in symptoms, HRQoL, and functioning; and time to deterioration (TTD) in cough, dyspnea, chest pain, arm/shoulder pain, fatigue, and a composite of three symptoms (cough, dyspnea, chest pain).PRO data were collected using EORTC QLQ-C30 and LC13 questionnaires.Raw scores were standardized to a 0-100-point range, with a >/=10-point score change defined as clinically meaningful.TTD was defined as the time from randomization until confirmed clinically meaningful deterioration (i.e., a >/=10-point score change from baseline).RESULTS: Baseline completion rates and characteristics were balanced in the PRO-evaluable population (alectinib n = 100, 66%; crizotinib n = 97, 64%).On average, alectinib-treated patients reported clinically meaningful improvements in lung cancer symptoms for longer than crizotinib-treated patients.Between-treatment differences in lung cancer symptoms tended to favor alectinib from 11.1 months (45 weeks) onwards, around the time of median PFS with crizotinib (11.1 months).TTD in lung cancer symptoms was similar between treatment arms, despite longer duration of symptom improvement with alectinib; composite symptom endpoint (hazard ratio 1.10 [95% confidence interval: 0.72-1.68]).Duration of clinically meaningful improvement in HRQoL was longer with alectinib versus crizotinib (Week 88 vs. Week 68, respectively).Better patient-reported tolerability was observed with alectinib versus crizotinib on common treatment-related symptoms.CONCLUSION: PRO data support the superior efficacy and tolerability of alectinib relative to crizotinib demonstrated in the ALEX study.",1,1,1,1
31175052,"Personalized Decision Making in Early Stage Breast Cancer: Applying Clinical Prediction Models for Anthracycline Cardiotoxicity and Breast Cancer Mortality Demonstrates Substantial Heterogeneity of Benefit-Harm Trade-off.BACKGROUND: Anthracycline agents can cause cardiotoxicity.We used multivariable risk prediction models to identify a subset of patients with breast cancer at high risk of cardiotoxicity, for whom the harms of anthracycline chemotherapy may balance or exceed the benefits.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A clinical prediction model for anthracycline cardiotoxicity was created in 967 patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor-negative breast cancer treated with doxorubicin in the ECOG-ACRIN study E5103.Cardiotoxicity was defined as left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decline of >/= 10% to < 50% and/or a centrally adjudicated clinical heart failure diagnosis.Patient-specific incremental absolute benefit of anthracyclines (compared with non-anthracycline taxane chemotherapy) was estimated using the PREDICT model to assess breast cancer mortality risk.RESULTS: Of the 967 women who initiated therapy, 51 (5.3%) developed cardiotoxicity (12 with clinical heart failure).In a multivariate model, increasing age (odds ratio [OR], 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.08), higher body mass index (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.02-1.10), and lower baseline LVEF (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.89-0.98) at baseline were significantly associated with cardiotoxicity.The concordance statistic of the risk model was 0.70 (95% CI, 0.63-0.77).In patients with low anticipated treatment benefit (n = 176) from the addition of anthracycline (< 2% absolute risk difference of breast cancer mortality at 10 years), 16 (9%) of 176 had a > 10% risk of cardiotoxicity and 61 (35%) of 176 had a 5% to 10% risk of cardiotoxicity at 1 year.CONCLUSION: Older age, higher body mass index, and lower baseline LVEF were associated with increased risk of cardiotoxicity.We identified a subgroup with low predicted absolute benefit of anthracyclines but with high predicted risk of cardiotoxicity.Additional studies are needed incorporating long-term cardiac outcomes and cardiotoxicity model external validation prior to implementation in routine clinical practice.",0,0,0,0
