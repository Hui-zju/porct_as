23863050,"Alpha emitter radium-223 and survival in metastatic prostate cancer.BACKGROUND: Radium-223 dichloride (radium-223), an alpha emitter, selectively targets bone metastases with alpha particles.We assessed the efficacy and safety of radium-223 as compared with placebo, in addition to the best standard of care, in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer and bone metastases.METHODS: In our phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we randomly assigned 921 patients who had received, were not eligible to receive, or declined docetaxel, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive six injections of radium-223 (at a dose of 50 kBq per kilogram of body weight intravenously) or matching placebo; one injection was administered every 4 weeks.In addition, all patients received the best standard of care.The primary end point was overall survival.The main secondary efficacy end points included time to the first symptomatic skeletal event and various biochemical end points.A prespecified interim analysis, conducted when 314 deaths had occurred, assessed the effect of radium-223 versus placebo on survival.An updated analysis, when 528 deaths had occurred, was performed before crossover from placebo to radium-223.RESULTS: At the interim analysis, which involved 809 patients, radium-223, as compared with placebo, significantly improved overall survival (median, 14.0 months vs. 11.2 months; hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.55 to 0.88; two-sided P=0.002).The updated analysis involving 921 patients confirmed the radium-223 survival benefit (median, 14.9 months vs. 11.3 months; hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.83; P<0.001).Assessments of all main secondary efficacy end points also showed a benefit of radium-233 as compared with placebo.Radium-223 was associated with low myelosuppression rates and fewer adverse events.CONCLUSIONS: In this study, which was terminated for efficacy at the prespecified interim analysis, radium-223 improved overall survival.(Funded by Algeta and Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals; ALSYMPCA ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00699751.).",0,0,0,0
26183420,"Randomized Controlled Study to Evaluate the Efficacy of a Preoperative Respiratory Rehabilitation Program to Prevent Postoperative Pulmonary Complications after Esophagectomy.BACKGROUND/AIMS: Patients with postoperative pulmonary complications after esophagectomy often have increased mortality.The purpose of the study was to examine the efficacy of preventing postoperative pulmonary complications by an intensive preoperative respiratory rehabilitation (PR) program for esophageal cancer patients.METHODS: This study was a prospective randomized controlled study.Thirty patients in the PR group and 30 patients in the no preoperative respiratory rehabilitation (NPR) group were included.The PR group received preoperative rehabilitation for more than 7 days, while the NPR group did not receive any preoperative rehabilitation.All patients underwent postoperative rehabilitation from the first postoperative day.The postoperative pulmonary complications were evaluated using the Clavien-Dindo classification (CDC) and the Utrecht Pneumonia Scoring System (UPSS).RESULTS: The CDC grade in the PR group was significantly lower than that in the NPR group (p = 0.014).The UPSS score in the PR group was significantly lower than that in the NPR group at postoperative day 1 (p = 0.031).In the multivariate analysis, NPR was an independent risk factor for postoperative pulmonary complications greater than CDC grade II (OR: 3.99, 95% CI: 1.28-12.4, p = 0.017).CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the intensive PR program was capable of reducing the postoperative pulmonary complications in esophageal cancer patients.",1,1,0,0
27081036,"Cardiotoxicity as indicated by LVEF and troponin T sensitivity following two anthracycline-based regimens in lymphoma: Results from a randomized prospective clinical trial.Anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity influences treatment selection and may negatively affect clinical outcomes in lymphoma patients.While epirubicin induced cardiotoxicity less often than the same dose of doxorubicin in breast cancer, higher doses of epirubicin are required in lymphoma regimens for equivalent efficacy.Whether a higher dosage of epirubicin also induces cardiotoxicity less often than doxorubicin in lymphoma remains unknown.We therefore administered 6-8 cycles of cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisone (CEpOP) +/- rituximab (R) with either epirubicin (CEpOP) or doxorubicin (CHOP) to patients (N=398) with untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or follicular lymphoma grade 3 (FLG3).Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and high-sensitivity serum cardiac troponin T (HsTnT) were assessed at baseline and after 4 cycles of treatment.Epirubicin (70 mg/m2/dose) was equivalent to doxorubicin (50 mg/m2/dose) in terms of 3-year progression-free survival.The risk of decreased LVEF was similar between the two regimens.CEpOP+/-R induced HsTnT elevation less often than CHOP+/-R. We conclude that CEpOP+/-R is a more acceptable regimen with short-term efficacy similar to CHOP+/-R in lymphoma patients.Longer follow-up is needed to monitor the risk of cardiac dysfunction and determine whether differences in the induction of elevated HsTnT between epirubicin and doxorubicin justify changes in clinical practice.",0,0,0,0
22402288,"Central adiposity and Prostate Cancer in a Black Population.BACKGROUND: The relationship between central adiposity and prostate cancer remains unclear.METHODS: This report includes 963 newly diagnosed cases of histologically confirmed prostate cancer and 941 randomly selected age-matched controls ascertained from the population-based Prostate Cancer in a Black Population study conducted between July 2002 and January 2011 in Barbados, West Indies.Trained nurse interviewers obtained data on height, weight, waist and hip circumferences, family and medical history, and lifestyle factors.ORs and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to assess associations between anthropometric measures and prostate cancer.RESULTS: A two-fold increased risk of prostate cancer was found among men in the highest quartile of waist-hip ratio compared with those in the lowest quartile (OR = 2.11, 95% CI, 1.54-2.88).Similarly, men with the largest waist circumferences had an OR of 1.84 (95% CI, 1.19-2.85) compared with those with the smallest waist sizes.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that measures of central rather than global adiposity may be more predictive of prostate cancer, especially in westernized African populations, where patterns of visceral fat distribution are different than other groups.IMPACT: The findings highlight the need to further elucidate the mechanisms underlying the relationship between central adiposity and prostate cancer in populations of predominantly African descent.",0,0,0,0
24793004,"A feasibility study of a psychoeducational intervention program for gynecological cancer patients.PURPOSE OF THE RESEARCH: This study aimed to test the feasibility of implementing a psychoeducational intervention program for gynecological cancer patients.METHODS AND SAMPLE: A single-blinded randomized controlled trial and mixed-method design were used.Study subjects were newly diagnosed gynecological cancer patients with surgery as the first-line treatment.They were randomly assigned to the intervention group, in which a psychoeducational intervention program based on a thematic counseling model was offered, or to the attention control group.Quantitative data on sexual functioning, quality of life, uncertainty, anxiety, depression and social support were collected at recruitment, post-operative and during the in-hospital period, and eight weeks after the operation.Participants in the intervention group and three nurses working in the clinical setting were invited to have semi-structured interviews.KEY RESULTS: Of the 30 eligible subjects, 26 were successfully recruited into the study.Following the psychoeducational intervention program, there was significant improvement in the level of inconsistent information about the illness within the category of uncertainty among participants in the intervention group.In addition, trends towards improvement were demonstrated in quality of life, uncertainty, depression and perceived social support with the provision of the interventions.Qualitative data indicated the interventions were desired and appreciated by the participants, as well as being feasible and practical to implement in Hong Kong clinical settings.CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that it is feasible to deliver the psychoeducational intervention program and it may have beneficial effects in gynecological cancer patients.A full-scale study is warranted to confirm the results.",1,1,0,0
27265347,"Adjuvant chemotherapy of S-1 versus gemcitabine for resected pancreatic cancer: a phase 3, open-label, randomised, non-inferiority trial (JASPAC 01).BACKGROUND: Although adjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine is standard care for resected pancreatic cancer, S-1 has shown non-inferiority to gemcitabine for advanced disease.We aimed to investigate the non-inferiority of S-1 to gemcitabine as adjuvant chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer in terms of overall survival.METHODS: We did a randomised, open-label, multicentre, non-inferiority phase 3 trial undertaken at 33 hospitals in Japan.Patients who had histologically proven invasive ductal carcinoma of the pancreas, pathologically documented stage I-III, and no local residual or microscopic residual tumour, and were aged 20 years or older were eligible.Patients with resected pancreatic cancer were randomly assigned (in a 1:1 ratio) to receive gemcitabine (1000 mg/m(2), intravenously administered on days 1, 8, and 15, every 4 weeks [one cycle], for up to six cycles) or S-1 (40 mg, 50 mg, or 60 mg according to body-surface area, orally administered twice a day for 28 days followed by a 14 day rest, every 6 weeks [one cycle], for up to four cycles) at the data centre by a modified minimisation method, balancing residual tumour status, nodal status, and institutions.The primary outcome was overall survival in the two treatment groups, assessed in the per-protocol population, excluding ineligible patients and those not receiving the allocated treatment.The protocol prespecified that the superiority of S-1 with respect to overall survival was also to be assessed in the per-protocol population by a log-rank test, if the non-inferiority of S-1 was verified.We estimated overall and relapse-free survival using the Kaplan-Meier methods, and assessed non-inferiority of S-1 to gemcitabine using the Cox proportional hazard model.The expected hazard ratio (HR) for mortality was 0.87 with a non-inferiority margin of 1.25 (power 80%; one-sided type I error 2.5%).This trial is registered at UMIN CTR (UMIN000000655).FINDINGS: 385 patients were randomly assigned to treatment between April 11, 2007, and June 29, 2010 (193 to the gemcitabine group and 192 to the S-1 group).Of these, three were exlcuded because of ineligibility and five did not receive chemotherapy.The per-protocol population therefore consisted of 190 patients in the gemcitabine group and 187 patients in the S-1 group.On Sept 15, 2012, following the recommendation from the independent data and safety monitoring committee, this study was discontinued because the prespecified criteria for early discontinuation were met at the interim analysis for efficacy, when all the protocol treatments had been finished.Analysis with the follow-up data on Jan 15, 2016, showed HR of mortality was 0.57 (95% CI 0.44-0.72, pnon-inferiority<0.0001, p<0.0001 for superiority), associated with 5-year overall survival of 24.4% (18.6-30.8) in the gemcitabine group and 44.1% (36.9-51.1) in the S-1 group.Grade 3 or 4 leucopenia, neutropenia, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase were observed more frequently in the gemcitabine group, whereas stomatitis and diarrhoea were more frequently experienced in the S-1 group.INTERPRETATION: Adjuvant chemotherapy with S-1 can be a new standard care for resected pancreatic cancer in Japanese patients.These results should be assessed in non-Asian patients.FUNDING: Pharma Valley Center, Shizuoka Industrial Foundation, Taiho Pharmaceutical.",1,1,1,0
26946057,"BRCA1-like profile predicts benefit of tandem high dose epirubicin-cyclophospamide-thiotepa in high risk breast cancer patients randomized in the WSG-AM01 trial.BRCA1 is an important protein in the repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), which are induced by alkylating chemotherapy.A BRCA1-like DNA copy number signature derived from tumors with a BRCA1 mutation is indicative for impaired BRCA1 function and associated with good outcome after high dose (HD) and tandem HD DSB inducing chemotherapy.We investigated whether BRCA1-like status was a predictive biomarker in the WSG AM 01 trial.WSG AM 01 randomized high-risk breast cancer patients to induction (2x epirubicin-cyclophosphamide) followed by tandem HD chemotherapy with epirubicin, cyclophosphamide and thiotepa versus dose dense chemotherapy (4x epirubicin-cyclophospamide followed by 3x cyclophosphamide-methotrexate-5-fluorouracil).We generated copy number profiles for 143 tumors and classified them as being BRCA1-like or non-BRCA1-like.Twenty-six out of 143 patients were BRCA1-like.BRCA1-like status was associated with high grade and triple negative tumors.With regard to event-free-survival, the primary endpoint of the trial, patients with a BRCA1-like tumor had a hazard rate of 0.2, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.07-0.63, p = 0.006.In the interaction analysis, the combination of BRCA1-like status and HD chemotherapy had a hazard rate of 0.19, 95% CI: 0.067-0.54, p = 0.003.Similar results were observed for overall survival.These findings suggest that BRCA1-like status is a predictor for benefit of tandem HD chemotherapy with epirubicin-thiotepa-cyclophosphamide.",0,0,0,0
23636449,"Prophylaxis of catheter-related deep vein thrombosis in cancer patients with low-dose warfarin, low molecular weight heparin, or control: a randomized, controlled, phase III study.PURPOSE: Whether an anticoagulant prophylaxis is needed for patients with cancer with a central venous catheter is a highly controversial subject.We designed a study to compare different prophylactic strategies over 3 months of treatment.METHODS: We performed a phase III prospective, open-label randomized trial.After the insertion of a central venous access device, consecutive patients with planned chemotherapy for cancer were randomized to no anticoagulant prophylaxis, low molecular weight heparin [low molecular weight heparin (LMWH); with isocoagulation doses], or warfarin 1 mg/day.Treatments were given over the first 3 months.Doppler ultrasound and venographies were performed on days 1 and 90, respectively, or sooner in case of clinical presumption of thrombosis.RESULTS: A total of 420 patients were randomized, and 407 were evaluable.Forty-two catheter-related deep vein thrombosis (DVT) occurred (10.3 %), 20 in those with no anticoagulation, 8 in those receiving warfarin, and 14 in those receiving LMWH.Nine additional non-related catheter deep vein thrombosis (CDVT) occurred.Anticoagulation significantly reduced the incidence of catheter-related DVT (p = 0.035) and catheter non-related DVT (p = 0.007), with no difference between warfarin and LMWH.Safety was good (3.4 % of attributable events) but compliance with randomized prophylaxis was lower than expected.CONCLUSIONS: Prophylaxis showed a benefit regarding catheter-related and non-catheter-related DVT with no increase in serious side effects.",0,0,0,0

23467957,"Use of irradiate animal pericardium membrane for prevention of Frey's syndrome after parotidectomy.BACKGROUND: Frey syndrome is a common complication that appears few months after parotid surgery with flushing and sweating of the parotid-temporal area during mastication.It presumably originates from an aberrant nervous regeneration in which the parasympathetic fibers of the parotid gland would combine themselves with the sympathetic fibers of the sweat glands and with the cutaneous vessels.AIM: In the present study we analyze the effectiveness of a collagenous membrane derived from animal pericardium (APM) to prevent Frey's syndrome after parotidectomy.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied a total of 40 patients with benign tumors of the parotid gland, including 30 patients with pleomorphic adenoma, 7 patients with Warthin tumor and 3 with basal cells adenoma.The patients were divided into 2 groups: group 1 (experimental n=20) executed superficial parotidectomy with replacement of bovine pericardial matrix (BPM); group 2 (control n=20) underwent superficial parotidectomy followed by reposition of superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS) flap.All patients were questioned over their subjective symptom and tested with Minor's test after 12 months from the intervention and introduced in a follow-up of 3 years.RESULTS: Subjectively Frey syndrome was referred in 5% of patients in group 1 and in 10% in group 2, while 0 cases were observed in group 1 after the starch-iodine test, 2 cases in group 2 (10%).CONCLUSIONS: Considering the present results, although this study needs further implementation, we can affirm that BPM is a valid option in preventing Frey's syndrome whereas SMAS flap is not available.",0,0,0,0
25662406,"Phase I trial of a cancer vaccine consisting of 20 mixed peptides in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer: dose-related immune boosting and suppression.The heterogeneity expression of tumor-associated antigens (TAA) and variability of human T cell repertoire suggest that effective cancer vaccine requires induction of a wide breadth of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) specificities.This can be achieved with vaccines targeting multiple TAA.We evaluated the safety and immune dynamics of a cancer vaccine consisting of 20 mixed peptides (KRM-20) designed to induce CTLs against 12 different TAA in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).Patients received each of three different randomly assigned doses of KRM-20 (6, 20, or 60 mg) once a week for 6 weeks.KRM-20 was applicable for patients with positive human leukocyte antigen (HLA) A2, A3, A11, A24, A26, A31 or A33 alleles, which cover the majority of the global population.To evaluate the minimum immunological effective dose (MIED), peptide-specific CTL and immunoglobulin G (IgG) responses, and immune suppressive subsets were evaluated during the vaccination.Total of 17 patients was enrolled.No serious adverse drug reactions were encountered.The MIED of KRM-20 in CTL or IgG response calculated by logistic regression model was set as 16 or 1.6 mg, respectively.The frequency of immune suppressive subsets was fewer in the 20 mg cohort than that in 6 or 60 mg cohort.Clinical responses determined by prostate-specific antigen levels were two partial responses (from the 20 mg cohort), five no changes and ten progressive diseases.Twenty milligrams of KRM-20 could be recommended for further studies because of the safety and ability to augment CTL activity.",0,0,0,0

27209164,"BEVERLY: Rationale and Design of a Randomized Open-Label Phase III Trial Comparing Bevacizumab Plus Erlotinib Versus Erlotinib Alone as First-Line Treatment of Patients With EGFR-Mutated Advanced Nonsquamous Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.BACKGROUND: About 20% of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases harbor somatic mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene.In these patients, the standard first-line treatments are the EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as gefitinib, erlotinib, or afatinib.Most of these patients develop resistance and relapse within about 1 year of initiation of an EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor.Consequently, it is important to develop new combination strategies to delay this resistance.Preclinical data have showed that EGFR and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) share a common downstream pathway, suggesting the important role of VEGF in the resistance to EGFR blockade.The combination of erlotinib and bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF agent, showed very interesting clinical results.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The bevacizumab plus erlotinib study (BEVERLY) is a randomized, open-label, phase III trial investigating first-line erlotinib plus bevacizumab versus erlotinib in patients with advanced NSCLC harboring activating EGFR mutations.The co-primary endpoints are investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) and blinded, independent centrally reviewed PFS.The secondary endpoints include overall survival, quality of life, objective response rate, and safety.A total of 200 patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive oral erlotinib (150 mg daily) plus bevacizumab (15 mg/kg, intravenously, on day 1 of every 21-day cycle) or erlotinib alone, until objective disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or the patient's or physician's motivated decision to stop the treatment.CONCLUSION: If the primary endpoint of PFS is met, the erlotinib plus bevacizumab combination will be confirmed as the best first-line treatment for patients with advanced NSCLC harboring activating EGFR mutations.",1,1,0,0

24661672,"SPARCL1 expression increases with preoperative radiation therapy and predicts better survival in rectal cancer patients.PURPOSE: The secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine-like 1 (SPARCL1) is expressed in various normal tissues and many types of cancers.The function of SPARCL1 and its relationship to a patient's prognosis have been studied, whereas its relationship to radiation therapy (RT) is not known.Our aim was to investigate the expression of SPARCL1 in rectal cancer patients who participated in a clinical trial of preoperative RT.METHODS AND MATERIALS: The study included 136 rectal cancer patients who were randomized to undergo preoperative RT and surgery (n=63) or surgery alone (n=73).The expression levels of SPARCL1 in normal mucosa (n=29), primary tumor (n=136), and lymph node metastasis (n=35) were determined by immunohistochemistry.RESULTS: Tumors with RT had stronger SPARCL1 expression than tumors without RT (P=.003).In the RT group, strong SPARCL1 expression was related to better survival than weak expression in patients with stage III tumors, independent of sex, age, differentiation, and margin status (P=.022; RR = 18.128; 95% confidence interval, 1.512-217.413).No such relationship was found in the non-RT group (P=.224).Further analysis of interactions among SPARCL1 expression, RT, and survival showed statistical significance (P=.024).In patients with metastases who received RT, strong SPARCL1 expression was related to better survival compared to weak expression (P=.041) but not in the non-RT group (P=.569).CONCLUSIONS: SPARCL1 expression increases with RT and is related to better prognosis in rectal cancer patients with RT but not in patients without RT.This result may help us to select the patients best suited for preoperative RT.",0,0,0,0
28623628,"Does Patient Preference Measurement in Decision Aids Improve Decisional Conflict? A Randomized Trial in Men with Prostate Cancer.BACKGROUND: Shared decision making (SDM) has been advocated as an approach to medical decision making that can improve decisional quality.Decision aids are tools that facilitate SDM in the context of limited physician time; however, many decision aids do not incorporate preference measurement.OBJECTIVES: We aim to understand whether adding preference measurement to a standard patient educational intervention improves decisional quality and is feasible in a busy clinical setting.METHODS: Men with incident localized prostate cancer (n = 122) were recruited from the Greater Los Angeles Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center urology clinic, Olive View UCLA Medical Center, and Harbor UCLA Medical Center from January 2011 to May 2015 and randomized to education with a brochure about prostate cancer treatment or software-based preference assessment in addition to the brochure.Men undergoing preference assessment received a report detailing the relative strength of their preferences for treatment outcomes used in review with their doctor.Participants completed instruments measuring decisional conflict, knowledge, SDM, and patient satisfaction with care before and/or after their cancer consultation.RESULTS: Baseline knowledge scores were low (mean 62%).The baseline mean total score on the Decisional Conflict Scale was 2.3 (+/-0.9), signifying moderate decisional conflict.Men undergoing preference assessment had a significantly larger decrease in decisional conflict total score (p = 0.023) and the Perceived Effective Decision Making subscale (p = 0.003) post consult compared with those receiving education only.Improvements in satisfaction with care, SDM, and knowledge were similar between groups.CONCLUSIONS: Individual-level preference assessment is feasible in the clinic setting.Patients with prostate cancer who undergo preference assessment are more certain about their treatment decisions and report decreased levels of decisional conflict when making these decisions.",0,0,0,0
24386491,"Neuromuscular electrical stimulation of the quadriceps in patients with non-small cell lung cancer receiving palliative chemotherapy: a randomized phase II study.BACKGROUND: A reduced exercise capacity is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Therapeutic exercise can be beneficial and neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) of the quadriceps muscles may represent a practical approach.The primary aim of this study was to determine the acceptability of NMES of the quadriceps to patients with NSCLC used alongside palliative chemotherapy.Secondary aims explored aspects of safety and efficacy of NMES in this setting.METHODS: Patients with advanced NSCLC due to receive first-line palliative chemotherapy were randomized to usual care with or without NMES.They were asked to undertake 30 minute sessions of NMES, ideally daily, but as a minimum, three times weekly.For NMES to be considered acceptable, it was predetermined that >/=80% of patients should achieve this minimum level of adherence.Qualitative interviews were held with a subset of patients to explore factors influencing adherence.Safety was assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events.Quadriceps muscle strength, thigh lean mass, and physical activity level were assessed at baseline and after three cycles of chemotherapy.RESULTS: 49 patients (28 male, median (IQR) age 69 (64-75) years) participated.Of 30 randomized to NMES, 18 were eligible for the primary endpoint, of whom 9 (50% [90% CI, 29 to 71]) met the minimum level of adherence.Adherence was enhanced by incorporating sessions into a daily routine and hindered by undesirable effects of chemotherapy.There were no serious adverse events related to NMES, nor significant differences in quadriceps muscle strength, thigh lean mass or physical activity level between groups.CONCLUSIONS: NMES is not acceptable in this setting, nor was there a suggestion of benefit.The need remains to explore NMES in patients with cancer in other settings.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN 42944026 www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN42944026.",0,0,0,0

22605570,"Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of sulindac in individuals at risk for melanoma: evaluation of potential chemopreventive activity.BACKGROUND: Reduced melanoma risk has been reported with regular use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).However, the ability of NSAIDs to reach melanocytes in vivo and modulate key biomarkers in preneoplastic lesions such as atypical nevi has not been evaluated.METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of sulindac was conducted in individuals with atypical nevi (AN) to determine bioavailability of sulindac and metabolites in nevi and effect on apoptosis and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) expression in AN.Fifty subjects with AN >/= 4 mm in size and 1 benign nevus (BN) were randomized to sulindac (150 mg twice a day) or placebo for 8 weeks.Two AN were randomized for baseline excision, and 2 AN and BN were excised after intervention.RESULTS: Postintervention sulindac, sulindac sulfone, and sulindac sulfide concentrations were 0.31 +/- 0.36, 1.56 +/- 1.35, and 2.25 +/- 2.24 mug/mL in plasma, and 0.51 +/- 1.05, 1.38 +/- 2.86, and 0.12 +/- 0.12 mug/g in BN, respectively.Sulindac intervention did not significantly change VEGFA expression but did increase expression of the apoptotic marker cleaved caspase-3 in AN (increase of 3 +/- 33 in sulindac vs decrease of 25 +/- 45 in the placebo arm, P = .0056), although significance was attenuated (P = .1103) after adjusting for baseline expression.CONCLUSIONS: Eight weeks of sulindac intervention resulted in high concentrations of sulindac sulfone, a proapoptotic metabolite, in BN but did not effectively modulate VEGFA and cleaved caspase-3 expression.Study limitations included limited exposure time to sulindac and the need to optimize a panel of biomarkers for NSAID intervention studies.",0,0,0,0
27432930,"Effect of Interval (7 or 11 weeks) Between Neoadjuvant Radiochemotherapy and Surgery on Complete Pathologic Response in Rectal Cancer: A Multicenter, Randomized, Controlled Trial (GRECCAR-6).Purpose A pathologic complete response (pCR; ypT0N0) of a rectal tumor after neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy (RCT) is associated with an excellent prognosis.Several retrospective studies have investigated the effect of increasing the delay after RCT.The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of increasing the interval between the end of RCT and surgery on the pCR rate.Methods GRECCAR6 was a phase III, multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-group controlled trial.Patients with cT3/T4 or Tx N+ tumors of the mid or lower rectum who had received RCT (45 to 50 Gy with fluorouracil or capecitabine) were included.Patients were randomly included in the 7-week or the 11-week (11w) group.Primary end point was the pCR rate defined as a ypT0N0 specimen (NCT01648894).Results A total of 265 patients from 24 centers were enrolled between October 2012 and February 2015.The majority of the tumors were cT3 (82%).After RCT, surgery was not performed in nine patients (3.4%) because of the occurrence of distant metastasis (n = 5) or other reasons.Two patients underwent local resection of the tumor scar.A total of 47 (18.6%) specimens were classified as ypT0 (four had invaded lymph nodes [8.5%]).The primary end point (ypT0N0) was not different (7 weeks: 20 of 133, 15.0% v 11w: 23 of 132, 17.4%; P = .5983).Morbidity was significantly increased in the 11w group (44.5% v 32%; P = .0404) as a result of increased medical complications (32.8% v 19.2%; P = .0137).The 11w group had a worse quality of mesorectal resection (complete mesorectum [I] 78.7% v 90%; P = .0156).Conclusion Waiting 11 weeks after RCT did not increase the rate of pCR after surgical resection.A longer waiting period may be associated with higher morbidity and more difficult surgical resection.",0,0,0,0
28181131,"Randomized trial of aromatherapy versus conventional care for breast cancer patients during perioperative periods.PURPOSE: Several studies focused on the effect of aromatherapy on mood, quality of life (QOL), and physical symptoms in patients with cancer.We compared the effects on QOL, vital signs, and sleep quality between aromatherapy and conventional therapy during perioperative periods of the breast cancer patients in this study.METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive aromatherapy or usual care.The primary endpoint was QOL, which was assessed using the quality of life questionnaire QLQ-C30, Version 3.0 of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Study Group on quality of life.Secondary endpoints included the necessity of hypnotics, vital signs including blood pressure and heart rate and adverse events.In addition, we also summarized the patients' perception of the experience from a free description-type questionnaire.RESULTS: A total of 249 patients had breast cancer surgery and 162 patients gave physician consent and were recruited; 110 were randomly assigned to aromatherapy group (eight patients showed incomplete EORTC QLQ-C30) and 52 to control group (one patient showed incomplete EORTC QLQ-C30).There were no statistically significant differences between the aromatherapy group and control group in the EORTC QLQ-C30 at the surgery day.As for the results of the post-operation day 1, trends for differentiations of physical functioning and role functioning were detected between aromatherapy group and control group, but the differences did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.08 and 0.09).There were no significant differences of systolic and diastolic blood pressures between aromatherapy group and control group (p = 0.82 and 0.68).There was no statistically significant difference in heart rates between aromatherapy group (70.6 +/- 11.0 bpm) and control group (71.2 +/- 9.8 bpm) (p = 0.73).Likewise, the rate of hypnotic use was not statistically significant (p = 0.10).No adverse events were reported after aromatherapy and all impressions from aromatherapy group were positive with descriptors such as relaxed, comfortable, and enjoyable being common.CONCLUSION: The results showed no effects of aromatherapy on QOL, sleep quality, and vital sign.However, there was not any harm or adverse event for using aromatherapy.All impressions from self-reporting were positive such as relaxed, comfortable, and enjoyable by the aromatherapy group.Therefore, we can use aromatherapy during perioperative periods in order to meet the expectations of the patients.",0,0,0,0

26026737,"Physical activity and sedentary behavior in breast cancer survivors: New insight into activity patterns and potential intervention targets.BACKGROUND: Inactivity and sedentary behavior are related to poorer health outcomes in breast cancer survivors.However, few studies examining these behaviors in survivors have used objective measures, considered activities other than moderate-to-vigorous intensity activity (MVPA) and/or sedentary behavior (i.e. low intensity activities) or compared survivors to healthy controls.The purpose of the present study is to compare accelerometer-measured activity of various intensities (total, light, lifestyle, MVPA) and sedentary behavior between breast cancer survivors and non-cancer controls.METHODS: An imputation-based approach of independent sample t-tests adjusting for multiple comparisons was used to compare estimates of participation in each activity and sedentary behavior between survivors [n=398; M(SD)age=56.95 (9.11)] and block-matched non-cancer controls [n=1120; M(SD)age=54.88 (16.11)].Potential moderating effects of body mass index (BMI), age, and education were also examined.RESULTS: Breast cancer survivors registered less daily total (282.8 v. 346.9) light (199.1 v. 259.3) and lifestyle (62.0 v. 71.7) activity minutes and more MVPA (21.6 v. 15.9) and sedentary behavior (555.7 v. 500.6) minutes than controls (p<0.001 for all).These relationships were largely consistent across BMI, age and education.On average, survivors spent an estimated 66.4% of their waking time sedentary and 31.1% in light/lifestyle activity and 2.6% in MVPA.CONCLUSIONS: Breast cancer survivors are more sedentary and participate in less low intensity activity than controls.Although survivors registered more MVPA, these levels were insufficient.Future research should explore these differences and potential benefits of targeting low intensity activities and reducing sedentary time in this population.",0,0,0,0
25891302,"The effect, moderators, and mediators of resistance and aerobic exercise on health-related quality of life in older long-term survivors of prostate cancer.BACKGROUND: The current study examined effects, moderators (for whom), and mediators (working mechanisms) of 12 months of exercise on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in older long-term survivors of prostate cancer.METHODS: In total, 100 men aged 71.7 years (standard deviation, 6.4 years) were randomly assigned to 6 months of supervised aerobic and resistance exercise followed by 6 months of a home-based exercise maintenance program (EX group) or printed education material regarding physical activity for 12 months (PA group).Assessments took place at baseline and after 6 and 12 months.Generalized estimating equations were used to study the effects of EX versus PA on HRQoL at 6 and 12 months, adjusting for baseline HRQoL. The authors examined potential sociodemographic and clinical moderators by adding interaction terms, and potential physical and psychological mediators using the product-of-coefficients test.RESULTS: At 6 months, significant beneficial effects were found for global QoL, physical function, and social function in the EX group compared with the PA group.For physical function, beneficial effects were sustained at 12 months.Moderation analyses demonstrated larger effects of EX versus PA for patients who were married, started exercising sooner after their diagnosis, and previously used bisphosphonates.Changes in lower body functional performance significantly mediated the effect of EX on global QoL, physical function, and social function.No mediating effects on HRQoL were found for aerobic fitness, physical activity, fatigue, distress, or falls self-efficacy.CONCLUSIONS: Aerobic and resistance exercise appears to have beneficial effects on HRQoL among older, long-term survivors of prostate cancer.Effects were moderated by marital status, time since diagnosis, and use of bisphosphonates, and were mediated by lower body functional performance.",0,0,0,0

Prospective study of 10-core and 12-core prostate biopsy.PURPOSE: To evaluate the effectiveness of 2 more core prostate biopsy protocol in detecting the prostate cancer (PCa) by comparing 10-core prostate biopsy with 12-core according to the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level and the prostate volume.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 474 men with elevated serum levels of PSA between 2.5 and 20.0 ng/mL, regardless of abnormal finding on digital rectal examination and transrectal ultrasonography, received transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsies.The patients were prospectively randomized to undergo 10-core (group 1, n = 351) or 12-core (group 2, n = 123) biopsy.The PCa detection rates were assessed and compared according to the serum level of PSA and prostate volume.RESULTS: Of 474 men, 128 (27.0%) were diagnosed with PCa.The PCa detection rates of 10-core and 12-core biopsies were 26.4% and 28.4%, respectively (P = .378).There was no difference in cancer detection rates according to PSA level in both groups.Comparing the cancer detection rates according to the prostate volume (< 40 mL and >/= 40 mL), the patients with prostate volume >/= 40 mL showed higher cancer detection rates in 12-core biopsy group (26.9%) compared with 10-core biopsy group (16.4%) (P < .05).CONCLUSION: The overall cancer detection rates showed no differences in both groups.But the 12-core biopsy was a more efficient method in men with a prostate volume of >/= 40 mL, compared to the 10-core biopsy.",0,0,0,0
26964032,"Long-term impact of preeclampsia on maternal endometrial cancer risk.BACKGROUND: Endometrial cancer is mainly dependent on oestrogen exposure.Preeclampsia has shown to reduce oestrogen levels hence preeclampsia may affect later endometrial cancer risk.METHODS: We conducted a case-control study of 523 Danish women with endometrial cancer and 52 299controls during 1978-2010.The association between preeclampsia and later endometrial cancer was evaluated overall and according to preeclampsia onset and type of endometrial cancer in conditional logistic regression models.RESULTS: We observed no overall association between preeclampsia and endometrial cancer risk (OR=1.11 (95% CI 0.68-1.81)).This was true for all endometrial cancer subtypes.In an analysis of preeclampsia onset, however, we report a markedly increased risk of endometrial cancer following early-onset preeclampsia (OR=2.64 (95% CI 1.29-5.38)).CONCLUSIONS: Although we report no obvious association between preeclampsia and endometrial cancer, studying the subset of early-onset preeclampsia may prove fruitful in further understanding the aetiology of endometrial cancer.",0,0,0,0
26063890,"Effect of Primary Letrozole Treatment on Tumor Expression of mTOR and HIF-1alpha and Relation to Clinical Response.INTRODUCTION: Recently the combination of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor everolimus and the aromatase inhibitor exemestane has been shown to double the progression-free survival rate in advanced breast cancer.However, the effect of the interrelated pathways of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) and mTOR signaling, both of which are associated with a more aggressive breast cancer phenotype and endocrine resistance, on response in the neoadjuvant setting is unknown.We, therefore, have investigated the influence of these pathways with the aim of better defining those patients most likely to benefit from an endocrine-based therapy associated with/without mTOR inhibitors.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 107 women with T2-4 N0-1 and estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer were randomly assigned to 6 months of primary letrozole (2.5 mg/daily) (LET) or LET plus oral ""metronomic"" cyclophosphamide (50mg/daily) (LET-CYC).Phospo-mTOR and HIF-1alpha were evaluated in tumor specimens collected before and after treatment using a tissue microarray format.RESULTS: LET-based therapy induced a downregulation of phospho-mTOR and HIF-1alpha expression (P = .0001 and P < .004, respectively).The reduction of HIF-1alpha expression observed was positively correlated with phospho-mTOR reduction (P < .03); however, no treatment interaction between the two proteins was detected.HIF-1alpha expression was significantly modulated by the treatment (P < .004) with a reduction both in the LET arm (45%, n = 36/80) (P = .05) and LET-CYC arm (55%, n = 44/80) (P = .04).HIF-1alpha reduction showed a relationship with clinical response confined in LET arm only (P < .03).CONCLUSIONS: In this neoadjuvant population, LET was able to modulate the phospho-mTOR and HIF-1alpha pathways and may define a subpopulation of nonresponders who may be most likely to benefit from mTOR inhibitors.",0,0,0,0

26386540,"Safety, efficacy, and immunogenicity of VGX-3100, a therapeutic synthetic DNA vaccine targeting human papillomavirus 16 and 18 E6 and E7 proteins for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2/3: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2b trial.BACKGROUND: Despite preventive vaccines for oncogenic human papillomaviruses (HPVs), cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) is common, and current treatments are ablative and can lead to long-term reproductive morbidity.We assessed whether VGX-3100, synthetic plasmids targeting HPV-16 and HPV-18 E6 and E7 proteins, delivered by electroporation, would cause histopathological regression in women with CIN2/3.METHODS: Efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of VGX-3100 were assessed in CIN2/3 associated with HPV-16 and HPV-18, in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2b study.Patients from 36 academic and private gynaecology practices in seven countries were randomised (3:1) to receive 6 mg VGX-3100 or placebo (1 mL), given intramuscularly at 0, 4, and 12 weeks.Randomisation was stratified by age (<25 vs >/=25 years) and CIN2 versus CIN3 by computer-generated allocation sequence (block size 4).Funder and site personnel, participants, and pathologists were masked to treatment.The primary efficacy endpoint was regression to CIN1 or normal pathology 36 weeks after the first dose.Per-protocol and modified intention-to-treat analyses were based on patients receiving three doses without protocol violations, and on patients receiving at least one dose, respectively.The safety population included all patients who received at least one dose.The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (number NCT01304524) and EudraCT (number 2012-001334-33).FINDINGS: Between Oct 19, 2011, and July 30, 2013, 167 patients received either VGX-3100 (n=125) or placebo (n=42).In the per-protocol analysis 53 (49.5%) of 107 VGX-3100 recipients and 11 (30.6%) of 36 placebo recipients had histopathological regression (percentage point difference 19.0 [95% CI 1.4-36.6]; p=0.034).In the modified intention-to-treat analysis 55 (48.2%) of 114 VGX-3100 recipients and 12 (30.0%) of 40 placebo recipients had histopathological regression (percentage point difference 18.2 [95% CI 1.3-34.4]; p=0.034).Injection-site reactions occurred in most patients, but only erythema was significantly more common in the VGX-3100 group (98/125, 78.4%) than in the placebo group (24/42, 57.1%; percentage point difference 21.3 [95% CI 5.3-37.8]; p=0.007).INTERPRETATION: VGX-3100 is the first therapeutic vaccine to show efficacy against CIN2/3 associated with HPV-16 and HPV-18.VGX-3100 could present a non-surgical therapeutic option for CIN2/3, changing the treatment outlook for this common disease.FUNDING: Inovio Pharmaceuticals.",0,0,0,0
25091846,"Perioperative patient-reported outcomes predict serious postoperative complications: a secondary analysis of the COST trial.BACKGROUND: Decreased survival after colon cancer surgery has been reported in patients with deficient preoperative quality of life.We hypothesized that deficits in preoperative quality of life are associated with postoperative complications.PATIENT AND METHODS: A secondary analysis of the Clinical Outcomes Surgical Therapy trial NCCTG 93-46-53 (INT 0146, Alliance) was performed.Quality of life deficit was defined as overall quality of life score <50 on a 100-point scale and used for univariate and multivariate analysis.RESULTS: Of 431 patients enrolled in the quality of life portion of the trial, 81 patients (19%) experienced complications including two deaths (0.5%).Fifty-five patients (13%) had a preoperative quality of life score <50.Patients with a preoperative deficit were more likely to have a serious early complication (16 vs 6%, p = 0.023).Using stepwise logistic model, the variables significantly associated with having any early complications (yes/no) were age, ASA III and change in ""activity"" from baseline to day 14.Patients with an early complication experienced a 3.5-day longer hospital stay (p = 0.0001).Gender, race, tumor stage, and laparoscopic or open approach were not associated with an increased frequency of complications.After adjusting for demographics, tumor stage, ASA, and operative approach, significant predictors for readmission were preoperative pain (odds ratio (OR) 1.61, confidence interval (CI) 1.11-2.34, p = 0.0125), and changes from baseline to day 2 in fatigue (OR 1.34, CI 1.03-1.74, p = 0.032).CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that quality of life can provide an early indicator for patients at risk of complications.Further studies should evaluate how perioperative quality of life assessment may assist to improve outcomes.",0,0,0,0
24553693,"Dietary total and insoluble fiber intakes are inversely associated with prostate cancer risk.Although experimental data suggest a potentially protective involvement of dietary fiber in prostate carcinogenesis, very few prospective studies have investigated the relation between dietary fiber intake and prostate cancer risk, and those have had inconsistent results.Our objective was to study the association between dietary fiber intake (overall, insoluble, soluble, and from different sources, such as cereals, vegetables, fruits, and legumes) and prostate cancer risk.Stratifications by excess weight status, insulin-like growth factors, and amount of alcohol intake were also considered.This prospective analysis included 3313 men from the Supplementation en Vitamines et Mineraux Antioxydants (SU.VI.MAX) cohort who completed at least 3 24-h dietary records.One hundred thirty-nine incident prostate cancers were diagnosed between 1994 and 2007 (median follow-up of 12.6 y).Associations between quartiles of energy-adjusted dietary fiber intake and prostate cancer risk were characterized by multivariate Cox proportional hazards models.Prostate cancer risk was inversely associated with total dietary fiber intake (HR of quartile 4 vs. quartile 1 = 0.47; 95% CI: 0.27, 0.81; P = 0.001), insoluble (HR = 0.46; 95% CI: 0.27, 0.78; P = 0.001), and legume (HR = 0.55; 95% CI: 0.32, 0.95; P = 0.04) fiber intakes.In contrast, we found no association between prostate cancer risk and soluble (P = 0.1), cereal (P = 0.7), vegetable (P = 0.9), and fruit (P = 0.4) fiber intakes.In conclusion, dietary fiber intake (total, insoluble, and from legumes but not soluble or from cereals, vegetables, and fruits) was inversely associated with prostate cancer risk, consistent with mechanistic data.",0,0,0,0
28274672,"The role of screening expectations in modifying short-term psychological responses to low-dose computed tomography lung cancer screening among high-risk individuals.OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the relationship between pre-screening expectations and psychological responses to low-dose computerised tomography (LDCT) screening among high-risk individuals in the United Kingdom Lung Cancer Screening (UKLS) pilot trial.METHODS: Prior to screening, high-risk individuals randomised into the intervention arm of the UKLS were asked about their expected screening test result.Their actual LDCT scan result was compared with their baseline screening expectation to determine the level of congruence.Levels of concern about and perceived accuracy of the result were assessed in a questionnaire two weeks following receipt of their test result.RESULTS: The sample included 1589 participants.Regardless of their expected results, patients who required follow-up investigations after their initial LDCT scan were the most concerned about their result (p<0.001).Participants who expected to require follow-up, but did not need it, perceived the test to be least accurate (p=0.006).CONCLUSIONS: Lung cancer screening participants who require follow-up or who have unexpected negative results can be identified for supportive interventions.PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: These findings can be used to ensure that any future LDCT lung cancer screening programme is tailored to identify and support those high-risk individuals who may benefit from additional help.",0,0,0,0

24882434,"Olaparib maintenance therapy in patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed serous ovarian cancer: a preplanned retrospective analysis of outcomes by BRCA status in a randomised phase 2 trial.BACKGROUND: Maintenance monotherapy with the PARP inhibitor olaparib significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) versus placebo in patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent serous ovarian cancer.We aimed to explore the hypothesis that olaparib is most likely to benefit patients with a BRCA mutation.METHODS: We present data from the second interim analysis of overall survival and a retrospective, preplanned analysis of data by BRCA mutation status from our randomised, double-blind, phase 2 study that assessed maintenance treatment with olaparib 400 mg twice daily (capsules) versus placebo in patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent serous ovarian cancer who had received two or more platinum-based regimens and who had a partial or complete response to their most recent platinum-based regimen.Randomisation was by an interactive voice response system, stratified by time to progression on penultimate platinum-based regimen, response to the most recent platinum-based regimen before randomisation, and ethnic descent.The primary endpoint was PFS, analysed for the overall population and by BRCA status.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00753545.FINDINGS: Between Aug 28, 2008, and Feb 9, 2010, 136 patients were assigned to olaparib and 129 to placebo.BRCA status was known for 131 (96%) patients in the olaparib group versus 123 (95%) in the placebo group, of whom 74 (56%) versus 62 (50%) had a deleterious or suspected deleterious germline or tumour BRCA mutation.Of patients with a BRCA mutation, median PFS was significantly longer in the olaparib group than in the placebo group (11.2 months [95% CI 8.3-not calculable] vs 4.3 months [3.0-5.4]; HR 0.18 [0.10-0.31]; p<0.0001); similar findings were noted for patients with wild-type BRCA, although the difference between groups was lower (7.4 months [5.5-10.3] vs 5.5 months [3.7-5.6]; HR 0.54 [0.34-0.85]; p=0.0075).At the second interim analysis of overall survival (58% maturity), overall survival did not significantly differ between the groups (HR 0.88 [95% CI 0.64-1.21]; p=0.44); similar findings were noted for patients with mutated BRCA (HR 0.73 [0.45-1.17]; p=0.19) and wild-type BRCA (HR 0.99 [0.63-1.55]; p=0.96).The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events in the olaparib group were fatigue (in ten [7%] patients in the olaparib group vs four [3%] in the placebo group) and anaemia (seven [5%] vs one [<1%]).Serious adverse events were reported in 25 (18%) patients who received olaparib and 11 (9%) who received placebo.Tolerability was similar in patients with mutated BRCA and the overall population.INTERPRETATION: These results support the hypothesis that patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent serous ovarian cancer with a BRCA mutation have the greatest likelihood of benefiting from olaparib treatment.FUNDING: AstraZeneca.",1,1,1,1
22641239,"Responder analysis of the effects of denosumab on bone mineral density in men receiving androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer.BACKGROUND: Denosumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody against RANK ligand, increased bone mineral density (BMD) and reduced fracture risk vs placebo in a phase 3 trial in men with prostate cancer on androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).The present analysis of this study evaluated BMD changes after 36 months in responder subgroups and in individual patients for three key skeletal sites (lumbar spine (LS), femoral neck (FN) and total hip (TH)) and the distal radius.METHODS: Men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer receiving ADT were treated with subcutaneous denosumab 60 mg (n=734) or placebo (n=734) every 6 months for up to 36 months in a phase 3, randomized, double-blind study.Patients were instructed to take supplemental calcium and vitamin D. For this BMD responder analysis, the primary outcome measure was the percentage change in BMD from baseline to month 36 at the LS, FN and TH as measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.BMD at the distal 1/3 radius at 36 months was measured in a substudy of 309 patients.RESULTS: At 36 months, significantly more patients in the denosumab arm had increases of >3% BMD from baseline at each site studied compared with placebo (LS, 78 vs 17%; FN, 48 vs 13%; TH, 48 vs 6%; distal 1/3 radius, 40 vs 7% (P<0.0001 for all)).BMD loss at the LS, FN and TH occurred in 1% of denosumab-treated patients vs 42% of placebo patients, and BMD gain at all three sites occurred in 69% of denosumab patients vs 8% of placebo patients.Lower baseline BMD was associated with higher-magnitude BMD responses to denosumab at the LS, FN and TH.CONCLUSIONS: In men with prostate cancer receiving ADT, significantly higher BMD response rates were observed with denosumab vs placebo.Patients with lower baseline T-scores benefited the most from denosumab treatment.",0,0,0,0
26198205,"Computed tomographic colonography compared with colonoscopy or barium enema for diagnosis of colorectal cancer in older symptomatic patients: two multicentre randomised trials with economic evaluation (the SIGGAR trials).BACKGROUND: Computed tomographic colonography (CTC) is a relatively new diagnostic test that may be superior to existing alternatives to investigate the large bowel.OBJECTIVES: To compare the diagnostic efficacy, acceptability, safety and cost-effectiveness of CTC with barium enema (BE) or colonoscopy.DESIGN: Parallel randomised trials: BE compared with CTC and colonoscopy compared with CTC (randomisation 2 : 1, respectively).SETTING: A total of 21 NHS hospitals.PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged >/= 55 years with symptoms suggestive of colorectal cancer (CRC).INTERVENTIONS: CTC, BE and colonoscopy.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: For the trial of CTC compared with BE, the primary outcome was the detection rate of CRC and large polyps (>/= 10 mm), with the proportion of patients referred for additional colonic investigation as a secondary outcome.For the trial of CTC compared with colonoscopy, the primary outcome was the proportion of patients referred for additional colonic investigation, with the detection rate of CRC and large polyps as a secondary outcome.Secondary outcomes for both trials were miss rates for cancer (via registry data), all-cause mortality, serious adverse events, patient acceptability, extracolonic pathology and cost-effectiveness.RESULTS: A total of 8484 patients were registered and 5384 were randomised and analysed (BE trial: 2527 BE, 1277 CTC; colonoscopy trial: 1047 colonoscopy, 533 CTC).Detection rates in the BE trial were 7.3% (93/1277) for CTC, compared with 5.6% (141/2527) for BE (p = 0.0390).The difference was due to better detection of large polyps by CTC (3.6% vs. 2.2%; p = 0.0098), with no significant difference for cancer (3.7% vs. 3.4%; p = 0.66).Significantly more patients having CTC underwent additional investigation (23.5% vs. 18.3%; p = 0.0003).At the 3-year follow-up, the miss rate for CRC was 6.7% for CTC (three missed cancers) and 14.1% for BE (12 missed cancers).Significantly more patients randomised to CTC than to colonoscopy underwent additional investigation (30% vs. 8.2%; p < 0.0001).There was no significant difference in detection rates for cancer or large polyps (10.7% for CTC vs. 11.4% for colonoscopy; p = 0.69), with no difference when cancers (p = 0.94) and large polyps (p = 0.53) were analysed separately.At the 3-year follow-up, the miss rate for cancer was nil for colonoscopy and 3.4% for CTC (one missed cancer).Adverse events were uncommon for all procedures.In 1042 of 1748 (59.6%) CTC examinations, at least one extracolonic finding was reported, and this proportion increased with age (p < 0.0001).A total of 149 patients (8.5%) were subsequently investigated, and extracolonic neoplasia was diagnosed in 79 patients (4.5%) and malignancy in 29 (1.7%).In the short term, CTC was significantly more acceptable to patients than BE or colonoscopy.Total costs for CTC and colonoscopy were finely balanced, but CTC was associated with higher health-care costs than BE.The cost per large polyp or cancer detected was pound4235 (95% confidence interval pound395 to pound9656).CONCLUSIONS: CTC is superior to BE for detection of cancers and large polyps in symptomatic patients.CTC and colonoscopy detect a similar proportion of large polyps and cancers and their costs are also similar.CTC precipitates significantly more additional investigations than either BE or colonoscopy, and evidence-based referral criteria are needed.Further work is recommended to clarify the extent to which patients initially referred for colonoscopy or BE undergo subsequent abdominopelvic imaging, for example by computed tomography, which will have a significant impact on health economic estimates.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN95152621.",0,0,0,0

25361980,"Translational studies within the TAMRAD randomized GINECO trial: evidence for mTORC1 activation marker as a predictive factor for everolimus efficacy in advanced breast cancer.BACKGROUND: Everolimus is an agent frequently associated with specific toxicities.Predictive markers of efficacy are needed to help define which patients could benefit from it.The goal of this exploratory study was to identify potential predictive biomarkers in the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1) activation pathway using primary tumor samples collected during the phase II tamoxifen plus everolimus (TAMRAD) trial.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Tumor tissues were collected retrospectively from the TAMRAD trial.Immunohistochemistry was carried out using specific antibodies directed toward proteins that result in mTORC1 activation [canonical phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt)/mTOR or alternative pathways].DNA was extracted from the tumor tissue; mutation screening in the PIK3CA gene (exons 9 and 20) and the KRAS gene (exons 2 and 3) was first carried out using Sanger direct sequencing, and then completed by next-generation sequencing for PIK3CA.An exploratory analysis of everolimus efficacy in terms of a time-to-progression (TTP) increase was carried out in each biomarker subgroup (high versus low expression referring to the median percentage of marked cells).RESULTS: A total of 55 primary tumor samples from the TAMRAD trial-25 from the tamoxifen-alone group and 30 from the tamoxifen/everolimus group-were evaluated for biomarkers.The subgroups most likely to have an improvement in TTP with tamoxifen/everolimus therapy, compared with tamoxifen alone, were patients with high p4EBP1, low 4EBP1, low liver kinase B1, low pAkt, and low PI3K.Among the 45 samples screened for mutation status, nine samples (20%; 95% CI 9.6-34.6) had a PIK3CA mutation.KRAS mutation was observed in one patient.CONCLUSIONS: A positive correlation between late effectors of mTORC1 activation, a positive correlation between Akt-independent mTORC1 activation, and an inverse correlation between canonical PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and everolimus efficacy were observed in this exploratory analysis.However, these correlations need to be validated in larger studies before applying the findings to routine clinical practice.",0,0,0,0

28283195,"Effects of Survivorship Care Plans on patient reported outcomes in ovarian cancer during 2-year follow-up - The ROGY care trial.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the long-term impact of an automatically generated Survivorship Care Plan (SCP) on patient reported outcomes in ovarian cancer in routine clinical practice.Outcome measures included satisfaction with information provision and care, illness perceptions and health care utilization.METHODS: In this pragmatic cluster randomized trial, twelve hospitals in the South of the Netherlands were randomized to 'SCP care' or 'usual care'.All newly diagnosed ovarian cancer patients in the 'SCP care' arm received an SCP that was automatically generated by the oncology provider, by clicking a button in the web-based Registrationsystem Oncological GYnecology (ROGY).Ovarian cancer patients (N=174, mean age 63.3, SD=11.4; all stages) completed questionnaires directly after initial treatment and after 6, 12 and 24months.RESULTS: First questionnaires were returned from 61 (67%) ovarian cancer patients in the 'SCP care' arm and 113 (72%) patients in the 'usual care' arm.In the 'SCP care' arm, 66% (N=41) of the patients reported receipt of an SCP.No overall differences were observed between the trial arms on satisfaction with information provision, satisfaction with care or health care utilization.Regarding illness perceptions, patients in the 'SCP care' arm had lower beliefs that the treatment would help to cure their disease (overall, 6.7 vs. 7.5, P<0.01).CONCLUSIONS: SCPs did not increase satisfaction with information provision or care in ovarian cancer patients.Our trial results suggest that ovarian cancer patients may not benefit from an SCP.TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01185626.",0,0,0,0
25596266,"The genotype of MLH1 identifies a subgroup of follicular lymphoma patients who do not benefit from doxorubicin: FIL-FOLL study.Though most follicular lymphoma biomarkers rely on tumor features, the host genetic background may also be relevant for outcome.Here we aimed at verifying the contribution of candidate polymorphisms of FCgamma receptor, DNA repair and detoxification genes to prognostic stratification of follicular lymphoma treated with immunochemotherapy.The study was based on 428 patients enrolled in the FOLL05 prospective trial that compared three standard-of-care regimens (rituximab-cyclophosphamide-vincristine-prednisone versus rituximab-cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-vincristine-prednisone versus rituximab-fludarabine-mitoxantrone) for the first line therapy of advanced follicular lymphoma.Polymorphisms were genotyped on peripheral blood DNA samples.The primary endpoint was time to treatment failure.Polymorphisms of FCGR2A and FCGR3A, which have been suggested to influence the activity of rituximab as a single agent, did not affect time to treatment failure in the pooled analysis of the three FOLL05 treatment arms that combined rituximab with chemotherapy (P=0.742, P=0.252, respectively).These results were consistent even when the analysis was conducted by intention to treat, indicating that different chemotherapy regimens and loads did not interact differentially with the FCGR2A and FCGR3A genotypes.The genotype of MLH1, which regulates the genotoxic effect of doxorubicin, significantly affected time to treatment failure in patients in the rituximab-cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-vincristine-prednisone arm (P=0.001; q<0.1), but not in arms in which patients did not receive doxorubicin (i.e., the rituximab-cyclophosphamide-vincristine-prednisone and rituximab-fludarabine-mitoxantrone arms).The impact of MLH1 on time to treatment failure was independent after adjusting for the Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index and other potential confounding variables by multivariate analysis.These data indicate that MLH1 genotype is a predictor of failure to benefit from rituximab-cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-vincristine-prednisone treatment in advanced follicular lymphoma and confirm that FCGR2A and FCGR3A polymorphisms have no impact when follicular lymphoma is treated with rituximab plus chemotherapy (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT00774826).",0,0,0,0

CONCLUSIONS: In this group of patients with spinal bone metastases we were able to show that guided resistance training of the paravertebral muscles had no essential impact on survival concomitant to RT.Importantly, no local bone progression in group A was detected, nevertheless no prognostic factor for combined treatment could be evaluated.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical trial identifier NCT 01409720 .Registered 8 February 2011.",0,0,0,0
22317882,"Hyoscine N-butylbromide does not improve polyp detection during colonoscopy: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trial.BACKGROUND: Colonoscopy is used for the detection of neoplastic polyps, although a significant miss rate has been reported.Limited data suggest that the administration of the antispasmodic hyoscine N-butylbromide during colonoscopy improves polyp detection.OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the use of 20 mg hyoscine N-butylbromide intravenously during colonoscopy improves polyp detection or removal.DESIGN: A prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, clinical trial.SETTING: Nonacademic teaching hospital.PATIENTS: This study involved 674 patients who were routinely referred and accepted for either diagnostic or screening colonoscopy.INTERVENTION: Intravenous injection of either 1 mL hyoscine N-butylbromide (n = 340) or 0.9% NaCl solution (n = 334) when withdrawal was started.MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Polyp detection rate (PDR), adenoma detection rate (ADR), and the advanced lesion detection rate (ALDR), 5% trimmed mean number of polyps, mean withdrawal time.RESULTS: The cecal intubation rate was 96%.The PDR, ADR, and ALDR were 56% versus 60%, 30% versus 31%, and 14% versus 14% in the hyoscine N-butylbromide and placebo groups, respectively (all P values > .25).The means of the total number of detected, removed, and harvested polyps per patient were 1.13 versus 1.21, 1.03 versus 1.06, and 0.89 versus 0.89 in the hyoscine N-butylbromide and placebo groups, respectively (all P values > .37).Mean withdrawal time was 561 versus 584 seconds in the hyoscine N-butylbromide and placebo groups, respectively (P = .34).Multivariate analysis demonstrated no effect of hyoscine N-butylbromide on the investigated parameters.LIMITATIONS: Only experienced colonoscopists participated in the study.CONCLUSION: We found no evidence to support the use of hyoscine N-butylbromide during withdrawal of the colonoscope to improve polyp detection or removal.( CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN25405865.).",0,0,0,0
24129868,"Effect of a web-based curriculum on primary care practice: basic skin cancer triage trial.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Primary care physicians (PCPs) are uniquely positioned to detect melanoma.Effective educational interventions targeted at PCPs may improve early melanoma detection.A previous in-person Basic Skin Cancer Triage (BSCT) 2-hour course demonstrated significant short-term improvement in provider practices, attitudes, ability, confidence, and knowledge.We conducted a randomized trial to test the efficacy of the BSCT course implemented as a web-based learning program, compared to a similar (control) web-based course on weight assessment.METHODS: We recruited a sample of 57 PCPs and 3,341 of their patients from four geographically diverse centers.Skin cancer control activities by PCPs were assessed by physician survey and by chart review and patient telephone interview about their recent visit to their PCP at baseline and at 1--2 months and 12 months after course completion.RESULTS: Some effect of intervention on skin cancer parameters was self-reported by physicians; this was not confirmed by patient survey or chart-extracted data.Rates of skin cancer control practices by PCPs were low across both groups before and after intervention.The positive changes in physician-reported behaviors (total body skin examination [TBSE]), intentions (discuss skin cancer detection), confidence (performing TBSE), office practices, and knowledge (58% skin versus 49% control) were neither matched by differences in practice reported by their patients, nor persisted in a longer term follow-up, hence may be attributable to physician recall bias due to the experience of the course or desire to please study investigators and were less dramatic as compared to our previously reported in-person BSCT intervention.Thus this approach by itself appears unlikely to result in improved PCP handling of skin cancer issues.CONCLUSIONS: Given previous success with our in-person course, the features required to make WBL a more effective tool for medical education must be further explored.",0,0,0,0

28352657,"Randomized, placebo-controlled window trial of EGFR, Src, or combined blockade in head and neck cancer.BACKGROUND.EGFR and Src family kinases are upregulated in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).EGFR interacts with Src to activate STAT3 signaling, and dual EGFR-Src targeting is synergistic in HNSCC preclinical models.pSrc overexpression predicted resistance to the EGFR inhibitor, erlotinib, in a prior window trial.We conducted a 4-arm window trial to identify biomarkers associated with response to EGFR and/or Src inhibition.METHODS.Patients with operable stage II-IVa HNSCC were randomized to 7-21 days of neoadjuvant erlotinib, the Src inhibitor dasatinib, the combination of both, or placebo.Paired tumor specimens were collected before and after treatment.Pharmacodynamic expression of EGFR and Src pathway components was evaluated by IHC of tissue microarrays and reverse-phase protein array of tissue lysates.Candidate biomarkers were assessed for correlation with change in tumor size.RESULTS.From April 2009 to December 2012, 58 patients were randomized and 55 were treated.There was a significant decrease in tumor size in both erlotinib arms (P = 0.0014); however, no effect was seen with dasatinib alone (P = 0.24).High baseline pMAPK expression was associated with response to erlotinib (P = 0.03).High baseline pSTAT3 was associated with resistance to dasatinib (P = 0.099).CONCLUSIONS.Brief exposure to erlotinib significantly decreased tumor size in operable HNSCC, with no additive effect from dasatinib.Baseline pMAPK expression warrants further study as a response biomarker for anti-EGFR therapy.Basal expression of pSTAT3 may be independent of Src, explain therapeutic resistance, and preclude development of dasatinib in biomarker-unselected cohorts.TRIAL REGISTRATION.NCT00779389.FUNDING.National Cancer Institute, American Cancer Society, Pennsylvania Department of Health, V Foundation for Cancer Research, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Astellas Pharma.",1,1,1,1

22826983,"[Evaluation of the efficacy and toxicity of protocol cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin compared to protocol fluorouracil, doxorubicin and mitomycin C in locally advanced and metastatic gastric cancer].INTRODUCTION: Still there is no consensus on the choice of the most efficient and the least toxic chemotherapy regimen in the treatment of advanced gastric cancer.Nowadays few therapy protocols are available for treating this disease.OBJECTIVE: Study was conducted to compare the efficacy and toxicity of FAM (flurouracil, doxorubicin, mitomycin C) with CDDP and FU/FA (cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin) protocols in patients with locally advanced and metastatic gastric cancer.METHODS: This randomized study involved a group of 50 patients with locally advanced or metastatic gastric cancer, who had not previously undergone chemotherapy treatment.Progression free survival, overall survival and drug toxicity were evaluated.For statistical analysis chi-squaretest, Kaplan-Meier curve and the log rank test were used.RESULTS: The overall response rate was 20% in the group treated with FAM and 24% in the group treated with CDDP, FU/FA (4% of patients from each group had complete response), but without significant statistical difference.Median survival was 10.9 months in the FAM group and 11.8 months in CDDP, FU/FA group, with no statistically significant difference.Non-haematological and haematological toxicities of CDDP, FU/FA were considerably less frequent than of FAM, and there was no treatment related deaths in any of the groups.CONCLUSION: Both investigated regimens demonstrated moderate efficacy.The study shows in favour of justified application of both protocols, while in regard to toxicity CDDP and FU/FA can be recommended as preferable treatment for locally advanced and metastatic gastric cancer.New strategies should be considered for better efficacy in the treatment of advanced gastric cancer.New strategies are necessary with the goal to achieve a better therapeutic effect.",0,0,0,0
27640367,"Word catheter and marsupialisation in women with a cyst or abscess of the Bartholin gland (WoMan-trial): a randomised clinical trial.OBJECTIVE: To compare recurrence of a cyst or abscess of the Bartholin gland after surgical treatment using a Word catheter or marsupialisation.DESIGN: Multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial.SETTING: Eighteen hospitals in the Netherlands and one hospital in England.POPULATION: Women with a symptomatic cyst or abscess of the Bartholin gland.METHODS: Women were randomised to treatment with Word catheter or marsupialisation.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was recurrence of the cyst or abscess within 1 year of treatment.The secondary outcomes included pain during and after treatment (measured on a 10-point scale), use of analgesics, and time from diagnosis to treatment.Analysis was by intention-to-treat.To assess whether marsupialisation would reduce the recurrence rate by 5% (from 20 to 15%) we needed to include 160 women (alpha error 0.05, beta error 0.2).RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-one women were randomly allocated to treatment by Word catheter (n = 82) or marsupialisation (n = 79) between August 2010 and May 2014.Baseline characteristics were comparable.Recurrence occurred in 10 women (12%) allocated to Word catheter versus eight women (10%) allocated to marsupialisation: relative risk (RR) 1.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64-1.91; P = 0.70.Pain scores after treatment were also comparable.In the first 24 hours after treatment, 33% used analgesics in the Word catheter group versus 74% in the marsupialisation group (P < 0.001).Time from diagnosis to treatment was 1 hour for placement of Word catheter versus 4 hours for marsupialisation (P = 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: In women with an abscess or cyst of the Bartholin gland, treatment with Word catheter and marsupialisation results in comparable recurrence rates.TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: Comparable recurrence rates for treatment of Bartholinic abscess/cyst with Word catheter and marsupialisation.",0,0,0,0
23732774,"Equal efficacy of endoscopic and surgical cystogastrostomy for pancreatic pseudocyst drainage in a randomized trial.BACKGROUND & AIMS: Although surgery is the standard technique for drainage of pancreatic pseudocysts, use of endoscopic methods is increasing.We performed a single-center, open-label, randomized trial to compare endoscopic and surgical cystogastrostomy for pancreatic pseudocyst drainage.METHODS: Patients with pancreatic pseudocysts underwent endoscopic (n = 20) or surgical cystogastrostomy (n = 20).The primary end point was pseudocyst recurrence after a 24-month follow-up period.Secondary end points were treatment success or failure, complications, re-interventions, length of hospital stay, physical and mental health scores, and total costs.RESULTS: At the end of the follow-up period, none of the patients who received endoscopic therapy had a pseudocyst recurrence, compared with 1 patient treated surgically.There were no differences in treatment successes, complications, or re-interventions between the groups.However, the length of hospital stay was shorter for patients who underwent endoscopic cystogastrostomy (median, 2 days, vs 6 days in the surgery group; P < .001).Although there were no differences in physical component scores and mental health component scores (MCS) between groups at baseline on the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form General Survey questionnaire, longitudinal analysis showed significantly better physical component scores (P = .019) and mental health component scores (P = .025) for the endoscopy treatment group.The total mean cost was lower for patients managed by endoscopy than surgery ($7011 vs $15,052; P = .003).CONCLUSIONS: In a randomized trial comparing endoscopic and surgical cystogastrostomy for pancreatic pseudocyst drainage, none of the patients in the endoscopy group had pseudocyst recurrence during the follow-up period, therefore there is no evidence that surgical cystogastrostomy is superior.However, endoscopic treatment was associated with shorter hospital stays, better physical and mental health of patients, and lower cost.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00826501.",0,0,0,0
26585118,"Aspirin Reduces Plasma Concentrations of the Oncometabolite 2-Hydroxyglutarate: Results of a Randomized, Double-Blind, Crossover Trial.BACKGROUND: Aspirin use is an effective strategy for the chemoprevention of colorectal cancer, even at low doses.However, in order to implement aspirin interventions, risk-benefit balances and biologic mechanisms need to be better defined; to further this aim, we used a metabolomics approach.METHODS: We metabolically profiled 40 healthy, nonsmoking men and women ages 20 to 45 years enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, crossover trial of 325 mg aspirin/day over a period of 60 days.Gas and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry were used to comprehensively profile participants' plasma samples after aspirin and placebo interventions.RESULTS: A total of 363 metabolites, covering most human biochemical pathways, were measured.Compared with placebo-treated participants, plasma concentrations of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (R+S) decreased after aspirin treatment in both men and women (P = 0.005).This signal proved robust during 20-fold random splitting of the data using 80% of the samples in each split.We subsequently performed functional follow-up studies using targeted, enantiospecific detection in human colorectal cancer cell lines and observed an aspirin-induced reduction of (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate.We further showed that salicylate, the primary aspirin metabolite, inhibits the hydroxyacid-oxoacid transhydrogenase mediated production of (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate, thereby providing mechanistic evidence for the clinically observed effects of aspirin on total-2-hydroxyglutarate.CONCLUSIONS: Using a metabolomics approach with functional follow-up, we propose that a decrease in the oncometabolite (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate may identify an additional mechanism for aspirin or its metabolites in cancer prevention.IMPACT: Reduction of the oncometabolite (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate identifies a novel, non-COX-inhibition-mediated mechanism of aspirin.",0,0,0,0

Relevant endpoints included change from baseline QoL and improvement in hospice knowledge.RESULTS: From November 13, 2008, through July 28, 2009, 26 patients were accrued at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida.The study closed early due to published data demonstrating the benefits of early palliative care interventions in the management of metastatic cancer patients.Statistically significant improvements from baseline were noted in emotional and mental QoL assessments in the intervention group that were not seen in the control group.Patients found it useful to have the living will and Five Wishes documents offered as part of the ARNP intervention.CONCLUSIONS: An ARNP-directed intervention that explains the benefits of hospice and addresses advanced directives early in the course of metastatic cancer patients' treatment, is well received by the patients and their relatives and leads to measurable improvement in the patient's emotional and mental QoL.",1,1,0,0
25284802,"Multicenter randomized controlled trial of percutaneous cryoablation versus radiofrequency ablation in hepatocellular carcinoma.UNLABELLED: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is considered a curative treatment option for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Growing data have demonstrated that cryoablation represents a safe and effective alternative therapy for HCC, but no randomized controlled trial (RCT) has been reported to compare cryoablation with RFA in HCC treatment.The present study was a multicenter RCT aimed to compare the outcomes of percutaneous cryoablation with RFA for the treatment of HCC.In all, 360 patients with Child-Pugh class A or B cirrhosis and one or two HCC lesions </= 4 cm, treatment-naive, without metastasis were randomly assigned to cryoablation (n = 180) or RFA (n = 180).The primary endpoints were local tumor progression at 3 years after treatment and safety.Local tumor progression rates at 1, 2, and 3 years were 3%, 7%, and 7% for cryoablation and 9%, 11%, and 11% for RFA, respectively (P = 0.043).For lesions >3 cm in diameter, the local tumor progression rate was significantly lower in the cryoablation group versus the RFA group (7.7% versus 18.2%, P = 0.041).The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates were 97%, 67%, and 40% for cryoablation and 97%, 66%, and 38% for RFA, respectively (P = 0.747).The 1-, 3-, and 5-year tumor-free survival rates were 89%, 54%, and 35% in the cryoablation group and 84%, 50%, and 34% in the RFA group, respectively (P = 0.628).Multivariate analyses demonstrated that Child-Pugh class B and distant intrahepatic recurrence were significant negative predictors for overall survival.Major complications occurred in seven patients (3.9%) following cryoablation and in six patients (3.3%) following RFA (P = 0.776).CONCLUSION: Cryoablation resulted in a significantly lower local tumor progression than RFA, although both cryoablation and RFA were equally safe and effective, with similar 5-year survival rates.",1,1,1,0

Chemoprevention or ""chemopromotion""?BACKGROUND: Antioxidants effectiveness in prostate cancer (PCa) chemoprevention has been severely questioned, especially after the recent results of the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial.We present the results of a double-blind randomized controlled trial (dbRCT) on the pharmacokinetic, clinical, and molecular activity of dietary supplements containing lycopene, selenium, and green tea catechins (GTCs) in men with multifocal high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (mHGPIN) and/or atypical small acinar proliferation (ASAP).METHODS: From 2009 to 2014, we conducted a dbRCT including 60 patients with primary mHGPIN and/or ASAP receiving daily lycopene 35 mg, selenium 55 microg, and GTCs 600 mg, or placebo for 6 months.Pharmacokinetic analysis were performed with UV-Visible spectrophotometric assay under standard (SC) and accelerated (AC) conditions.Upon plasma lycopene concentrations falling within the expected range (1.2-90 mcg/l) and no side-effects of grade >1, study proceeded to phase II (n = 50).After unblinding of results, eight men (4 per arm, 2 without and 2 with PCa, respectively) were randomly selected and totRNA extracted from ""non-pathological"" tissues.MicroRNA profiling was performed with the Agilent platform.Raw data processing used R-statistical language and linear models for microarray analysis.RESULTS: Samples were stable except for lycopene, showing significant degradation (SC = 56%, AC = 59%) and consequently stabilized under vacuum in a dark packaging.Mean plasmatic lycopene concentration was 1,45 +/- 0,4 muM. At 6 months, 53 men underwent re-biopsy and 13 (24.5%) were diagnosed with PCa (supplementation n = 10, placebo n = 3 [P = 0.053]).At a mean 37 months follow-up, 3 additional PCa were found in the placebo group.No significant variations in PSA, IPSS, and PR25 questionnaires were observed.Stronger modulation of miRNAs was present on re-biopsy in the supplementation group compared to the placebo, including: (i) overexpression of miRNAs present in PCa versus non-cancer tissue; (ii) underexpression of miRNAs suppressing PCa proliferation; (iii) detection of 35 miRNAs in PCa patients versus disease-free men, including androgen-regulated miR-125b-5p and PTEN-targeting miR-92a-3p (both upregulated).CONCLUSION: Administration of high doses of lycopene, GTCs, and selenium in men harboring HGPIN and/or ASAP was associated with a higher incidence of PCa at re-biopsy and expression of microRNAs implicated in PCa progression at molecular analysis.The use of these supplements should be avoided.",0,0,0,0

26897518,"TOPical Imiquimod treatment of high-grade Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (TOPIC trial): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) is the premalignant condition of cervical cancer.Whereas not all high grade CIN lesions progress to cervical cancer, the natural history and risk of progression of individual lesions remain unpredictable.Therefore, high-grade CIN is currently treated by surgical excision: large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ).This procedure has potential complications, such as acute haemorrhage, prolonged bleeding, infection and preterm birth in subsequent pregnancies.These complications could be prevented by development of a non-invasive treatment modality, such as topical imiquimod treatment.The primary study objective is to investigate the efficacy of topical imiquimod 5% cream for the treatment of high-grade CIN and to develop a biomarker profile to predict clinical response to imiquimod treatment.Secondary study objectives are to assess treatment side-effects, disease recurrence and quality of life during and after different treatment modalities.METHODS/DESIGN: The study design is a randomized controlled trial.One hundred forty women with a histological diagnosis of high-grade CIN (CIN 2-3) will be randomized into two arms: imiquimod treatment during 16 weeks (experimental arm) or immediate LLETZ (standard care arm).Treatment efficacy will be evaluated by colposcopy with diagnostic biopsies at 20 weeks for the experimental arm.Successful imiquimod treatment is defined as regression to CIN 1 or less, successful LLETZ treatment is defined as PAP 1 after 6 months.Disease recurrence will be evaluated by cytology at 6, 12 and 24 months after treatment.Side-effects will be evaluated using a standardized report form.Quality of life will be evaluated using validated questionnaires at baseline, 20 weeks and 1 year after treatment.Biomarkers, reflecting both host and viral factors in the pathophysiology of CIN, will be tested at baseline with the aim of developing a predictive biomarker profile for the clinical response to imiquimod treatment.DISCUSSION: Treatment of high-grade CIN lesions with imiquimod in a selected patient population may diminish complications as a result of surgical intervention.More knowledge on treatment efficacy, side effects and long-term recurrence rates after treatment is necessary.TRIAL REGISTRATION: EU Clinical Trials Register EU-CTR2013-001260-34 .Registered 18 March 2013.Medical Ethical Committee approval number: NL44336.068.13 (Medical Ethical Committee Maastricht University Hospital, University of Maastricht).Affiliation: Maastricht University Hospital.Registration number ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02329171.",1,1,1,0
26531235,"Randomized prospective comparison of midline and off-midline closure techniques in pilonidal sinus surgery.BACKGROUND: Pilonidal sinus is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the intergluteal sulcus.The disorder often negatively affects patients' quality of life, and there are numerous possible methods of operative treatment for pilonidal sinus.The aim of our study was to compare the results of 3 different operative procedures (tension-free primary closure, Limberg flap, and Karydakis technique) used in the treatment of pilonidal disease.METHODS: The study was conducted via a prospective randomized design.The patients were randomized into 3 groups via a closed envelope method.Patients were included in the study after admission to our clinic with pilonidal sinus disease and operative treatment already were planned.The 2 main outcomes of the study were early complications from the methods used and later recurrences of the disease.RESULTS: A total of 150 patients were included in the study, and the groups were similar in terms of age, sex, and American Society of Anesthesiologists scores.The median follow-up time of the study was 24.2 months (range, 18.5-34.27) postsurgery.The recurrence rates were 6% for both the Limberg and Karydakis groups and 4% for the tension-free primary closure group.Therefore, there was no substantial difference in the recurrence rates.CONCLUSION: The search for an ideal treatment modality for pilonidal sinus disease is still ongoing.The main conclusion of our study is that a tension-free healing side is much more important than a midline suture line.Also, tension-free primary closure is as effective as a flap procedure, and it is also easier to perform.",0,0,0,0
27325147,"Adrenal vein sampling versus CT scan to determine treatment in primary aldosteronism: an outcome-based randomised diagnostic trial.BACKGROUND: The distinction between unilateral aldosterone-producing adenoma or bilateral adrenal hyperplasia as causes of primary aldosteronism is usually made by adrenal CT or by adrenal vein sampling (AVS).Whether CT or AVS represents the best test for diagnosis remains unknown.We aimed to compare the outcome of CT-based management with AVS-based management for patients with primary aldosteronism.METHODS: In a randomised controlled trial, we randomly assigned patients with aldosteronism to undergo either adrenal CT or AVS to determine the presence of aldosterone-producing adenoma (with subsequent treatment consisting of adrenalectomy) or bilateral adrenal hyperplasia (subsequent treatment with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists).The primary endpoint was the intensity of drug treatment for obtaining target blood pressure after 1 year of follow-up, in the intention-to-diagnose population.Intensity of drug treatment was expressed as daily defined doses.Key secondary endpoints included biochemical outcome in patients who received adrenalectomy, health-related quality of life, cost-effectiveness, and adverse events.This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01096654.FINDINGS: We recruited 200 patients between July 6, 2010, and May 30, 2013.Of the 184 patients that completed follow-up, 92 received CT-based treatment (46 adrenalectomy and 46 mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist) and 92 received AVS-based treatment (46 adrenalectomy and 46 mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist).We found no differences in the intensity of antihypertensive medication required to control blood pressure between patients with CT-based treatment and those with AVS-based treatment (median daily defined doses 3.0 [IQR 1.0-5.0] vs 3.0 [1.1-5.9], p=0.52; median number of drugs 2 [IQR 1-3] vs 2 [1-3], p=0.87).Target blood pressure was reached in 39 (42%) patients and 41 (45%) patients, respectively (p=0.82).On secondary endpoints we found no differences in health-related quality of life (median RAND-36 physical scores 52.7 [IQR 43.9-56.8] vs 53.2 [44.0-56.8], p=0.83; RAND-36 mental scores 49.8 [43.1-54.6] vs 52.7 [44.9-55.5], p=0.17) for CT-based and AVS-based treatment.Biochemically, 37 (80%) of patients with CT-based adrenalectomy and 41 (89%) of those with AVS-based adrenalectomy had resolved hyperaldosteronism (p=0.25).A non-significant mean difference of 0.05 (95% CI -0.04 to 0.13) in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) was found to the advantage of the AVS group, associated with a significant increase in mean health-care costs of euro2285 per patient (95% CI 1323-3248).At a willingness-to-pay value of euro30 000 per QALY, the probability that AVS compared with CT constitutes an efficient use of health-care resources in the diagnostic work-up of patients with primary aldosteronism is less than 0.2.There was no difference in adverse events between groups (159 events of which nine were serious vs 187 events of which 12 were serious) for CT-based and AVS-based treatment.INTERPRETATION: Treatment of primary aldosteronism based on CT or AVS did not show significant differences in intensity of antihypertensive medication or clinical benefits for patients after 1 year of follow-up.This finding challenges the current recommendation to perform AVS in all patients with primary aldosteronism.FUNDING: Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development-Medical Sciences, Institute of Cardiology, Warsaw.",0,0,0,0

22399076,"The effects of psychotherapy on psychological well-being and diurnal cortisol patterns in breast cancer survivors.BACKGROUND: Neuroendocrine dysregulation influenced by psychosocial stress is related to breast cancer recurrence.Very few studies examine the impacts of psychotherapy on diurnal cortisol patterns among breast cancer survivors.METHODS: Forty-eight breast cancer patients who completed active cancer treatment were randomly assigned to receive either 8 weekly body-mind-spirit (BMS) group therapy sessions or 1 educational (EDU) session.Self-report measures included the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), and the Meaning in Life questionnaire (MLQ) including two subscales: MLQ-Presence and MLQ-Search.Salivary cortisol levels were collected by the subjects in their homes at the time of awakening, 30 and 45 min after awakening, and at 12.00, 17.00, and 21.00 h. Measurement time points include baseline, the 2nd month (completion of BMS therapy), the 5th month, and the 8th month.RESULTS: There were no significant differences in BDI-II scores (p>0.05) and MLQ-Presence scores (p >0.05) between BMS and EDU groups at baseline or across the three follow-ups.Nevertheless, greater MLQ-Search scores were found in the BMS group compared to the EDU group during the 5th month of follow-up (p <0.01).The higher level of cortisol at 21.00 h (p < 0.01) and a flatter diurnal cortisol pattern were more likely to occur in EDU than in BMS participants (p < 0.05) at the 8th month of follow-up.CONCLUSION: BMS group therapy likely contributed to enhancing an active search for meaning in life toward more opportunities for personal growth and to maintaining stable cortisol responses to everyday life stress for breast cancer survivors.",0,0,0,0
27596353,"Health-related quality of life in the randomised KEYNOTE-002 study of pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy in patients with ipilimumab-refractory melanoma.BACKGROUND: In KEYNOTE-002, pembrolizumab significantly prolonged progression-free survival and was associated with a better safety profile compared with chemotherapy in patients with advanced melanoma that progressed after ipilimumab.We present health-related quality of life (HRQoL) outcomes from KEYNOTE-002.METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to pembrolizumab 2 or 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks (Q3W) or investigator-choice chemotherapy.HRQoL was assessed using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire-Core 30 instrument.A constrained longitudinal data analysis model was implemented to assess between-arm differences in HRQoL scores.The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01704287.RESULTS: Of the 540 patients enrolled, 520 were included in the HRQoL analysis.Baseline global health status (GHS) was similar across treatment arms.Compliance rates at week 12 were 76.6% (n = 108), 82.3% (n = 121), and 86.4% (n = 133) for the control, pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg Q3W, and pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg Q3W arms, respectively.From baseline to week 12, GHS/HRQoL scores were maintained to a higher degree in the pembrolizumab arms compared with the chemotherapy arm (decrease of -2.6 for each pembrolizumab arm versus -9.1 for chemotherapy; P = 0.01 for each pembrolizumab arm versus chemotherapy).Fewer patients treated with pembrolizumab experienced deterioration in GHS at week 12 (31.8% for pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg, 26.6% for 10 mg/kg, and 38.3% for chemotherapy), with similar trends observed for the individual functioning and symptoms scales.CONCLUSIONS: HRQoL was better maintained with pembrolizumab than with chemotherapy in KEYNOTE-002, supporting the use of pembrolizumab in patients with ipilimumab-refractory melanoma.",0,0,0,0
25361981,"Molecular subtype and tumor characteristics of breast cancer metastases as assessed by gene expression significantly influence patient post-relapse survival.BACKGROUND: We and others have recently shown that tumor characteristics are altered throughout tumor progression.These findings emphasize the need for re-examination of tumor characteristics at relapse and have led to recommendations from ESMO and the Swedish Breast Cancer group.Here, we aim to determine whether tumor characteristics and molecular subtypes in breast cancer metastases confer clinically relevant prognostic information for patients.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The translational aspect of the Swedish multicenter randomized trial called TEX included 111 patients with at least one biopsy from a morphologically confirmed locoregional or distant breast cancer metastasis diagnosed from December 2002 until June 2007.All patients had detailed clinical information, complete follow-up, and metastasis gene expression information (Affymetrix array GPL10379).We assessed the previously published gene expression modules describing biological processes [proliferation, apoptosis, human epidermal receptor 2 (HER2) and estrogen (ER) signaling, tumor invasion, immune response, and angiogenesis] and pathways (Ras, MAPK, PTEN, AKT-MTOR, PI3KCA, IGF1, Src, Myc, E2F3, and beta-catenin) and the intrinsic subtypes (PAM50).Furthermore, by contrasting genes expressed in the metastases in relation to survival, we derived a poor metastasis survival signature.RESULTS: A significant reduction in post-relapse breast cancer-specific survival was associated with low-ER receptor signaling and apoptosis gene module scores, and high AKT-MTOR, Ras, and beta-catenin module scores.Similarly, intrinsic subtyping of the metastases provided statistically significant post-relapse survival information with the worst survival outcome in the basal-like [hazard ratio (HR) 3.7; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3-10.9] and HER2-enriched (HR 4.4; 95% CI 1.5-12.8) subtypes compared with the luminal A subtype.Overall, 25% of the metastases were basal-like, 32% HER2-enriched, 10% luminal A, 28% luminal B, and 5% normal-like.CONCLUSIONS: We show that tumor characteristics and molecular subtypes of breast cancer metastases significantly influence post-relapse patient survival, emphasizing that molecular investigations at relapse provide prognostic and clinically relevant information.CLINICALTRIALS.GOV: This is the translational part of the Swedish multicenter and randomized trial TEX, clinicaltrials.gov identifier nct01433614 (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct01433614).",0,0,0,0
24231627,"Docetaxel or pemetrexed with or without cetuximab in recurrent or progressive non-small-cell lung cancer after platinum-based therapy: a phase 3, open-label, randomised trial.BACKGROUND: Available preclinical and phase 2 clinical data suggest that the addition of cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody directed against the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), to chemotherapy might improve outcome in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).We aimed to assess whether the addition of cetuximab to chemotherapy improved progression-free survival in patients with recurrent or progressive NSCLC after platinum-based therapy.METHODS: In this unmasked, open-label randomised phase 3 trial we enrolled patients with metastatic, unresectable, or locally advanced NSCLC from 121 sites in Canada and the USA.Eligible patients were those aged 18 years or older who had experienced progressive disease during or after one previous platinum-based regimen.Initially, patients were randomly assigned to receive either pemetrexed (500 mg/m(2)) or docetaxel (75 mg/m(2)) and then randomly assigned within each group to receive their chemotherapy with or without cetuximab (400 mg/m(2) at first dose and 250 mg/m(2) weekly thereafter) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.However, after a change in the standard of care, investigators chose whether to treat with pemetrexed or docetaxel on a patient-by-patient basis.The primary analysis was changed to compare progression-free survival with cetuximab plus pemetrexed versus pemetrexed, on an intention-to-treat basis.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00095199.FINDINGS: Between Jan 10, 2005, and Feb 10, 2010, we enrolled 939 patients; data for one patient was accidentally discarded.Of the remaining 938 patients, 605 received pemetrexed (301 patients with cetuximab and 304 alone) and 333 received docetaxel (167 in combination with cetuximab and 166 alone).Median progression-free survival with cetuximab plus pemetrexed was 2.9 months (95% CI 2.7-3.2) versus 2.8 months (2.5-3.3) with pemetrexed (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.87-1.21; p=0.76).The most common grade 3-4 adverse events with cetuximab plus pemetrexed were fatigue (33 [11%] of 292 patients), acneiform rash (31 [11%]), dyspnoea (29 [10%]), and decreased neutrophil count (28 [10%]), and with pemetrexed alone were dyspnoea (35 [12%] of 289 patients), decreased neutrophil count (26 [9%]), and fatigue (23 [8%]).A significantly higher proportion of patients in the cetuximab plus pemetrexed group (119 [41%] of 292 patients) experienced at least one serious adverse event than those patients in the pemetrexed group (85 [29%] of 289 patients; p=0.0054).Nine (3%) of 292 treated patients in the cetuximab and pemetrexed group died of adverse events compared with five (2%) of 289 treated patients in the pemetrexed alone group.INTERPRETATION: The use of cetuximab is not recommended in combination with chemotherapy in patients previously treated with platinum-based therapy.FUNDING: Eli Lilly and Company and ImClone Systems LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Eli Lilly and Company.",0,0,0,0
27823821,"Prostate high dose-rate brachytherapy as monotherapy for low and intermediate risk prostate cancer: Early toxicity and quality-of life results from a randomized phase II clinical trial of one fraction of 19Gy or two fractions of 13.5Gy.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Multi-fraction high dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy as monotherapy is safe and effective for low and intermediate risk prostate cancer.Two or single fraction regimens have some radiobiological rationale.The purpose is to determine toxicity and effect on health related quality of life (HRQOL) of single fraction 19Gy or 13.5Gyx2.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eligible patients had low or intermediate risk prostate cancer, prostate volume <60cc, and no androgen deprivation use.170 patients were randomized to receive either a single 19Gy or two fractions of 13.5Gy 1week apart.HRQOL was measured using the Expanded Prostate Index Composite (EPIC), toxicity with Common Terminology for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0 and urinary symptoms with the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS).RESULTS: Median follow-up is 20months.Grade 2 urinary toxicity occurred in 51% within the first 3months and in 31% thereafter with no significant difference between treatment arms.Ten patients (6%) developed urinary retention in the acute phase, although only 4 (2.4%) required a catheter for more than 48h.One Grade 3 acute (3months) and late (>3months) urinary toxicity occurred.No more than 1% had any Grade 2 GI toxicity.The 2-fraction arm had a higher occurrence of grade 2 erectile dysfunction (29% vs. 11.5%, p=0.0249) and higher IPSS scores for the first year.Mean EPIC urinary scores at 12months decreased by 4.0 and 4.6, and sexual scores decreased by 8 and 15.9 (p=0.035) in the single and 2-fraction arms, respectively.No change occurred in the bowel or hormonal domains.CONCLUSIONS: Single 19Gy and 13.5Gyx2 are both well tolerated.During the first 12months, urinary symptoms and erectile dysfunction are more common in the 2-fraction arm.",0,0,0,0
26526085,"Effect of Dynamic Position Changes on Adenoma Detection During Colonoscope Withdrawal: A Randomized Controlled Multicenter Trial.OBJECTIVES: Adequate luminal distension is essential for improving adenoma detection during colonoscope withdrawal.A few crossover studies have reported that dynamic position changes maximize luminal distension and increase adenoma detection rates (ADR).We designed a multicenter, randomized, parallel-group trial to verify the effect of dynamic position changes on colonic adenoma detection.METHODS: This study was conducted at the six hospitals of the Catholic University of Korea.Patients aged 45-80 years who underwent a colonoscopy for the first time were included.In the position change group, the position changes during colonoscope withdrawal were as follows: cecum, ascending colon, and hepatic flexure: left lateral position; transverse colon: supine position; splenic flexure, descending colon, sigmoid colon, and rectum: right lateral position.In the control group, the examinations were performed entirely in the left lateral position during colonoscope withdrawal.The primary outcome measure was the ADR, which was defined as the proportion of patients with >/=1 adenoma.RESULTS: A total of 1,072 patients were randomized into the position change group (536 patients) or the control group (536 patients).The ADR was higher in the position change group than in the control group (42.4 vs. 33.0%, P=0.002).More adenomas were detected per subject in the position change group (0.90 vs. 0.67, P=0.01).Increases in the number of adenomas were observed in examinations of the transverse colon (0.22 vs. 0.13, P=0.016) and the left colon (0.37 vs. 0.27, P=0.045).A significant increase in the ADR was observed for endoscopists with a relatively low detection rate.For endoscopists with a high detection rate, non-significant changes in the ADR were observed.CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic position changes during colonoscope withdrawal increased the ADR.",0,0,0,0
