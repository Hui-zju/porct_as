22498022,"A community-based randomized trial of a faith-placed intervention to reduce cervical cancer burden in Appalachia.OBJECTIVE: Faith Moves Mountains assessed the effectiveness of a faith-placed lay health advisor (LHA) intervention to increase Papanicolaou (Pap) test use among middle-aged and older women in a region disproportionately affected by cervical cancer and low screening rates (regionally, only 68% screened in prior 3 years).METHOD: This community-based RCT was conducted in four Appalachian Kentucky counties (December 2005-June 2008).Women aged 40-64 and overdue for screening were recruited from churches and individually randomized to treatment (n=176) or wait-list control (n=169).The intervention provided LHA home visits and newsletters addressing barriers to screening.Self-reported Pap test receipt was the primary outcome.RESULTS: Intention-to-treat analyses revealed that treatment group participants (17.6% screened) had over twice the odds of wait-list controls (11.2% screened) of reporting Pap test receipt post-intervention, OR=2.56, 95% CI: 1.03-6.38, p=0.04.Independent of group, recently screened participants (last Pap >1 but <5 years ago) had significantly higher odds of obtaining screening during the study than rarely or never screened participants (last Pap >/=5 years ago), OR=2.50, 95% CI: 1.48-4.25, p=0.001.CONCLUSIONS: The intervention was associated with increased cervical cancer screening.The faith-placed LHA addressing barriers comprises a novel approach to reducing cervical cancer disparities among Appalachian women.",0,0,0,0
22402288,"Central adiposity and Prostate Cancer in a Black Population.BACKGROUND: The relationship between central adiposity and prostate cancer remains unclear.METHODS: This report includes 963 newly diagnosed cases of histologically confirmed prostate cancer and 941 randomly selected age-matched controls ascertained from the population-based Prostate Cancer in a Black Population study conducted between July 2002 and January 2011 in Barbados, West Indies.Trained nurse interviewers obtained data on height, weight, waist and hip circumferences, family and medical history, and lifestyle factors.ORs and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to assess associations between anthropometric measures and prostate cancer.RESULTS: A two-fold increased risk of prostate cancer was found among men in the highest quartile of waist-hip ratio compared with those in the lowest quartile (OR = 2.11, 95% CI, 1.54-2.88).Similarly, men with the largest waist circumferences had an OR of 1.84 (95% CI, 1.19-2.85) compared with those with the smallest waist sizes.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that measures of central rather than global adiposity may be more predictive of prostate cancer, especially in westernized African populations, where patterns of visceral fat distribution are different than other groups.IMPACT: The findings highlight the need to further elucidate the mechanisms underlying the relationship between central adiposity and prostate cancer in populations of predominantly African descent.",0,0,0,0
22377820,"Early enteral nutrition reduces the rate of life-threatening complications after thoracic esophagectomy in patients with esophageal cancer.BACKGROUND: Early postoperative enteral nutrition has been suggested to improve the nutritional status of patients after esophageal surgery.However, whether enteral nutrition decreases rates of surgical complications and increases the completion rate of the clinical management pathway is unclear.METHODS: We analyzed 154 patients who were randomly assigned to either an enteral or parenteral nutrition group after undergoing esophagectomy, compared the incidence of surgical complications, and evaluated the completion rate of the clinical pathway.In these 2 patient groups, perioperative management was performed through identical clinical pathways, except for nutrition.RESULTS: The overall rate of surgical complications of any type did not differ between patients who received early enteral nutrition and those who did not (p = 0.50); however, the rate of life-threatening surgical complications was significantly lower in patients who received early enteral nutrition (p = 0.02).The rate of non-life-threatening surgical complications did not differ between the groups (p = 0.98).In patients who received enteral nutrition, the completion rate of the clinical pathway was higher (p = 0.03), and the postoperative hospital stay was shorter (p = 0.04).CONCLUSIONS: Early enteral nutrition reduces the incidence of life-threatening surgical complications and improves the completion rate of the clinical pathway for thoracic esophagectomy.",0,0,0,0
23129742,"Randomized phase III trial of induction chemotherapy with docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil followed by surgery versus up-front surgery in locally advanced resectable oral squamous cell carcinoma.PURPOSE: To evaluate induction chemotherapy with docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil (TPF) followed by surgery and postoperative radiotherapy versus up-front surgery and postoperative radiotherapy in patients with locally advanced resectable oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective open-label phase III trial was conducted.Eligibility criteria included untreated stage III or IVA locally advanced resectable OSCC.Patients received two cycles of TPF induction chemotherapy (docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) on day 1, cisplatin 75 mg/m(2) on day 1, and fluorouracil 750 mg/m(2) on days 1 to 5) followed by radical surgery and postoperative radiotherapy (54 to 66 Gy) versus up-front radical surgery and postoperative radiotherapy.The primary end point was overall survival (OS).Secondary end points included local control and safety.RESULTS: Of the 256 patients enrolled onto this trial, 222 completed the full treatment protocol.There were no unexpected toxicities, and induction chemotherapy did not increase perioperative morbidity.The clinical response rate to induction chemotherapy was 80.6%.After a median follow-up of 30 months, there was no significant difference in OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.977; 95% CI, 0.634 to 1.507; P = .918) or disease-free survival (HR, 0.974; 95% CI, 0.654 to 1.45; P = .897) between patients treated with and without TPF induction.Patients in the induction chemotherapy arm with a clinical response or favorable pathologic response (</= 10% viable tumor cells) had superior OS and locoregional and distant control.CONCLUSION: Our study failed to demonstrate that TPF induction chemotherapy improves survival compared with up-front surgery in patients with resectable stage III or IVA OSCC.",0,0,0,0
22357257,"A randomised trial of primary tamoxifen versus mastectomy plus adjuvant tamoxifen in fit elderly women with invasive breast carcinoma of high oestrogen receptor content: long-term results at 20 years of follow-up.BACKGROUND: Long-term analysis of a randomised trial in Nottingham comparing tamoxifen versus surgery as initial treatment demonstrated that in oestrogen receptor (ER)-unselected cases, surgery achieved better local control, with no difference in overall survival.It was suggested that for patients with ER-rich tumours, local control and survival may be comparable.We now present long-term follow-up of a randomised trial designed to address this clinical scenario.PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and fifty three fit elderly (>/=70 years) women with clinically node-negative primary invasive breast carcinoma <5 cm of high ER content [histochemical (H) score >/=100] were randomised 2:1 to primary tamoxifen (Tam) (N = 100) or mastectomy with adjuvant tamoxifen (Mx + Tam) (N = 53).RESULTS: With median follow-up of 78 months, there was no statistically significant difference in 10-year rates of regional recurrence (9.0% versus 7.5%), metastasis (8.0% versus 13.2%), breast cancer-specific survival (89.0% versus 86.8%) or overall survival (64.0% versus 66.0%) between Tam and Mx + Tam; however, local control was inferior with Tam (local failure rates 43.0% versus 1.9%; P < 0.001).CONCLUSION: Irrespective of the degree of ER positivity, surgery achieved better local control.However, there was excellent and similar survival in both groups.Tam could be considered in those who are 'frail', refuse or prefer not to initially undergo surgery.",1,1,1,1
22075171,"Overall efficacy of HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine against grade 3 or greater cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: 4-year end-of-study analysis of the randomised, double-blind PATRICIA trial.BACKGROUND: Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or greater (CIN2+) is the surrogate endpoint used in licensure trials of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines.Vaccine efficacy against CIN3+, the immediate precursor to invasive cervical cancer, is more difficult to measure because of its lower incidence, but provides the most stringent evidence of potential cancer prevention.We report vaccine efficacy against CIN3+ and adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) in the end-of-study analysis of PATRICIA (PApilloma TRIal against Cancer In young Adults).METHODS: Healthy women aged 15-25 years with no more than six lifetime sexual partners were included in PATRICIA, irrespective of their baseline HPV DNA status, HPV-16 or HPV-18 serostatus, or cytology.Women were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive an HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine or a control hepatitis A vaccine via an internet-based central randomisation system using a minimisation algorithm to account for age ranges and study sites.The patients and study investigators were masked to allocated vaccine.The primary endpoint of PATRICIA has been reported previously.In the present end-of-study analysis, we focus on CIN3+ and AIS in the populations of most clinical interest, the total vaccinated cohort (TVC) and the TVC-naive.The TVC comprised all women who received at least one vaccine dose, approximating catch-up populations and including sexually active women (vaccine n=9319; control=9325).The TVC-naive comprised women with no evidence of oncogenic HPV infection at baseline, approximating early adolescent HPV exposure (vaccine n=5824; control=5820).This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00122681.FINDINGS: Vaccine efficacy against CIN3+ associated with HPV-16/18 was 100% (95% CI 85.5-100) in the TVC-naive and 45.7% (22.9-62.2) in the TVC.Vaccine efficacy against all CIN3+ (irrespective of HPV type in the lesion and including lesions with no HPV DNA detected) was 93.2% (78.9-98.7) in the TVC-naive and 45.6% (28.8-58.7) in the TVC.In the TVC-naive, vaccine efficacy against all CIN3+ was higher than 90% in all age groups.In the TVC, vaccine efficacy against all CIN3+ and CIN3+ associated with HPV-16/18 was highest in the 15-17 year age group and progressively decreased in the 18-20 year and 21-25 year age groups.Vaccine efficacy against all AIS was 100% (31.0-100) and 76.9% (16.0-95.8) in the TVC-naive and TVC, respectively.Serious adverse events occurred in 835 (9.0%) and 829 (8.9%) women in the vaccine and control groups, respectively; only ten events (0.1%) and five events (0.1%), respectively, were considered to be related to vaccination.INTERPRETATION: PATRICIA end-of-study results show excellent vaccine efficacy against CIN3+ and AIS irrespective of HPV DNA in the lesion.Population-based vaccination that incorporates the HPV-16/18 vaccine and high coverage of early adolescents might have the potential to substantially reduce the incidence of cervical cancer.FUNDING: GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals.",0,0,0,0
22947544,"Effect of exercise on bone structural traits, physical performance and body composition in breast cancer patients--a 12-month RCT.In this 12-month RCT, we examined whether aerobic impact exercise training (3x/week) could facilitate breast cancer survivors' recovery by enhancing their bone structural strength, physical performance and body composition.After the adjuvant chemo- and/ or radiotherapy, 86 patients were randomly assigned into the training or control group.Structural bone traits were assessed with pQCT at the tibia and with DXA at the femoral neck.Agility (figure-8 running), jump force and power (force platform), grip strength and cardiovascular fitness (2-km walk test) were also assessed.Training effects on outcome variables were estimated by two-way factorial ANCOVA using the study group and menopausal status as fixed factors.Bone structural strength was better maintained among the trainees.At the femoral neck, there was a small but significant 2% training effect in the bone mass distribution (p=0.05).At the tibial diaphysis, slight 1% to 2% training effects (p=0.03) in total cross-sectional area and bone structural strength were observed (p=0.03) among the postmenopausal trainees.Also, 3% to 4% training effects were observed in the figure-8 running time (p=0.03) and grip strength (p=0.01).In conclusion, vigorous aerobic impact exercise training has potential to maintain bone structural strength and improve physical performance among breast cancer survivors.",0,0,0,0
22493375,"Intra-arterial infusion of irinotecan-loaded drug-eluting beads (DEBIRI) versus intravenous therapy (FOLFIRI) for hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer: final results of a phase III study.BACKGROUND: Metastases to the liver receive most of their blood supply from the arterial route, therefore for patients with hepatic metastases from large bowel cancer, hepatic arterial infusion adopting drug-eluting beads preloaded with irinotecan (DEBIRI) may offer a chance of cure.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a multi-institutional study, 74 patients were randomly assigned to receive DEBIRI (36) versus systemic irinotecan, fluorouracil and leucovorin (FOLFIRI, 38).The primary end-point was survival; secondary end points were response, recurrence, toxicity, quality of life, cost and influence of molecular markers.RESULTS: At 50 months, overall survival was significantly longer for patients treated with DEBIRI than for those treated with FOLFIRI (p=0.031, log-rank).Median survival was 22 (95% Confidence Interval CI=21-23) months, for DEBIRI and 15 (95% CI=12-18) months for FOLFIRI.Progression-free survival was 7 (95% CI=3-11) months in the DEBIRI group compared to 4 (95% CI=3-5) months in the FOLFIRI group and the difference between groups was statistically significant (p=0.006, log-rank).Extrahepatic progression had occurred in all patients by the end of the study, at a median time of 13 (95% CI=10-16) months in the DEBIRI group compared to 9 (95% CI 5-13) months in the FOLFIRI group.A statistically significant difference between groups was not observed (p=0.064, log-rank).The median time for duration of improvement to quality of life was 8 (95% CI=3-13) months in the DEBIRI group and 3 (95% CI=2-4) months in the FOLFIRI group.The difference in duration of improvement was statistically significant (p=0.00002, log-rank).CONCLUSION: This study showed a statistically significant difference between DEBIRI and FOLFIRI for overall survival (7 months), progression-free survival (3 months) and quality of life (5 months).In addition, a clinically significant improvement in time to extrahepatic progression (4 months) was observed for DEBIRI, a reversal of the expectation for a regional treatment.This suggests a benefit of DEBIRI treatment over standard chemotherapy and serves to establish the expected difference between these two treatment options for planning future large randomized studies.",1,1,1,1
21931376,"Frequency of elevated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) biomarkers in patients with advanced hepatitis C.OBJECTIVES: Prospective studies of serum hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) biomarkers in patients with advanced hepatitis C are lacking.The aim of this study was to determine the frequencies and performance of elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), AFP-L3, and des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin (DCP) levels as HCC biomarkers in advanced hepatitis C. METHODS: Patients in the HALT-C Trial were tested every 3 months for 42 months.Screening ultrasound was performed every 12 months.Levels of biomarkers were compared in patients in whom HCC did or did not develop.RESULTS: In all, 855 patients were evaluated; HCC developed in 46.Among patients without HCC, 73.2% had AFP consistently <20, 24.5% had at least one AFP between 20 and 199, and 2.3% had at least one AFP value >/=200 ng/ml; 73.7% had DCP consistently <90, 11.6% had at least one DCP between 90 and 149, and 14.7% had at least one DCP value >/=150 mAU/ml.AFP-L3 >/=10% was present at least once in 9.0% and in 17.1% of those with AFP >/=20 ng/ml.Among all patients with elevated biomarkers, a diagnosis of HCC was made in 0-31.6% (depending on the biomarker and cutoff) during the subsequent 24 months.AFP >/=200 ng/ml had the highest specificity (99%), but sensitivity was </=20%.DCP >/=40mAU/ml had the highest sensitivity (76%), but specificity was </=58%.Independent predictors of elevated AFP were gender (female), race (Black), more advanced disease, and HCC.Elevated DCP was associated with more advanced disease and HCC.CONCLUSIONS: Mild-moderate elevations in total AFP and DCP but not in AFP-L3 occur frequently in patients with chronic hepatitis C and advanced fibrosis, are related to factors other than HCC, and are poor predictors of HCC.",0,0,0,0
22641239,"Responder analysis of the effects of denosumab on bone mineral density in men receiving androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer.BACKGROUND: Denosumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody against RANK ligand, increased bone mineral density (BMD) and reduced fracture risk vs placebo in a phase 3 trial in men with prostate cancer on androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).The present analysis of this study evaluated BMD changes after 36 months in responder subgroups and in individual patients for three key skeletal sites (lumbar spine (LS), femoral neck (FN) and total hip (TH)) and the distal radius.METHODS: Men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer receiving ADT were treated with subcutaneous denosumab 60 mg (n=734) or placebo (n=734) every 6 months for up to 36 months in a phase 3, randomized, double-blind study.Patients were instructed to take supplemental calcium and vitamin D. For this BMD responder analysis, the primary outcome measure was the percentage change in BMD from baseline to month 36 at the LS, FN and TH as measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.BMD at the distal 1/3 radius at 36 months was measured in a substudy of 309 patients.RESULTS: At 36 months, significantly more patients in the denosumab arm had increases of >3% BMD from baseline at each site studied compared with placebo (LS, 78 vs 17%; FN, 48 vs 13%; TH, 48 vs 6%; distal 1/3 radius, 40 vs 7% (P<0.0001 for all)).BMD loss at the LS, FN and TH occurred in 1% of denosumab-treated patients vs 42% of placebo patients, and BMD gain at all three sites occurred in 69% of denosumab patients vs 8% of placebo patients.Lower baseline BMD was associated with higher-magnitude BMD responses to denosumab at the LS, FN and TH.CONCLUSIONS: In men with prostate cancer receiving ADT, significantly higher BMD response rates were observed with denosumab vs placebo.Patients with lower baseline T-scores benefited the most from denosumab treatment.",0,0,0,0

When Gleason score >7 was excluded, 177 men were left for case matching.At Massachusetts General Hospital, 203 similar patients were treated by a single brachytherapist from 1997 to 2002.Minimum follow-up was 3 years.Case matching, based on T stage, Gleason score, prostate-specific antigen, and age resulted in 141 matches (282 patients).Median follow-up was 8.6 and 7.4 years for EBRT and brachytherapy, respectively.The primary endpoint was biochemical failure (BF).RESULTS: Using the Phoenix definition, the 8-year BF rates were 7.7% and 16.1% for EBRT and brachytherapy, respectively (p = 0.42).A stratified analysis was performed by risk group.In the EBRT group, 113 and 28 patients were low and intermediate risk, respectively.In the brachytherapy group, 118 and 23 were.When stratified by risk group, the BF rates were similar by either technique.CONCLUSIONS: High-dose EBRT and brachytherapy result in similar BF rates for men with localized prostate cancer.Comparative quality-of-life and cost-effectiveness studies are warranted.",0,0,0,0
22758921,"The effect of a translating research into practice (TRIP)--cancer intervention on cancer pain management in older adults in hospice.BACKGROUND: Pain is a major concern for individuals with cancer, particularly older adults who make up the largest segment of individuals with cancer and who have some of the most unique pain challenges.One of the priorities of hospice is to provide a pain-free death, and while outcomes are better in hospice, patients still die with poorly controlled pain.OBJECTIVE: This article reports on the results of a Translating Research into Practice intervention designed to promote the adoption of evidence-based pain practices for older adults with cancer in community-based hospices.SETTING: This Institutional Human Subjects Review Board-approved study was a cluster randomized controlled trial implemented in 16 Midwestern hospices.METHODS: Retrospective medical records from newly admitted patients were used to determine the intervention effect.Additionally, survey and focus group data gathered from hospice staff at the completion of the intervention phase were analyzed.RESULTS: Improvement on the Cancer Pain Practice Index, an overall composite outcome measure of evidence-based practices for the experimental sites, was not significantly greater than control sites.Decrease in patient pain severity from baseline to post-intervention in the experimental group was greater; however, the result was not statistically significant (P = 0.1032).CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate a number of factors that may impact implementation of multicomponent interventions, including unique characteristics and culture of the setting, the level of involvement with the change processes, competing priorities and confounding factors, and complexity of the innovation (practice change).Our results suggest that future study is needed on specific factors to target when implementing a community-based hospice intervention, including determining and measuring intervention fidelity prospectively.",0,0,0,0
22453059,"Effects of vitamin D on cardiovascular disease risk factors in polycystic ovary syndrome women with vitamin D deficiency.BACKGROUND: Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent among women, including patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).Some studies have suggested that vitamin D may have a role in cardiovascular disease (CVD).There is very limited data on the vitamin D effect on CVD risk factors in women with PCOS and vitamin D deficiency.AIM: To investigate the effect of cholecalciferol on CVD risk factors in PCOS women with vitamin D deficiency.METHODS: The study was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double blinded trial.Fifty PCOS women with vitamin D deficiency (vitamin D, no. = 24; placebo, no. = 26) aged 20-40 yr, were randomly assigned to receive 3 oral capsules of 50,000 IU vitamin D3 or a placebo (one capsule every 20 days) for two months.Serum vitamin D, PTH, lipid profile, apolipoprotein AI (APO-AI), and high sensitive C- reactive protein (hs-CRP) were measured at baseline and after treatment.RESULTS: Vitamin D3 therapy in PCOS patients, increased serum vitamin D (7.00 +/- 2.80 to 22.9 +/- 6.14 ng/ml), decreased serum total cholesterol (196.6 +/- 32.8 to 179.1 +/- 34.1 mg/dl), triglyceride (156.8 +/- 73.0 to 130.5 +/- 56.5 mg/dl), and VLDL (31.4 +/- 14.6 to 26.1 +/- 11.3 mg/dl) levels significantly (p < 0.05), but it did not affect serum HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, APO-AI, and hs-CRP concentrations.There was no change in variables in the placebo group.CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that vitamin D3 therapy had beneficial effects on some CVD risk factors in PCOS patients with vitamin D deficiency.The trial was registered at IRCT.ir (IRCT138904113140N2).",1,0,0,0

22552048,"Efficacy of docetaxel-based chemotherapy following ketoconazole in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: implications for prior therapy in clinical trials.OBJECTIVES: Abiraterone acetate (AA) is a CYP17 inhibitor of androgen synthesis approved for use following docetaxel for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC); evaluation in the pre-docetaxel setting is ongoing.Given that the reported efficacy of AA is lower following docetaxel vs. pre-docetaxel, the potential exists for cross resistance given docetaxel's partly androgen receptor targeting activity.The efficacy of docetaxel following ketoconazole (KC), a weaker and nonspecific inhibitor of CYP17, may provide some insights into this potential interaction.We retrospectively evaluated the efficacy of every 3-week docetaxel with prednisone (DP) in mCRPC previously exposed to KC compared to KC-naive patients.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A randomized phase II trial of men with mCRPC treated with DP + AT-101 (bcl-2 inhibitor) vs. DP plus placebo was analyzed.Both arms were combined for analysis as no significant differences were seen.Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective response (ORR), pain, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rates were estimated with and without prior KC.Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate the effect of covariates on OS.RESULTS: Of 220 evaluable men, 40 (18.2%) received prior KC.The median OS with DP-based therapy of KC-naive patients (18.3 months, 95% CI: 15.0, 24.5) and post-KC patients (17.0 months, 95% CI: 9.9, 20.4) was not statistically different (P = 0.20).After controlling for prognostic classifications, analyses demonstrated consistent trends for worsening of OS after KC, with (hazard ratios (HRs) 1.33-1.46.Similar unfavorable trends were observed for ORR, PSA declines, and PFS.CONCLUSIONS: In this hypothesis-generating analysis, patients treated with docetaxel-based chemotherapy following prior KC had numerically and consistently worse outcomes than patients not exposed to prior KC.Although the estimated differences did not attain statistical significance, evaluation of outcomes with docetaxel in particular, and all classes of novel and emerging agents following AA, is of clinical importance, given its more potent androgen synthesis inhibition compared with KC.Drug development should take into account the potential impact of previous therapy.",0,0,0,0
22918392,"Face-to-face vs telephone pre-colonoscopy consultation in colorectal cancer screening; a randomised trial.BACKGROUND: A pre-colonoscopy consultation in colorectal cancer (CRC) screening is necessary to assess a screenee's general health status and to explain benefits and risks of screening.The first option allows for personal attention, whereas a telephone consultation does not require travelling.We hypothesised that a telephone consultation would lead to higher response and participation in CRC screening compared with a face-to-face consultation.METHODS: A total of 6600 persons (50-75 years) were 1:1 randomised for primary colonoscopy screening with a pre-colonoscopy consultation either face-to-face or by telephone.In both arms, we counted the number of invitees who attended a pre-colonoscopy consultation (response) and the number of those who subsequently attended colonoscopy (participation), relative to the number invited for screening.A questionnaire regarding satisfaction with the consultation and expected burden of the colonoscopy (scored on five-point rating scales) was sent to invitees.Besides, a questionnaire to assess the perceived burden of colonoscopy was sent to participants, 14 days after the procedure.RESULTS: In all, 3302 invitees were allocated to the telephone group and 3298 to the face-to-face group, of which 794 (24%) attended a telephone consultation and 822 (25%) a face-to-face consultation (P=0.41).Subsequently, 674 (20%) participants in the telephone group and 752 (23%) in the face-to-face group attended colonoscopy (P=0.018).Invitees and responders in the telephone group expected the bowel preparation to be more painful than those in the face-to-face group while perceived burden scores for the full screening procedure were comparable.More subjects in the face-to-face group than in the telephone group were satisfied by the consultation in general: (99.8% vs 98.5%, P=0.014).CONCLUSION: Using a telephone rather than a face-to-face consultation in a population-based CRC colonoscopy screening programme leads to similar response rates but significantly lower colonoscopy participation.",0,0,0,0

22494567,"Efficacy and safety of maintenance erlotinib in Asian patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer: a subanalysis of the phase III, randomized SATURN study.Maintenance therapy, commenced immediately after the completion of first-line chemotherapy, is a promising strategy for improving treatment outcomes in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).The global phase III SequentiAl Tarceva in UnResectable NSCLC (SATURN) study evaluated the efficacy and safety of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine-kinase inhibitor erlotinib as maintenance treatment in NSCLC patients without progression after first-line chemotherapy.We report a retrospective subanalysis of Asian patients enrolled in SATURN.Patients with advanced NSCLC with no evidence of progression after four cycles of chemotherapy were randomized to receive erlotinib 150 mg/day or placebo, until progressive disease or limiting toxicity.The co-primary endpoints of SATURN were progression-free survival (PFS) in all patients and in those with positive EGFR immunohistochemistry (IHC) status.Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), disease control rate, safety, quality of life (QoL) and biomarker analyses.In total, 126 patients from East and South-East Asian centers were randomized (14% of the intent-to-treat population): 88 from Korea, 28 from China and 10 from Malaysia; one patient was excluded from this analysis due to Indian ethnicity.PFS was significantly prolonged in the erlotinib treatment arm, both overall (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.57; p=0.0067) and in patients with EGFR IHC-positive disease (HR=0.50; p=0.0057).There was a trend towards an increase in OS, which reached statistical significance in the EGFR IHC-positive subgroup (p=0.0233).The overall response rate was significantly higher with erlotinib compared with placebo (24% versus 5%; p=0.0025).Erlotinib was generally well tolerated and had no negative impact on QoL in this subpopulation.The most common treatment-related adverse events were rash, diarrhea and pruritus.Erlotinib was effective and well tolerated in Asian patients, producing benefits consistent with those observed in the overall SATURN population.Maintenance treatment with erlotinib appears to be a useful option for the management of Asian patients with advanced NSCLC without progression after first-line chemotherapy.",1,1,1,1
22237467,"Randomized clinical trial of omega-3 fatty acid-supplemented enteral nutrition versus standard enteral nutrition in patients undergoing oesophagogastric cancer surgery.BACKGROUND: Oesophagogastric cancer surgery is immunosuppressive.This may be modulated by omega-3 fatty acids (O-3FAs).The aim of this study was to assess the effect of perioperative O-3FAs on clinical outcome and immune function after oesophagogastric cancer surgery.METHODS: Patients undergoing subtotal oesophagectomy and total gastrectomy were recruited and allocated randomly to an O-3FA enteral immunoenhancing diet (IED) or standard enteral nutrition (SEN) for 7 days before and after surgery, or to postoperative supplementation alone (control group).Clinical outcome, fatty acid concentrations, and HLA-DR expression on monocytes and activated T lymphocytes were determined before and after operation.RESULTS: Of 221 patients recruited, 26 were excluded.Groups (IED, 66; SEN, 63; control, 66) were matched for age, malnutrition and co-morbidity.There were no differences in morbidity (P = 0.646), mortality (P = 1.000) or hospital stay (P = 0.701) between the groups.O-3FA concentrations were higher in the IED group after supplementation (P < 0.001).The ratio of omega-6 fatty acid to O-3FA was 1.9:1, 4.1:1 and 4.8:1 on the day before surgery in the IED, SEN and control groups (P < 0.001).There were no differences between the groups in HLA-DR expression in either monocytes (P = 0.538) or activated T lymphocytes (P = 0.204).CONCLUSION: Despite a significant increase in plasma concentrations of O-3FA, immunonutrition with O-3FA did not affect overall HLA-DR expression on leucocytes or clinical outcome following oesophagogastric cancer surgery.REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN43730758 (http://www.controlled-trials.com).",1,1,0,0
22726970,The efficacy of apparent diffusion coefficient value calculation in differentiation between malignant and benign thyroid nodules.PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) calculation in differentiation between malignant and benign thyroid nodules.METHODS AND MATERIALS: A prospective study was conducted in 52 patients.Diffusion-weighted echoplanar imaging was performed and b factors were taken as 0 and 400 s/mm(2).RESULTS: The mean ADC value for malignant thyroid nodules was 0.829+/-0.179x10(-3) mm(2)/s and that for benign thyroid nodules was 1.984+/-0.482x10(-3) mm(2)/s.The mean ADC value for malignant nodules was significantly lower than that for benign nodules (P=.0001).CONCLUSION: ADC value calculation is an effective method in differentiation of malignant thyroid nodules from benign ones.,0,0,0,0
23018640,"Sequence analysis of beta-subunit genes of the 20S proteasome in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma treated with bortezomib or dexamethasone.Variations within proteasome beta (PSMB) genes, which encode the beta subunits of the 20S proteasome, may affect proteasome function, assembly, and/or binding of proteasome inhibitors.To investigate the potential association between PSMB gene variants and treatment-emergent resistance to bortezomib and/or long-term outcomes, in the present study, PSMB gene sequence variation was characterized in tumor DNA samples from patients who participated in the phase 3 Assessment of Proteasome Inhibition for Extending Remissions (APEX) study of bortezomib versus high-dose dexamethasone for treatment of relapsed multiple myeloma.Twelve new PSMB variants were identified.No associations were found between PSMB single nucleotide polymorphism genotype frequency and clinical response to bortezomib or dexamethasone treatment or between PSMB single nucleotide polymorphism allelic frequency and pooled overall survival or time to progression.Although specific PSMB5 variants have been identified previously in preclinical models of bortezomib resistance, these variants were not detected in patient tumor samples collected after clinical relapse from bortezomib, which suggests that alternative mechanisms underlie bortezomib insensitivity.",0,0,0,0
22890582,"Oral supplementation of branched-chain amino acids reduces early recurrence after hepatic resection in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma: a prospective study.PURPOSES: The long-term outcomes of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) administration after hepatic resection in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unclear.This study assessed the effect of oral supplementation with BCAA on the development of liver tumorigenesis after hepatic resection in HCC patients.METHODS: Fifty-six patients were randomly assigned to receive either BCAA supplementation (Livact group, n = 26) or a conventional diet (Control group, n = 30).Twenty-six patients in the BCAA group were treated orally for 2 weeks before and 6 months after hepatic resection.Postoperative tumor recurrence was continuously evaluated in all patients by measuring various clinical parameters.RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the overall survival rate between the two patient groups; however, the recurrence rate at 30 months after surgery was significantly better in the Livact group in comparison to the Control group.Interestingly, the tumor markers, such as AFP and PIVKA-II, significantly decreased at 36 months after liver resection in the Livact group in comparison to the Control group.CONCLUSIONS: Oral supplementation of BCAA reduces early recurrence after hepatic resection in patients with HCC.This treatment regimen offers potential benefits for clinical use in such patients, even in cases with a well-preserved preoperative liver function.",1,1,1,1
22153087,"Preventing seroma formation after axillary dissection for breast cancer: a randomized clinical trial.BACKGROUND: Seroma formation after axillary dissection remains the most common early sequel to breast cancer surgery.Different surgical approaches have been performed to reduce seroma collection.Therefore, we aimed to assess the outcome of patients operated on using an ultrasound scalpel according to a standardized operative technique before accepting it as a routine procedure.METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was designed to compare the outcome of patients undergoing breast surgery and axillary dissection using either standard scalpel blades, scissors, ligations, and electrocautery or the ultrasound scalpel only.Each arm of the trial consisted of 30 patients.RESULTS: A statistically significant benefit in terms of axillary and chest wall drainage volume, the number of axilla seromas, intraoperative bleeding, and hospitalization stay was recorded in the harmonic scalpel group.No significant differences were found between the 2 groups in terms of operative time.Finally, no postoperative hematoma, wound infections, and chest wall seroma were observed.CONCLUSIONS: The use of the harmonic scalpel was shown to reduce the magnitude of seromas in axilla and hospitalization stay.The harmonic scalpel can be used alone in axillary dissection with a safe and effective hemostasis.Our results must be confirmed by larger series.",0,0,0,0
22335737,"Semuloparin for thromboprophylaxis in patients receiving chemotherapy for cancer.BACKGROUND: Patients receiving chemotherapy for cancer are at increased risk for venous thromboembolism.Limited data support the clinical benefit of antithrombotic prophylaxis.METHODS: In this double-blind, multicenter trial, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of the ultra-low-molecular-weight heparin semuloparin for prevention of venous thromboembolism in patients receiving chemotherapy for cancer.Patients with metastatic or locally advanced solid tumors who were beginning to receive a course of chemotherapy were randomly assigned to receive subcutaneous semuloparin, 20 mg once daily, or placebo until there was a change of chemotherapy regimen.The primary efficacy outcome was the composite of any symptomatic deep-vein thrombosis, any nonfatal pulmonary embolism, and death related to venous thromboembolism.Clinically relevant bleeding (major and nonmajor) was the main safety outcome.RESULTS: The median treatment duration was 3.5 months.Venous thromboembolism occurred in 20 of 1608 patients (1.2%) receiving semuloparin, as compared with 55 of 1604 (3.4%) receiving placebo (hazard ratio, 0.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.21 to 0.60; P<0.001), with consistent efficacy among subgroups defined according to the origin and stage of cancer and the baseline risk of venous thromboembolism.The incidence of clinically relevant bleeding was 2.8% and 2.0% in the semuloparin and placebo groups, respectively (hazard ratio, 1.40; 95% CI, 0.89 to 2.21).Major bleeding occurred in 19 of 1589 patients (1.2%) receiving semuloparin and 18 of 1583 (1.1%) receiving placebo (hazard ratio, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.55 to 1.99).Incidences of all other adverse events were similar in the two study groups.CONCLUSIONS: Semuloparin reduces the incidence of thromboembolic events in patients receiving chemotherapy for cancer, with no apparent increase in major bleeding.(Funded by Sanofi; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00694382.).",0,0,0,0
22774206,"A multiinstitutional phase 2 trial of pazopanib monotherapy in advanced anaplastic thyroid cancer.CONTEXT/OBJECTIVES: Pazopanib, an inhibitor of kinases including vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, demonstrated impressive activity in progressive metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer, prompting its evaluation in anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC).DESIGN/SETTING/PATIENTS/INTERVENTIONS/OUTCOME MEASURES: Preclinical studies, followed by a multicenter single arm phase 2 trial of continuously administered 800 mg pazopanib daily by mouth (designed to provide 90% chance of detecting a response rate of >20% at the 0.10 significance level when the true response rate is >5%), were undertaken.The primary trial end point was Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) response.RESULTS: Pazopanib displayed activity in the KTC2 ATC xenograft model, prompting clinical evaluation.Sixteen trial patients were enrolled; 15 were treated: 66.7% were female, median age was 66 yr (range 45-77 yr), and 11 of 15 had progressed through prior systemic therapy.Enrollment was halted, triggered by a stopping rule requiring more than one confirmed RECIST response among the first 14 of 33 potential patients.Four patients required one to two dose reductions; severe toxicities (National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria-Adverse Events version 3.0 grades >3) were hypertension (13%) and pharyngolaryngeal pain (13%).Treatment was discontinued because of the following: disease progression (12 patients), death due to a possibly treatment-related tumor hemorrhage (one patient), and intolerability (radiation recall tracheitis and uncontrolled hypertension, one patient each).Although transient disease regression was observed in several patients, there were no confirmed RECIST responses.Median time to progression was 62 d; median survival time was 111 d. Two patients are alive with disease 9.9 and 35 months after the registration; 13 died of disease.CONCLUSIONS: Despite preclinical in vivo activity in ATC, pazopanib has minimal single-agent clinical activity in advanced ATC.",0,0,0,0
