22565002,"Randomized phase II trial of everolimus in combination with tamoxifen in patients with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative metastatic breast cancer with prior exposure to aromatase inhibitors: a GINECO study.PURPOSE: Cross-talk between signal transduction pathways likely contributes to hormone resistance in metastatic breast cancer (mBC).Everolimus, an oral inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin, has restored sensitivity in endocrine-resistance models and shown anticancer activity in early-phase mBC clinical trials.This analysis evaluated efficacy and safety of everolimus in combination with tamoxifen in patients with mBC resistant to aromatase inhibitors (AIs).PATIENTS AND METHODS: This open-label, phase II study randomly assigned postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative, AI-resistant mBC to tamoxifen 20 mg/d plus everolimus 10 mg/d (n = 54) or tamoxifen 20 mg/d alone (n = 57).Randomization was stratified by primary and secondary hormone resistance.Primary end point was clinical benefit rate (CBR), defined as the percentage of all patients with a complete or partial response or stable disease at 6 months.No formal statistical comparison between groups was planned.RESULTS: The 6-month CBR was 61% (95% CI, 47 to 74) with tamoxifen plus everolimus and 42% (95% CI, 29 to 56) with tamoxifen alone.Time to progression (TTP) increased from 4.5 months with tamoxifen alone to 8.6 months with tamoxifen plus everolimus, corresponding to a 46% reduction in risk of progression with the combination (hazard ratio [HR], 0.54; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.81).Risk of death was reduced by 55% with tamoxifen plus everolimus versus tamoxifen alone (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.24 to 0.81).The main toxicities associated with tamoxifen plus everolimus were fatigue (72% v 53% with tamoxifen alone), stomatitis (56% v 7%), rash (44% v 7%), anorexia (43% v 18%), and diarrhea (39% v 11%).CONCLUSION: This study suggests that tamoxifen plus everolimus increased CBR, TTP, and overall survival compared with tamoxifen alone in postmenopausal women with AI-resistant mBC.",1,1,1,1
22511495,"High-dose imatinib induction followed by standard-dose maintenance in pre-treated chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia patients--final analysis of a randomized, multicenter, phase III trial.BACKGROUND: Previous data suggest that the response of chronic myeloid leukemia cells to imatinib is dose-dependent.The potential benefit of initial dose intensification of imatinib in pre-treated patients with chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia remains unknown.DESIGN AND METHODS: Two hundred and twenty-seven pre-treated patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase were randomly assigned to continuous treatment with a standard dose of imatinib (400 mg/day; n=113) or to 6 months of high-dose induction with imatinib (800 mg/day) followed by a standard dose of imatinib as maintenance therapy (n=114).RESULTS: The rates of major and complete cytogenetic responses were significantly higher in the high-dose arm than in the standard-dose arm at both 3 and 6 months (major cytogenetic responses: 36.8% versus 21.2%, P=0.01 and 50.0% versus 34.5%, P=0.018; complete cytogenetic responses: 22.8% versus 6.2%, P<0.001 and 40.4% versus 16.8%, P<0.001) on the basis of an intention-to-treat analysis.At 12 months, the difference between treatment arms remained statistically significant for complete cytogenetic responses (40.4% versus 24.8%, P=0.012) but not for major cytogenetic responses (49.1% versus 44.2%, P=0.462).The rate of major molecular responses was also significantly better at 3 and 6 months in the high-dose arm (month 3: 14.9% versus 3.5%, P=0.003; month 6: 32.5% versus 8.8%, P<0.001).Overall and progression-free survival rates were comparable between arms, but event-free survival was significantly worse in the high-dose arm (P=0.014).CONCLUSIONS: Standard-dose imatinib remains the standard of care for pre-treated patients with chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT00327262).",1,1,1,1
22610153,"Extended benefit from sequential administration of docetaxel after standard fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide regimen for node-positive breast cancer: the 8-year follow-up results of the UNICANCER-PACS01 trial.PURPOSE: The initial report from the Programme Action Concertee Sein (PACS) PACS01 trial demonstrated a benefit at 5 years for disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) rates with the sequential administration of docetaxel after FEC100 (fluorouracil 500 mg/m(2), epirubicin 100 mg/m(2), and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m(2)) for patients with node-positive, operable breast cancer.We evaluate here the impact of this regimen at 8 years.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between June 1997 and March 2000, a total of 1,999 patients (age <65) with localized, resectable, non-pretreated, unilateral breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive either standard FEC100 for 6 cycles or 3 cycles of FEC100 followed by 3 cycles of 100 mg/m(2) docetaxel (FEC-D), both given every 21 days.Radiotherapy was mandatory after conservative surgery and tamoxifen was given for 5 years to hormone receptor (HR)-positive patients.Five-year DFS was the trial's main endpoint.Updated 8-year survival data are presented.RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 92.8 months, 639 patients experienced at least one event.A total number of 383 deaths were registered.Eight-year DFS rates were 65.8% with FEC alone and 70.2% with FEC-D. OS rates at 8 years were 78% with FEC alone and 83.2% with FEC-D. Cox regression analysis adjusted for age and number of positive nodes showed a 15% reduction in the relative risk of relapse and a 25% reduction in the relative risk of death in favor of FEC-D. Significant relative risk reductions were observed in the HR-positive, HER2-positive, and Ki67 >/=20% subpopulations.CONCLUSION: Benefits for DFS and OS rates with the sequential FEC-D regimen are fully confirmed at 8 years.",1,1,1,1
23019943,"[Curative effect of 3D-CRT combined with gemcitabine concurrently with addition of Kanglaite Injection in treatment of locally advanced pancreatic].OBJECTIVE: To explore the efficacy of concurrent chemoradiotherapy combined with Kanglaite Injection (KI) for locally advanced pancreatic carcinoma patients.METHODS: Totally 50 patients unsuitable for surgery were randomly assigned to the treatment group and the control group, 25 in each group.Patients in the control group were treated with gemcitabine and concurrent 3D-CRT, while those in the treatment group were also treated with intravenous injection of KI (at 100 mL/d) for 21 successive days, 28 days as one cycle, two cycles with one week interval.The short-term curative effect, the survival time, the improvement of symptoms, the tumor markers, and adverse reactions were respectively observed for two years.RESULTS: The short-term curative effective rate (CR + PR) was 52.17% (12/23), and the disease control rate (CR + PR + SD) was 95.65% (22/23) in the treatment group.The short-term curative effective rate (CR + PR) was 41.67% (10/24), and the disease control rate (CR + PR + SD) was 87.50% (21/24) in the control group.There was no statistical difference between the two groups (P > 0.05).The 2-year survival rate was 34.78% (8/23) in the treatment group, better than that in the control group (25.00%, 6/24).The median survival time was 17.2 months in the treatment group and 12.4 months in the control group with statistical difference (P < 0.05).The response rate of pain relief and weight gain were 75.00% and 82.61% in the treatment group respectively, and they were 50.00% and 54.67% in the control group respectively, showing statistical difference between the two groups (P < 0.05).After treatment, the levels of CA19-9 (U/mL) and CEA (ng/mL) were respectively reduced to 118.00 +/- 78.89 and 7.41 +/- 2.37 respectively in the treatment group, showing statistical difference when compared with those of the control group (being 216.00 +/- 153.23 and 12.25 +/- 7.53 respectively, P < 0.05).CONCLUSION: The concurrent chemoradiotherapy com- bined with KI for locally advanced pancreatic carcinoma patients obtained better results.",1,1,1,1
22674529,"A phase 3 study of induction treatment with concurrent chemoradiotherapy versus chemotherapy before surgery in patients with pathologically confirmed N2 stage IIIA nonsmall cell lung cancer (WJTOG9903).BACKGROUND: This study sought to ascertain whether induction-concurrent radiotherapy added to chemotherapy could improve the survival of patients undergoing surgery for stage IIIA N2 nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC).METHODS: Patients with pathologically proven N2 disease were randomized to receive either induction chemotherapy (docetaxel 60 mg/m(2) and carboplatin AUC [area under the receiver operating characteristic curve] = 5 for 2 cycles) plus concurrent radiation therapy (40 Gy) followed by surgery (CRS arm) or induction chemotherapy followed by surgery (CS arm).They subsequently underwent pulmonary resection when possible.RESULTS: Sixty patients were randomly assigned between December 2000 and August 2005.The study was prematurely terminated in January 2006 because of slow accrual.The most common toxicity was grade 3 or 4 leukopenia in 92.9% of patients in the CRS arm and 46.4% in the CS arm.Induction therapy was generally well tolerated, and there were no treatment-related deaths in either arm.Downstaging in the CS arm and CRS arm was 21% and 40%, respectively.The progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in the CS arm were 9.7 months and 29.9 months (PFS, hazard ratio [HR] = 0.68, P = .187), and those in the CRS arm were 12.4 months and 39.6 months (OS, HR = 0.77, P = .397), respectively.The PFS with and without downstaging was 55.0 and 9.4 months, respectively (HR = 3.39, P = .001).The OS with and without downstaging was 63.3 and 29.5 months, respectively (HR = 2.62, P = .021).CONCLUSIONS: The addition of radiotherapy to induction chemotherapy conferred better local control without significant adverse events.Tumor downstaging is important for prolonging the OS in patients with stage IIIA (N2) NSCLC.",1,1,1,1
22408263,"MYC+ diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is not salvaged by classical R-ICE or R-DHAP followed by BEAM plus autologous stem cell transplantation.Approximately 5-10% of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL) harbor a 8q24/MYC rearrangement (MYC(+)).We determined the prognostic significance of MYC rearrangement in patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL prospectively treated by R-ICE or R-DHAP followed by high-dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation.Twenty-eight (17%) of the 161 patients analyzed presented a MYC(+) rearrangement, targeted as either simple hit (25%) or complex hits (n=75%) including MYC/BCL2, MYC/BCL6, and MYC/BCL2/BCL6.Results were statistically highly concordant in matched primary and relapsed biopsies (n = 45).Compared to the MYC(-) DLBCL patients, the MYC(+) DLBCL patients presented with a more elevated lactico-deshydrogenase level (P = .0006) and a more advanced age adjusted international prognostic index (P = .0039).The 4-year PFS and OS were significantly lower in the MYC(+) DLBCL patients than those in the MYC(-) DLBCL patients, with rates of 18% vs 42% (P = .0322), and of 29% vs 62% (P = .0113), respectively.Type of treatment, R-DHAP or R-ICE, had no impact on survivals, with 4-year PFS rates of 17% vs 19% and 4-year OS rates of 26% vs 31%.In conclusion, MYC rearrangement is an early event in DLBCL.MYC(+) DLBCL patients have a significant inferior prognosis than MYC(-) DLBCL patients.Their outcome was not influenced by the proposed salvage therapy.",0,0,0,0
22585294,"The impact of bladder neck mucosal eversion during open radical prostatectomy on bladder neck stricture and urinary extravasation.PURPOSE: To determine whether the bladder neck mucosal eversion (BNM-eversion) during radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP) reduces the risk of bladder neck stricture (BNS) and of peri-anastomotic extravasation (PAE) in postoperative cystography.METHODS: Two hundred and eleven patients with clinically localized prostate cancer underwent RRP and were prospectively randomized into patients with BNM-eversion (group I) and without BNM-eversion (group II).All patients underwent an evaluation of PAE by retrograde cystography on postoperative day 8.We assessed BNS after 6 months.RESULTS: Ninety-two patients with and 113 patients without BNM-eversion were included.There was no significant difference in baseline characteristics, including age, TNM-classification, Gleason score, PSA, prostate volume, and blood loss in both groups.A complete follow-up of 6 months for BNS was available for 188 patients (89.1 %).Sixteen BNS out of 188 patients were recorded, 4.7 % (n = 4) in group I and 11.7 % (n = 12) in group II (p = 0.09).Data from 205 out of 211 patients were available for the evaluation of the extravasation by cystography.Peri-anastomotic extravasation was detectable in 11.96 %, (11/205) in group I and in 21.24 % (24/205) in group II (p = 0.08).CONCLUSION: BNM-eversion does not have a positive influence on the prevention of bladder neck strictures.Peri-anastomotic extravasation detected by cystography does not correlate with a formation of bladder neck stricture.",0,0,0,0

Results from the GEICAM/2006-03, multicenter study.Chemotherapy remains as the only systemic treatment option available for basal-like breast cancer (BC) patients.Preclinical models and several phase II studies suggested that platinum salts are active drugs in this BC subtype though there is no randomized study supporting this hypothesis.This study investigates if the addition of carboplatin to a combination of an alkylating agent together with anthracyclines and taxanes is able to increase the efficacy in the neoadjuvant treatment context.Patients with operable breast cancer and immunophenotypically defined basal-like disease (ER-/PR-/HER2- and cytokeratin 5/6+ or EGFR+) were recruited.Patients were randomized to receive EC (epirubicin 90 mg/m(2) plus cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2) for 4 cycles) followed either by D (docetaxel 100 mg/m(2) x 4 cycles; EC-D) or DCb (docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) plus carboplatin AUC 6 x 4 cycles; EC-DCb).The primary end point was pathological complete response (pCR) in the breast following the Miller and Payne criteria.Ninety-four patients were randomized (46 EC-D, 48 EC-DCb).pCR rate in the breast was seen in 16 patients (35 %) with EC-D and 14 patients (30 %) with EC-DCb (P value = 0.61).pCR in the breast and axilla was seen in 30 % of patients in both arms.The overall clinical response rate was 70 % (95 % CI 56-83) in the EC-D arm and 77 % (95 % CI 65-87) in the EC-DCb arm.Grade 3/4 toxicity was similar in both arms.The addition of carboplatin to conventional chemotherapy with EC-D in basal-like breast cancer patients did not improve the efficacy probably because they had already received an alkylating agent.These findings should be taken into consideration when developing new agents for this disease.",1,1,1,1

Among hrHPV-positive women the rate of CIN2+ was 19.0% (n = 43), in contrast with 1.6% (n = 2) among hrHPV-negative women (relative risk = 12.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.6-81.1, P < 0.001).Among all hrHPV-negative women whose cytological findings were normal or ASCUS, dysplastic lesions were uncommon (n = 4/119, 3.4%), and all were CIN1.If these women had not been referred to colposcopy, the number of colposcopies would have been reduced by 33.6%.We conclude that hrHPV testing combined with repeat cervical cytology had a high negative predictive value in patients with recurrent low-grade cervical cytology.This could reduce the referral rate to colposcopy without jeopardizing patient safety.",0,0,0,0
23127215,"Associations of soluble fiber, whole fruits/vegetables, and juice with plasma Beta-carotene concentrations in a free-living population of breast cancer survivors.OBJECTIVE: Soluble fiber and the physical state of fruits/vegetables affect plasma ss-carotene concentrations; however, most of this research was conducted in laboratory-based settings.These analyses investigated the relationship between soluble fiber and juiced versus whole fruits/vegetables to plasma ss-carotene concentrations in a free-living population.METHOD: This cross-sectional analysis used 12-month follow-up data from the Women's Healthy Eating & Living Study (1995-2006), a study to improve diet in breast cancer survivors in the Western United States.The dietary nutrients considered in this analysis included intake of soluble fiber (g), ss-carotene from fruit/vegetable juice (mg), and ss-carotene from whole fruits/vegetables (mg).A linear regression model was used to assess the relationship of the variables to plasma ss-carotene concentrations.RESULTS: Out of 3,088 women enrolled in the Women's Healthy Eating & Living Study, 2,397 women had complete data (mean age = 54).The final model accounted for approximately 49% of the explained variance in plasma ss-carotene concentrations.Fruit/vegetable juice had the largest positive relation to plasma ss-carotene concentrations (standardized parameter estimate = 0.23, p < 0.01), followed by whole fruits/vegetables (standardized parameter estimate = 0.09, p < 0.01).CONCLUSION: Soluble fiber may inhibit ss-carotene absorption; therefore, consumption of juice may increase plasma ss-carotene concentrations more than whole fruits/vegetables in free-living populations.",0,0,0,0
22610153,"Extended benefit from sequential administration of docetaxel after standard fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide regimen for node-positive breast cancer: the 8-year follow-up results of the UNICANCER-PACS01 trial.PURPOSE: The initial report from the Programme Action Concertee Sein (PACS) PACS01 trial demonstrated a benefit at 5 years for disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) rates with the sequential administration of docetaxel after FEC100 (fluorouracil 500 mg/m(2), epirubicin 100 mg/m(2), and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m(2)) for patients with node-positive, operable breast cancer.We evaluate here the impact of this regimen at 8 years.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between June 1997 and March 2000, a total of 1,999 patients (age <65) with localized, resectable, non-pretreated, unilateral breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive either standard FEC100 for 6 cycles or 3 cycles of FEC100 followed by 3 cycles of 100 mg/m(2) docetaxel (FEC-D), both given every 21 days.Radiotherapy was mandatory after conservative surgery and tamoxifen was given for 5 years to hormone receptor (HR)-positive patients.Five-year DFS was the trial's main endpoint.Updated 8-year survival data are presented.RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 92.8 months, 639 patients experienced at least one event.A total number of 383 deaths were registered.Eight-year DFS rates were 65.8% with FEC alone and 70.2% with FEC-D. OS rates at 8 years were 78% with FEC alone and 83.2% with FEC-D. Cox regression analysis adjusted for age and number of positive nodes showed a 15% reduction in the relative risk of relapse and a 25% reduction in the relative risk of death in favor of FEC-D. Significant relative risk reductions were observed in the HR-positive, HER2-positive, and Ki67 >/=20% subpopulations.CONCLUSION: Benefits for DFS and OS rates with the sequential FEC-D regimen are fully confirmed at 8 years.",1,1,1,1
22840231,"Influence of perioperative oxygen fraction on pulmonary function after abdominal surgery: a randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: A high perioperative inspiratory oxygen fraction (FiO2) may reduce the frequency of surgical site infection.Perioperative atelectasis is caused by absorption, compression and reduced function of surfactant.It is well accepted, that ventilation with 100% oxygen for only a few minutes is associated with significant formation of atelectasis.However, it is still not clear if a longer period of 80% oxygen results in more atelectasis compared to a low FiO2.Our aim was to assess if a high FiO2 is associated with impaired oxygenation and decreased pulmonary functional residual capacity (FRC).METHODS: Thirty-five patients scheduled for laparotomy for ovarian cancer were randomized to receive either 30% oxygen (n = 15) or 80% oxygen (n = 20) during and for 2 h after surgery.The oxygenation index (PaO2/FiO2) was measured every 30 min during anesthesia and 90 min after extubation.FRC was measured the day before surgery and 2 h after extubation by a rebreathing method using the inert gas SF6.RESULTS: Five min after intubation, the median PaO2/FiO2 was 69 kPa [53-71] in the 30%-group vs. 60 kPa [47-69] in the 80%-group (P = 0.25).At the end of anesthesia, the PaO2/FiO2 was 58 kPa [40-70] vs. 57 kPa [46-67] in the 30%- and 80%-group, respectively (P = 0.10).The median FRC was 1993 mL [1610-2240] vs. 1875 mL [1545-2048] at baseline and 1615 mL [1375-2318] vs. 1633 mL [1343-1948] postoperatively in the 30%- and 80%-group, respectively (P = 0.70).CONCLUSION: We found no significant difference in oxygenation index or functional residual capacity between patients given 80% and 30% oxygen for a period of approximately 5 hours.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00637936.",0,0,0,0
22488460,"Efficient identification and referral of low-income women at high risk for hereditary breast cancer: a practice-based approach.BACKGROUND: Identification of low-income women with the rare but serious risk of hereditary cancer and their referral to appropriate services presents an important public health challenge.We report the results of formative research to reach thousands of women for efficient identification of those at high risk and expedient access to free genetic services.External validity is maximized by emphasizing intervention fit with the two end-user organizations who must connect to make this possible.This study phase informed the design of a subsequent randomized controlled trial.METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled pilot study (n = 38) to compare two intervention models for feasibility and impact.The main outcome was receipt of genetic counseling during a two-month intervention period.Model 1 was based on the usual outcall protocol of an academic hospital genetic risk program, and Model 2 drew on the screening and referral procedures of a statewide toll-free phone line through which large numbers of high-risk women can be identified.In Model 1, the risk program proactively calls patients to schedule genetic counseling; for Model 2, women are notified of their eligibility for counseling and make the call themselves.We also developed and pretested a family history screener for administration by phone to identify women appropriate for genetic counseling.RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in receipt of genetic counseling between women randomized to Model 1 (3/18) compared with Model 2 (3/20) during the intervention period.However, when unresponsive women in Model 2 were called after 2 months, 7 more obtained counseling; 4 women from Model 1 were also counseled after the intervention.Thus, the intervention model that closely aligned with the risk program's outcall to high-risk women was found to be feasible and brought more low-income women to free genetic counseling.Our screener was easy to administer by phone and appeared to identify high-risk callers effectively.The model and screener are now in use in the main trial to test the effectiveness of this screening and referral intervention.A validation analysis of the screener is also underway.CONCLUSION: Identification of intervention strategies and tools, and their systematic comparison for impact and efficiency in the context where they will ultimately be usedare critical elements of practice-based research.",0,0,0,0
22795435,"American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z4099/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 1021: a randomized study of sublobar resection compared with stereotactic body radiotherapy for high-risk stage I non-small cell lung cancer.During the past decade, tremendous interest has arisen in the use of nonoperative therapies for patients with non-small cell lung cancer.Of these therapies, stereotactic body radiotherapy has become established as an effective modality for treating peripheral cancer in medically inoperable patients.Toxicity is low, and the treatment is effective, with excellent local control rates.Several investigators have suggested that stereotactic body radiotherapy could be effective for high-risk operable patients (usually treated with sublobar resection) and even perhaps for standard-risk operable patients (usually treated with lobectomy); however, this is less accepted.A direct comparison of stereotactic body radiotherapy and sublobar resection is difficult for a number of reasons.These include different definitions of recurrence, different populations of patients in these studies (with those undergoing stereotactic body radiotherapy tending to be the medically inoperable group), and different methods of classifying morbidity in the surgical and radiation oncology studies.Imaging follow-up has also not been standardized among the studies.Thus, a randomized study is necessary and timely.Investigators from the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group and the Radiation Therapy and Oncology Group have collaborated to develop a phase III randomized study comparing stereotactic body radiotherapy and sublobar resection (with or without brachytherapy) for high-risk operable patients with non-small cell lung cancer.This study (American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z4099/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 1021) has recently opened for accrual.It is hoped that this will help to better define the role of these therapies for patients with non-small cell lung cancer.",0,0,0,0
22511495,"High-dose imatinib induction followed by standard-dose maintenance in pre-treated chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia patients--final analysis of a randomized, multicenter, phase III trial.BACKGROUND: Previous data suggest that the response of chronic myeloid leukemia cells to imatinib is dose-dependent.The potential benefit of initial dose intensification of imatinib in pre-treated patients with chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia remains unknown.DESIGN AND METHODS: Two hundred and twenty-seven pre-treated patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase were randomly assigned to continuous treatment with a standard dose of imatinib (400 mg/day; n=113) or to 6 months of high-dose induction with imatinib (800 mg/day) followed by a standard dose of imatinib as maintenance therapy (n=114).RESULTS: The rates of major and complete cytogenetic responses were significantly higher in the high-dose arm than in the standard-dose arm at both 3 and 6 months (major cytogenetic responses: 36.8% versus 21.2%, P=0.01 and 50.0% versus 34.5%, P=0.018; complete cytogenetic responses: 22.8% versus 6.2%, P<0.001 and 40.4% versus 16.8%, P<0.001) on the basis of an intention-to-treat analysis.At 12 months, the difference between treatment arms remained statistically significant for complete cytogenetic responses (40.4% versus 24.8%, P=0.012) but not for major cytogenetic responses (49.1% versus 44.2%, P=0.462).The rate of major molecular responses was also significantly better at 3 and 6 months in the high-dose arm (month 3: 14.9% versus 3.5%, P=0.003; month 6: 32.5% versus 8.8%, P<0.001).Overall and progression-free survival rates were comparable between arms, but event-free survival was significantly worse in the high-dose arm (P=0.014).CONCLUSIONS: Standard-dose imatinib remains the standard of care for pre-treated patients with chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT00327262).",1,1,1,1
22149921,"ABVD alone versus radiation-based therapy in limited-stage Hodgkin's lymphoma.BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy plus radiation treatment is effective in controlling stage IA or IIA nonbulky Hodgkin's lymphoma in 90% of patients but is associated with late treatment-related deaths.Chemotherapy alone may improve survival because it is associated with fewer late deaths.METHODS: We randomly assigned 405 patients with previously untreated stage IA or IIA nonbulky Hodgkin's lymphoma to treatment with doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD) alone or to treatment with subtotal nodal radiation therapy, with or without ABVD therapy.Patients in the ABVD-only group, both those with a favorable risk profile and those with an unfavorable risk profile, received four to six cycles of ABVD.Among those assigned to subtotal nodal radiation therapy, patients who had a favorable risk profile received subtotal nodal radiation therapy alone and patients with an unfavorable risk profile received two cycles of ABVD plus subtotal nodal radiation therapy.The primary end point was 12-year overall survival.RESULTS: The median length of follow-up was 11.3 years.At 12 years, the rate of overall survival was 94% among those receiving ABVD alone, as compared with 87% among those receiving subtotal nodal radiation therapy (hazard ratio for death with ABVD alone, 0.50; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.25 to 0.99; P=0.04); the rates of freedom from disease progression were 87% and 92% in the two groups, respectively (hazard ratio for disease progression, 1.91; 95% CI, 0.99 to 3.69; P=0.05); and the rates of event-free survival were 85% and 80%, respectively (hazard ratio for event, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.54 to 1.43; P=0.60).Among the patients randomly assigned to ABVD alone, 6 patients died from Hodgkin's lymphoma or an early treatment complication and 6 died from another cause; among those receiving radiation therapy, 4 deaths were related to Hodgkin's lymphoma or early toxic effects from the treatment and 20 were related to another cause.CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma, ABVD therapy alone, as compared with treatment that included subtotal nodal radiation therapy, was associated with a higher rate of overall survival owing to a lower rate of death from other causes.(Funded by the Canadian Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute; HD.6 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00002561.).",1,1,1,1
22376019,"Population pharmacokinetics of native Escherichia coli asparaginase.The main aim of this analysis was to characterize the population pharmacokinetics of native Escherichia coli asparaginase (ASNase medac) in pediatric patients with previously untreated acute lymphoblastic leukemia.Secondary objective was to give further evidence for bioequivalence between ASNase medac and a new recombinant ASNase preparation.The authors reanalyzed 233 plasma samples from 16 children treated according to the DCOG-ALL 10 protocol (5000 U/m(2) ASNase medac) using NONMEM.Subsequently, assessment of bioequivalence was performed by including the preparation as a categorical covariate into the PopPK model when analyzing data of both preparations (480 samples, 32 children).A linear 2-compartment model with first-order elimination sufficiently described ASNase medac pharmacokinetics.The parameters found were as follows: total body clearance 0.13 L/h +/- 12.4% per 1.73 m(2), volume of distribution in the central compartment 4.11 L +/- 12.3% per 70 kg, volume of distribution in the peripheral compartment 1.63 L per 70 kg and intercompartmental clearance 0.106 L/h (mean +/- interindividual variability).A visual predictive check procedure and simulation of different dosages ASNase medac administered in the ALL-BFM protocol indicated adequate model performance.Assessment of bioequivalence provided a difference of about 14% in clearance of both preparations being too small to be considered as clinically relevant.A population pharmacokinetic model of ASNase medac in pediatric patients with previously untreated acute lymphoblastic leukemia was established.The model was able to describe asparaginase activity of different dosages in the ALL-BFM protocol and provides further evidence for bioequivalence between ASNase medac and a new recombinant asparaginase preparation.",0,0,0,0
22565002,"Randomized phase II trial of everolimus in combination with tamoxifen in patients with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative metastatic breast cancer with prior exposure to aromatase inhibitors: a GINECO study.PURPOSE: Cross-talk between signal transduction pathways likely contributes to hormone resistance in metastatic breast cancer (mBC).Everolimus, an oral inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin, has restored sensitivity in endocrine-resistance models and shown anticancer activity in early-phase mBC clinical trials.This analysis evaluated efficacy and safety of everolimus in combination with tamoxifen in patients with mBC resistant to aromatase inhibitors (AIs).PATIENTS AND METHODS: This open-label, phase II study randomly assigned postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative, AI-resistant mBC to tamoxifen 20 mg/d plus everolimus 10 mg/d (n = 54) or tamoxifen 20 mg/d alone (n = 57).Randomization was stratified by primary and secondary hormone resistance.Primary end point was clinical benefit rate (CBR), defined as the percentage of all patients with a complete or partial response or stable disease at 6 months.No formal statistical comparison between groups was planned.RESULTS: The 6-month CBR was 61% (95% CI, 47 to 74) with tamoxifen plus everolimus and 42% (95% CI, 29 to 56) with tamoxifen alone.Time to progression (TTP) increased from 4.5 months with tamoxifen alone to 8.6 months with tamoxifen plus everolimus, corresponding to a 46% reduction in risk of progression with the combination (hazard ratio [HR], 0.54; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.81).Risk of death was reduced by 55% with tamoxifen plus everolimus versus tamoxifen alone (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.24 to 0.81).The main toxicities associated with tamoxifen plus everolimus were fatigue (72% v 53% with tamoxifen alone), stomatitis (56% v 7%), rash (44% v 7%), anorexia (43% v 18%), and diarrhea (39% v 11%).CONCLUSION: This study suggests that tamoxifen plus everolimus increased CBR, TTP, and overall survival compared with tamoxifen alone in postmenopausal women with AI-resistant mBC.",1,1,1,1

23053638,"A randomized phase II trial of platinum salts in basal-like breast cancer patients in the neoadjuvant setting. Results from the GEICAM/2006-03, multicenter study.Chemotherapy remains as the only systemic treatment option available for basal-like breast cancer (BC) patients.Preclinical models and several phase II studies suggested that platinum salts are active drugs in this BC subtype though there is no randomized study supporting this hypothesis.This study investigates if the addition of carboplatin to a combination of an alkylating agent together with anthracyclines and taxanes is able to increase the efficacy in the neoadjuvant treatment context.Patients with operable breast cancer and immunophenotypically defined basal-like disease (ER-/PR-/HER2- and cytokeratin 5/6+ or EGFR+) were recruited.Patients were randomized to receive EC (epirubicin 90 mg/m(2) plus cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2) for 4 cycles) followed either by D (docetaxel 100 mg/m(2) x 4 cycles; EC-D) or DCb (docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) plus carboplatin AUC 6 x 4 cycles; EC-DCb).The primary end point was pathological complete response (pCR) in the breast following the Miller and Payne criteria.Ninety-four patients were randomized (46 EC-D, 48 EC-DCb).pCR rate in the breast was seen in 16 patients (35 %) with EC-D and 14 patients (30 %) with EC-DCb (P value = 0.61).pCR in the breast and axilla was seen in 30 % of patients in both arms.The overall clinical response rate was 70 % (95 % CI 56-83) in the EC-D arm and 77 % (95 % CI 65-87) in the EC-DCb arm.Grade 3/4 toxicity was similar in both arms.The addition of carboplatin to conventional chemotherapy with EC-D in basal-like breast cancer patients did not improve the efficacy probably because they had already received an alkylating agent.These findings should be taken into consideration when developing new agents for this disease.",1,1,1,1

Continuous accelerated irradiation of 7-days per week is equal to accelerated fractionation with concomitant boost of 7 fractions in 5-days per week: report on phase 3 clinical trial in head-and-neck cancer patients.PURPOSE: To report long-term results of randomized trial comparing 2 accelerated fractionations of definitive radiation therapy assessing the need to irradiate during weekend in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 345 patients with SCC of the oral cavity, larynx, and oro- or hypo-pharynx, stage T2-4N0-1M0, were randomized to receive continuous accelerated irradiation (CAIR: once per day, 7 days per week) or concomitant accelerated boost (CB: once per day, 3 days per week, and twice per day, 2 days per week).Total dose ranged from 66.6-72 Gy, dose per fraction was 1.8 Gy, number of fractions ranged from 37-40 fractions, and overall treatment time ranged from 37-40 days.RESULTS: No differences for all trial end-points were noted.At 5 and 10 years, the actuarial rates of local-regional control were 63% and 60% for CAIR vs 65% and 60% for CB, and the corresponding overall survival were 40% and 25% vs 44% and 25%, respectively.Confluent mucositis was the main acute toxicity, with an incidence of 89% in CAIR and 86% in CB patients.The 5-year rate of grade 3-4 late radiation morbidity was 6% for both regimens.CONCLUSIONS: Results of this trial indicate that the effects of accelerated fractionation can be achieve by delivering twice-per-day irradiation on weekday(s).This trial has also confirmed that an accelerated, 6-weeks schedule is a reasonable option for patients with intermediate-stage head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma because of the associated high cure rate and minimal severe late toxicity.",0,0,0,0
22674529,"A phase 3 study of induction treatment with concurrent chemoradiotherapy versus chemotherapy before surgery in patients with pathologically confirmed N2 stage IIIA nonsmall cell lung cancer (WJTOG9903).BACKGROUND: This study sought to ascertain whether induction-concurrent radiotherapy added to chemotherapy could improve the survival of patients undergoing surgery for stage IIIA N2 nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC).METHODS: Patients with pathologically proven N2 disease were randomized to receive either induction chemotherapy (docetaxel 60 mg/m(2) and carboplatin AUC [area under the receiver operating characteristic curve] = 5 for 2 cycles) plus concurrent radiation therapy (40 Gy) followed by surgery (CRS arm) or induction chemotherapy followed by surgery (CS arm).They subsequently underwent pulmonary resection when possible.RESULTS: Sixty patients were randomly assigned between December 2000 and August 2005.The study was prematurely terminated in January 2006 because of slow accrual.The most common toxicity was grade 3 or 4 leukopenia in 92.9% of patients in the CRS arm and 46.4% in the CS arm.Induction therapy was generally well tolerated, and there were no treatment-related deaths in either arm.Downstaging in the CS arm and CRS arm was 21% and 40%, respectively.The progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in the CS arm were 9.7 months and 29.9 months (PFS, hazard ratio [HR] = 0.68, P = .187), and those in the CRS arm were 12.4 months and 39.6 months (OS, HR = 0.77, P = .397), respectively.The PFS with and without downstaging was 55.0 and 9.4 months, respectively (HR = 3.39, P = .001).The OS with and without downstaging was 63.3 and 29.5 months, respectively (HR = 2.62, P = .021).CONCLUSIONS: The addition of radiotherapy to induction chemotherapy conferred better local control without significant adverse events.Tumor downstaging is important for prolonging the OS in patients with stage IIIA (N2) NSCLC.",1,1,1,1
21953376,"MRI of colorectal cancer liver metastases: comparison of orally administered manganese with intravenously administered gadobenate dimeglumine.OBJECTIVES: To compare the sensitivity of MRI to detect colorectal cancer liver metastases (CRLM) after ingestion of manganese-based contrast agent (CMC-001) with that of a comprehensive intravenous gadobenate dimeglumine protocol, and to assess the safety and acceptability of oral manganese.METHODS: 20 patients suspected of having 1-6 CRLM were included prospectively in this randomised cross-over study.Liver MRI was performed with a one-week interval at 1.5 T and included T1-w VIBE and T2-HASTE, before and after administration of 1.6 g CMC-001 or 0.1 mmol/kg gadobenate dimeglumine.The metastasis-to-liver signal intensity (SI) ratio was calculated.Standard of reference was histopathology after surgery, or combination of other imaging studies and/or follow up.Adverse events (AE) and clinicolaboratory tests were monitored.RESULTS: Of 44 metastases, 41 were detected after CMC-001 (93%) and 42 after gadobenate dimeglumine (95%).Fifteen false-positive lesions were found after CMC-001 and 2 after gadobenate dimeglumine.The metastasis-to-liver SI ratio was significantly higher after CMC-001 than after gadobenate dimeglumine (0.51 and 0.21 respectively, P < 0.0001).More AE occurred after manganese compared to gadobenate dimeglumine.CONCLUSIONS: CMC-001 is as sensitive as an extensive intravenous gadobenate dimeglumine protocol in detecting CRLM.It was relatively well tolerated but had higher rates of gastrointestinal AE.KEY POINTS: * Liver MRI after ingestion of manganese is highly sensitive for detecting metastases * High false-positive rate necessitates further evaluation, in some cases * The MR examination time is short * Oral ingestion of manganese seems safe and relatively well tolerated by patients *Manganese compounds may be useful for liver metastasis surveillance after colorectal cancer.",0,0,0,0
23158059,"Chromosome damage and cell proliferation rates in in vitro irradiated whole blood as markers of late radiation toxicity after radiation therapy to the prostate.PURPOSE: In vitro irradiated blood samples from prostate cancer patients showing late normal tissue damage were examined for lymphocyte response by measuring chromosomal aberrations and proliferation rate.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients were selected from a randomized trial evaluating the optimal timing of dose-escalated radiation and short-course androgen deprivation therapy.Of 438 patients, 3% experienced grade 3 late radiation proctitis and were considered to be radiosensitive.Blood samples were taken from 10 of these patients along with 20 matched samples from patients with grade 0 proctitis.The samples were irradiated at 6 Gy and, along with control samples, were analyzed for dicentric chromosomes and excess fragments per cell.Cells in first and second metaphase were also enumerated to determine the lymphocyte proliferation rate.RESULTS: At 6 Gy, there were statistically significant differences between the radiosensitive and control cohorts for 3 endpoints: the mean number of dicentric chromosomes per cell (3.26 +/- 0.31, 2.91 +/- 0.32; P=.0258), the mean number of excess fragments per cell (2.27 +/- 0.23, 1.43 +/- 0.37; P<.0001), and the proportion of cells in second metaphase (0.27 +/- 0.10, 0.46 +/- 0.09; P=.0007).CONCLUSIONS: These results may be a valuable indicator for identifying radiosensitive patients and for tailoring radiation therapy.",0,0,0,0

23053638,"A randomized phase II trial of platinum salts in basal-like breast cancer patients in the neoadjuvant setting. Results from the GEICAM/2006-03, multicenter study.Chemotherapy remains as the only systemic treatment option available for basal-like breast cancer (BC) patients.Preclinical models and several phase II studies suggested that platinum salts are active drugs in this BC subtype though there is no randomized study supporting this hypothesis.This study investigates if the addition of carboplatin to a combination of an alkylating agent together with anthracyclines and taxanes is able to increase the efficacy in the neoadjuvant treatment context.Patients with operable breast cancer and immunophenotypically defined basal-like disease (ER-/PR-/HER2- and cytokeratin 5/6+ or EGFR+) were recruited.Patients were randomized to receive EC (epirubicin 90 mg/m(2) plus cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2) for 4 cycles) followed either by D (docetaxel 100 mg/m(2) x 4 cycles; EC-D) or DCb (docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) plus carboplatin AUC 6 x 4 cycles; EC-DCb).The primary end point was pathological complete response (pCR) in the breast following the Miller and Payne criteria.Ninety-four patients were randomized (46 EC-D, 48 EC-DCb).pCR rate in the breast was seen in 16 patients (35 %) with EC-D and 14 patients (30 %) with EC-DCb (P value = 0.61).pCR in the breast and axilla was seen in 30 % of patients in both arms.The overall clinical response rate was 70 % (95 % CI 56-83) in the EC-D arm and 77 % (95 % CI 65-87) in the EC-DCb arm.Grade 3/4 toxicity was similar in both arms.The addition of carboplatin to conventional chemotherapy with EC-D in basal-like breast cancer patients did not improve the efficacy probably because they had already received an alkylating agent.These findings should be taken into consideration when developing new agents for this disease.",1,1,1,1
22674191,"Goserelin and bicalutamide treatments alter the expression of microRNAs in the prostate.BACKGROUND: Although endocrine therapy has been used for decades, its influence on the expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) in clinical tissue specimens has not been analyzed.Moreover, the effects of the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion on the expression of miRNAs in hormone naive and endocrine-treated prostate cancers are poorly understood.METHODS: We used clinical material from a neoadjuvant trial consisting of 28 men treated with goserelin (n = 8), bicalutamide (n = 9), or no treatment (n = 11) for 3 months prior to radical prostatectomy.Freshly frozen specimens were used for microarray analysis of 723 human miRNAs.Specific miRNA expression in cancer, benign epithelium and stromal tissue compartments was predicted with an in silico Bayesian modeling tool.RESULTS: The expression of 52, 44, and 34 miRNAs was affected >1.4-fold by the endocrine treatment in the cancer, non-malignant epithelium, and stromal compartments, respectively.Of the 52 miRNAs, only 10 were equally affected by the two treatment modalities in the cancer compartment.Twenty-six of the 52 genes (50%) showed AR binding sites in their proximity in either VCaP or LNCaP cell lines.Forty-seven miRNAs were differentially expressed in TMPRSS2:ERG fusion positive compared with fusion negative cases.Endocrine treatment reduced the differences between fusion positive and negative cases.CONCLUSIONS: Goserelin treatment and bicalutamide treatment mostly affected the expression of different miRNAs.The effect clearly varied in different tissue compartments.TMPRSS2:ERG fusion positive and negative cases showed differential expression of miRNAs, and the difference was diminished by androgen ablation.",0,0,0,0

22565002,"Randomized phase II trial of everolimus in combination with tamoxifen in patients with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative metastatic breast cancer with prior exposure to aromatase inhibitors: a GINECO study.PURPOSE: Cross-talk between signal transduction pathways likely contributes to hormone resistance in metastatic breast cancer (mBC).Everolimus, an oral inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin, has restored sensitivity in endocrine-resistance models and shown anticancer activity in early-phase mBC clinical trials.This analysis evaluated efficacy and safety of everolimus in combination with tamoxifen in patients with mBC resistant to aromatase inhibitors (AIs).PATIENTS AND METHODS: This open-label, phase II study randomly assigned postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative, AI-resistant mBC to tamoxifen 20 mg/d plus everolimus 10 mg/d (n = 54) or tamoxifen 20 mg/d alone (n = 57).Randomization was stratified by primary and secondary hormone resistance.Primary end point was clinical benefit rate (CBR), defined as the percentage of all patients with a complete or partial response or stable disease at 6 months.No formal statistical comparison between groups was planned.RESULTS: The 6-month CBR was 61% (95% CI, 47 to 74) with tamoxifen plus everolimus and 42% (95% CI, 29 to 56) with tamoxifen alone.Time to progression (TTP) increased from 4.5 months with tamoxifen alone to 8.6 months with tamoxifen plus everolimus, corresponding to a 46% reduction in risk of progression with the combination (hazard ratio [HR], 0.54; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.81).Risk of death was reduced by 55% with tamoxifen plus everolimus versus tamoxifen alone (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.24 to 0.81).The main toxicities associated with tamoxifen plus everolimus were fatigue (72% v 53% with tamoxifen alone), stomatitis (56% v 7%), rash (44% v 7%), anorexia (43% v 18%), and diarrhea (39% v 11%).CONCLUSION: This study suggests that tamoxifen plus everolimus increased CBR, TTP, and overall survival compared with tamoxifen alone in postmenopausal women with AI-resistant mBC.",1,1,1,1
22633317,"Prostate-specific antigen kinetics and outcomes in patients with bone metastases from castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with or without zoledronic acid.BACKGROUND: Zoledronic acid (ZOL) is a standard therapy for the prevention of skeletal-related events (SREs) in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).Although prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is an established marker for monitoring prostate cancer patients, correlations between PSA and disease outcomes during ZOL therapy are unclear.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationships among PSA kinetics, bone-directed therapy with ZOL, and clinical outcomes in men with bone metastases from CRPC using a ZOL phase 3 trial database.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Exploratory analyses from a phase 3 trial in men with bone metastases from CRPC (n=643) randomized to ZOL or placebo every 3 wk.OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: PSA levels during the first 3 mo of the study were evaluated in linear and logarithmic (log) models stratified using prognostic factors established in a ZOL phase 3 trial and a CRPC nomogram.Relative risks of SREs, bone disease progression (BDP), and death were calculated per 1 log (nanograms per milliliter) PSA increase.Baseline PSA models used the study median (PSA: 77.3 ng/ml) as the high/low cut-off point.RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: A total of 202 placebo- and 434 ZOL-treated patients were assessable.In both groups, PSA increases correlated with significantly increased risks of death, BDP, and first SRE.In the placebo and ZOL groups, associated increases in risk per 1 log (nanograms per milliliter) PSA increase were 29% (p<0.0001) and 10% (p<0.0074), respectively, for BDP, and 24% (p=0.0010) and 13% (p=0.0079), respectively, for first SRE.Limitations include the retrospective nature of these analyses and the potential confounding effects of concurrent antineoplastic therapies.CONCLUSIONS: PSA is an important prognostic tool for survival in patients with bone metastases from CRPC, and these analyses show that PSA is also prognostic for BDP and SREs regardless of bone-targeted therapy.",1,1,1,0
20835926,"Palliative stenting with or without radiotherapy for inoperable esophageal carcinoma: a randomized trial.BACKGROUND: A majority of patients with esophageal cancer present with inoperable disease and require rapid and long-lasting palliation of dysphagia.STUDY AIM: To compare the duration of relief of dysphagia in patients with inoperable esophageal cancer treated with esophageal stenting alone or a combination of esophageal stenting and external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), and to assess overall survival, treatment-related complications, and quality of life (QOL) in the two groups.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with inoperable esophageal cancer and with high grade dysphagia were randomized to receive esophageal stenting with self-expandable metal stent (Ultraflex) alone (Group I), versus a combination of stenting followed by EBRT (30 gray in ten divided fractions over 2 weeks) (Group II).Dysphagia relief, overall survival, QOL (using European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30, version 3), and treatment-related complications were assessed in the two groups.RESULTS: From April 2007 to March 2009, 84 patients were randomized to receive esophageal stent alone (42 patients) or a combination of stent and EBRT (42 patients).The two groups were comparable in demographics, tumor characteristics, indications for palliative treatment, and pretreatment dysphagia score.Dysphagia scores improved significantly in both groups following stent insertion.However, dysphagia relief was more sustained in Group II than in Group I (7 vs. 3 months, p = 0.002).Overall median survival was significantly higher in Group II than in Group I (180 vs. 120 days, p = 0.009).Addition of radiotherapy following stenting prolonged the mean dysphagia-free survival (118.6 +/- 55.8 vs. 96.8 +/- 43.0 days, p = 0.054).There was significant improvement in all QOL parameters at 1 week after stenting.The QOL, however, significantly declined immediately after radiotherapy.There was no treatment-related mortality, and the incidence of complications was similar in the two groups.CONCLUSION: Post-stenting EBRT effectively prolongs duration of dysphagia relief and improves overall survival in inoperable esophageal cancer.",1,1,0,0

22488488,"The impact of PLCO control arm contamination on perceived PSA screening efficacy.PURPOSE: To quantify the extent to which a clinically significant prostate cancer mortality reduction due to screening could have been masked by control arm screening (contamination) in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) trial.METHODS: We used three independently developed models of prostate cancer natural history to conduct a virtual PLCO trial.Simulated participants underwent pre-trial screening based on population patterns.The intervention arm followed observed compliance during the trial then resumed population screening.A contaminated control arm followed observed contamination during the trial then resumed population screening, while an uncontaminated control arm discontinued screening upon entry.We assumed a clinically significant screening benefit, applied population treatments and survival patterns, and calculated mortality rate ratios relative to the contaminated and uncontaminated control arms.RESULTS: The virtual trial reproduced observed incidence, including stage and grade distributions, and control arm mortality after 10 years of complete follow-up.Under the assumed screening benefit, the three models found that contamination increased the mortality rate ratio from 0.68-0.77 to 0.86-0.91, increased the chance of excess mortality in the intervention arm from 0-4 % to 15-28 %, and decreased the power of the trial to detect a mortality difference from 40-70 % to 9-25 %.CONCLUSIONS: Our computer simulation models indicate that contamination substantially limited the ability of the PLCO to identify a clinically significant screening benefit.While the trial shows annual screening does not reduce mortality relative to population screening, contamination prevents concluding whether screening reduces mortality relative to no screening.",0,0,0,0

22965962,"Aflibercept and Docetaxel versus Docetaxel alone after platinum failure in patients with advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer: a randomized, controlled phase III trial.PURPOSE: To compare the efficacy of aflibercept (ziv-aflibercept), a recombinant human fusion protein targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway, with or without docetaxel in platinum-pretreated patients with advanced or metastatic nonsquamous non-small-cell lung cancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this international, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trial, 913 patients were randomly assigned to (ziv-)aflibercept 6 mg/kg intravenous (IV; n = 456) or IV placebo (n = 457), both administered every 3 weeks and in combination with docetaxel 75 mg/m(2).The primary end point was overall survival (OS).Other efficacy outcomes, safety, and immunogenicity were also assessed.RESULTS: Patient characteristics were balanced between arms; 12.3% of patients had received prior bevacizumab.(Ziv-)Aflibercept did not improve OS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.01; 95% CI, 0.87 to 1.17; stratified log-rank P = .90).The median OS was 10.1 months (95% CI, 9.2 to 11.6 months) for (ziv-)aflibercept and 10.4 months (95% CI, 9.2 to 11.9 months) for placebo.In exploratory analyses, median progression-free survival was 5.2 months (95% CI, 4.4 to 5.6 months) for (ziv-)aflibercept versus 4.1 months (95% CI, 3.5 to 4.3 months) for placebo (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72 to 0.94; P = .0035); overall response rate was 23.3% of evaluable patients (95% CI, 19.1% to 27.4%) in the (ziv-)aflibercept arm versus 8.9% (95% CI, 6.1% to 11.6%; P < .001) in the placebo arm.Grade >/= 3 adverse events occurring more frequently in the (ziv-)aflibercept arm versus the placebo arm were neutropenia (28.0% v 21.1%, respectively), fatigue (11.1% v 4.2%, respectively), stomatitis (8.8% v 0.7%, respectively), and hypertension (7.3% v 0.9%, respectively).CONCLUSION: The addition of (ziv-)aflibercept to standard docetaxel therapy did not improve OS.In exploratory analyses, secondary efficacy end points did seem to be improved in the (ziv-)aflibercept arm.The study regimen was associated with increased toxicities, consistent with known anti-VEGF and chemotherapy-induced events.",1,1,1,1
22978687,"In thyroidectomized patients with thyroid cancer, a serum thyrotropin of 30 muU/mL after thyroxine withdrawal is not always adequate for detecting an elevated stimulated serum thyroglobulin.BACKGROUND: The thyrotropin (TSH) level or duration of thyroid hormone withdrawal (THW) required to detect stimulated thyroglobulin (Tg) in differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) monitoring is unknown.The objective of this study was to evaluate the TSH cutoff of >30 muU/mL as a means to detect stimulated Tg >/=2 ng/mL after THW (THW-Tg>/=2), and sensitivity of the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) questionnaire for detecting hypothyroid symptoms.METHODS: This was a prospective longitudinal cohort study done at a tertiary academic medical center.Forty-seven patients with DTC undergoing their first Tg stimulation or after previously abnormal Tg stimulation had weekly measurements of TSH and Tg during the 4 weeks THW, and repeated questionnaire assessments.RESULTS: TSH did not reach a plateau in any patient, and in those whose Tg did not remain undetectable, Tg continued to rise.Seventy-five percent of patients had an undetectable Tg <0.2 ng/mL at baseline (95% were <0.5 mg/mL) with 16% remaining undetectable throughout THW.The majority of patients (72.7% and 97.8%) achieved TSH >30 muU/mL by 3 and 4 weeks THW, respectively.Of the 15 patients with maximum stimulated THW-Tg>/=2, 38% were detected before the minimal TSH >30 muU/mL cutoff.At 2 weeks THW, 3 had a TSH>30 muU/mL, and none of them had Tg >/=2 ng/mL. At 3 weeks THW, 11 had a TSH >30 muU/mL, and 64% of them had Tg >/=2 ng/mL. Only 60% were detected at 3-week THW regardless of their TSH level.Eighty-six percent were detected by TSH 60-<80 muU/mL. Conversely, all patients whose serum Tg was <0.2 ng/mL when their serum TSH was >20 muU/mL did not achieve a THW-Tg>/=2.CONCLUSION: The minimal TSH cutoff of >30 muU/mL was inadequate to detect many patients with final stimulated THW-Tg>/=2 during complete THW.TSH >80-100 muU/mL was a better cutoff, achieved in only 53% after 4-week THW.Conversely, we propose a preliminary THW-stopping rule for ending THW early in selected patients.In patients with a Tg <0.2 ng/mL when TSH >20 muU/mL, all had a final stimulated Tg </=2 ng/mL, potentially saving qualifying patients 40% of THW duration compared to 4-week THW.FACIT-F correlated with TSH, but was not sensitive to detect mild hypothyroidism.",0,0,0,0
22306907,"Autologous cytokine-induced killer cell transfusion in combination with gemcitabine plus cisplatin regimen chemotherapy for metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma.In this study, we evaluate the efficacy of autologous cytokine-induced killer cells (CIK) transfusion used in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin (GC) chemotherapy to treat nasopharyngeal carcinoma in patients with distant metastasis after radiotherapy.From September 2007 to August 2008, 60 patients with distant metastasis after radiotherapy were followed up and were randomly divided into 2 groups.The 30 patients in the GC+CIK group were treated with adoptive autologous CIK cell transfusion in combination with GC chemotherapy; the 30 patients in the GC group were treated with chemotherapy alone.Short-term efficacy evaluation revealed that in the GC+CIK group, there were 3 cases of complete remission, 18 cases of partial remission, 2 cases of stabilization of disease, and 7 cases of progression of disease and the total effective rate was 70% (21/30).In the GC group, there were 0 cases of complete remission, 14 cases of partial remission, 3 case of stable disease, and 13 cases of progressive disease and the total effective rate was 46.7% (14/21).Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that the overall survival of the GC+CIK group was higher than that of the GC group, but the difference was not significant (P=0.1374, log-rank test).However, the progression-free survival of the GC+CIK group was significantly higher than that of the GC group (P=0.0234, log-rank test).Thus, our study indicated that CIK cell transfusion therapy used in combination with GC chemotherapy may be a more effective treatment for postradiotherapy distant metastasis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients.",1,1,1,1

22065199,"Temozolomide plus radiotherapy for glioblastoma in a Canadian province: efficacy versus effectiveness and the impact of O6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase promoter methylation.BACKGROUND: Radiotherapy with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide has been the standard of care for newly diagnosed glioblastoma in adults since the pivotal trial by Roger Stupp and colleagues.The effectiveness of this regimen has not been evaluated in Canada.Additionally, the impact of O6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation on patient survival has not been confirmed.Hence, survival outcomes and MGMT predictive value were compared for the patients in Alberta versus the Stupp trial population.METHODS: Retrospective chart review of 215 adult glioblastoma patients who started radiotherapy and temozolomide between January 2007 and December 2010 at the Cross Cancer Institute (Edmonton, Alberta) or the Tom Baker Cancer Centre (Calgary, Alberta).RESULTS: In the Alberta population, median overall survival was 14.3 months (vs. 14.6 months in trial, p = NS) and median progression-free survival was 5.8 months (vs. 6.9 months in trial, p = NS).However, unlike the trial, the Alberta MGMT subgroup analysis for overall survival was not statistically significant, despite a hazard ratio of 0.65 in favor of the methylated group.More Alberta patients received corticosteroids (p < 0.0001) and fewer underwent complete resection (p = 0.0001) or a postprogression second surgery (p = 0.01) than the Stupp population, but characteristics were otherwise similar.CONCLUSION: Current practice in Alberta enables patients to achieve overall and progression-free survival similar to the clinical trial.Further follow-up is required to confirm the predictive value of the MGMT assay.Until that is clarified or better treatments are developed, it is reasonable to continue offering this treatment regimen to patients regardless of MGMT methylation status.",0,0,0,0
22520631,"Ability of C-reactive protein to complement multiple prognostic classifiers in men with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer receiving docetaxel-based chemotherapy.UNLABELLED: What's known on the subject? and What does the study add?Serum C-reactive protein (C-reactive protein) is emerging as a potential novel prognostic factor in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).In the present study, a prospective trial was investigated retrospectively and a significant prognostic impact for C-reactive protein that was independent of multiple published prognostic models was identified in men receiving docetaxel-based chemotherapy for mCRPC.Prospective validation is warranted.OBJECTIVE: * Given the recent emergence of C-reactive protein levels as a novel prognostic factor in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), we sought to evaluate the independent prognostic ability of C-reactive protein in the context of published prognostic nomograms, risk grouping and disease state models in men receiving docetaxel-based chemotherapy for mCRPC.PATIENTS AND METHODS: * A large randomized phase II trial (CS-205) of mCRPC patients who received docetaxel-prednisone + AT-101 (Bcl-2 inhibitor) or docetaxel-prednisone + placebo was analyzed retrospectively (n= 220).* Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and measures of discriminatory ability were assessed in a hypothesis-generating analysis using Cox regression and concordance probabilities.* Patients from both treatment groups were combined for this analysis because no significant differences in outcomes were observed.* Because some factors used in nomograms were not collected or defined differently, risk was estimated based on slightly modified versions of nomograms.RESULTS: * C-reactive protein was independently prognostic for OS and PFS (P </= 0.002) after adjusting for all modeled risk estimates and classifiers.* C-reactive protein showed a concordance probability of 0.65 for both OS and PFS.* A 10-factor modified prognostic model based on the TAX327 trial had the greatest observed discrimination ability for OS and PFS (concordance probability = 0.623 and 0.603, respectively) among the modified nomograms or classifiers.* Adding the TAX327 model risk estimates to C-reactive protein did not substantially increase discrimination ability over C-reactive protein alone.CONCLUSIONS: * Current prognostic classifications provide modest discrimination of outcomes in mCRPC receiving docetaxel-based chemotherapy, highlighting the need for improved risk-based models.* Baseline C-reactive protein appears to be an useful, independent prognostic factor and prospective external validation is warranted.",0,0,0,0

22669453,"Tumor budding is an independent predictor of outcome in AJCC/UICC stage II colorectal cancer.BACKGROUND: In colorectal cancer, the morphology of the invasive tumor margin may reflect aggressiveness of tumor growth, thus providing important prognostic information.The tumor growth pattern according to Jass and the extent of tumor budding were analyzed in patients with American Joint Committee on Cancer/Union for International Cancer Control (AJCC/UICC) stage II disease.METHODS: Tumors of 120 randomly selected patients with AJCC/UICC stage II disease were retrospectively reviewed for tumor growth pattern (expanding vs. infiltrating) and the extent of tumor budding, with high-grade budding reflecting presence of 10 or more budding foci scattered at the invasive tumor margin.Progression-free and cancer-specific survivals were determined by the Kaplan-Meier method.For multivariable analysis, Cox's proportional hazards regression models were performed.RESULTS: The infiltrating growth pattern was significantly associated with histological subtype and lymphovascular invasion, while high-grade budding was significantly associated with tumor grade and lymphovascular invasion.High-grade budding, but not the infiltrating growth pattern, was significantly associated with outcome in univariable analysis.Cox's proportional hazards regression models proved tumor budding to be an independent predictor of disease progression (hazard ratio 3.91, 95 % confidence interval 1.3-11.77; P = 0.02) and cancer-related death (hazard ratio 5.90, 95 % confidence interval 1.62-21.51; P = 0.007).The combination of infiltrating growth pattern and high-grade budding did not have a stronger prognostic significance than tumor budding alone.CONCLUSIONS: Tumor budding independently predicted patient outcome in patients with AJCC/UICC stage II colorectal cancer and may therefore be used for accurate prognostication, patient counseling, and design of clinical trials by using integrated multimodal therapy.",0,0,0,0

23031619,"Breast density as indicator for the use of mammography or MRI to screen women with familial risk for breast cancer (FaMRIsc): a multicentre randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: To reduce mortality, women with a family history of breast cancer often start mammography screening at a younger age than the general population.Breast density is high in over 50% of women younger than 50 years.With high breast density, breast cancer incidence increases, but sensitivity of mammography decreases.Therefore, mammography might not be the optimal method for breast cancer screening in young women.Adding MRI increases sensitivity, but also the risk of false-positive results.The limitation of all previous MRI screening studies is that they do not contain a comparison group; all participants received both MRI and mammography.Therefore, we cannot empirically assess in which stage tumours would have been detected by either test.The aim of the Familial MRI Screening Study (FaMRIsc) is to compare the efficacy of MRI screening to mammography for women with a familial risk.Furthermore, we will assess the influence of breast density.METHODS/DESIGN: This Dutch multicentre, randomized controlled trial, with balanced randomisation (1:1) has a parallel grouped design.Women with a cumulative lifetime risk for breast cancer due to their family history of >/=20%, aged 30-55 years are eligible.Identified BRCA1/2 mutation carriers or women with 50% risk of carrying a mutation are excluded.Group 1 receives yearly mammography and clinical breast examination (n = 1000), and group 2 yearly MRI and clinical breast examination, and mammography biennially (n = 1000).Primary endpoints are the number and stage of the detected breast cancers in each arm.Secondary endpoints are the number of false-positive results in both screening arms.Furthermore, sensitivity and positive predictive value of both screening strategies will be assessed.Cost-effectiveness of both strategies will be assessed.Analyses will also be performed with mammographic density as stratification factor.DISCUSSION: Personalized breast cancer screening might optimize mortality reduction with less over diagnosis.Breast density may be a key discriminator for selecting the optimal screening strategy for women < 55 years with familial breast cancer risk; mammography or MRI.These issues are addressed in the FaMRIsc study including high risk women due to a familial predisposition.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Netherland Trial Register NTR2789.",1,1,0,0
22115704,"Comparison of pemetrexed plus cisplatin with other first-line doublets in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC): a combined analysis of three phase 3 trials.INTRODUCTION: In a first-line study of advanced NSCLC, pemetrexed-cisplatin was more effective among patients with adenocarcinoma and large-cell carcinoma compared with gemcitabine-cisplatin (median survival of 11.8 versus 10.4 months, P=.005), while survival with pemetrexed-cisplatin was shorter than with gemcitabine-cisplatin in patients with squamous cell carcinoma.The comparability of pemetrexed-cisplatin to other commonly used regimens within histology subgroups needs to be explored.METHODS: This retrospective analysis combined the patient-level data from three phase 3 randomized controlled trials that compared the efficacy of different third generation platinum- and non-platinum based doublets.Unadjusted median survival times and Cox covariate-adjusted treatment hazard ratio (HR) estimates were calculated.Overall results and subgroups by histological type were reported.RESULTS: This combined analysis consisted of 3467 patients.In the overall analysis, adjusted HRs favored pemetrexed (HR <1.0) to each of the other 5 regimens, though none of these HRs were statistically significant.Among patients with non-squamous histology, pemetrexed-cisplatin produced favorable HRs to each of the other regimens, achieving statistical significance when compared with vinorelbine-cisplatin (HR=0.67; 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 0.50, 0.91) and gemcitabine-cisplatin (HR=0.85; 95% CI: 0.75, 0.97).Among patients with squamous histology, 4 of the 5 comparison regimens produced favorable HRs (HR >1.0) when compared with pemetrexed-cisplatin, with only the comparison with gemcitabine-cisplatin achieving statistical significance (HR=1.23; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.51).CONCLUSION: In the absence of randomized clinical trial data comparing pemetrexed-cisplatin to commonly used doublets in advanced NSCLC other than gemcitabine-cisplatin, this combined analysis of multiple trials provides estimates for such comparisons.",0,0,0,0

22892060,"Hormone replacement therapy after breast cancer: 10 year follow up of the Stockholm randomised trial.BACKGROUND: The management of hormonal deficiency symptoms in breast cancer survivors is an unsolved problem.While hormone replacement therapy (HRT) may increase the risk of breast cancer in healthy women, its effects on recurrence is unclear.Observational studies have suggested decreased recurrence rates from HRT.The few clinical trials in this field have all been closed preterm.METHODS: The Stockholm trial was started in 1997 and designed to minimise the dose of progestogen in the HRT arm.Disease-free women with a history of breast cancer were randomised to HRT (n=188) or no HRT (n=190).The trial was stopped in 2003 when another Swedish study (HABITS, the Hormonal Replacement After Breast Cancer - Is it Safe?) reported increased recurrence.However the Stockholm material showed no excess risk after 4 years of follow-up.A long term follow-up has now been performed.FINDINGS: After 10.8 years of follow-up, there was no difference in new breast cancer events: 60 in the HRT group versus 48 among controls (hazard ratio (HR)=1.3; 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.9-1.9).Among women on HRT, 11 had local recurrence and 12 distant metastases versus 15 and 12 for the controls.There were 14 contra-lateral breast cancers in the HRT group and four in the control group (HR=3.6; 95% CI=1.2-10.9; p=0.013).No differences in mortality or new primary malignancies were found.INTERPRETATION: The number of new events did not differ significantly between groups, in contrast to previous reports.The increased recurrence in HABITS has been attributed to higher progestogen exposure.As both trials were prematurely closed, data do not allow firm conclusions.Both studies found no increased mortality from breast cancer or other causes from HRT.Current guidelines typically consider HRT contraindicated in breast cancer survivors.Findings suggest that, in some women symptom relief may outweigh the potential risks of HRT.",0,0,0,0
23146280,"The prognostic and predictive value of mRNA expression of vascular endothelial growth factor family members in breast cancer: a study in primary tumors of high-risk early breast cancer patients participating in a randomized Hellenic Cooperative Oncology Group trial.INTRODUCTION: The main prognostic variables in early breast cancer are tumor size, histological grade, estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor (ER/PgR) status, number of positive nodes and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status.The present study evaluated the prognostic and/or predictive value of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family members in high-risk early breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant chemo-hormonotherapy.METHODS: RNA was isolated from 308 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded primary tumor samples from breast cancer patients enrolled in the HE10/97 trial, evaluating adjuvant dose-dense sequential chemotherapy with epirubicin followed by cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil (CMF) with or without paclitaxel (E-T-CMF versus E-CMF).A fully automated method based on magnetic beads was applied for RNA extraction, followed by one-step quantitative RT-PCR for mRNA analysis of VEGF-A, -B, -C and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) 1, 2, 3.RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 8 years, 109 patients (35%) developed a relapse and 80 patients (26%) died.In high VEGF-C and VEGFR1 mRNA expressing tumors, ER/PgR-negative tumors (Fisher's exact test, P = 0.001 and P = 0.021, respectively) and HER2-positive tumors (P <0.001 and P = 0.028, respectively) were more frequent than in low VEGF-C and VEGFR1 expressing tumors, respectively.From the VEGF family members evaluated, high VEGFR1 mRNA expression (above the 75th percentile) emerged as a significant negative prognostic factor for overall survival (OS; hazard ratio (HR) = 1.60, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01 to 2.55, Wald's P = 0.047) and disease-free survival (DFS; HR = 1.67, 95% CI: 1.13 to 2.48, P = 0.010), when adjusting for treatment group.High VEGF-C mRNA expression was predictive for benefit from adjuvant treatment with paclitaxel (E-T-CMF arm) for OS (test for interaction, Wald's P = 0.038), while in multivariate analysis the interaction of VEGF-C with taxane treatment was significant for both OS (Wald's P = 0.019) and DFS (P = 0.041) and continuous VEGF-B mRNA expression values for OS (P = 0.019).CONCLUSIONS: The present study reports, for the first time, that VEGF-C mRNA overexpression, as assessed by qRT-PCR, has a strong predictive value in high-risk early breast cancer patients undergoing adjuvant paclitaxel-containing treatment.Further studies are warranted to validate the prognostic and/or predictive value of VEGF-B, VEGF-C and VEGFR1 in patients treated with adjuvant therapies and to reveal which members of the VEGF family could possibly be useful markers in identifying patients who will benefit most from anti-VEGF strategies.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR) ACTRN12611000506998.",0,0,0,0
21699645,"Usefulness of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) rise as a marker of prostate cancer in men treated with dutasteride: lessons from the REDUCE study.OBJECTIVES: To determine if dutasteride-treated men can be monitored safely and adequately for prostate cancer based on data from the Reduction by Dutasteride in Prostate Cancer Events (REDUCE) study.To analyse whether the use of treatment-specific criteria for repeat biopsy maintains the usefulness of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level for detecting high grade cancers.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The REDUCE study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled investigation of whether dutasteride (0.5 mg/day) reduced the risk of biopsy-detectable prostate cancer in men with a previous negative biopsy.The usefulness of PSA was evaluated using biopsy thresholds defined by National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines in the placebo group and any rise in PSA from nadir (the lowest PSA level achieved while in the study) in the dutasteride group.The number of cancers detected on biopsy in the absence of increased/suspicious PSA level as well as sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for high grade prostate cancer detection were analysed by treatment group.Prostate cancer pathological characteristics were compared between men who did and did not meet biopsy thresholds.RESULTS: Of 8231 men randomized, 3305 (dutasteride) and 3424 (placebo) underwent at least one prostate biopsy during the study and were included in the analysis.If only men meeting biopsy thresholds underwent biopsy, 25% (47/191) of Gleason 7 and 24% (7/29) of Gleason 8-10 cancers would have been missed in the dutasteride group, and 37% (78/209) of Gleason 7 and 22% (4/18) Gleason 8-10 cancers would have been missed in the placebo group.In both groups, the incidence of Gleason 7 and Gleason 8-10 cancers generally increased with greater rises in PSA.Sensitivity of PSA kinetics was higher and specificity was lower for the detection of Gleason 7-10 cancers in men treated with dutasteride vs placebo.Men with Gleason 7 and Gleason 8-10 cancer meeting biopsy thresholds had greater numbers of positive cores, percent core involvement, and biopsy cancer volume vs men not meeting thresholds.CONCLUSION: Using treatment-specific biopsy thresholds, the present study shows that the ability of PSA kinetics to detect high grade prostate cancer is maintained with dutasteride compared with placebo in men with a previous negative biopsy.The sensitivity of PSA kinetics with dutasteride was similar to (Gleason 8-10) or higher than (Gleason 7-10) the placebo group; however, biopsy decisions based on a single increased PSA measurement from nadir in the dutasteride group resulted in a lower specificity compared with using a comparable biopsy threshold in the placebo group, indicating the importance of confirmation of PSA measurements.",0,0,0,0

22507091,"Prospective randomized controlled study comparing cell block method and conventional smear method for pancreatic juice cytology.AIM: To elucidate the diagnostic efficacy of the cell block (CB) method by comparing it with that of conventional smear cytology for pancreatic juice obtained by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in a randomized controlled trial fashion.METHODS: A total of 170 patients with pancreatic lesions suspicious of being malignant who underwent pancreatic juice collection without giving secretin under ERCP were enrolled in this study.After sampling, the pancreatic juice was randomized to the CB method (n = 85) or to smear cytology (n = 85).CB sections were subjected to hematoxylin-eosin, periodic acid Schiff-Alcian blue, and immunohistochemical stains.Both Papanicolaou stain and Giemsa stain were used for smear cytology.RESULTS: The final diagnosis was malignancy in 54 patients: pancreatic cancer, 45; intraductal papillary-mucinous carcinoma, six; and endocrine tumor, three.The number of patients with a cytological borderline malignancy in the CB group (3.5%) was significantly smaller than that in the smear group (27.1%) (P < 0.001).The diagnostic accuracy of the CB method and that of smear cytology were 76.5% (65/85) and 74.1% (63/85), respectively (P = 0.72), and their respective sensitivities were 50% (14/28) and 38.5% (10/26) (P = 0.39).The sensitivity of the CB method (88.9%) was better than that of smear cytology (42.9%) for invasive ductal carcinoma in the pancreas head (P = 0.048).CONCLUSIONS: The CB method using immunostaining for pancreatic juice cytology showed a much lower rate of equivocal borderline malignancy and a tendency for a higher diagnostic yield compared with smear cytology.Its diagnostic sensitivity, however, was not satisfactory except for pancreatic-head cancer.",1,0,0,0
22474202,"Effect of oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and leucovorin with or without cetuximab on survival among patients with resected stage III colon cancer: a randomized trial.CONTEXT: Leucovorin, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) is the standard adjuvant therapy for resected stage III colon cancer.Adding cetuximab to FOLFOX benefits patients with metastatic wild-type KRAS but not mutated KRAS colon cancer.OBJECTIVE: To assess the potential benefit of cetuximab added to the modified sixth version of the FOLFOX regimen (mFOLFOX6) in patients with resected stage III wild-type KRAS colon cancer.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A randomized trial of 2686 patients aged 18 years or older at multiple institutions across North America enrolled following resection and informed consent between February 10, 2004, and November 25, 2009.The primary randomized comparison was 12 biweekly cycles of mFOLFOX6 with and without cetuximab.KRAS mutation status was centrally determined.The trial was halted after a planned interim analysis of 48% of predicted events (246/515) occurring in 1863 (of 2070 planned) patients with tumors having wild-type KRAS.A total of 717 patients with mutated KRAS and 106 with indeterminate KRAS were accrued.The 2070 patients with wild-type KRAS provided 90% power to detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.33 (2-sided alpha = .05), with planned interim efficacy analyses after 25%, 50%, and 75% of expected relapses.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Disease-free survival in patients with wild-type KRAS mutations.Secondary end points included overall survival and toxicity.RESULTS: Median (range) follow-up was 28 (0-68) months.The trial demonstrated no benefit when adding cetuximab.Three-year disease-free survival for mFOLFOX6 alone was 74.6% vs 71.5% with the addition of cetuximab (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.98-1.49; P = .08) in patients with wild-type KRAS, and 67.1% vs 65.0% (HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.86-1.46; P = .38) in patients with mutated KRAS, with no significant benefit in any subgroups assessed.Among all patients, grade 3 or higher adverse events (72.5% vs 52.3%; odds ratio [OR], 2.4; 95% CI, 2.1-2.8; P < .001) and failure to complete 12 cycles (33% vs 23%; OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.4-1.9; P < .001) were significantly higher with cetuximab.Increased toxicity and greater detrimental differences in all outcomes were observed in patients aged 70 years or older.CONCLUSION: Among patients with stage III resected colon cancer, the use of cetuximab with adjuvant mFOLFOX6 compared with mFOLFOX6 alone did not result in improved disease-free survival.TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00079274.",1,1,1,1
21750964,"Pathological complete response rates following different neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens for operable breast cancer according to ER status, in two parallel, randomized phase II trials with an adaptive study design (ECTO II).Sequential doxorubicin/paclitaxel (AT) followed by CMF treatment was shown to be an active neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen in the first European Cooperative Trial in Operable Breast Cancer (ECTO I trial).The aim of the current study (ECTO II) is to assess the complete pathological response (pCR) rate following three different anthracycline and taxane-containing neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens, with or without capecitabine (X).Patients with operable, invasive breast cancer > 2.0 cm in diameter, were randomized to AT-->CMF, AT-->CMX or AC-->TX regimens in two parallel, randomized, open-label, phase II trials (within a single study) in patients with estrogen receptor negative (ER-) and estrogen receptor positive (ER+) diseases, respectively.Exemestane was delivered concomitantly with neoadjuvant chemotherapy in ER+ tumors.Achievement of pCR was more common in ER- than ER+ women (45.3 vs. 10.4%).Capecitabine was only associated with a higher frequency of pCR in ER+ patients receiving AT-->CMX.Overall response rates (ORR) ranged from 88 to 97%, and this translated into high rates of breast-conserving surgery (67% of ER- patients and 72% of ER+ patients).All three regimens were well tolerated.Febrile neutropenia and gastrointestinal effects were the most common grade >/= 3 adverse events.As expected, the ECTO II study showed higher pCR rates in patients with ER- disease.Substituting capecitabine for fluorouracil (+/- methotrexate) in anthracycline/taxane-containing regimens appeared to be beneficial only in ER+ tumors.Translational studies investigating interactions between therapeutic agents and tumor biology are warranted to refine patient selection and improve the results of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.",0,0,0,0
22184384,"Phase III trial comparing capecitabine plus cisplatin versus capecitabine plus cisplatin with concurrent capecitabine radiotherapy in completely resected gastric cancer with D2 lymph node dissection: the ARTIST trial.PURPOSE: The ARTIST (Adjuvant Chemoradiation Therapy in Stomach Cancer) trial was the first study to our knowledge to investigate the role of postoperative chemoradiotherapy therapy in patients with curatively resected gastric cancer with D2 lymph node dissection.This trial was designed to compare postoperative treatment with capecitabine plus cisplatin (XP) versus XP plus radiotherapy with capecitabine (XP/XRT/XP).PATIENTS AND METHODS: The XP arm received six cycles of XP (capecitabine 2,000 mg/m2 per day on days 1 to 14 and cisplatin 60 mg/m2 on day 1, repeated every 3 weeks) chemotherapy.The XP/XRT/XP arm received two cycles of XP followed by 45-Gy XRT (capecitabine 1,650 mg/m2 per day for 5 weeks) and two cycles of XP.RESULTS: Of 458 patients, 228 were randomly assigned to the XP arm and 230 to the XP/XRT/XP arm.Treatment was completed as planned by 75.4% of patients (172 of 228) in the XP arm and 81.7% (188 of 230) in the XP/XRT/XP arm.Overall, the addition of XRT to XP chemotherapy did not significantly prolong disease-free survival (DFS; P = .0862).However, in the subgroup of patients with pathologic lymph node metastasis at the time of surgery (n = 396), patients randomly assigned to the XP/XRT/XP arm experienced superior DFS when compared with those who received XP alone (P = .0365), and the statistical significance was retained at multivariate analysis (estimated hazard ratio, 0.6865; 95% CI, 0.4735 to 0.9952; P = .0471).CONCLUSION The addition of XRT to XP chemotherapy did not significantly reduce recurrence after curative resection and D2 lymph node dissection in gastric cancer.A subsequent trial (ARTIST-II) in patients with lymph node-positive gastric cancer is planned.",0,0,0,0
22826983,"[Evaluation of the efficacy and toxicity of protocol cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin compared to protocol fluorouracil, doxorubicin and mitomycin C in locally advanced and metastatic gastric cancer].INTRODUCTION: Still there is no consensus on the choice of the most efficient and the least toxic chemotherapy regimen in the treatment of advanced gastric cancer.Nowadays few therapy protocols are available for treating this disease.OBJECTIVE: Study was conducted to compare the efficacy and toxicity of FAM (flurouracil, doxorubicin, mitomycin C) with CDDP and FU/FA (cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin) protocols in patients with locally advanced and metastatic gastric cancer.METHODS: This randomized study involved a group of 50 patients with locally advanced or metastatic gastric cancer, who had not previously undergone chemotherapy treatment.Progression free survival, overall survival and drug toxicity were evaluated.For statistical analysis chi-squaretest, Kaplan-Meier curve and the log rank test were used.RESULTS: The overall response rate was 20% in the group treated with FAM and 24% in the group treated with CDDP, FU/FA (4% of patients from each group had complete response), but without significant statistical difference.Median survival was 10.9 months in the FAM group and 11.8 months in CDDP, FU/FA group, with no statistically significant difference.Non-haematological and haematological toxicities of CDDP, FU/FA were considerably less frequent than of FAM, and there was no treatment related deaths in any of the groups.CONCLUSION: Both investigated regimens demonstrated moderate efficacy.The study shows in favour of justified application of both protocols, while in regard to toxicity CDDP and FU/FA can be recommended as preferable treatment for locally advanced and metastatic gastric cancer.New strategies should be considered for better efficacy in the treatment of advanced gastric cancer.New strategies are necessary with the goal to achieve a better therapeutic effect.",0,0,0,0
