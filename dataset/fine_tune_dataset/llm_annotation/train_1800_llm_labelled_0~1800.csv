30511130,"A New Feasible Technique for Polytetrafluoroethylene Suture Buttress-Reinforced Pancreaticojejunostomy (PBRP): Mechanical Analysis and a Prospective, Randomized Controlled Trial.OBJECTIVES: Postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) is a major concern after pancreatoduodenectomy (PD).We recently designed a new anastomotic method to reduce the rate of pancreatic fistula: polytetrafluoroethylene suture buttress-reinforced pancreaticojejunostomy (PBRP).METHODS: An animal model and a computer simulation were used to measure the maximum stress and tensile strength of the pancreas with and without the suture buttresses.Then, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) was performed to compare the outcome of PD between patients who underwent PBRP vs traditional pancreaticojejunostomy (TP).RESULTS: The maximum load in the animal model was significantly higher with the suture buttresses than without (5.47 +/- 1.67 N vs 3.72 +/- 1.36 N, p < 0.01), and in the computer simulation, the peak stress was lower with the suture buttresses than without (54.86 vs 486.8 MPa).There were no significant differences between the two groups in the overall frequency of POPF, but the rate of clinically relevant POPF was significantly lower in the PBRP group (2.8 vs 22.8%, p = 0.028).The pancreaticojejunostomy time was significantly longer in the PBRP group (19.57 +/- 3.31 vs 17.17 +/-4.83 min, p = 0.018), and the PBRP group showed a shorter drainage tube retention duration (10 vs 12 days, p = 0.006) and postoperative hospital stay (13 d vs 15 d, p = 0.031).CONCLUSIONS: PBRP is a feasible and reliable procedure for preventing clinically relevant POPF.Additional multi-institution randomized trials should be conducted to confirm these results.",0,0,0,0
25130401,"A randomized, open-label, multicentre, phase 2/3 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lumiliximab in combination with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab versus fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab alone in subjects with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.Lumiliximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody that targets CD23 on the surface of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) B-cells.Early phase clinical studies with lumiliximab alone and in combination with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab (FCR) established its potential efficacy and tolerability.The 152CL201 trial [Lumiliximab with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab (FCR) versus FCR alone in subjects with relapsed CLL; LUCID] was a phase 2/3, randomized (1:1), open-label, multicentre study of lumiliximab in combination with FCR versus FCR alone in patients with relapsed CLL.Six hundred and twenty-seven patients were randomized to either arm.Overall the combination of lumiliximab with FCR was not significantly better than FCR alone (overall response rate 71% vs. 72%, complete response rate 16% vs. 15%, median progression-free survival 24.6 vs. 23.9 months respectively, for FCR with and without lumiliximab).There was a slightly increased incidence of adverse events with lumiliximab but these increases did not appear to lead to differences in eventual outcomes.An interim analysis failed to show sufficient efficacy of the combination of lumiliximab with FCR.The study was therefore stopped early for lack of efficacy.Despite the eventual outcome, the LUCID trial is one of the largest studies that provides valuable insight into the efficacy and tolerability of FCR as a therapeutic option for patients with relapsed CLL.",1,1,1,1
25843292,"Cytokine induced killer cell-based immunotherapies in patients with different stages of renal cell carcinoma.Cytokine induced killer (CIK) cell-based treatments have shown antitumor activity against renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in vitro and in vivo. But the therapeutic options and benefits of various CIK cells were unknown for different stages of RCC.In this random clinical trial, the 3-year disease free survival (DFS) of operable RCC patients treated with autologous tumor lysate-pulsed dendritic cells co-cultured with cytokine induced killer (Ag-DC-CIK) was 96.7% compared with 57.7% in the control group.Ag-DC-CIK immunotherapy decreased the risk of post-operative disease progression and relapse (P = 0.0418).In inoperable RCC patients treated with CIK, the 3-year overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were significantly longer than the control group (P = 0.0116 and P = 0.0212).The CD4(+)/CD8(+) T cell ratio in peripheral blood increased after the last cell infusion in the CIK treatment group, and especially further increased in the Ag-DC-CIK treatment group (P = 0.002).No severe toxicity was observed after infusion of CIK cells.Therefore, tumor antigen-sensitized Ag-DC-CIK cells might be more efficient and personalized for the patients with tumor resection, and CIK cells could improve the prognosis for those inoperable patients.According to the stages of RCC patients, different CIK cell-based immunotherapies would help to achieve more beneficial effects.",1,1,1,1
23355041,"A randomized phase II study of gemcitabine and S-1 combination therapy versus gemcitabine monotherapy for advanced biliary tract cancer.PURPOSE: In order to confirm the impact of adding S-1 to gemcitabine, we conducted a randomized phase II study to compare the combination therapy of gemcitabine plus S-1 to gemcitabine monotherapy in patients with advanced biliary tract cancer.METHODS: Sixty-two patients with advanced cholangiocarcinoma or gallbladder cancer were randomized to either the combination therapy of gemcitabine and S-1 (gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 15 and S-1 40 mg/m(2) b.i.d.on days 1-14, repeated every 4 weeks) or gemcitabine monotherapy (gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m(2) on days 1, 8, and 15, repeated every 4 weeks).The primary endpoint of this study was response rate, and the regimen which showed the better response rate was selected as a candidate of phase III study.Tumor response was assessed every two cycles using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria version 1.0.RESULTS: The response rates of the combination therapy and the monotherapy were 20.0 and 9.4 %, respectively.The median time-to-progressions and overall survivals of these two treatments were nearly the same (5.6 vs. 4.3 months; 8.9 vs. 9.2 months).Adverse events occurred more frequently in the combination arm.CONCLUSIONS: The combination therapy of gemcitabine and S-1 showed the better response rate, but the superiority of this combination therapy was not clear in total.Because the standard of care changed to the combination therapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin during this study, it is difficult to select this combination therapy with a 4-week regimen as a candidate of phase III study.",1,1,1,1
33002438,"Adjuvant radiotherapy versus early salvage radiotherapy plus short-term androgen deprivation therapy in men with localised prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy (GETUG-AFU 17): a randomised, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Adjuvant radiotherapy reduces the risk of biochemical progression in prostate cancer patients after radical prostatectomy.We aimed to compare adjuvant versus early salvage radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy, combined with short-term hormonal therapy, in terms of oncological outcomes and tolerance.METHODS: GETUG-AFU 17 was a randomised, open-label, multicentre, phase 3 trial done at 46 French hospitals.Men aged at least 18 years who had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 1 or less, localised adenocarcinoma of the prostate treated with radical prostatectomy, who had pathologically-staged pT3a, pT3b, or pT4a (with bladder neck invasion), pNx (without pelvic lymph nodes dissection), or pN0 (with negative lymph nodes dissection) disease, and who had positive surgical margins were eligible for inclusion in the study.Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to either immediate adjuvant radiotherapy or delayed salvage radiotherapy at the time of biochemical relapse.Random assignment, by minimisation, was done using web-based software and stratified by Gleason score, pT stage, and centre.All patients received 6 months of triptorelin (intramuscular injection every 3 months).The primary endpoint was event-free survival.Efficacy and safety analyses were done on the intention-to-treat population.The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00667069.FINDINGS: Between March 7, 2008, and June 23, 2016, 424 patients were enrolled.We planned to enrol 718 patients, with 359 in each study group.However, on May 20, 2016, the independent data monitoring committee recommended early termination of enrolment because of unexpectedly low event rates.At database lock on Dec 19, 2019, the overall median follow-up time from random assignment was 75 months (IQR 50-100), 74 months (47-100) in the adjuvant radiotherapy group and 78 months (52-101) in the salvage radiotherapy group.In the salvage radiotherapy group, 115 (54%) of 212 patients initiated study treatment after biochemical relapse.205 (97%) of 212 patients started treatment in the adjuvant group.5-year event-free survival was 92% (95% CI 86-95) in the adjuvant radiotherapy group and 90% (85-94) in the salvage radiotherapy group (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.48-1.36; log-rank p=0.42).Acute grade 3 or worse toxic effects occurred in six (3%) of 212 patients in the adjuvant radiotherapy group and in four (2%) of 212 patients in the salvage radiotherapy group.Late grade 2 or worse genitourinary toxicities were reported in 125 (59%) of 212 patients in the adjuvant radiotherapy group and 46 (22%) of 212 patients in the salvage radiotherapy group.Late genitourinary adverse events of grade 2 or worse were reported in 58 (27%) of 212 patients in the adjuvant radiotherapy group versus 14 (7%) of 212 patients in the salvage radiotherapy group (p<0.0001).Late erectile dysfunction was grade 2 or worse in 60 (28%) of 212 in the adjuvant radiotherapy group and 17 (8%) of 212 in the salvage radiotherapy group (p<0.0001).INTERPRETATION: Although our analysis lacked statistical power, we found no benefit for event-free survival in patients assigned to adjuvant radiotherapy compared with patients assigned to salvage radiotherapy.Adjuvant radiotherapy increased the risk of genitourinary toxicity and erectile dysfunction.A policy of early salvage radiotherapy could spare men from overtreatment with radiotherapy and the associated adverse events.FUNDING: French Health Ministry and Ipsen.",0,0,0,0
34597375,"Role of radiotherapy to bulky sites of advanced Hodgkin lymphoma treated with ABVD: final results of FIL HD0801 trial.The role of consolidation radiotherapy (RT) for bulky lesions is controversial in patients with advanced-stage Hodgkin lymphoma who achieve complete metabolic response (CMR) after doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine (ABVD)-based chemotherapy.We present the final results of the Fondazione Italiana Linfomi HD0801 trial, which investigated the potential benefit of RT in that setting.In this phase 3 randomized study, patients with a bulky lesion at baseline (a mass with largest diameter >/=5 cm) who have CMR after 2 and 6 ABVD cycles were randomly assigned 1:1 to RT vs observation (OBS) with a primary endpoint of event-free survival (EFS) at 2 years.The sample size was calculated estimating an EFS improvement for RT of 20% (from 60% to 80%).The secondary end point was progression-free survival (PFS).One hundred sixteen patients met the inclusion criteria and were randomly assigned to RT or OBS.Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis showed a 2-year EFS of 87.8% vs 85.8% for RT vs OBS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.6-3.5; P = .34).At 2 years, ITT-PFS was 91.3% vs 85.8% (HR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.5-3; P = .7).Patients in CMR randomly assigned to OBS had a good outcome, and the primary end point of a 20% benefit in EFS for RT was not met.However, the sample size was underpowered to detect a benefit of 10% or less, keeping open the question of a potential, more limited role of RT in this setting.This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00784537.",0,0,0,0

31400480,"Effect of a high-intensity interval training on serum microRNA levels in women with breast cancer undergoing hormone therapy. A single-blind randomized trial.BACKGROUND: The role of microRNAs (miRs) in hormone therapy (HT) is of keen interest in developing biomarkers and treatments for individuals with breast cancer.Although miRs are often moderate regulators under homeostatic conditions, their function is changed more in response to physical activity.OBJECTIVE: This single-blind randomized trial aimed to explore the effect of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on serum levels of miRs in individuals with early-stage breast cancer undergoing HT.METHODS: Hormone receptor-positive women with breast cancer and healthy women were randomly assigned to a healthy control group (n=15), healthy group with HIIT (n=15), breast cancer group with HT (HT, n=26), and breast cancer group with HT and HIIT (HT+HIIT, n=26).The exercise groups underwent interval uphill walking training on a treadmill 3 times a week for 12weeks.At the end of the study, we analyzed changes in levels of cancer-related miRs (oncomiRs) and tumour suppressor miRs (TSmiRs) in response to the HT and HIIT.RESULTS: In women with breast cancer versus healthy controls, the expression of some oncomiRs was significantly increased - miR-21 (P<0.001), miR-155 (P=0.001), miR-221 (P=0.008), miR-27a (P<0.001), and miR-10b (P=0.007) - and that of some TSmiRs was significantly decreased - miR-206 (P=0.048), miR-145 (P=0.011), miR-143 (P=0.008), miR-9 (P=0.020), and let-7a (P=0.005).Moreover, HT considerably downregulated oncomiRs and upregulated TSmiRs.HIIT for 12weeks with HT significantly decreased the expression of the oncomiRs and significantly increased that of the TSmiRs as compared with HT alone.CONCLUSIONS: HITT could amplify the decrease and/or increase in expression of miRs associated with HT in women with breast cancer.A prospective trial could determine whether the use of circulating miRs for monitoring treatment can be useful in therapy decisions.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (No.: IRCT201202289171N1).",1,1,0,0
32975708,"Randomized phase II clinical trial and biomarker analysis of paclitaxel plus epirubicin versus vinorelbine plus epirubicin as neoadjuvant chemotherapy in locally advanced HER2-negative breast cancer with TEKT4 variations.PURPOSE: Resistance to paclitaxel remains a major challenge in treating breast cancer.Our preclinical study suggested that TEKT4 germline variations in breast cancer are associated with paclitaxel resistance and increase vinorelbine sensitivity.This clinical trial compared the efficacy of paclitaxel and vinorelbine in breast cancer neoadjuvant chemotherapy.METHODS: In this open-label, single-center, phase II trial, female patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, stage IIB-IIIC breast cancer harboring TEKT4 germline variations were randomly assigned to the paclitaxel plus epirubicin (PE) or vinorelbine plus epirubicin (NE).The primary endpoint was the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate, and the secondary endpoints were the objective response rate (ORR) and safety.Targeted sequencing of a panel comprising 484 breast-related genes was performed to identify pCR-associated somatic mutations in each group.RESULTS: 91 Patients were assigned to PE (46 patients) or NE (45 patients).NE numerically increased the pCR rate (22.2% versus 8.7%, P = 0.074).The ORRs for NE and PE were 82.2% and 76.1%, respectively.Interestingly, NE (15.4%) showed a significantly higher pCR rate than PE (0%) in the hormone receptor (HR)-positive subgroup (P = 0.044).Both regimens were well tolerated, with grade 3 and 4 toxicities reported at the expected levels.The biomarker analysis showed that UNC13D mutation predicted the pCR rate in NE (P = 0.011).CONCLUSIONS: Although the primary endpoint was not met, NE might bring clinical benefit to HR-positive patients or patients simultaneously carrying UNC13D mutations.",1,1,1,1
23850170,"Which patients benefit most from primary surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy in stage IIIC or IV ovarian cancer? An exploratory analysis of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer 55971 randomised trial.BACKGROUND: To investigate whether biomarkers consisting of baseline characteristics of advanced stage ovarian cancer patients can help in identifying subgroups of patients who would benefit more from primary surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy.METHODS: We used data of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 55971 trial in which 670 patients were randomly assigned to primary surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy.The primary outcome was overall survival.Ten baseline clinical and pathological characteristics were selected as potential biomarkers.Using Subpopulation Treatment Effect Pattern Plots (STEPP), biomarkers with a statistically significant qualitative additive interaction with treatment were considered as potentially informative for treatment selection.We also combined selected biomarkers to form a multimarker treatment selection rule.FINDINGS: The size of the largest metastatic tumour and clinical stage were significantly associated with the magnitude of the benefit from treatment, in terms of five-year survival (p for interaction: 0.008 and 0.016, respectively).Stage IIIC patients with metastatic tumours 45 mm benefited more from primary surgery while stage IV patients with metastatic tumours >45 mm benefited more from neoadjuvant chemotherapy.In stage IIIC patients with larger metastatic tumours and in stage IV patients with less extensive metastatic tumours both treatments were equally effective.We estimated that by selecting treatments for patients based on largest metastatic tumour and clinical stage, the potential five-year survival rate in the population of treated patients would be 27.3% (95% confidence interval (CI) 21.9-33.0), 7.8% higher than if all were treated with primary surgery, and 5.6% higher if all were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.INTERPRETATION: Although survival was comparable after primary surgery and neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the overall group of patients with ovarian cancer in the EORTC 55971 trial, we found in this exploratory analysis that patients with stage IIIC and less extensive metastatic tumours had higher survival with primary surgery, while patients with stage IV disease and large metastatic tumours had higher survival with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.For patients who did not meet these criteria, both treatment options led to comparable survival rates.",1,1,1,1
29648580,"Bevacizumab plus hypofractionated radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone in elderly patients with glioblastoma: the randomized, open-label, phase II ARTE trial.Background: The addition of bevacizumab to temozolomide-based chemoradiotherapy (TMZ/RT --> TMZ) did not prolong overall survival (OS) in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma in phase III trials.Elderly and frail patients are underrepresented in clinical trials, but early reports suggested preferential benefit in this population.Patients and methods: ARTE was a 2 : 1 randomized, multi-center, open-label, non-comparative phase II trial of hypofractionated RT (40 Gy in 15 fractions) with bevacizumab (10 mg/kgx14 days) (arm A, N = 50) or without bevacizumab (arm B, N = 25) in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma aged >/=65 years.The primary objective was to obtain evidence for prolongation of median OS by the addition of bevacizumab to RT.Response was assessed by RANO criteria.Quality of life (QoL) was monitored by the EORTC QLQ-C30/BN20 modules.Exploratory studies included molecular subtyping by 450k whole methylome and gene expression analyses.Results: Median PFS was longer in arm A than in arm B (7.6 and 4.8 months, P = 0.003), but OS was similar (12.1 and 12.2 months, P = 0.77).Clinical deterioration was delayed and more patients came off steroids in arm A. Prolonged PFS in arm A was confined to tumors with the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) I methylation subtype (HR 0.25, P = 0.014) and proneural gene expression (HR 0.29, P = 0.025).In a Cox model of OS controlling for established prognostic factors, associations with more favorable outcome were identified for age <70 years (HR 0.52, P = 0.018) and Karnofsky performance score 90%-100% (HR 0.51, P = 0.026).Including molecular subtypes into that model identified an association of the RTK II gene methylation subtype with inferior OS (HR 1.73, P = 0.076).Conclusion: Efficacy outcomes and exploratory analyses of ARTE do not support the hypothesis that the addition of bevacizumab to RT generally prolongs survival in elderly glioblastoma patients.Molecular biomarkers may identify patients with preferential benefit from bevacizumab.Clinical trial registration number: NCT01443676.",1,1,1,1

23653366,"Single-port access compared with three-port laparoscopic adnexal surgery in a randomized controlled trial.OBJECTIVE: Scar-related cosmetic outcomes were compared prospectively between conventional three-port and single-port access laparoscopic adnexal gynaecological surgery.METHODS: Enrolled patients were randomly assigned to a single- or three-port surgery group.Scar-related outcomes were evaluated at 1 month, 6 months and 1 year.Scars were assessed by an independent observer using the modified Vancouver Scar Scale (mVSS).All patients were asked about pain related to the scar and scar satisfaction; results were recorded using a numerical rating scale.RESULTS: Seventy-three patients were enrolled between June 2010 and June 2011.Demographic and surgical outcomes did not differ between the groups.mVSS results were similar in the two groups at each follow-up point.The scar satisfaction profile measured at 1 month showed no significant difference between the groups, but the single-port access group had better results than the conventional group at all other follow-up timepoints.CONCLUSION: Cosmetic outcome was better for single-port than for three-port adnexal gynaecological surgery at 6-month and 1-year follow-up.",0,0,0,0
32179448,"Outcomes of metastatic non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas (NRSTS) treated within the BERNIE study: a randomised, phase II study evaluating the addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy.PURPOSE: We analysed the cohort of paediatric patients with metastatic non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas (NRSTS) treated in the BERNIE protocol, i.e. open-label, multicentre, randomised phase II study evaluating the role of bevacizumab (BO20924/ITCC-006; ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00643565).METHODS: Eligible patients were randomised 1:1 to add or not add bevacizumab to nine courses of intensive multi-drug chemotherapy, followed by 12-month maintenance chemotherapy (plus surgery and radiotherapy).The primary end-point was event-free survival (EFS); secondary objectives were objective response rate (ORR) and overall survival (OS).RESULTS: From 2008 and 2013, 49 NRSTS patients (out of 154 cases) were treated, 26 in the standard arm and 23 in the bevacizumab arm.ORR was seen in 10 out of 36 evaluable cases (27.7%), i.e. 4/18 standard arm cases and 6/18 bevacizumab arm cases.Two-year EFS was 27.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 13.9-42.5) for all NRSTS patients, i.e. 34.9% (95% CI 14.6-56.2) for bevacizumab arm and 22.9% (95% CI 7.1-43.9) for standard arm (p-value = 0.19).Three-year OS (median follow-up 48.6 months) was 35.2%, with no differences in the two arms.Time to event and time to death were 16.3 and 17.2 months for bevacizumab arm and 2.1 and 7.6 months for standard arm, respectively.Patients not receiving any local treatment on primary disease had a worse outcome as compared to others.Treatment results were better for patients receiving surgical resection and worse for those who did not receive any specific treatment.CONCLUSION: The addition of the anti-angiogenic agent to the standard chemotherapy did not show statistically significant improvement in survival in metastatic NRSTS.",1,1,1,1
30247524,"The prognostic impact of consensus molecular subtypes (CMS) and its predictive effects for bevacizumab benefit in metastatic colorectal cancer: molecular analysis of the AGITG MAX clinical trial.Background: The consensus molecular subtypes (CMS) is a transcriptome-based classification of colorectal cancer (CRC) initially described in early-stage cohorts, but the associations of CMS with treatment outcomes in the metastatic setting are yet to be established.This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic impact of CMS classification and its predictive effects for bevacizumab benefit in metastatic CRC by correlative analysis of the AGITG MAX trial.Patients and methods: The MAX trial previously reported improved progression-free survival (PFS) for the addition of bevacizumab (B) to chemotherapy [capecitabine (C)+/-mitomycin (M)].Archival primary tumours from 237 patients (50% of trial population) underwent gene expression profiling and classification into CMS groups.CMS groups were correlated to PFS and overall survival (OS).The interaction of CMS with treatment was assessed by proportional hazards model.Results: The distribution of CMS in MAX were CMS1 18%, CMS2 47%, CMS3 12%, CMS4 23%.CMS1 was the predominant subtype in right-sided primary tumours, while CMS2 was the predominant subtype in left-sided.CMS was prognostic of OS (P = 0.008), with CMS2 associated with the best outcome and CMS1 the worst.CMS remained an independent prognostic factor in a multivariate analysis.There was a significant interaction between CMS and treatment (P-interaction = 0.03), for PFS, with hazard ratios (95% CI) for CB+CBM versus C arms in CMS1, 2, 3 and 4: 0.83 (0.43-1.62), 0.50 (0.33-0.76), 0.31 (0.13-0.75) and 1.24 (0.68-2.25), respectively.Conclusions: This exploratory study found that CMS stratified OS outcomes in metastatic CRC regardless of first-line treatment, with prognostic effects of CMS groups distinct from those previously reported in early-stage cohorts.In CMS associations with treatment, CMS2 and possibly CMS3 tumours may preferentially benefit from the addition of bevacizumab to first-line capecitabine-based chemotherapy, compared with other CMS groups.Validation of these findings in additional cohorts is warranted.Clinical trial number: This is a molecular sub-study of MAX clinical trial (NCT00294359).",0,0,0,0

22526159,"A prospective multicenter study of treosulfan in elderly patients with recurrent ovarian cancer: results of a planned safety analysis.BACKGROUND: Treosulfan, an alkylating agent, has demonstrated activity in recurrent ovarian carcinoma.It is equieffective as oral (p.o.) and intravenous (i.v.) formulation.To explore the preference and compliance of elderly patients regarding p.o. or i.v. treosulfan for the treatment of relapsed ovarian carcinoma, women aged 65 years or older were included in this prospective multicenter study.Since elderly patients usually have several concomitant diseases and experience more treatment toxicity, an interim safety analysis was planned and performed after 25 patients finished therapy to assess the tolerability of the treatment regimens.METHODS: Patients had a free choice of treosulfan i.v.(7,000 mg/m(2) day 1 of a 28-day cycle) or p.o. (600 mg/m(2) day 1-28 of a 56-day cycle) for a maximum of 12 cycles (i.v.) or 12 months (p.o.).Indecisive patients were randomized.Toxicity was evaluated according to the NCI-CTC version 2.0.RESULTS: Twenty-five of 51 recruited patients completed therapy at the time of the planned interim analysis (median age, 75 years; range, 70-82).Median ECOG was 1, and median number of prior chemotherapy regimens was 2.A median number of 4 cycles (range, 1-12) were administered per patient.Anemia was the most common hematological toxicity (88 % of patients).Most frequent non-hematological toxicities were nausea (76 %), constipation (68 %), and fatigue (64 %).CONCLUSION: Treatment was generally well tolerated despite the fact that most patients suffered from multiple comorbidities and were heavily pretreated.There were no unexpected hematological or non-hematological toxicities.Based on this safety analysis, the next step of study recruitment was continued.",0,0,0,0
27061082,"Randomized phase III trial of amrubicin/cisplatin versus etoposide/cisplatin as first-line treatment for extensive small-cell lung cancer.BACKGROUND: Extensive-disease small-cell lung cancer (ED-SCLC) is characterized by rapid progression and relapse, despite high initial response rates to chemotherapy.The primary objective of this trial was to demonstrate the non-inferiority of amrubicin and cisplatin (AP) combination therapy compared with the standard first-line regimen of etoposide and cisplatin (EP) for previously untreated ED-SCLC in a Chinese population.When non-inferiority was verified, the objective was switched from non-inferiority to superiority.METHODS: From June 2008 to July 2010, 300 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio to AP and EP groups.AP-treated patients received cisplatin (60 mg/m(2), day 1) and amrubicin (40 mg/m(2), days 1-3) once every 21 days.EP-treated patients received cisplatin (80 mg/m(2), day 1) and etoposide (100 mg/m(2), days 1-3) once every 21 days.Treatment was continued for four to six cycles, except in cases of progressive disease or toxicity, and patient refusal.RESULTS: Median overall survival (OS) for AP vs. EP treatment was 11.8 vs. 10.3 months (p = 0.08), respectively, demonstrating non-inferiority of AP to EP (AP group: 95% confidence interval for hazard ratio 0.63-1.03 months).Median progression-free survival and overall response rates for AP vs. EP groups were 6.8 vs. 5.7 months (p = 0.35) and 69.8% vs. 57.3%, respectively.Drug-related adverse events in both groups were similar, with neutropenia being the most frequent (AP 54.4%; EP 44.0%).Leukopenia, pyrexia, and fatigue were more prevalent in the AP group, but all were clinically reversible and manageable.CONCLUSIONS: AP therapy demonstrated non-inferiority to EP therapy, prolonging OS for 1.5 months, but this difference was not statistically significant; thus we propose AP as a promising treatment option for ED-SCLC in China.TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was registered on 10 April 2008 (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00660504).",1,1,1,1

33581820,"Transdermal oestradiol for androgen suppression in prostate cancer: long-term cardiovascular outcomes from the randomised Prostate Adenocarcinoma Transcutaneous Hormone (PATCH) trial programme.BACKGROUND: Androgen suppression is a central component of prostate cancer management but causes substantial long-term toxicity.Transdermal administration of oestradiol (tE2) circumvents first-pass hepatic metabolism and, therefore, should avoid the cardiovascular toxicity seen with oral oestrogen and the oestrogen-depletion effects seen with luteinising hormone releasing hormone agonists (LHRHa).We present long-term cardiovascular follow-up data from the Prostate Adenocarcinoma Transcutaneous Hormone (PATCH) trial programme.METHODS: PATCH is a seamless phase 2/3, randomised, multicentre trial programme at 52 study sites in the UK.Men with locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer were randomly allocated (1:2 from August, 2007 then 1:1 from February, 2011) to either LHRHa according to local practice or tE2 patches (four 100 mug patches per 24 h, changed twice weekly, reducing to three patches twice weekly if castrate at 4 weeks [defined as testosterone </=1.7 nmol/L]).Randomisation was done using a computer-based minimisation algorithm and was stratified by several factors, including disease stage, age, smoking status, and family history of cardiac disease.The primary outcome of this analysis was cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.Cardiovascular events, including heart failure, acute coronary syndrome, thromboembolic stroke, and other thromboembolic events, were confirmed using predefined criteria and source data.Sudden or unexpected deaths were attributed to a cardiovascular category if a confirmatory post-mortem report was available and as other relevant events if no post-mortem report was available.PATCH is registered with the ISRCTN registry, ISRCTN70406718; the study is ongoing and adaptive.FINDINGS: Between Aug 14, 2007, and July 30, 2019, 1694 men were randomly allocated either LHRHa (n=790) or tE2 patches (n=904).Overall, median follow-up was 3.9 (IQR 2.4-7.0) years.Respective castration rates at 1 month and 3 months were 65% and 93% among patients assigned LHRHa and 83% and 93% among those allocated tE2.157 events from 145 men met predefined cardiovascular criteria, with a further ten sudden deaths with no post-mortem report (total 167 events in 153 men).26 (2%) of 1694 patients had fatal cardiovascular events, 15 (2%) of 790 assigned LHRHa and 11 (1%) of 904 allocated tE2.The time to first cardiovascular event did not differ between treatments (hazard ratio 1.11, 95% CI 0.80-1.53; p=0.54 [including sudden deaths without post-mortem report]; 1.20, 0.86-1.68; p=0.29 [confirmed group only]).30 (34%) of 89 cardiovascular events in patients assigned tE2 occurred more than 3 months after tE2 was stopped or changed to LHRHa.The most frequent adverse events were gynaecomastia (all grades), with 279 (38%) events in 730 patients who received LHRHa versus 690 (86%) in 807 patients who received tE2 (p<0.0001) and hot flushes (all grades) in 628 (86%) of those who received LHRHa versus 280 (35%) who received tE2 (p<0.0001).INTERPRETATION: Long-term data comparing tE2 patches with LHRHa show no evidence of a difference between treatments in cardiovascular mortality or morbidity.Oestrogens administered transdermally should be reconsidered for androgen suppression in the management of prostate cancer.FUNDING: Cancer Research UK, and Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit at University College London.",0,0,0,0
29852043,"Effect of Adjuvant Trastuzumab for a Duration of 9 Weeks vs 1 Year With Concomitant Chemotherapy for Early Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2-Positive Breast Cancer: The SOLD Randomized Clinical Trial.Importance: Trastuzumab plus chemotherapy is the standard adjuvant treatment for patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive early breast cancer.While the standard duration of trastuzumab treatment is 12 months, the benefits and harms of trastuzumab continued beyond the chemotherapy are unclear.Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of adjuvant trastuzumab continued beyond chemotherapy in women treated with up-front chemotherapy containing a taxane and trastuzumab.Design, Setting, and Participants: Open-label, randomized (1:1) clinical trial including women with HER2-positive breast cancer.Chemotherapy was identical in the 2 groups, consisting of 3 cycles of 3-weekly docetaxel (either 80 or 100 mg/m2) plus trastuzumab for 9 weeks, followed by 3 cycles of fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide.Thereafter, no trastuzumab was administered in the 9-week group, whereas controls received trastuzumab to complete 1 year of administration.Disease-free survival (DFS) was compared between the groups using a Cox model and the noninferiority approach.The estimated sample size was 2168 patients (1-sided testing, with a relative noninferiority margin of 1.3).From January 3, 2008, to December 16, 2014, 2176 patients were accrued from 7 countries.Intervention: Docetaxel plus trastuzumab for 9 weeks, followed by 3 cycles of fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide in both groups.Controls continued trastuzumab to 1 year.Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary objective was DFS; secondary objectives included distant disease-free survival, overall survival, cardiac DFS, and safety.Results: In the 2174 women analyzed, median age was 56 (interquartile range [IQR], 48-64) years.The median follow-up was 5.2 (IQR, 3.8-6.7) years.Noninferiority of the 9-week treatment could not be demonstrated for DFS (hazard ratio, 1.39; 2-sided 90% CI, 1.12-1.72).Distant disease-free survival and overall survival did not differ substantially between the groups.Thirty-six (3%) and 21 (2%) patients in the 1-year and the 9-week groups, respectively, had cardiac failure; the left ventricle ejection fraction was better maintained in the 9-week group.An interaction was detected between the docetaxel dose and DFS; patients in the 9-week group treated with 80 mg/m2 had inferior and those treated with 100 mg/m2 had similar DFS as patients in the 1-year group.Conclusions and Relevance: Nine weeks of trastuzumab was not noninferior to 1 year of trastuzumab when given with similar chemotherapy.Cardiac safety was better in the 9-week group.The docetaxel dosing with trastuzumab requires further study.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00593697.",1,1,1,1
31125276,"Palbociclib Plus Letrozole as First-Line Therapy in Postmenopausal Asian Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer: Results From the Phase III, Randomized PALOMA-2 Study.PURPOSE: In PALOMA-2, palbociclib plus letrozole significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) as initial treatment of estrogen receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative advanced breast cancer.We assessed the benefit of palbociclib plus letrozole in Asians.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Of 666 enrolled postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative advanced breast cancer (no prior treatment of advanced disease), 95 were Asian.Patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive palbociclib plus letrozole or placebo plus letrozole.The primary end point was investigator-assessed PFS.Secondary end points were overall survival, objective response, patient-reported outcomes, pharmacokinetics, and safety.RESULTS: Median PFS was significantly longer in Asian patients who received palbociclib plus letrozole versus placebo plus letrozole (25.7 months [95% CI, 19.2 months to not estimable] v 13.9 months [95% CI, 7.4 to 22.0 months]; hazard ratio, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.87; P = .007).The most common toxicities with palbociclib were hematologic and more frequent among Asians versus non-Asians: neutropenia (any grade, 95.4% v 76.8%; grade 3/4, 89.2% v 62.5%), leukopenia (43.1% v 38.3%; 32.3% v 23.5%), and thrombocytopenia (27.7% v 13.5%; 4.6% v 1.1%).No Asians had febrile neutropenia.Discontinuation rates as a result of adverse events were similar among Asian and non-Asian patients who received palbociclib plus letrozole (10.8% and 9.5%).In Asians, quality of life (QOL) was maintained with no significant differences observed between treatments from baseline in breast cancer-specific QOL and general health status scores.Change from baseline in EuroQol five dimensions index scores was significantly higher with palbociclib plus letrozole (0.013 v -0.069; P = .0132).Geometric mean palbociclib trough concentration values were higher in Asians versus non-Asians (93.8 v 61.7 ng/mL).CONCLUSION: Consistent with the overall study population, the addition of palbociclib to letrozole significantly improved PFS in Asians.Hematologic toxicities were more frequent in Asians versus non-Asians but manageable with early dose modifications while maintaining QOL.",1,1,1,1
34551229,"Overall Survival Benefit with Tebentafusp in Metastatic Uveal Melanoma.BACKGROUND: Uveal melanoma is a disease that is distinct from cutaneous melanoma, with a low tumor mutational burden and a 1-year overall survival of approximately 50% in patients with metastatic uveal melanoma.Data showing a proven overall survival benefit with a systemic treatment are lacking.Tebentafusp is a bispecific protein consisting of an affinity-enhanced T-cell receptor fused to an anti-CD3 effector that can redirect T cells to target glycoprotein 100-positive cells.METHODS: In this open-label, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned previously untreated HLA-A*02:01-positive patients with metastatic uveal melanoma in a 2:1 ratio to receive tebentafusp (tebentafusp group) or the investigator's choice of therapy with single-agent pembrolizumab, ipilimumab, or dacarbazine (control group), stratified according to the lactate dehydrogenase level.The primary end point was overall survival.RESULTS: A total of 378 patients were randomly assigned to either the tebentafusp group (252 patients) or the control group (126 patients).Overall survival at 1 year was 73% in the tebentafusp group and 59% in the control group (hazard ratio for death, 0.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.37 to 0.71; P<0.001) in the intention-to-treat population.Progression-free survival was also significantly higher in the tebentafusp group than in the control group (31% vs. 19% at 6 months; hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.94; P = 0.01).The most common treatment-related adverse events in the tebentafusp group were cytokine-mediated events (due to T-cell activation) and skin-related events (due to glycoprotein 100-positive melanocytes), including rash (83%), pyrexia (76%), and pruritus (69%).These adverse events decreased in incidence and severity after the first three or four doses and infrequently led to discontinuation of the trial treatment (2%).No treatment-related deaths were reported.CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with tebentafusp resulted in longer overall survival than the control therapy among previously untreated patients with metastatic uveal melanoma.(Funded by Immunocore; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03070392; EudraCT number, 2015-003153-18.).",1,1,1,1
31560068,"Addition of docetaxel to hormonal therapy in low- and high-burden metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer: long-term survival results from the STAMPEDE trial.BACKGROUND: STAMPEDE has previously reported that the use of upfront docetaxel improved overall survival (OS) for metastatic hormone naive prostate cancer patients starting long-term androgen deprivation therapy.We report on long-term outcomes stratified by metastatic burden for M1 patients.METHODS: We randomly allocated patients in 2 : 1 ratio to standard-of-care (SOC; control group) or SOC + docetaxel.Metastatic disease burden was categorised using retrospectively-collected baseline staging scans where available.Analysis used Cox regression models, adjusted for stratification factors, with emphasis on restricted mean survival time where hazards were non-proportional.RESULTS: Between 05 October 2005 and 31 March 2013, 1086 M1 patients were randomised to receive SOC (n = 724) or SOC + docetaxel (n = 362).Metastatic burden was assessable for 830/1086 (76%) patients; 362 (44%) had low and 468 (56%) high metastatic burden.Median follow-up was 78.2 months.There were 494 deaths on SOC (41% more than the previous report).There was good evidence of benefit of docetaxel over SOC on OS (HR = 0.81, 95% CI 0.69-0.95, P = 0.009) with no evidence of heterogeneity of docetaxel effect between metastatic burden sub-groups (interaction P = 0.827).Analysis of other outcomes found evidence of benefit for docetaxel over SOC in failure-free survival (HR = 0.66, 95% CI 0.57-0.76, P < 0.001) and progression-free survival (HR = 0.69, 95% CI 0.59-0.81, P < 0.001) with no evidence of heterogeneity of docetaxel effect between metastatic burden sub-groups (interaction P > 0.5 in each case).There was no evidence that docetaxel resulted in late toxicity compared with SOC: after 1 year, G3-5 toxicity was reported for 28% SOC and 27% docetaxel (in patients still on follow-up at 1 year without prior progression).CONCLUSIONS: The clinically significant benefit in survival for upfront docetaxel persists at longer follow-up, with no evidence that benefit differed by metastatic burden.We advocate that upfront docetaxel is considered for metastatic hormone naive prostate cancer patients regardless of metastatic burden.",1,1,1,1
30705033,"Randomized study of imatinib for chronic myeloid leukemia: comparing standard dose escalation with aggressive escalation.In 2007, we conducted a prospective randomized study to compare an aggressive dose escalation (group B, n = 123) with the standard dose escalation proposed by European LeukemiaNet (group A, n = 122).In group B, if patients did not achieve a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) at 3 months or did not achieve a major molecular response (MR3) at 6 months, imatinib was increased to 600 mg.At 6 months CCyR was achieved in 69.4% and 78.7% of patients in groups A and B, respectively.The rate of MR3 at 12 months and 24 months were similar in group A (52.1% and 70.0%) and group B (58.7% and 68.3%).The cumulative incidence of withdrawal by failure without accelerated/blast phase was higher in group A than in group B (9.2% vs 2.5% at 24 months).At 3 and 6 months, the protocol called for the imatinib dose to increase to 600 mg in 90 patients (74.4%) in group B. Among the 42 patients who received increased dose according to the protocol, 25 (60.0%) achieved MR3 at 12 months, whereas only 14 (35.0%) of 40 patients who did not receive an increased dose achieved MR3 (P < .05).The number of patients who withdrew from this study was similar (group A, 20%; group B, 21%).The early aggressive dose escalation failed to produce a better molecular response at 12 months.However, for patients who tolerate imatinib well, but show inadequate response at an early time point, aggressive dose escalation may contribute to achieving a better outcome.This study was registered at http://www.umin.ac.jp/ctr/ as #R000000965.",1,1,1,1

26175059,"Effect of weight loss on bone health in overweight/obese postmenopausal breast cancer survivors.Current guidelines recommend weight loss in obese cancer survivors.Weight loss, however, has adverse effects on bone health in obese individuals without cancer but this has not been evaluated in breast cancer survivors.We investigated the associations of intentional weight loss with bone mineral density (BMD) and bone turn-over markers in overweight/obese postmenopausal breast cancer survivors.Participants were overweight/obese breast cancer survivors (N = 81) with stage I, II or IIIA disease enrolled in the St. Louis site of a multi-site Exercise and Nutrition to Enhance Recovery and Good health for You (ENERGY) study; a randomized-controlled clinical trial designed to achieve a sustained >/=7 % loss in body weight at 2 years.Weight loss was achieved through dietary modification with the addition of physical activity.Generalized estimating equations were used to assess differences in mean values between follow-up and baseline.Mean weight decreased by 3 and 2.3 % between baseline and 6-month follow-up, and 12-month follow-up, respectively.There were decreases in osteocalcin (10.6 %, p value < 0.001), PINP (14.5 %, p value < 0.001), NTx (19.2 % p value < 0.001), and RANK (48.5 %, p value < 0.001), but not BALP and CTX-1 levels between baseline and 12-month follow-up.No significant changes occurred in mean T-scores, pelvis and lumbar spine BMD between baseline and 12-month follow-up.A 2.3 % weight loss over 12 months among overweight/obese women with early-stage breast cancer does not appear to have deleterious effect on bone health, and might even have beneficial effect.These findings warrant confirmation, particularly among breast cancer survivors with a larger magnitude of weight loss.",0,0,0,0
24076063,"Neoadjuvant treatment of endometrial cancer using anastrozole: a randomised pilot study.OBJECTIVE: Excessive oestrogenic stimulation is a well-known risk factor for the development and progression of endometrial cancer.Aromatase is the key enzyme which catalyses the conversion of androgens to oestrogens in postmenopausal women.Inhibition of aromatase may therefore be a useful strategy in the management of endometrial cancer.A pilot study was designed to assess the feasibility of a neoadjuvant model and understand the biological effects of anastrozole, an aromatase inhibitor, in the treatment of endometrial cancer.METHODS: Patients with endometrial cancer who consented to participate in the study were randomised to receive anastrozole or placebo for a minimum of 14 days prior to definitive surgery.Endometrial samples were obtained before and after treatment.Immunohistochemistry was performed to ascertain the expression of oestrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha), progesterone receptor (PR), androgen receptor (AR), ki-67 and Bcl2 before and after treatment in glands and stroma of the endometrium.RESULTS: A total of 16 patients were randomised to the anastrozole arm and 8 to the placebo arm (2:1 randomisation).A significant decrease in the glandular expression of ERalpha and AR was observed in the anastrozole arm.There was no significant change in the expression of PR or Bcl2.Expression of ki-67, a proliferation marker, also decreased significantly following treatment with anastrozole.CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with anastrozole caused a significant decrease in proliferation as demonstrated by decreased ki-67 expression.A large randomised controlled trial is warranted to fully assess the role of anastrozole in the neoadjuvant treatment of endometrial cancer.",1,1,1,1
28891398,"Geometric analysis of loco-regional recurrences in relation to pre-treatment hypoxia in patients with head and neck cancer.INTRODUCTION: A previous pattern-of-failure study has suggested that up to 50% of the loco-regional failures (LRF) in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) occur outside the initial hypoxic volume determined by [(18)F]-fluoromisonidazole-PET ([(18)F]-FMISO-PET).The aim of the present analysis was to correlate spatial patterns of failure with respect to the pretherapeutic dynamic [(18)F]-FMISO-PET/CT in HNSCC after radiochemotherapy (RCT).MATERIAL AND METHODS: Within a running phase 2 trial using [(18)F]-FMISO-PET imaging prior to RCT in HNSCC patients (n = 54), we have observed so far 11 LRF with a minimum follow-up of 12 months.For nine patients, LRF imaging (CT or [(18)F]-FDG-PET/CT) for pattern-of-failure analysis was available.Analysis included the static 4-h hypoxic subvolume (VH) as well as a M-parameter volume (VM), which is derived from modeling of dynamic PET.Deformable image registration of the CT scan with the recurrent tumor to the pre-treatment [(18)F]-FMISO-PET/CT and the planning CT was done to quantify the hypoxic subvolumes compared to the recurrent tumor volume.Moreover, a point-of-origin analysis was performed.RESULTS: A total of five local, two regional and two loco-regional recurrences were detected.After deformable image registration of the CT scan with the recurrent tumor to the pre-treatment [(18)F]-FMISO-PET/CT and the planning CT, a significant overlap of the recurrence volume with [(18)F]-FMISO-positive subvolumes in the initial gross tumor volume (GTV) was observed.Median overlap of 40.2%, range 9.4-100.0%, for VH and 49.0%, range 4.4-96.4%, for VM was calculated.The point-of-origin analysis showed median distances of 0.0 mm, range 0.0-11.3 mm to VH and 8.6 mm, range 0.0-15.5 mm to VM, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that loco-regional recurrences after RCT originate from the initial GTV (primary tumor and/or lymph node metastases) containing hypoxic subvolumes, which supports the concept of hypoxia imaging-based dose escalation.",0,0,0,0

Two-Year Results from a Prospective Randomized Trial in Breast Cancer Survivors.BACKGROUND: In a previous randomized controlled trial it has been demonstrated that arm compression sleeves worn immediately after breast cancer surgery, including axillary lymph node removal in addition to physical therapy are able to reduce the occurrence of early postoperative swelling and of arm lymphedema up to 1 year and to improve quality of life.The aim of the present investigation was to check the further development of the arm swelling in patients using compression sleeves or not, and to compare the quality of life in women treated due to breast cancer 2 years after surgery.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty from originally 23 patients who still wore their compression sleeves (15 mmHg) and 21 from 22 patients who had been randomized into the control group without compression could be seen after one more year.Arm volume measurements were performed and quality of life (QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23 questionnaires) was assessed.RESULTS: Three from 20 patients in the compression group (CG) and 6 from 21 without compression showed arm lymphedema, defined by an increase of the arm volume exceeding 10% compared with the preoperative values.Significant improvement of several quality of life parameters were found in the CG.CONCLUSION: Light compression sleeves worn for 2 years are not only able to reduce the incidence of early postoperative edema and of lymphedema, but also lead to a significant improvement of important quality-of-life parameters like physical functioning, fatigue, pain, arm and breast symptoms, and future perspectives.",0,0,0,0
26686313,"Anastrozole versus tamoxifen for the prevention of locoregional and contralateral breast cancer in postmenopausal women with locally excised ductal carcinoma in situ (IBIS-II DCIS): a double-blind, randomised controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Third-generation aromatase inhibitors are more effective than tamoxifen for preventing recurrence in postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive invasive breast cancer.However, it is not known whether anastrozole is more effective than tamoxifen for women with hormone-receptor-positive ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).Here, we compare the efficacy of anastrozole with that of tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive DCIS.METHODS: In a double-blind, multicentre, randomised placebo-controlled trial, we recruited women who had been diagnosed with locally excised, hormone-receptor-positive DCIS.Eligible women were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio by central computer allocation to receive 1 mg oral anastrozole or 20 mg oral tamoxifen every day for 5 years.Randomisation was stratified by major centre or hub and was done in blocks (six, eight, or ten).All trial personnel, participants, and clinicians were masked to treatment allocation and only the trial statistician had access to treatment allocation.The primary endpoint was all recurrence, including recurrent DCIS and new contralateral tumours.All analyses were done on a modified intention-to-treat basis (in all women who were randomised and did not revoke consent for their data to be included) and proportional hazard models were used to compute hazard ratios and corresponding confidence intervals.This trial is registered at the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN37546358.RESULTS: Between March 3, 2003, and Feb 8, 2012, we enrolled 2980 postmenopausal women from 236 centres in 14 countries and randomly assigned them to receive anastrozole (1449 analysed) or tamoxifen (1489 analysed).Median follow-up was 7.2 years (IQR 5.6-8.9), and 144 breast cancer recurrences were recorded.We noted no statistically significant difference in overall recurrence (67 recurrences for anastrozole vs 77 for tamoxifen; HR 0.89 [95% CI 0.64-1.23]).The non-inferiority of anastrozole was established (upper 95% CI <1.25), but its superiority to tamoxifen was not (p=0.49).A total of 69 deaths were recorded (33 for anastrozole vs 36 for tamoxifen; HR 0.93 [95% CI 0.58-1.50], p=0.78), and no specific cause was more common in one group than the other.The number of women reporting any adverse event was similar between anastrozole (1323 women, 91%) and tamoxifen (1379 women, 93%); the side-effect profiles of the two drugs differed, with more fractures, musculoskeletal events, hypercholesterolaemia, and strokes with anastrozole and more muscle spasm, gynaecological cancers and symptoms, vasomotor symptoms, and deep vein thromboses with tamoxifen.CONCLUSIONS: No clear efficacy differences were seen between the two treatments.Anastrozole offers another treatment option for postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive DCIS, which may be be more appropriate for some women with contraindications for tamoxifen.Longer follow-up will be necessary to fully evaluate treatment differences.FUNDING: Cancer Research UK, National Health and Medical Research Council Australia, Breast Cancer Research Fund, AstraZeneca, Sanofi Aventis.",1,1,1,1

27743738,"Impact of histology and surgical approach on survival among women with early-stage, high-grade uterine cancer: An NRG Oncology/Gynecologic Oncology Group ancillary analysis.OBJECTIVES: We sought to analyze the clinicopathologic features, recurrence patterns and survival outcomes of women with high-grade uterine cancer (UC) enrolled on The Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) LAP2 trial.METHODS: This is a post-hoc analysis of LAP-2 patients with grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma (ENDO), uterine serous (USC), clear cell (CC) and carcinosarcoma (CS).Demographics, clinicopathologic features, and recurrence patterns, were compared by histology and surgical approach.Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.RESULTS: Of the 2600 patients enrolled in LAP-2, 753 patients had high-grade UC: 350 had ENDO, 289 had USC, 42 had CC and 72 had CS.Compared with the ENDO cohort, those with other high-grade subtypes were older (p<0.001) and were more likely to have positive peritoneal cytology (p<0.001), positive lymph nodes (p=0.05) and higher disease stage on final pathology (p<0.001).With a median follow-up time of 60months, compared to patients with ENDO, those with USC, CCC and CS subtypes had higher recurrence rates (p<0.001), extra-pelvic recurrences (p<0.001) and poorer PFS (p<0.001) and OS (p<0.001).Those diagnosed with USC and CS experienced the worst survival outcomes (p=0.003).Patterns of recurrence and survival were not different in those staged with LSC vs LAP.On multivariable analysis, age, stage, pelvic washings and Type II histology were independently and adversely associated with survival.CONCLUSIONS: Women with apparent early-stage, USC and CS histologies have poorer outcomes than women with grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma.Patterns of recurrence and survival were not impacted by surgical approach.",0,0,0,0
30762141,"Effects of live music during chemotherapy in lymphoma patients: a randomized, controlled, multi-center trial.PURPOSE: Chemotherapy is associated with both somatic and psychological side effects.Music might ease these problems.Several randomized controlled trials have investigated the effect of music, but the results are inconclusive.We aimed to examine whether live or pre-recorded music listening decreases anxiety during chemotherapy in newly diagnosed lymphoma patients.METHODS: A total of 143 patients with non-Hodgkin and Hodgkin lymphomas were randomly assigned into three groups receiving either 30 min of patient-preferred live music (n = 47), 30 min of patient-preferred pre-recorded music (n = 47), or standard care (n = 49) during up to five outpatient chemotherapy sessions.The primary endpoint was anxiety measured by the Spielberger's State Anxiety Inventory.Secondary endpoints included blood pressure, pulse rate, nausea and vomiting, serum catecholamine levels pre- and post-intervention to measure arousal levels, and health-related quality of life.The Musical Ability Test was used to link musical ability to the primary endpoint.RESULTS: When adjusting for age, sex, diagnosis, number of sessions, and baseline anxiety, the linear mixed model showed a borderline statistically significant reduction in the primary outcome anxiety in the live music group compared to standard care (7% (95% CI, - 14% to 0%, p = 0.05), while the effect of pre-recorded music was non-significant (5% (95% CI, - 12% to + 3%, p = 0.18).No intervention effects were seen in secondary outcomes.CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that patient-preferred live music reduces anxiety among patients with malignant lymphomas undergoing chemotherapy.Musical ability among this group of cancer patients seems not to be a determining factor for effect of music intervention.",0,0,0,0

Investigator-assessed median progression-free survival was 9.2 months (95% CI, 7.4 to 15.6) and 12.9 months (95% CI, 11.1 to not reached) in arms A and B, respectively.Independent review committee-assessed intracranial ORR in patients with measurable brain metastases at baseline was 42% (11 of 26 patients) in arm A and 67% (12 of 18 patients) in arm B. Common treatment-emergent adverse events were nausea (arm A/B, 33%/40%), diarrhea (arm A/B, 19%/38%), headache (arm A/B, 28%/27%), and cough (arm A/B, 18%/34%), and were mainly grades 1 to 2.A subset of pulmonary adverse events with early onset (median onset: day 2) occurred in 14 of 219 treated patients (all grades, 6%; grade >/= 3, 3%); none occurred after escalation to 180 mg in arm B.

28056902,"An objective and cross-sectional examination of sun-safe behaviours in New South Wales primary schools.BACKGROUND: Previous evaluations have supported the link between sun protection policies and improved sun protection behaviours.However these evaluations have relied on self-reported data.METHODS: A cross-sectional design as part of an ongoing 18-month cluster-controlled trial in primary schools (n = 20) was used.Researchers conducted direct observations to record students' hat use and teachers' use of sun protective measures during recess and lunch.Researchers also recorded the volume of sunscreen consumed in each school.RESULTS: Only 60% of primary school children wear a sun-safe hat during their breaks when observed using objective measures.Weak correlations were observed between the wearing of a sun-safe hat and a school's socio-economic status (r = 0.26).All other independent variables measured had only very weak correlations (r < 0.19) with sun-safe hat wearing behaviour of students.Sunscreen consumption by school students during the school day is negligible.CONCLUSIONS: A large percentage of NSW primary schools in this study wear sun-safe hats during the school day but this is well below what has been reported in previous national surveys.Given the finite resources of schools and the correlation, though small, with SES status for these behaviours, it behoves researchers to investigate low-cost solutions to these problems.Further qualitative data will also be needed to inform the enablers and barriers for sun-safe behaviour interventions to be adopted in NSW primary schools.",0,0,0,0
24076063,"Neoadjuvant treatment of endometrial cancer using anastrozole: a randomised pilot study.OBJECTIVE: Excessive oestrogenic stimulation is a well-known risk factor for the development and progression of endometrial cancer.Aromatase is the key enzyme which catalyses the conversion of androgens to oestrogens in postmenopausal women.Inhibition of aromatase may therefore be a useful strategy in the management of endometrial cancer.A pilot study was designed to assess the feasibility of a neoadjuvant model and understand the biological effects of anastrozole, an aromatase inhibitor, in the treatment of endometrial cancer.METHODS: Patients with endometrial cancer who consented to participate in the study were randomised to receive anastrozole or placebo for a minimum of 14 days prior to definitive surgery.Endometrial samples were obtained before and after treatment.Immunohistochemistry was performed to ascertain the expression of oestrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha), progesterone receptor (PR), androgen receptor (AR), ki-67 and Bcl2 before and after treatment in glands and stroma of the endometrium.RESULTS: A total of 16 patients were randomised to the anastrozole arm and 8 to the placebo arm (2:1 randomisation).A significant decrease in the glandular expression of ERalpha and AR was observed in the anastrozole arm.There was no significant change in the expression of PR or Bcl2.Expression of ki-67, a proliferation marker, also decreased significantly following treatment with anastrozole.CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with anastrozole caused a significant decrease in proliferation as demonstrated by decreased ki-67 expression.A large randomised controlled trial is warranted to fully assess the role of anastrozole in the neoadjuvant treatment of endometrial cancer.",1,1,1,1

27795558,"Expression of CD33 is a predictive factor for effect of gemtuzumab ozogamicin at different doses in adult acute myeloid leukaemia.It remains unclear in adult acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) whether leukaemic expression of CD33, the target antigen for gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO), adds prognostic information on GO effectiveness at different doses.CD33 expression quantified in 1583 patients recruited to UK-NCRI-AML17 (younger adults) and UK-NCRI-AML16 (older adults) trials was correlated with clinical outcomes and benefit from GO including a dose randomisation.CD33 expression associated with genetic subgroups, including lower levels in both adverse karyotype and core-binding factor (CBF)-AML, but was not independently prognostic.When comparing GO versus no GO (n=393, CBF-AMLs excluded) by stratified subgroup-adjusted analysis, patients with lowest quartile (Q1) %CD33-positivity had no benefit from GO (relapse risk, HR 2.41 (1.27-4.56), P=0.009 for trend; overall survival, HR 1.52 (0.92-2.52)).However, from the dose randomisation (NCRI-AML17, n=464, CBF-AMLs included), 6 mg/m(2) GO only had a relapse benefit without increased early mortality in CD33-low (Q1) patients (relapse risk HR 0.64 (0.36-1.12) versus 1.70 (0.99-2.92) for CD33-high, P=0.007 for trend).Thus CD33 expression is a predictive factor for GO effect in adult AML; although GO does not appear to benefit the non-CBF AML patients with lowest CD33 expression a higher GO dose may be more effective for CD33-low but not CD33-high younger adults.",0,0,0,0
30998694,"""Hey, that could be me"": The role of similarity in narrative persuasion.Stories are often used in health communication because of accumulating evidence of their potential to affect people's attitudes and health behavioral intentions.Similarity between the reader and the story's protagonist appears to positively influence narrative persuasion, but the exact role of similarity on persuasive outcomes is debated, as some research finds clear effects of similarity manipulations whereas others do not.Possibly, these mixed results were found because the similarity manipulations were not always relevant to the topic of the story.We conducted an experiment (N = 582) in which we varied the age and gender of the protagonist, features that were of central relevance to the story's topic, namely breast cancer versus testicular cancer.There were two groups of participants: 324 students (mean age: 21.46 years) and 258 older adults (mean age: 56.83 years).Age similarity (but not gender similarity) had an effect on identification with the protagonist, transportation (i.e. the experience of being absorbed into a story), and the intention to donate, but only for students.For older adults, age or gender of the protagonist did not seem to matter, as nearly no differences in persuasive measures were found.As far as the underlying mechanism is concerned, the results of structural equation modeling showed that the concept of 'perceived similarity' would be a relevant addition to models of narrative persuasion, as it was significantly related to the narrative processes of transportation and identification, which, in turn, predicted attitudes and behavioral intentions, both directly-in the case of transportation-or indirectly, via the emotion of compassion.We conclude that both manipulated and perceived similarity are important for narrative persuasion, and that it should be kept on the research agenda of health communication.",0,0,0,0

28352657,"Randomized, placebo-controlled window trial of EGFR, Src, or combined blockade in head and neck cancer.BACKGROUND.EGFR and Src family kinases are upregulated in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).EGFR interacts with Src to activate STAT3 signaling, and dual EGFR-Src targeting is synergistic in HNSCC preclinical models.pSrc overexpression predicted resistance to the EGFR inhibitor, erlotinib, in a prior window trial.We conducted a 4-arm window trial to identify biomarkers associated with response to EGFR and/or Src inhibition.METHODS.Patients with operable stage II-IVa HNSCC were randomized to 7-21 days of neoadjuvant erlotinib, the Src inhibitor dasatinib, the combination of both, or placebo.Paired tumor specimens were collected before and after treatment.Pharmacodynamic expression of EGFR and Src pathway components was evaluated by IHC of tissue microarrays and reverse-phase protein array of tissue lysates.Candidate biomarkers were assessed for correlation with change in tumor size.RESULTS.From April 2009 to December 2012, 58 patients were randomized and 55 were treated.There was a significant decrease in tumor size in both erlotinib arms (P = 0.0014); however, no effect was seen with dasatinib alone (P = 0.24).High baseline pMAPK expression was associated with response to erlotinib (P = 0.03).High baseline pSTAT3 was associated with resistance to dasatinib (P = 0.099).CONCLUSIONS.Brief exposure to erlotinib significantly decreased tumor size in operable HNSCC, with no additive effect from dasatinib.Baseline pMAPK expression warrants further study as a response biomarker for anti-EGFR therapy.Basal expression of pSTAT3 may be independent of Src, explain therapeutic resistance, and preclude development of dasatinib in biomarker-unselected cohorts.TRIAL REGISTRATION.NCT00779389.FUNDING.National Cancer Institute, American Cancer Society, Pennsylvania Department of Health, V Foundation for Cancer Research, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Astellas Pharma.",1,1,1,1

28352657,"Randomized, placebo-controlled window trial of EGFR, Src, or combined blockade in head and neck cancer.BACKGROUND.EGFR and Src family kinases are upregulated in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).EGFR interacts with Src to activate STAT3 signaling, and dual EGFR-Src targeting is synergistic in HNSCC preclinical models.pSrc overexpression predicted resistance to the EGFR inhibitor, erlotinib, in a prior window trial.We conducted a 4-arm window trial to identify biomarkers associated with response to EGFR and/or Src inhibition.METHODS.Patients with operable stage II-IVa HNSCC were randomized to 7-21 days of neoadjuvant erlotinib, the Src inhibitor dasatinib, the combination of both, or placebo.Paired tumor specimens were collected before and after treatment.Pharmacodynamic expression of EGFR and Src pathway components was evaluated by IHC of tissue microarrays and reverse-phase protein array of tissue lysates.Candidate biomarkers were assessed for correlation with change in tumor size.RESULTS.From April 2009 to December 2012, 58 patients were randomized and 55 were treated.There was a significant decrease in tumor size in both erlotinib arms (P = 0.0014); however, no effect was seen with dasatinib alone (P = 0.24).High baseline pMAPK expression was associated with response to erlotinib (P = 0.03).High baseline pSTAT3 was associated with resistance to dasatinib (P = 0.099).CONCLUSIONS.Brief exposure to erlotinib significantly decreased tumor size in operable HNSCC, with no additive effect from dasatinib.Baseline pMAPK expression warrants further study as a response biomarker for anti-EGFR therapy.Basal expression of pSTAT3 may be independent of Src, explain therapeutic resistance, and preclude development of dasatinib in biomarker-unselected cohorts.TRIAL REGISTRATION.NCT00779389.FUNDING.National Cancer Institute, American Cancer Society, Pennsylvania Department of Health, V Foundation for Cancer Research, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Astellas Pharma.",1,1,1,1
26577690,"RESTORE: an exploratory trial of a web-based intervention to enhance self-management of cancer-related fatigue: findings from a qualitative process evaluation.BACKGROUND: Cancer-related fatigue is a distressing symptom experienced by many after cancer treatment.An exploratory randomised controlled trial was conducted to test proof of concept of RESTORE: a web-based tool to enhance self-efficacy to manage cancer-related fatigue.This paper reports findings from a qualitative process evaluation to determine feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and trial processes.METHOD: Qualitative process evaluation carried out at the end of the trial to explore participants' experiences using semi-structured telephone interviews with a purposive sample of participants from both trial arms.Normalisation Process Theory informed data collection and analysis.Analysis involved directed content analysis within a Framework Approach.RESULTS: Nineteen participants took part.They understood the purpose and requirements of the trial and identified beneficial outcomes from taking part.For the majority, the work of the trial was easily accommodated into daily routines and did not require new skills.There were mixed views about the value of the information provided by RESTORE, depending on time since diagnosis and treatment.Personal factors, constraints of the intervention, and environmental context inhibited the integration and embedding of RESTORE into everyday life.Access to the intervention at an early stage in the treatment trajectory was important to effective utilisation, as were individual preferences for delivery of information.CONCLUSION: The theoretical foundations of the intervention were sound.Participants derived benefits from the intervention but barriers to implementation and integration suggest that RESTORE and the trial processes require some modification before testing in a full trial.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN67521059 (10(th) October 2012).",0,0,0,0
27914822,"Effects of sodium thiosulfate versus observation on development of cisplatin-induced hearing loss in children with cancer (ACCL0431): a multicentre, randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Sodium thiosulfate is an antioxidant shown in preclinical studies in animals to prevent cisplatin-induced hearing loss with timed administration after cisplatin without compromising the antitumour efficacy of cisplatin.The primary aim of this study was to assess sodium thiosulfate for prevention of cisplatin-induced hearing loss in children and adolescents.METHODS: ACCL0431 was a multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial that enrolled participants at 38 participating Children's Oncology Group hospitals in the USA and Canada.Eligible participants aged 1-18 years with newly diagnosed cancer and normal audiometry were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive sodium thiosulfate or observation (control group) in addition to their planned cisplatin-containing chemotherapy regimen, using permuted blocks of four.Randomisation was initially stratified by age and duration of cisplatin infusion.Stratification by previous cranial irradiation was added later as a protocol amendment.The allocation sequence was computer-generated centrally and concealed to all personnel.Participants received sodium thiosulfate 16 g/m(2) intravenously 6 h after each cisplatin dose or observation.The primary endpoint was incidence of hearing loss 4 weeks after final cisplatin dose.Hearing was measured using standard audiometry and reviewed centrally by audiologists masked to allocation using American Speech-Language-Hearing Association criteria but treatment was not masked for participants or clinicians.Analysis of the primary endpoint was by modified intention to treat, which included all randomly assigned patients irrespective of treatment received but restricted to those assessable for hearing loss.Enrolment is complete and this report represents the final analysis.This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00716976.FINDINGS: Between June 23, 2008, and Sept 28, 2012, 125 eligible participants were randomly assigned to either sodium thiosulfate (n=61) or observation (n=64).Of these, 104 participants were assessable for the primary endpoint (sodium thiosulfate, n=49; control, n=55).Hearing loss was identified in 14 (28.6%; 95% CI 16.6-43.3) participants in the sodium thiosulfate group compared with 31 (56.4%; 42.3-69.7) in the control group (p=0.00022).Adjusted for stratification variables, the likelihood of hearing loss was significantly lower in the sodium thiosulfate group compared with the control group (odds ratio 0.31, 95% CI 0.13-0.73; p=0.0036).The most common grade 3-4 haematological adverse events reported, irrespective of attribution, were neutropenia (117 [66%] of 177 participant cycles in the sodium thiosulfate group vs 145 [65%] of 223 in the control group), whereas the most common non-haematological adverse event was hypokalaemia (25 [17%] of 147 vs 22 [12%] of 187).Of 194 serious adverse events reported in 26 participants who had received sodium thiosulfate, none were deemed probably or definitely related to sodium thiosulfate; the most common serious adverse event was decreased neutrophil count: 26 episodes in 14 participants.INTERPRETATION: Sodium thiosulfate protects against cisplatin-induced hearing loss in children and is not associated with serious adverse events attributed to its use.Further research is needed to define the appropriate role for sodium thiosulfate among emerging otoprotection strategies.FUNDING: US National Cancer Institute.",0,0,0,0

24573743,"A phase II open-label randomized multicenter trial of TSU-68 in combination with S-1 and oxaliplatin versus S-1 in combination with oxaliplatin in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide.The combination of oxaliplatin-based treatments (oxaliplatin plus infusional 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin [FOLFOX] or oxaliplatin plus capecitabine [CapeOX]) and bevacizumab is a standard chemotherapy regimen for metastatic CRC (mCRC).However, several clinical studies that tested S-1 plus oxaliplatin (SOX) indicate that SOX is also a treatment option for mCRC.TSU-68 is an oral compound that inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptor and platelet-derived growth factor receptor.The recommended dose of TSU-68 + SOX was previously determined in a phase I study of mCRC patients.The goal of this trial was to evaluate the efficacy of TSU-68 in combination with SOX.METHODS: This open-label multicenter randomized phase II trial was performed in Korea.Treatment-naive mCRC patients with a performance status of 0 or 1 were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either TSU-68 + SOX or SOX alone.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS).RESULTS: A total of 105 patients (TSU-68 + SOX, 52 patients; SOX alone, 53 patients) were randomized.The median PFS was 7.0 months in the TSU-68 + SOX group (hazard ratio [HR], 1.057) and 7.2 months in the SOX group (p = 0.8401).The most frequent grade 3 and 4 adverse events were thrombocytopenia (9.6 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 26.4 % [SOX]), neutropenia (13.5 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 15.1 % [SOX]), and anemia (3.8 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 13.2 % [SOX]).We observed a difference between the 2 groups for all grades of anemia (15.4 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 32.1 % [SOX]), diarrhea (30.8 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 47.2 % [SOX]), vomiting (50.0 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 26.4 % [SOX]), and chromaturia (23.1 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 0.0 % [SOX]).Analysis using a Cox proportional hazard model showed that baseline interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels were associated with a survival benefit of TSU-68 (p = 0.012).CONCLUSION: TSU-68 + SOX had a favorable safety profile.However, TSU-68 did not have a synergistic effect on the efficacy of SOX.The baseline serum IL-6 level could be a prognostic factor for TSU-68 efficacy.",1,1,1,1

28188670,"A randomized phase II trial of personalized peptide vaccine with low dose cyclophosphamide in biliary tract cancer.Since the prognosis of advanced biliary tract cancer (aBTC) still remains very poor, new therapeutic approaches, including immunotherapies, need to be developed.In the current study, we conducted an open-label randomized phase II study to test whether low dose cyclophosphamide (CPA) could improve antigen-specific immune responses and clinical efficacy of personalized peptide vaccination (PPV) in 49 previously treated aBTC patients.Patients with aBTC refractory to at least one regimen of chemotherapies were randomly assigned to receive PPV with low dose CPA (100 mg/day for 7 days before vaccination) (PPV/CPA, n = 24) or PPV alone (n = 25).A maximum of four HLA-matched peptides were selected based on the pre-existing peptide-specific IgG responses, followed by subcutaneous administration.T cell responses to the vaccinated peptides in the PPV/CPA arm tended to be greater than those in the PPV alone arm.The PPV/CPA arm showed significantly better progression-free survival (median time: 6.1 vs 2.9 months; hazard ratio (HR): 0.427; P = 0.008) and overall survival (median time: 12.1 vs 5.9 months; HR: 0.376; P = 0.004), compared to the PPV alone arm.The PPV alone arm, but not the PPV/CPA arm, showed significant increase in plasma IL-6 after vaccinations, which might be associated with inhibition of antigen-specific T cell responses.These results suggested that combined treatment with low dose CPA could provide clinical benefits in aBTC patients under PPV, possibly through prevention of IL-6-mediated immune suppression.Further clinical studies would be recommended to clarify the clinical efficacy of PPV/CPA in aBTC patients.",1,1,1,1

30982687,"Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy versus standard of care palliative treatment in patients with oligometastatic cancers (SABR-COMET): a randomised, phase 2, open-label trial.BACKGROUND: The oligometastatic paradigm suggests that some patients with a limited number of metastases might be cured if all lesions are eradicated.Evidence from randomised controlled trials to support this paradigm is scarce.We aimed to assess the effect of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) on survival, oncological outcomes, toxicity, and quality of life in patients with a controlled primary tumour and one to five oligometastatic lesions.METHODS: This randomised, open-label phase 2 study was done at 10 hospitals in Canada, the Netherlands, Scotland, and Australia.Patients aged 18 or older with a controlled primary tumour and one to five metastatic lesions, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score of 0-1, and a life expectancy of at least 6 months were eligible.After stratifying by the number of metastases (1-3 vs 4-5), we randomly assigned patients (1:2) to receive either palliative standard of care treatments alone (control group), or standard of care plus SABR to all metastatic lesions (SABR group), using a computer-generated randomisation list with permuted blocks of nine.Neither patients nor physicians were masked to treatment allocation.The primary endpoint was overall survival.We used a randomised phase 2 screening design with a two-sided alpha of 0.20 (wherein p<0.20 designates a positive trial).All analyses were intention to treat.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01446744.FINDINGS: 99 patients were randomised between Feb 10, 2012, and Aug 30, 2016.Of 99 patients, 33 (33%) were assigned to the control group and 66 (67%) to the SABR group.Two (3%) patients in the SABR group did not receive allocated treatment and withdrew from the trial; two (6%) patients in the control group also withdrew from the trial.Median follow-up was 25 months (IQR 19-54) in the control group versus 26 months (23-37) in the SABR group.Median overall survival was 28 months (95% CI 19-33) in the control group versus 41 months (26-not reached) in the SABR group (hazard ratio 0.57, 95% CI 0.30-1.10; p=0.090).Adverse events of grade 2 or worse occurred in three (9%) of 33 controls and 19 (29%) of 66 patients in the SABR group (p=0.026), an absolute increase of 20% (95% CI 5-34).Treatment-related deaths occurred in three (4.5%) of 66 patients after SABR, compared with none in the control group.INTERPRETATION: SABR was associated with an improvement in overall survival, meeting the primary endpoint of this trial, but three (4.5%) of 66 patients in the SABR group had treatment-related death.Phase 3 trials are needed to conclusively show an overall survival benefit, and to determine the maximum number of metastatic lesions wherein SABR provides a benefit.FUNDING: Ontario Institute for Cancer Research and London Regional Cancer Program Catalyst Grant.",0,0,0,0

22552048,"Efficacy of docetaxel-based chemotherapy following ketoconazole in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: implications for prior therapy in clinical trials.OBJECTIVES: Abiraterone acetate (AA) is a CYP17 inhibitor of androgen synthesis approved for use following docetaxel for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC); evaluation in the pre-docetaxel setting is ongoing.Given that the reported efficacy of AA is lower following docetaxel vs. pre-docetaxel, the potential exists for cross resistance given docetaxel's partly androgen receptor targeting activity.The efficacy of docetaxel following ketoconazole (KC), a weaker and nonspecific inhibitor of CYP17, may provide some insights into this potential interaction.We retrospectively evaluated the efficacy of every 3-week docetaxel with prednisone (DP) in mCRPC previously exposed to KC compared to KC-naive patients.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A randomized phase II trial of men with mCRPC treated with DP + AT-101 (bcl-2 inhibitor) vs. DP plus placebo was analyzed.Both arms were combined for analysis as no significant differences were seen.Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective response (ORR), pain, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rates were estimated with and without prior KC.Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate the effect of covariates on OS.RESULTS: Of 220 evaluable men, 40 (18.2%) received prior KC.The median OS with DP-based therapy of KC-naive patients (18.3 months, 95% CI: 15.0, 24.5) and post-KC patients (17.0 months, 95% CI: 9.9, 20.4) was not statistically different (P = 0.20).After controlling for prognostic classifications, analyses demonstrated consistent trends for worsening of OS after KC, with (hazard ratios (HRs) 1.33-1.46.Similar unfavorable trends were observed for ORR, PSA declines, and PFS.CONCLUSIONS: In this hypothesis-generating analysis, patients treated with docetaxel-based chemotherapy following prior KC had numerically and consistently worse outcomes than patients not exposed to prior KC.Although the estimated differences did not attain statistical significance, evaluation of outcomes with docetaxel in particular, and all classes of novel and emerging agents following AA, is of clinical importance, given its more potent androgen synthesis inhibition compared with KC.Drug development should take into account the potential impact of previous therapy.",0,0,0,0
34059488,"Sex Differences in Multiple Myeloma Biology but not Clinical Outcomes: Results from 3894 Patients in the Myeloma XI Trial.BACKGROUND: Sex differences in the incidence and outcomes of several cancers are well established.Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant plasma cell dyscrasia accounting for 2% of all new cancer cases in the UK.There is a clear sex disparity in MM incidence, with 57% of cases in males and 43% in females.The mechanisms behind this are not well understood and the impact of sex on patient outcomes has not been thoroughly explored.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We investigated the association of sex with baseline disease characteristics and outcome in 3894 patients recruited to the phase III UK NCRI Myeloma XI trial, in which treatment exposure to lenalidomide predominated.RESULTS: Females were significantly more likely to have the molecular lesions t(14;16) and del(17p) and were more likely to meet the cytogenetic classification of high-risk (HiR) or ultra-high-risk disease (UHiR).There was no difference in progression-free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS) between the sexes in the overall population.CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that the genetic lesions involved in the initiation and progression of MM may be different between the sexes.Although females were more likely to have the poor prognosis lesions t(14;16) and del(17p), and were more likely to be assessed as having HiR or UHiR disease, this was not associated with reduced PFS or OS.In female patients the trial treatment may have been able to overcome some of the adverse effects of high-risk cytogenetic lesions.MicroAbstract Multiple myeloma (MM) is more common in males compared to females but the reasons behind this are not well understood and the impact of sex on patient outcomes is unclear.This study demonstrates fundamental differences in genetic lesions underlying the biology of MM between males and females.However, we found that progression-free survival and overall survival were the same in both sexes.",0,0,0,0
33479759,"Prognostic impact of geriatric assessment in elderly patients with non-small cell lung cancer: an integrated analysis of two randomized phase III trials (JCOG1115-A).OBJECTIVE: Patients' actual age and performance status do not always accurately identify the 'fit elderly' for chemotherapy.This study aimed to determine whether four geriatric assessment tools could predict prognosis.METHODS: This study were analyzed using the data of two randomized phase III trials (JCOG0207 and JCOG0803/WJOG4307L) for elderly patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer and included all eligible patients who were assessed before treatment with four geriatric assessment tools: the Barthel activities of daily living index, Lawton instrumental activities of daily living scale, Mini-Mental State Examination, and Geriatric Depression Scale-15.Univariable and multivariable analyses for overall survival, adjusted for baseline factors, were performed using a stratified Cox regression model with treatment regimen as strata.RESULTS: This analysis included 330 patients aged 70-74, 75-79 or 80 or more (n = 95/181/54), with a performance status of 0 or 1 (n = 119/211).Patients were divided into three groups based on Mini-Mental State Examination and two groups based on Geriatric Depression Scale, but over 80% of patients had perfect scores for both activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living.In overall survival subgroup analyses by GA tool, only Mini-Mental State Examination scores were associated with substantial outcome differences (median survival times: 21.2, 13.5 and 12.2 months for scores 30, 29-24 and </=23).After adjusting for baseline factors, the Mini-Mental State Examination, sex and performance status were tended to be worse overall survival.CONCLUSION: MMSE scores, performance status and sex, but not chronological age, effectively predicted the prognosis of elderly patients.Further studies should confirm that the Mini-Mental State Examination is useful for determining the indication of chemotherapy in elderly patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.",0,0,0,0
28412590,"Baseline carcinoembryonic antigen as a predictive factor of ramucirumab efficacy in RAISE, a second-line metastatic colorectal carcinoma phase III trial.BACKGROUND: The RAISE phase III clinical trial demonstrated that ramucirumab + (folinic acid plus 5-fluorouracil plus irinotecan) FOLFIRI significantly improved overall survival (OS) versus placebo + FOLFIRI for second-line metastatic colorectal carcinoma (mCRC) patients failing bevacizumab- and oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.73-0.98, P = 0.022).Post hoc analyses of RAISE patient data examined the association of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) subgroups with efficacy parameters.METHODS: CEA subgroups (</=10 versus >10 ng/ml) were based on 2X upper limit of normal (ULN) (5 ng/ml).The Kaplan-Meier method estimated the median OS and the progression-free survival (PFS).Log-rank test compared the survival distributions within the subgroups.Hazard ratio (HR) (95% confidence interval [CI]) and treatment-by-subgroup interaction p-values were calculated by Cox proportional hazards model.RESULTS: Ramucirumab treatment prolonged survival for the CEA </=10 subgroup (HR = 0.68; 95% CI = 0.50-0.92; P = 0.013) and CEA >10 subgroup (HR = 0.90; 95% CI = 0.76-1.07; P = 0.233).However, the ramucirumab OS benefit over placebo was greater for the CEA </=10 subgroup than for the CEA >10 subgroup (median OS: 3.6 versus 0.8 months greater, respectively).The interaction P-value between CEA level and treatment effect on OS was 0.088.This trend was observed across randomisation strata and to a lesser extent for PFS (P = 0.594).CONCLUSIONS: Although patients in both high- and low-CEA subgroups derive OS and PFS benefits from ramucirumab treatment, the low baseline CEA level may identify a subgroup of patients with mCRC who obtain greater benefit from ramucirumab.",1,1,1,1
30707756,"A randomized study to improve care for young women with breast cancer at community and academic medical oncology practices in the United States: The Young and Strong study.BACKGROUND: The authors conducted a cluster randomized study to determine the effect of an exportable educational intervention for young women with breast cancer (YWI) on improving care.METHODS: Sites were randomized 1:1 to the YWI or a contact time control physical activity intervention (PAI) stratified by academic or community site.Up to 15 women aged </=45 years with newly diagnosed breast cancer were enrolled at each of 14 academic sites and 10 were enrolled at each of 40 community sites.The primary endpoint, attention to fertility, was ascertained by medical record review.Statistical inferences concerning the effect of the intervention used general estimating equations for clustered data.RESULTS: A total of 467 patients across 54 sites were enrolled between July 2012 and December 2013.The median age of the patients at the time of diagnosis was 40 years (range, 22-45 years).Attention to fertility by 3 months was observed in 55% of patients in the YWI and 58% of patients in the PAI (P = .88).Rates were found to be strongly correlated with age (P < .0001), and were highest in patients aged <30 years.Attention to genetics was similar (80% in the YWI and 81% in the PAI), whereas attention to emotional health was higher in patients in the YWI (87% vs 76%; estimated odds ratio, 2.63 [95% confidence interval, 1.20-5.76; P = .016]).Patients rated both interventions as valuable in providing education (64% in the YWI and 63% in the PAI).CONCLUSIONS: The current study failed to demonstrate differences in attention to fertility with an intervention to improve care for women with breast cancer, although attention to fertility was found to be higher than expected in both groups and emotional health was improved in the YWI group.Greater attention to young women with breast cancer in general may promote more comprehensive care for this population.",0,0,0,0

23497452,"A randomized trial to assess the biological activity of short-term (pre-surgical) fulvestrant 500 mg plus anastrozole versus fulvestrant 500 mg alone or anastrozole alone on primary breast cancer.INTRODUCTION: Fulvestrant shows dose-dependent biological activity.Greater estrogen-receptor (ER) blockade may feasibly be achieved by combining fulvestrant with anastrozole.This pre-surgical study compared fulvestrant plus anastrozole versus either agent alone in patients with ER-positive breast cancer.METHODS: In this double-blind, multicenter trial, 121 patients received fulvestrant 500 mg on Day 1 plus anastrozole 1 mg/day for 14 to 21 days (F + A); fulvestrant plus anastrozole placebo (F); or fulvestrant placebo plus anastrozole (A), 2 to 3 weeks before surgery.ER, progesterone-receptor (PgR) and Ki67 expression were determined from tumor biopsies before treatment and at surgery.RESULTS: A total of 103 paired samples were available (F, n = 35; F+A, n = 31; A, n = 37).All treatments significantly reduced mean ER expression from baseline (F: -41%, P = 0.0001; F + A: -39%, P = 0.0001; A: -13%, P = 0.0034).F and F + A led to greater reductions in ER versus A (both P = 0.0001); F + A did not lead to additional reductions versus F. PgR and Ki67 expression were significantly reduced with all treatments (means were -34% to -45%, and -75% to -85%, respectively; all P = 0.0001), with no differences between groups.CONCLUSIONS: In this short-term study, all treatments reduced ER expression, although F and F + A showed greater reductions than A. No significant differences were detected between the treatment groups in terms of PgR and Ki67 expression.No additional reduction in tumor biomarkers with combination treatment was observed, suggesting that F + A is unlikely to have further clinical benefit over F alone.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00259090.",1,1,1,1
27386647,"[Effect of Tanshinone IIA in Preventing and Treating Oxaliplatin Induced Peripheral Neuropathy].OBJECTIVE: To observe preventive and therapeutic effects of Tanshinone IIA (T II A) on oxaliplatin induced peripheral neuropathy (OlPN) and to explore its effects on the expression of calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) and never growth factor (NGF).METHODS: Totally 36 phase II - III patients with malignant tumor of digestive tract undergoing chemotherapy program with oxaliplatin, were equally assigned to the T II A group (using THA at 80 mg/day 1 day before oxaliplatin chemotherapy for 3 successive days) and the control group (using chemotherapy program with oxaliplatin alone) by segmented randomization.After 4 cycles of chemotherapy, the incidence degree and incidence of OlPN were evaluated.Sensory nerve conduction velocity (SNCV) and motor nerve conduction velocity ( MNCV) were tested by EMGevoked potential device.Serum levels of CGRP and NGF were also detected in the two groups before and after chemotherapy.The correlation of serum levels of CGRP and NGF to OIPN was assessed using linear correlation analysis.RESULTS: After chemotherapy the OlPN incidence was 27.8% (5/18 cases) in the T II A group, obviously lower than that in the control group (55.6%, 10/18 cases; P < 0.05).Compared with before treatment in the same group, SNCV and MNCV of common peroneal nerve were slowed down, serum NGF levels decreased, and serum CGRP levels obviously increased in the two groups (all P < 0.05).Compared with the control group after treatment, SNCV and MNCV of common peroneal nerve were obviously accelerated, serum NGF levels increased, and serum CGRP levels obviously decreased in the THA group (all P < 0.05).Results of linear correlation analysis indicated serum NGF level was negatively correlated with peripheral neuropathy (PN), serum CGRP expression was positively correlated with neurotoxicity (P < 0.05).CONCLUSION: T II A could reduce the incidence of OlPN, which might be associated with inhibiting the expression of CGRP and up-regulating NGF activities.",1,1,1,1

29064206,"Correlation of changes in HIF-1alpha and p53 expressions with vitamin B3 deficiency in skin cancer patients.BACKGROUND: To investigate the correlation of changes in hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) and p53 expressions with vitamin B3 deficiency in skin cancer patients.METHODS: Twenty non-melanoma skin cancer patients with positive HIF-1alpha and p53 expressions were selected and randomly divided into two groups, the placebo group and the experimental group.After an appropriate number of cancer tissues were taken, the experimental group was treated with oral administration of 500 mg vitamin B3 every day, while the placebo group was treated with oral administration of the same amount of placebo; after 1 week, the skin cancer tissues in the same part were taken, and the skin tissues of healthy people were taken as the control group; the mRNA and protein expression levels of HIF-1alpha and p53 in tissues were detected.RESULTS: HIF-1alpha and p53 were mainly expressed in the nucleus in non-melanoma skin cancer.The protein and mRNA expression levels of HIF-1alpha and p53 in tissues of skin cancer patients were significantly increased compared with those in skin tissues of healthy people (P<0.05).The protein and mRNA expression levels of HIF-1alpha and p53 in tissues of skin cancer patients were significantly decreased at 1 week after the oral administration of vitamin B3 compared with those before the oral administration of vitamin B3 (P<0.05), but the protein and mRNA expression levels of HIF-1alpha and p53 in tissues of skin cancer patients in placebo group had no significant changes (P>0.05).The vitamin B3 deficiency in skin cancer patients was positively correlated with the expressions of HIF-1alpha and p53.CONCLUSIONS: The expression levels of HIF-1alpha and p53 in tissues of skin cancer patients are significantly increased compared with those in skin tissues of healthy people, and the changes in their expressions are positively correlated with the vitamin B3 deficiency.Supplementing vitamin B3 has a certain protective effect on skin cancer patients.",1,1,1,1
32889876,"Assessment of Robotic Versus Laparoscopic Distal Gastrectomy for Gastric Cancer: A Randomized Controlled Trial.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the short-term outcomes of patients with GC who received RDG or LDG.SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Despite the increasing use of RDG in patients with GC, its safety and efficacy compared to those of LDG have not been elucidated in a randomized controlled trial.METHODS: Three hundred patients with cT1-4a and N0/+ between September 2017 and January 2020 were enrolled in this randomized controlled trial at a high-volume hospital in China.The short-term outcomes were compared between the groups.RESULTS: The modified intention-to-treat analysis included data from 283 patients (RDG group: n = 141) and (LDG group: n = 142).Patients in the RDG group exhibited faster postoperative recovery, milder inflammatory responses, and reduced postoperative morbidity (9.2% vs 17.6%, respectively, P = 0.039).Higher extraperigastric lymph nodes (LNs) were retrieved in the RDG group (17.6 +/- 5.8 vs 15.8 +/- 6.6, P = 0.018) with lower noncompliance rate (7.7% vs 16.9%, respectively, P = 0.006).Additionally, patients in the RDG group were more likely to initiate adjuvant chemotherapy earlier [median (interquartile range) postoperative days: 28 (24-32) vs 32 (26-42), P = 0.003].Although total hospital costs were higher in the robotic group than in the laparoscopic group, the direct cost was lower for RDG than for LDG (all P < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: RDG is associated with a lower morbidity rate, faster recovery, milder inflammatory responses, and improved lymphadenectomy.Additionally, faster postoperative recovery in the RDG group enables early initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy.Our results provide evidence for the application of RDG in patients with GC.",1,1,1,0
28743247,"A randomized phase II study of paclitaxel alone versus paclitaxel plus sorafenib in second- and third-line treatment of patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer (PASO).BACKGROUND: We conducted an open-label, randomized, two-arm multi-center study to assess the efficacy and safety of paclitaxel versus paclitaxel + sorafenib in patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer.METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive either paclitaxel monotherapy (80 mg/m(2)) weekly (3 weeks on, 1 week off) plus sorafenib 400 mg orally, twice a day taken continuously throughout 28 day cycles.Sorafenib dose was gradually escalated from a starting dose of 200 mg twice a day.The primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS).RESULTS: A pre-planned efficacy interim analysis was performed on the data of 60 patients, 30 patients in each treatment arm.Median PFS was estimated at 6.6 months (95% CI: 5.1 to 9.0) in patients randomized to single-agent paclitaxel (Arm A) and 5.6 months (95% CI: 3.8 to 6.5) in patients randomized to paclitaxel-sorafenib combination (Arm B) therapy.Contrary to the hypothesis, the treatment effect was statistically significant in favor of paclitaxel monotherapy (hazard ratio 1.80, 95% CI: 1.02 to 3.20; log-rank test P = 0.0409).It was decided to stop the trial early for futility.Median OS was also in favor of Arm A (20.7 months (95% CI: 16.4 to 26.7) versus 12.1 months (95% CI: 5.8 to 20.4) in Arm B. Clinical control was achieved in 28 patients (93.3%) in Arm A and in 21 patients 70.0% in Arm B. Overall response rate was met in 43.3% of patients in Arm A and in 40.0% in Arm B. Toxicities were increased in Arm B with higher rates of diarrhea, nausea, neutropenia, hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) and anorexia, Grad 3 and 4 toxicities were rare.CONCLUSIONS: In this pre-planned interim analysis, paclitaxel-sorafenib combination therapy was not found to be superior to paclitaxel monotherapy with regard to the primary end point, progression-free survival.The trial was therefore discontinued early.There was no indication of more favorable outcomes for combination therapy in secondary efficacy end points.As expected, the safety and toxicity profile of the combination therapy was less favorable compared to monotherapy.Overall, this trial did not demonstrate that adding sorafenib to second- or third-line paclitaxel provides any clinical benefit to patients with HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer.Cautious dosing using a sorafenib ramp up schedule might have contributed to negative results.TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered at EudraCT (No 2009-018025-73) and retrospectively registered at Clinical trials.gov on March 17, 2011 ( NCT01320111 ).",1,1,1,1

OS rates at 8 years were 78% with FEC alone and 83.2% with FEC-D. Cox regression analysis adjusted for age and number of positive nodes showed a 15% reduction in the relative risk of relapse and a 25% reduction in the relative risk of death in favor of FEC-D. Significant relative risk reductions were observed in the HR-positive, HER2-positive, and Ki67 >/=20% subpopulations.CONCLUSION: Benefits for DFS and OS rates with the sequential FEC-D regimen are fully confirmed at 8 years.",1,1,1,1
30486814,"A process and mechanism of action evaluation of the effect of early and intensive nutrition care, delivered via telephone or mobile application, on quality of life in people with upper gastrointestinal cancer: a study protocol.BACKGROUND: Cancers of the upper gastrointestinal tract commonly result in malnutrition, which increases morbidity and mortality.Current nutrition best practice lacks a mechanism to provide early and intensive nutrition support to these patients.A 3-arm parallel randomised controlled trial is testing the provision of a tailored, nutritional counselling intervention delivered using a synchronous, telephone-based approach or an asynchronous, mobile application-based approach to address this problem.This protocol outlines the design and methods that will be used to undertake an evaluation of the implementation process, which is imperative for successful replication and dissemination.METHODS: A concurrent triangulation mixed methods comparative analysis will be undertaken.The nutrition intervention will be provided using best practice behaviour change techniques and communicated either via telephone or via mHealth.The implementation outcomes that will be measured are: fidelity to the nutrition intervention protocol and to the delivery approach; engagement; acceptability and contextual factors.Qualitative data from recorded telephone consultations and written messages will be analysed through a coding matrix against the behaviour change techniques outlined in the standard operating procedure, and also thematically to determine barriers and enablers.Negative binomial regression will be used to test for predictive relationships between intervention components with health-related quality of life and nutrition outcomes.Post-intervention interviews with participants and health professionals will be thematically analysed to determine the acceptability of delivery approaches.NVivo 11 Pro software will be used to code for thematic analysis.STATA version 15 will be used to perform quantitative analysis.DISCUSSION: The findings of this process evaluation will provide evidence of the core active ingredients that enable the implementation of best practice nutrition intervention for people with upper gastrointestinal cancer.Elucidation of the causal pathways of successful implementation and the important relationship to contextual delivery are anticipated.With this information, a strategy for sustained implementation across broader settings will be developed which impact the quality of life and nutritional status of individuals with upper gastrointestinal cancer.TRIAL REGISTRATION: 27th January 2017 Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry ( ACTRN12617000152325 ).",0,0,0,0

28759333,"Do Pattern-Focused Visuals Improve Skin Self-Examination Performance? Explicating the Visual Skill Acquisition Model.Skin self-examination (SSE) consists of routinely checking the body for atypical moles that might be cancerous.Identifying atypical moles is a visual task; thus, SSE training materials utilize pattern-focused visuals to cultivate this skill.Despite widespread use, researchers have yet to explicate how pattern-focused visuals cultivate visual skill.Using eye tracking to capture the visual scanpaths of a sample of laypersons (N = 92), the current study employed a 2 (pattern: ABCDE vs. ugly duckling sign [UDS]) x 2 (presentation: photorealistic images vs. illustrations) factorial design to assess whether and how pattern-focused visuals can increase layperson accuracy in identifying atypical moles.Overall, illustrations resulted in greater sensitivity, while photos resulted in greater specificity.The UDS x photorealistic condition showed greatest specificity.For those in the photo condition with high self-efficacy, UDS increased specificity directly.For those in the photo condition with self-efficacy levels at the mean or lower, there was a conditional indirect effect such that these individuals spent a larger amount of their viewing time observing the atypical moles, and time on target was positively related to specificity.Illustrations provided significant gains in specificity for those with low-to-moderate self-efficacy by increasing total fixation time on the atypical moles.Findings suggest that maximizing visual processing efficiency could enhance existing SSE training techniques.",0,0,0,0

24571588,"Systematic analysis of 18F-FDG PET and metabolism, proliferation and hypoxia markers for classification of head and neck tumors.BACKGROUND: Quantification of molecular cell processes is important for prognostication and treatment individualization of head and neck cancer (HNC).However, individual tumor comparison can show discord in upregulation similarities when analyzing multiple biological mechanisms.Elaborate tumor characterization, integrating multiple pathways reflecting intrinsic and microenvironmental properties, may be beneficial to group most uniform tumors for treatment modification schemes.The goal of this study was to systematically analyze if immunohistochemical (IHC) assessment of molecular markers, involved in treatment resistance, and 18F-FDG PET parameters could accurately distinguish separate HNC tumors.METHODS: Several imaging parameters and texture features for 18F-FDG small-animal PET and immunohistochemical markers related to metabolism, hypoxia, proliferation and tumor blood perfusion were assessed within groups of BALB/c nu/nu mice xenografted with 14 human HNC models.Classification methods were used to predict tumor line based on sets of parameters.RESULTS: We found that 18F-FDG PET could not differentiate between the tumor lines.On the contrary, combined IHC parameters could accurately allocate individual tumors to the correct model.From 9 analyzed IHC parameters, a cluster of 6 random parameters already classified 70.3% correctly.Combining all PET/IHC characteristics resulted in the highest tumor line classification accuracy (81.0%; cross validation 82.0%), which was just 2.2% higher (p = 5.2x10-32) than the performance of the IHC parameter/feature based model.CONCLUSIONS: With a select set of IHC markers representing cellular processes of metabolism, proliferation, hypoxia and perfusion, one can reliably distinguish between HNC tumor lines.Addition of 18F-FDG PET improves classification accuracy of IHC to a significant yet minor degree.These results may form a basis for development of tumor characterization models for treatment allocation purposes.",0,0,0,0

29552975,"MRI-Targeted or Standard Biopsy for Prostate-Cancer Diagnosis.BACKGROUND: Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with or without targeted biopsy, is an alternative to standard transrectal ultrasonography-guided biopsy for prostate-cancer detection in men with a raised prostate-specific antigen level who have not undergone biopsy.However, comparative evidence is limited.METHODS: In a multicenter, randomized, noninferiority trial, we assigned men with a clinical suspicion of prostate cancer who had not undergone biopsy previously to undergo MRI, with or without targeted biopsy, or standard transrectal ultrasonography-guided biopsy.Men in the MRI-targeted biopsy group underwent a targeted biopsy (without standard biopsy cores) if the MRI was suggestive of prostate cancer; men whose MRI results were not suggestive of prostate cancer were not offered biopsy.Standard biopsy was a 10-to-12-core, transrectal ultrasonography-guided biopsy.The primary outcome was the proportion of men who received a diagnosis of clinically significant cancer.Secondary outcomes included the proportion of men who received a diagnosis of clinically insignificant cancer.RESULTS: A total of 500 men underwent randomization.In the MRI-targeted biopsy group, 71 of 252 men (28%) had MRI results that were not suggestive of prostate cancer, so they did not undergo biopsy.Clinically significant cancer was detected in 95 men (38%) in the MRI-targeted biopsy group, as compared with 64 of 248 (26%) in the standard-biopsy group (adjusted difference, 12 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4 to 20; P=0.005).MRI, with or without targeted biopsy, was noninferior to standard biopsy, and the 95% confidence interval indicated the superiority of this strategy over standard biopsy.Fewer men in the MRI-targeted biopsy group than in the standard-biopsy group received a diagnosis of clinically insignificant cancer (adjusted difference, -13 percentage points; 95% CI, -19 to -7; P<0.001).CONCLUSIONS: The use of risk assessment with MRI before biopsy and MRI-targeted biopsy was superior to standard transrectal ultrasonography-guided biopsy in men at clinical risk for prostate cancer who had not undergone biopsy previously.(Funded by the National Institute for Health Research and the European Association of Urology Research Foundation; PRECISION ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02380027 .).",0,0,0,0
25525672,"Comparing effects in regular practice of e-communication and Web-based self-management support among breast cancer patients: preliminary results from a randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: While Web-based interventions have been shown to assist a wide range of patients successfully in managing their illness, few studies have examined the relative contribution of different Web-based components to improve outcomes.Further efficacy trials are needed to test the effects of Web support when offered as a part of routine care.OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to compare in regular care the effects of (1) an Internet-based patient provider communication service (IPPC), (2) WebChoice, a Web-based illness management system for breast cancer patients (IPPC included), and (3) usual care on symptom distress, anxiety, depression, (primary outcomes), and self-efficacy (secondary outcome).This study reports preliminary findings from 6 months' follow-up data in a 12-month trial.METHODS: We recruited 167 patients recently diagnosed with breast cancer and undergoing treatment from three Norwegian hospitals.The nurse-administered IPPC allowed patients to send secure e-messages to and receive e-messages from health care personnel at the hospital where they were treated.In addition to the IPPC, WebChoice contains components for symptom monitoring, tailored information and self-management support, a diary, and communication with other patients.A total of 20 care providers (11 nurses, 6 physicians, and 3 social workers) were trained to answer questions from patients.Outcomes were measured with questionnaires at study entry and at study months 2, 4, and 6.Linear mixed models for repeated measures were fitted to compare effects on outcomes over time.RESULTS: Patients were randomly assigned to the WebChoice group (n=64), the IPPC group (n=45), or the usual care group (n=58).Response rates to questionnaires were 73.7% (123/167) at 2 months, 65.9 (110/167) at 4 months, and 62.3% (104/167) at 6 months.Attrition was similar in all study groups.Among those with access to WebChoice, 64% (41/64) logged on more than once and 39% (25/64) sent e-messages to care providers.In the IPPC group, 40% (18/45) sent e-messages.Linear mixed models analyses revealed that the WebChoice group reported significantly lower symptom distress (mean difference 0.16, 95% CI 0.06-0.25, P=.001), anxiety (mean difference 0.79, 95% CI 0.09-1.49, P=.03), and depression (mean difference 0.79, 95% CI 0.09-1.49, P=.03) compared with the usual care group.The IPPC group reported significant lower depression scores compared with the usual care group (mean difference 0.69, 95% CI 0.05-1.32, P=.03), but no differences were observed for symptom distress or anxiety.No significant differences in self-efficacy were found among the study groups.CONCLUSIONS: In spite of practice variations and moderate use of the interventions, our results suggest that offering Web support as part of regular care can be a powerful tool to help patients manage their illness.Our finding that a nurse-administered IPPC alone can significantly reduce depression is particularly promising.However, the multicomponent intervention WebChoice had additional positive effects.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov:NCT00971009; http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00971009 (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/6USKezP0Y).",0,0,0,0

The median overall survival was 10.3 versus 8.9 months (stratified HR, 0.83; 80% CI, 0.64 to 1.07; one-sided P = .17) for the CE+V and CE+P arms, respectively.The overall response rate was 71.9% versus 65.6% (two-sided P = .57) for CE+V and CE+P, respectively.There was a significant treatment-by-strata interaction in PFS: Male patients with high lactate dehydrogenase levels derived significant benefit (PFS HR, 0.34; 80% CI, 0.22 to 0.51) but there was no evidence of benefit among patients in other strata (PFS HR, 0.81; 80% CI, 0.60 to 1.09).The following grade >/= 3 hematology toxicities were more frequent in the CE+V arm than the CE+P arm: CD4 lymphopenia (8% v 0%; P = .06) and neutropenia (49% v 32%; P = .08), but treatment delivery was comparable.CONCLUSION: The addition of veliparib to frontline chemotherapy showed signal of efficacy in patients with ES-SCLC and the study met its prespecified end point.",1,1,1,0
30203774,"Drug effect analysis of sorafenib combined with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization in the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.Sorafenib is a new multi-target oral drug that inhibits many kinds of protein kinase small molecules to treat tumors.Currently, sorafenib is one of the drugs that permit systemic treatment of liver cancer in the middle stage.Although sorafenib has good therapeutic effect on liver cancer, the clinical effect of sorafenib alone in the treatment of liver cancer is limited.This study compared the efficacy of sorafenib, TACE (transcatheter arterial chemoembolization), and sorafenib combined with TACE in the treatment of liver cancer patients.The results showed that the curative effect of sorafenib combined with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization is better than that of hepatic artery chemoembolization or sorafenib orally.The total effective rate of combined treatment is 93.8%, while the effective rate of arterial chemoembolization and sorafenib is 64.1% and 72.2% respectively.Combined treatment can significantly prolong the total survival of the patients with liver cancer, which is significantly different from that of arterial chemoembolization or sorafenib alone.",0,0,0,0
34838115,"Impact of an enhanced screening program on the detection of non-AIDS neoplasias in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection.BACKGROUND: The incidence of non-AIDS defining cancer (NADC) is higher in people living with HIV (PLWH) than in the general population, and it is already one of the leading causes of death in the HIV-infected population.It is estimated that the situation will be aggravated by the progressive aging of PLWH.Early diagnosis through intensive cancer screening may improve the ability for therapeutic interventions and could be critical in reducing mortality, but it might also increase expenditure and harms associated with adverse events.The aim of this study is to evaluate an enhanced screening program for early diagnosis of cancer in PLWH compared to standard practice.The specific objectives are (1) to compare the frequency of cancer diagnosed at an early stage, (2) to analyze safety of the enhanced program: adverse events and unnecessary interventions, (3) to analyze the cost-utility of the program, and (4) to estimate the overall and site-specific incidence of NADC in PLWH.METHODS: We will conduct a multicenter, non-blinded, randomized, controlled trial, comparing two parallel arms: conventional vs enhanced screening.Data will be recorded in an electronic data collection notebook.Conventional intervention group will follow the standard of care screening in the participating centers, according to the European AIDS Clinical Society recommendations, and the enhanced intervention group will follow an expanded screening aimed to early detection of lung, liver, anal, cervical, breast, prostate, colorectal, and skin cancer.The trial will be conducted within the framework of the Spanish AIDS Research Network Cohort (CoRIS).DISCUSSION: The trial will evaluate the efficacy, safety, and efficiency of an enhanced screening program for the early diagnosis of cancer in HIV patients compared to standard of care practice.The information provided will be relevant since there are currently no studies on expanded cancer screening strategies in patients with HIV, and available data estimating cost effectiveness or cost-utility of such as programs are scarce.An enhanced program for NADC screening in patients with HIV could lead to early diagnosis and improve the prognosis of these patients, with an acceptable rate of unnecessary interventions, but it is critical to demonstrate that the benefits clearly outweigh the harms, before the strategy could be implemented.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04735445.Registered on 25 June 2019.",0,0,0,0
23497452,"A randomized trial to assess the biological activity of short-term (pre-surgical) fulvestrant 500 mg plus anastrozole versus fulvestrant 500 mg alone or anastrozole alone on primary breast cancer.INTRODUCTION: Fulvestrant shows dose-dependent biological activity.Greater estrogen-receptor (ER) blockade may feasibly be achieved by combining fulvestrant with anastrozole.This pre-surgical study compared fulvestrant plus anastrozole versus either agent alone in patients with ER-positive breast cancer.METHODS: In this double-blind, multicenter trial, 121 patients received fulvestrant 500 mg on Day 1 plus anastrozole 1 mg/day for 14 to 21 days (F + A); fulvestrant plus anastrozole placebo (F); or fulvestrant placebo plus anastrozole (A), 2 to 3 weeks before surgery.ER, progesterone-receptor (PgR) and Ki67 expression were determined from tumor biopsies before treatment and at surgery.RESULTS: A total of 103 paired samples were available (F, n = 35; F+A, n = 31; A, n = 37).All treatments significantly reduced mean ER expression from baseline (F: -41%, P = 0.0001; F + A: -39%, P = 0.0001; A: -13%, P = 0.0034).F and F + A led to greater reductions in ER versus A (both P = 0.0001); F + A did not lead to additional reductions versus F. PgR and Ki67 expression were significantly reduced with all treatments (means were -34% to -45%, and -75% to -85%, respectively; all P = 0.0001), with no differences between groups.CONCLUSIONS: In this short-term study, all treatments reduced ER expression, although F and F + A showed greater reductions than A. No significant differences were detected between the treatment groups in terms of PgR and Ki67 expression.No additional reduction in tumor biomarkers with combination treatment was observed, suggesting that F + A is unlikely to have further clinical benefit over F alone.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00259090.",1,1,1,1

The main outcome measures included BMD, BTM [carboxy-terminal collagen crosslinks (CTX) and N-terminal propeptide of type 1 procollagen (P1NP)], and safety.RESULTS: Eighty-seven percent completed 24 months.BMD increased more in the active treatment group compared to placebo with an adjusted difference at 24 months of 3.9 +/-0.7 percentage points at the spine and 3.2 +/- 0.5 percentage points at the hip (both p < 0.05).The adjusted difference between the active treatment and placebo groups were 0.09 +/- 0.04 nmol/LBCE for CTX and 23.3 +/- 4.8 mug/mL for P1NP (both p < 0.05).Women with greater 12-month decreases in CTX and P1NP in the active treatment group had a greater 24-month increase in spinal BMD (p < 0.05).The oral therapy was safe and well tolerated.CONCLUSION: In postmenopausal women with low bone mass and breast cancer on an AI, the oral bisphosphonate risedronate maintained skeletal health.",1,1,1,0
34021033,"Randomized phase II trial of lymphodepletion plus adoptive cell transfer of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, with or without dendritic cell vaccination, in patients with metastatic melanoma.BACKGROUND: The adoptive transfer of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) has demonstrated robust efficacy in metastatic melanoma patients.Tumor antigen-loaded dendritic cells (DCs) are believed to optimally activate antigen-specific T lymphocytes.We hypothesized that the combined transfer of TIL, containing a melanoma antigen recognized by T cells 1 (MART-1) specific population, with MART-1-pulsed DC will result in enhanced proliferation and prolonged survival of transferred MART-1 specific T cells in vivo ultimately leading to improved clinical responses.DESIGN: We tested the combination of TIL and DC in a phase II clinical trial of patients with advanced stage IV melanoma.HLA-A0201 patients whose early TIL cultures demonstrated reactivity to MART-1 peptide were randomly assigned to receive TIL alone or TIL +DC pulsed with MART-1 peptide.The primary endpoint was to evaluate the persistence of MART-1 TIL in the two arms.Secondary endpoints were to evaluate clinical response and survival.RESULTS: Ten patients were given TIL alone while eight patients received TIL+DC vaccine.Infused MART-1 reactive CD8(+) TIL were tracked in the blood over time by flow cytometry and results show good persistence in both arms, with no difference in the persistence of MART-1 between the two arms.The objective response rate was 30% (3/10) in the TIL arm and 50% (4/8) in the TIL+DC arm.All treatments were well tolerated.CONCLUSIONS: The combination of TIL +DC showed no difference in the persistence of MART-1 TIL compared with TIL therapy alone.Although more patients showed a clinical response to TIL+DC therapy, this study was not powered to resolve differences between groups.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT00338377.",1,1,1,1

21660669,"Light treatment prevents fatigue in women undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer.PURPOSE: Fatigue is one of the most disturbing complaints of cancer patients and is often the reason for discontinuing treatment.This randomized controlled study tested the hypothesis that increased morning bright light, compared to dim light, would result in less fatigue in women with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy.METHODS: Thirty-nine women newly diagnosed with stage I-III breast cancer were randomized to either bright white light (BWL) or dim red light (DRL) treatment and were instructed to use the light box for 30 min every morning throughout the first four cycles of chemotherapy.The Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory was administered prior to the start of chemotherapy (baseline), during the chemotherapy treatment week of cycle 1 (C1TW), the last week (recovery week) of cycle 1 (C1RW), the chemotherapy treatment week of cycle 4 (C4TW), and the last week (recovery week) of cycle 4 (C4RW).RESULTS: The DRL group reported increased fatigue at C1TW (p = 0.003) and C4TW (p < 0.001) compared to baseline, while there was no significant change from baseline in the BWL group.A secondary analysis showed that the increases in fatigue levels in the DRL group were not mediated through nor associated with changes in sleep or in circadian rhythms as measured with wrist actigraphy.CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that morning bright light treatment may prevent overall fatigue from worsening during chemotherapy.Although our hypothesis that overall fatigue would improve with bright light treatment was not supported, the lack of deterioration in total fatigue scores suggests that bright morning light may be a useful intervention during chemotherapy for breast cancer.",0,0,0,0
28807031,"Inflammation and pro-resolution inflammation after hepatobiliary surgery.BACKGROUND: The magnitude of the perioperative inflammatory response plays a role in surgical outcomes.However, few studies have explored the mechanisms of the resolution of inflammation in the context of surgery.Here, we described the temporal kinetics of interleukin-6, cortisol, lipoxin A4, and resolvin D in patients who underwent oncologic liver resections.METHODS: All patients gave written informed consent.Demographic and perioperative surgical data were collected, along with blood samples, before surgery and on the mornings of postoperative days 1, 3, and 5.Interleukin-6, cortisol, lipoxin-A4, and resolvin D were measured in plasma.A P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.RESULTS: Forty-one patients were included in the study.Liver resection for colorectal metastatic disease was the most commonly performed surgery.The plasma concentrations of interleukin-6 were highest on day 1 after surgery and remained higher than the baseline up to postoperative day 1.Postoperative complications occurred in 14 (24%) patients.Cortisol concentrations spiked on postoperative day 1.The concentrations of lipoxin A4 and resolvin D were lowest on day 1 after surgery.CONCLUSIONS: The inflammatory response associated with hepatobiliary surgery is associated with low circulating concentrations of lipoxin A4 and resolvin D that mirror, in an opposite manner, the kinetics of interleukin 6 and cortisol.TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT01438476.",0,0,0,0

31526892,"Impact of choice of volumetry software and nodule management guidelines on recall rates in lung cancer screening.PURPOSE: Appropriate lung nodule management is essential to minimizing unnecessary patient recall in lung cancer screening.Two European guidelines provide differing recommendations in that participants with nodules >/=100 mm(3) or >/=80 mm(3) respectively should be recalled, at baseline.Nodule size estimation is known to vary between volumetry software packages (VSPs).The aim of this study was to examine the impact of choice of VSP on participant recall rates, when applying different European nodule management guidelines.An additional aim was to compare recall rates between 7 VSPs and manual diameter measurements.METHODS: 156 small-sized lung nodules (50-150 mm(3)) from the UK Lung Screening trial were measured using 7 different VSPs (VSP1-7) and also using manual diameter.The type of VSP used in the NELSON study (VSP1), on which European nodule management guidelines are based, provided the reference standard.Nodule size was compared using Bland Altman, and recall rates by Mcnemar's test.RESULTS: Compared to the reference standard, a 100 mm(3) threshold for recall, resulted in no difference in recall rates only for VSP 5 & 7.Using an 80mm(3) threshold resulted in no difference in recall rates for VSP2 & 6.Recall rates were significantly higher for VSP 4 regardless of threshold and when using manual diameter measurements.CONCLUSIONS: Appropriate nodule size thresholds for recall in screening depend on the type of volumetry software used.The results highlight the importance of benchmarking of volumetry packages.",0,0,0,0

31468214,"Assessment of DIEP Flap Perfusion with Intraoperative Indocyanine Green Fluorescence Imaging in Vasopressor-Dominated Hemodynamic Support Versus Liberal Fluid Administration: A Randomized Controlled Trial With Breast Cancer Patients.BACKGROUND: Dogmatic denial of vasopressor agents for blood pressure regulation during free-flap surgery is associated with concomitant large-volume intraoperative fluid administration.Yet, the doctrinal banning of vasopressors during microvascular breast reconstruction still is a subject of controversy.Several retrospective observations have recently drawn attention to serious iatrogenic consequences of intravenous crystalloid overload in microsurgery such as thrombus formation and increased flap failure rates.METHODS: This prospective randomized controlled trial investigated the potential effects of fluid-restrictive vasopressor-dominated hemodynamic support (FRV) compared with vasopressor-restrictive liberal fluid administration (LFA) on clinically relevant perfusion of the deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap via intraoperative indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging.The primary end point of the study was quantitative assessment of the percentage of insufficiently perfused tissue (NP) on the overall flap.Major complications were assessed as secondary end points.RESULTS: In 44 DIEP flap breast reconstructions after mastectomy, FRV circulatory support resulted in no statistically significant difference in total flap perfusion as detected via ICG fluorescence imaging in direct comparison with a traditional LFA strategy (NPFRV, 31.8% +/- 12.2% vs NPLFA, 29.5% +/- 13.3%; p = 0.559).One flap failure was registered with LFA, whereas no major complication occurred in the FRV cohort.CONCLUSIONS: According to the results of this study, neither a norepinephrine concentration of 0.065 +/- 0.020 mug/kg/min (FRV) nor fluid administration of 5.1 +/- 2.2 ml/kg/h (LFA) has a clinically significant impact on microperfusion in a standard DIEP flap procedure for breast reconstruction.Consistent with the current literature reporting a rise in complications with intraoperative fluid over-resuscitation, one flap failure occurred in the LFA cohort.",0,0,0,0
28049139,"A randomized phase 2 study of MK-2206 versus everolimus in refractory renal cell carcinoma.Background: Activation of the phosphoinisitide-3 kinase (PI3K) pathway through mutation and constitutive upregulation has been described in renal cell carcinoma (RCC), making it an attractive target for therapeutic intervention.We performed a randomized phase II study in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy refractory patients to determine whether MK-2206, an allosteric inhibitor of AKT, was more efficacious than the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor everolimus.Patients and methods: A total of 43 patients were randomized in a 2:1 distribution, with 29 patients assigned to the MK-2206 arm and 14 to the everolimus arm.Progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary endpoint.Results: The trial was closed at the first futility analysis with an observed PFS of 3.68 months in the MK-2206 arm and 5.98 months in the everolimus arm.Dichotomous response rate profiles were seen in the MK-2206 arm with one complete response and three partial responses in the MK-2206 arm versus none in the everolimus arm.On the other hand, progressive disease was best response in 44.8% of MK2206 versus 14.3% of everolimus-treated patients.MK-2206 induced significantly more rash and pruritis than everolimus, and dose reduction occurred in 37.9% of MK-2206 versus 21.4% of everolimus-treated patients.Genomic analysis revealed that 57.1% of the patients in the PD group had either deleterious TP53 mutations or ATM mutations or deletions.In contrast, none of the patients in the non-PD group had TP53 or ATM defects.No predictive marker for response was observed in this small dataset.Conclusions: Dichotomous outcomes are observed when VEGF therapy refractory patients are treated with MK-2206, and MK-2206 does not demonstrate superiority to everolimus.Additionally, mutations in DNA repair genes are associated with early disease progression, indicating that dysregulation of DNA repair is associated with a more aggressive tumor phenotype in RCC.",1,1,1,1

22488488,"The impact of PLCO control arm contamination on perceived PSA screening efficacy.PURPOSE: To quantify the extent to which a clinically significant prostate cancer mortality reduction due to screening could have been masked by control arm screening (contamination) in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) trial.METHODS: We used three independently developed models of prostate cancer natural history to conduct a virtual PLCO trial.Simulated participants underwent pre-trial screening based on population patterns.The intervention arm followed observed compliance during the trial then resumed population screening.A contaminated control arm followed observed contamination during the trial then resumed population screening, while an uncontaminated control arm discontinued screening upon entry.We assumed a clinically significant screening benefit, applied population treatments and survival patterns, and calculated mortality rate ratios relative to the contaminated and uncontaminated control arms.RESULTS: The virtual trial reproduced observed incidence, including stage and grade distributions, and control arm mortality after 10 years of complete follow-up.Under the assumed screening benefit, the three models found that contamination increased the mortality rate ratio from 0.68-0.77 to 0.86-0.91, increased the chance of excess mortality in the intervention arm from 0-4 % to 15-28 %, and decreased the power of the trial to detect a mortality difference from 40-70 % to 9-25 %.CONCLUSIONS: Our computer simulation models indicate that contamination substantially limited the ability of the PLCO to identify a clinically significant screening benefit.While the trial shows annual screening does not reduce mortality relative to population screening, contamination prevents concluding whether screening reduces mortality relative to no screening.",0,0,0,0
25087182,"Severe hypertriglyceridaemia during therapy for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.BACKGROUND: Asparaginase and steroids can cause hypertriglyceridaemia in children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL).There are no guidelines for screening or management of patients with severe hypertriglyceridaemia (>1000mg/dL) during ALL therapy.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fasting lipid profiles were obtained prospectively at four time-points for 257 children consecutively enrolled on a frontline ALL study.Risk factors were evaluated by the exact chi-square test.Details of adverse events and management of hypertriglyceridaemia were extracted retrospectively.RESULTS: Eighteen of 257 (7%) patients developed severe hypertriglyceridaemia.Older age and treatment with higher doses of asparaginase and steroids on the standard/high-risk arm were significant risk factors.Severe hypertriglyceridaemia was not associated with pancreatitis after adjustment for age and treatment arm or with osteonecrosis after adjustment for age.However, patients with severe hypertriglyceridaemia had a 2.5-3 times higher risk of thrombosis compared to patients without, albeit the difference was not statistically significant.Of the 30 episodes of severe hypertriglyceridaemia in 18 patients, seven were managed conservatively while the others with pharmacotherapy.Seventeen of 18 patients continued to receive asparaginase and steroids.Triglyceride levels normalised after completion of ALL therapy in all 12 patients with available measurements.CONCLUSION: Asparaginase- and steroid-induced transient hypertriglyceridaemia can be adequately managed with dietary modifications and close monitoring without altering chemotherapy.Patients with severe hypertriglyceridaemia were not at increased risk of adverse events, with a possible exception of thrombosis.The benefit of pharmacotherapy in decreasing symptoms and potential complications requires further investigation.",0,0,0,0
29522362,"Quality of Life During Treatment With Chemohormonal Therapy: Analysis of E3805 Chemohormonal Androgen Ablation Randomized Trial in Prostate Cancer.Purpose Chemohormonal therapy with docetaxel and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT+D) for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer improves overall survival as compared with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) alone.We compared the quality of life (QOL) between patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer who were treated with ADT+D and those who were treated with ADT alone.Methods Men were randomly assigned to ADT+ D (six cycles) or to ADT alone.QOL was assessed by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P), FACT-Taxane, Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue, and the Brief Pain Inventory at baseline and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to examine changes over time.Mixed-effect models compared the QOL between arms at each time point.Results Seven hundred ninety men were randomly assigned (ADT+D [n = 397] and ADT[ n = 393]) and completed FACT-P (90% at baseline, 86% at 3 months, 83% at 6 months, 78% at 9 months, and 77% at 12 months).ADT+D patients reported a statistically significant decline in FACT-P at 3 months ( P < .001) but FACT-P did not differ significantly between baseline and 12 months ( P = .38).ADT+D FACT-P scores were significantly lower at 3 months ( P = .02) but significantly higher at 12 months ( P = .04) when compared with ADT FACT-P scores.Differences did not exceed the minimal clinically important difference at any time point.ADT+D patients reported significantly lower Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue scores at 3 months than did ADT patients ( P < .001).Over time, both arms reported significantly poorer FACT-Taxane scores ( P < .001) when compared with baseline.Brief Pain Inventory scores were similar between arms.Conclusion Although ADT+D was associated with statistically worse QOL at 3 months, QOL was better at 12 months for ADT+D patients than for ADT patients.Both arms reported a similar minimally changed QOL over time, suggesting that ADT+D is not associated with a greater long-term negative impact on QOL.",1,1,1,1
28574779,"HELOISE: Phase IIIb Randomized Multicenter Study Comparing Standard-of-Care and Higher-Dose Trastuzumab Regimens Combined With Chemotherapy as First-Line Therapy in Patients With Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2-Positive Metastatic Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma.Purpose To compare standard-of-care (SoC) trastuzumab plus chemotherapy with higher-dose (HD) trastuzumab plus chemotherapy to investigate whether HD trastuzumab increases trastuzumab serum trough concentration (Ctrough) levels and increases overall survival (OS) in first-line human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.Patients and Methods Patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 2, no prior gastrectomy, and >/= two metastatic sites were randomly assigned at a one-to-one ratio to loading-dose trastuzumab 8 mg/kg followed by SoC trastuzumab maintenance 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks or loading-dose trastuzumab 8 mg/kg followed by HD trastuzumab maintenance 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks until progression; treatment in each arm was combined with cisplatin 80 mg/m(2) plus capecitabine 800 mg/m(2) twice per day in cycles 1 to 6.The primary objective was HD trastuzumab OS superiority (all randomly assigned patients [full-analysis set]).Final results are from an interim analysis for futility (boundary hazard ratio [HR] >/= 0.95) at 125 deaths.Results At clinical cutoff, 248 patients had been randomly assigned.A marked increase in mean trastuzumab Ctrough was observed after the first HD trastuzumab cycle versus SoC trastuzumab.In the full-analysis set, median OS was 12.5 months in the SoC trastuzumab arm and 10.6 months in the HD trastuzumab arm (stratified HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 0.86 to 1.78; P = .2401).Results were similar in the per-protocol set (cycle 1 trastuzumab Ctrough < 12 microg/mL).Safety was comparable between arms.Conclusion HD trastuzumab maintenance dosing was associated with higher trastuzumab concentrations, no increased efficacy, and no new safety signals.HELOISE confirms standard-dose trastuzumab (loading dose of 8 mg/kg followed by 6 mg/kg maintenance dose every 3 weeks) with chemotherapy as the SoC for first-line treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.",1,1,1,1
28679552,"Randomized controlled trial of dietary fiber for the prevention of radiation-induced gastrointestinal toxicity during pelvic radiotherapy.Background: Therapeutic radiotherapy is an important treatment of pelvic cancers.Historically, low-fiber diets have been recommended despite a lack of evidence and potentially beneficial mechanisms of fiber.Objective: This randomized controlled trial compared low-, habitual-, and high-fiber diets for the prevention of gastrointestinal toxicity in patients undergoing pelvic radiotherapy.Design: Patients were randomly assigned to low-fiber [</=10 g nonstarch polysaccharide (NSP)/d], habitual-fiber (control), or high-fiber (>/=18 g NSP/d) diets and received individualized counseling at the start of radiotherapy to achieve these targets.The primary endpoint was the difference between groups in the change in the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire-Bowel Subset (IBDQ-B) score between the starting and nadir (worst) score during treatment.Other measures included macronutrient intake, stool diaries, and fecal short-chain fatty acid concentrations.Results: Patients were randomly assigned to low-fiber (n = 55), habitual-fiber (n = 55), or high-fiber (n = 56) dietary advice.Fiber intakes were significantly different between groups (P < 0.001).The difference between groups in the change in IBDQ-B scores between the start and nadir was not significant (P = 0.093).However, the change in score between the start and end of radiotherapy was smaller in the high-fiber group (mean +/- SD: -3.7 +/- 12.8) than in the habitual-fiber group (-10.8 +/-13.5; P = 0.011).At 1-y postradiotherapy (n = 126) the difference in IBDQ-B scores between the high-fiber (+0.1 +/- 14.5) and the habitual-fiber (-8.4 +/- 13.3) groups was significant (P = 0.004).No significant differences were observed in stool frequency or form or in short-chain fatty acid concentrations.Significant reductions in energy, protein, and fat intake occurred in the low- and habitual-fiber groups only.Conclusions: Dietary advice to follow a high-fiber diet during pelvic radiotherapy resulted in reduced gastrointestinal toxicity both acutely and at 1 y compared with habitual-fiber intake.Restrictive, non-evidence-based advice to reduce fiber intake in this setting should be abandoned.This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT 01170299.",1,1,0,0

23017529,"Perioperative outcomes and oncologic efficacy from a pilot prospective randomized clinical trial of open versus robotic assisted radical cystectomy.PURPOSE: Robotic assisted laparoscopic radical cystectomy for bladder cancer has been reported with potential for improvement in perioperative morbidity compared to the open approach.However, most studies are retrospective with significant selection bias.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A pilot prospective randomized trial evaluating perioperative outcomes and oncologic efficacy of open vs robotic assisted laparoscopic radical cystectomy for consecutive patients was performed from July 2009 to June 2011.RESULTS: To date 47 patients have been randomized with data available on 40 patients for analysis.Each group was similar with regard to age, gender, race, body mass index and comorbidities, as well as previous surgeries, operative time, postoperative complications and final pathological stage.We observed no significant differences between oncologic outcomes of positive margins (5% each, p = 0.50) or number of lymph nodes removed for open radical cystectomy (23, IQR 15-28) vs robotic assisted laparoscopic radical cystectomy (11, IQR 8.75-21.5) groups (p = 0.135).The robotic assisted laparoscopic radical cystectomy group (400 ml, IQR 300-762.5) was noted to have decreased estimated blood loss compared to the open radical cystectomy group (800 ml, IQR 400-1,100) and trended toward a decreased rate of excessive length of stay (greater than 5 days) (65% vs 90%, p = 0.11) compared to the open radical cystectomy group.The robotic group also trended toward fewer transfusions (40% vs 50%, p = 0.26).CONCLUSIONS: Our study validates the concept of randomizing patients with bladder cancer undergoing radical cystectomy to an open or robotic approach.Our results suggest no significant differences in surrogates of oncologic efficacy.Robotic assisted laparoscopic radical cystectomy demonstrates potential benefits of decreased estimated blood loss and decreased hospital stay compared to open radical cystectomy.Our results need to be validated in a larger multicenter prospective randomized clinical trial.",1,1,0,0
23850170,"Which patients benefit most from primary surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy in stage IIIC or IV ovarian cancer? An exploratory analysis of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer 55971 randomised trial.BACKGROUND: To investigate whether biomarkers consisting of baseline characteristics of advanced stage ovarian cancer patients can help in identifying subgroups of patients who would benefit more from primary surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy.METHODS: We used data of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 55971 trial in which 670 patients were randomly assigned to primary surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy.The primary outcome was overall survival.Ten baseline clinical and pathological characteristics were selected as potential biomarkers.Using Subpopulation Treatment Effect Pattern Plots (STEPP), biomarkers with a statistically significant qualitative additive interaction with treatment were considered as potentially informative for treatment selection.We also combined selected biomarkers to form a multimarker treatment selection rule.FINDINGS: The size of the largest metastatic tumour and clinical stage were significantly associated with the magnitude of the benefit from treatment, in terms of five-year survival (p for interaction: 0.008 and 0.016, respectively).Stage IIIC patients with metastatic tumours 45 mm benefited more from primary surgery while stage IV patients with metastatic tumours >45 mm benefited more from neoadjuvant chemotherapy.In stage IIIC patients with larger metastatic tumours and in stage IV patients with less extensive metastatic tumours both treatments were equally effective.We estimated that by selecting treatments for patients based on largest metastatic tumour and clinical stage, the potential five-year survival rate in the population of treated patients would be 27.3% (95% confidence interval (CI) 21.9-33.0), 7.8% higher than if all were treated with primary surgery, and 5.6% higher if all were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.INTERPRETATION: Although survival was comparable after primary surgery and neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the overall group of patients with ovarian cancer in the EORTC 55971 trial, we found in this exploratory analysis that patients with stage IIIC and less extensive metastatic tumours had higher survival with primary surgery, while patients with stage IV disease and large metastatic tumours had higher survival with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.For patients who did not meet these criteria, both treatment options led to comparable survival rates.",1,1,1,1

26953983,"Pathologic Complete Response in Rectal Cancer: Can We Detect It? Lessons Learned From a Proposed Randomized Trial of Watch-and-Wait Treatment of Rectal Cancer.BACKGROUND: Chemoradiotherapy has the potential to downsize and downstage tumors before surgery, decrease locoregional recurrence, and induce a complete sterilization of tumor cells for middle and low locally advanced rectal cancer.A watch-and-wait tactic has been proposed for patients with clinical complete response.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to verify our ability to identify complete clinical response in patients with rectal cancer based on clinical and radiologic criteria.DESIGN: This was a prospective study.SETTINGS: The study was conducted at a single institution, in the setting of a watch-and-wait randomized trial.PATIENTS: Consecutive patients with stage T3 to T4N0M0 or T(any)N+M0 cancer located within 10 cm from anal verge or T2N0 within 7 cm from anal verge were included in the study.Patients were staged and restaged 8 weeks after completion of chemoradiation (5-fluorouracil, 5040 cGy) by digital examination, colonoscopy, pelvic MRI, and thorax and abdominal CT scans.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical and radiologic judgments of tumor response were compared with pathologic response of patients treated by total mesorectal excision or clinical follow-up of patients selected for nonoperative treatment.RESULTS: A total of 118 patients were treated.Six patients were considered clinic complete responders (2 randomly assigned for surgery (1 ypT0N0 and 1 ypT2N0) and 4 patients randomly assigned for observation (3 sustained clinic complete response and 1 had tumor regrowth)).The 112 clinic incomplete responders underwent total mesorectal excision, and 18 revealed pathologic complete response.These 18 patients were not considered complete responders at restaging because they presented at least 1 of the following conditions: mucosal ulceration and/or deformity and/or substenosis of rectal lumen at digital rectal examination and colonoscopy (n = 16), ymrT1 to T4 (n = 16), ymrN+ (n = 2), involvement of circumferential resection margin on MRI (n = 3), extramural vascular invasion on MRI (n = 4), MRI tumor response grade 2 to 4 (n = 15), and pelvic side wall lymph node involvement on MRI (n = 1).Sensitivity for identification of ypT0N0 or sustained clinic complete response was 18.2%.LIMITATIONS: This study has a short follow-up and small sample size.Radiologists who reviewed the restaging examination were not blinded to the pretreatment stage.Only 1 radiologist read the images of each patient.CONCLUSIONS: Evaluation of clinic complete response according to current adopted criteria has low sensitivity because pathologic complete response more frequently presented as clinic incomplete response (see Video, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/DCR/A221).",0,0,0,0
30807234,"Cyclin E1 Expression and Palbociclib Efficacy in Previously Treated Hormone Receptor-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer.PURPOSE: A large-panel gene expression analysis was conducted to identify biomarkers associated with the effectiveness of adding palbociclib to fulvestrant.METHODS: The PALOMA-3 ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01942135) trial randomly assigned 521 endocrine-pretreated patients with metastatic breast cancer to receive palbociclib plus fulvestrant or placebo plus fulvestrant.Primary analysis was first conducted on 10 genes on the basis of pathway biology and evidence from previous studies followed by a systematic panel-wide search among 2,534 cancer-related genes.The association of gene expression with the effect of palbociclib on progression-free survival (PFS) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, with gene expression as a continuous variable or dichotomized by median.An independent breast cancer cohort from the Preoperative Palbociclib (POP) Clinical Trial ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02008734) was used for validation, in 61 patients with primary breast cancer treated with 2 weeks of palbociclib.RESULTS: In the PALOMA-3 trial, 302 patients had tumor tissue analyzed (palbociclib arm, 194 patients; placebo arm, 108 patients).Palbociclib efficacy was lower in patients with high versus low cyclin E1 (CCNE1) mRNA expression (median PFS: palbociclib arm, 7.6 v 14.1 months; placebo arm, 4.0 v 4.8 months, respectively; interaction P unadjusted = .00238; false discovery rate-adjusted P = .0238).CCNE1 mRNA was more predictive in metastatic than in archival primary biopsy tissue samples.No significant interaction was found between treatment and expression levels of CDK4, CDK6, cyclin D1, and RB1.Palbociclib was efficacious in both luminal A and luminal B tumors.High CCNE1 mRNA expression was associated with poor antiproliferative activity of palbociclib in the POP trial (P = .005).CONCLUSION: Addition of palbociclib to fulvestrant demonstrated efficacy in all biomarker groups, although high CCNE1 mRNA expression was associated with relative resistance to palbociclib.",1,1,1,1
29332135,"Sequential versus simultaneous use of chemotherapy and gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) among estrogen receptor (ER)-positive premenopausal breast cancer patients: effects on ovarian function, disease-free survival, and overall survival.OBJECTIVE: To investigate ovarian function and therapeutic efficacy among estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, premenopausal breast cancer patients treated with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) and chemotherapy simultaneously or sequentially.METHOD: This study was a phase 3, open-label, parallel, randomized controlled trial (NCT01712893).Two hundred sixteen premenopausal patients (under 45 years) diagnosed with invasive ER-positive breast cancer were enrolled from July 2009 to May 2013 and randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy combined with sequential or simultaneous GnRHa treatment.All patients were advised to receive GnRHa for at least 2 years.The primary outcome was the incidence of early menopause, defined as amenorrhea lasting longer than 12 months after the last chemotherapy or GnRHa dose, with postmenopausal or unknown follicle-stimulating hormone and estradiol levels.The menstrual resumption period and survivals were the secondary endpoints.RESULT: The median follow-up time was 56.9 months (IQR 49.5-72.4 months).One hundred and eight patients were enrolled in each group.Among them, 92 and 78 patients had complete primary endpoint data in the sequential and simultaneous groups, respectively.The rates of early menopause were 22.8% (21/92) in the sequential group and 23.1% (18/78) in the simultaneous group [simultaneous vs. sequential: OR 1.01 (95% CI 0.50-2.08); p = 0.969; age-adjusted OR 1.13; (95% CI 0.54-2.37); p = 0.737].The median menstruation resumption period was 12.0 (95% CI 9.3-14.7) months and 10.3 (95% CI 8.2-12.4) months for the sequential and simultaneous groups, respectively [HR 0.83 (95% CI 0.59-1.16); p = 0.274; age-adjusted HR 0.90 (95%CI 0.64-1.27); p = 0.567].No significant differences were evident for disease-free survival (p = 0.290) or overall survival (p = 0.514) between the two groups.CONCLUSION: For ER-positive premenopausal patients, the sequential use of GnRHa and chemotherapy showed ovarian preservation and survival outcomes that were no worse than simultaneous use.The application of GnRHa can probably be delayed until menstruation resumption after chemotherapy.",1,1,1,1
25788492,"A Phase I/II Trial of BNC105P with Everolimus in Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma.PURPOSE: BNC105P inhibits tubulin polymerization, and preclinical studies suggest possible synergy with everolimus.In this phase I/II study, efficacy and safety of the combination were explored in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC).EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A phase I study in patients with clear cell mRCC and any prior number of therapies was conducted using a classical 3 + 3 design to evaluate standard doses of everolimus with increasing doses of BNC105P.At the recommended phase II dose (RP2D), patients with clear cell mRCC and one to two prior therapies (including >/= 1 VEGF-TKI) were randomized to BNC105P with everolimus (arm A) or everolimus alone (arm B).The primary endpoint of the study was 6-month progression-free survival (6MPFS).Secondary endpoints included response rate, PFS, overall survival, and exploratory biomarker analyses.RESULTS: In the phase I study (N = 15), a dose of BNC105P at 16 mg/m(2) with everolimus at 10 mg daily was identified as the RP2D.In the phase II study, 139 patients were randomized, with 69 and 67 evaluable patients in arms A and B, respectively.6MPFS was similar in the treatment arms (arm A: 33.82% vs. arm B: 30.30%, P = 0.66) and no difference in median PFS was observed (arm A: 4.7 mos vs. arm B: 4.1 mos; P = 0.49).Changes in matrix metalloproteinase-9, stem cell factor, sex hormone-binding globulin, and serum amyloid A protein were associated with clinical outcome with BNC105P.CONCLUSIONS: Although the primary endpoint was not met in an unselected population, correlative studies suggest several biomarkers that warrant further prospective evaluation.",1,1,1,1
24903230,"Effect of inspiration on airway dimensions measured in maximal inspiration CT images of subjects without airflow limitation.OBJECTIVES: To study the effect of inspiration on airway dimensions measured in voluntary inspiration breath-hold examinations.METHODS: 961 subjects with normal spirometry were selected from the Danish Lung Cancer Screening Trial.Subjects were examined annually for five years with low-dose CT.Automated software was utilized to segment lungs and airways, identify segmental bronchi, and match airway branches in all images of the same subject.Inspiration level was defined as segmented total lung volume (TLV) divided by predicted total lung capacity (pTLC).Mixed-effects models were used to predict relative change in lumen diameter (ALD) and wall thickness (AWT) in airways of generation 0 (trachea) to 7 and segmental bronchi (R1-R10 and L1-L10) from relative changes in inspiration level.RESULTS: Relative changes in ALD were related to relative changes in TLV/pTLC, and this distensibility increased with generation (p < 0.001).Relative changes in AWT were inversely related to relative changes in TLV/pTLC in generation 3--7 (p < 0.001).Segmental bronchi were widely dispersed in terms of ALD (5.7 +/- 0.7 mm), AWT (0.86 +/- 0.07 mm), and distensibility (23.5 +/- 7.7%).CONCLUSIONS: Subjects who inspire more deeply prior to imaging have larger ALD and smaller AWT.This effect is more pronounced in higher-generation airways.Therefore, adjustment of inspiration level is necessary to accurately assess airway dimensions.KEY POINTS: Airway lumen diameter increases and wall thickness decreases with inspiration.The effect of inspiration is greater in higher-generation (more peripheral) airways.Airways of generation 5 and beyond are as distensible as lung parenchyma.Airway dimensions measured from CT should be adjusted for inspiration level.",0,0,0,0
24246414,"Long-term results of the Dutch randomized prostate cancer trial: impact of dose-escalation on local, biochemical, clinical failure, and survival.PURPOSE: Nowadays, advanced irradiation techniques make it possible to escalate safely the dose in prostate cancer.We studied the effect of a higher dose on tumor control in a randomized trial with a median follow-up of 110 months.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with T1b-T4N0 prostate cancer (n=664) were randomized between 78 Gy and 68 Gy.Primary endpoint was biochemical and/or clinical failure (BCF) according to the American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology (ASTRO) guidelines (3 consecutive rises), and to Phoenix (nadir plus 2 mug/L).Secondary endpoints were clinical failure (CF), local failure (LF), prostate cancer death (PCD), and overall survival (OS).Explorative subgroup analyses were performed.RESULTS: BCF rate (HR=0.8; 20% less events) and LF rate (HR=0.5; 50% less events) were significantly lower in the 78 Gy arm (p<0.05).CF, PCD and OS were similar in both arms.A significant heterogeneity of treatment effect was found for PSA cutoffs between 7 and 10 mug/L. CONCLUSION: We observed significantly less BCF and LF in the high-dose arm.This suggests improvement of the therapeutic ratio.However, we observed similar rates of CF and PCD at the current update.More follow-up is needed to investigate which patients benefit in terms of prolonged OS.",0,0,0,0
25213871,"Post Hoc analyses of intention-to-treat population in phase III comparison of NovoTTF-100A system versus best physician's choice chemotherapy.We performed a treatment-based analysis of data from the pivotal phase III trial of the NovoTTF-100A System versus best physician's choice (BPC) chemotherapy in patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), with particular focus on efficacy in patients using NovoTTF Therapy as intended.Median overall survival (OS) was compared for recurrent GBM patients receiving at least one full cycle of treatment with NovoTTF-100A System or BPC chemotherapy (modified intention-to-treat [mITT] population) in the recently reported phase III trial.The relationship between NovoTTF-100A System compliance and OS was evaluated in the ITT population.Kaplan-Meier analyses examined treatment-related differences in OS for various patient subgroups.Median OS was significantly higher in patients receiving>/=1 course of NovoTTF Therapy versus BPC (7.7 v 5.9 months; hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52-0.91; P = .0093).Median OS was also significantly higher in patients receiving NovoTTF Therapy with a maximal monthly compliance rate>/=75% (>/=18 hours daily) versus those with a<75% compliance rate (7.7 v 4.5 months; P = .042), and Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated a significant trend for improved median OS with higher compliance (P = .039).Additional post hoc analysis showed significantly higher median OS with NovoTTF Therapy than with BPC for patients with prior low-grade glioma, tumor size>/=18 cm(2), Karnofsky performance status>/=80, and those who had previously failed bevacizumab therapy.When used as intended in mITT patients with recurrent GBM, NovoTTF Therapy provides an OS benefit compared with chemotherapy in patients with recurrent GBM.This contrasts with the equivalent efficacy reported previously based on analysis of all randomized ITT subjects, including many who did not receive a full cycle of treatment.Higher NovoTTF Therapy compliance corresponds with greater survival benefit in the present study.",0,0,0,0
32500650,"Long-term health-related quality of life among men with prostate cancer in the Finnish randomized study of screening for prostate cancer.BACKGROUND: The long-term health-related quality of life (HRQOL) impacts of PCa screening have not been adequately evaluated.We aimed to compare the generic and disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQOL) among men with prostate cancer in the screening arm with the control arm of the PSA-based prostate cancer screening trial in up to 15 years of follow-up.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was conducted within population-based Finnish Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (FinRSPC).During 1996-1999 80,458 men were randomized to the serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening arm (SA, N = 32 000) and the control arm (CA, N = 48 458).Men in the screening arm were screened at 4-year intervals until 2007.HRQOL questionnaires were delivered to newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients in the screening and control arm 1996-2006 (N = 5128) at the time of diagnosis (baseline), at 3-month, 12-month and 5, 10, and 15-year follow-up.Validated UCLA Prostate Cancer Index (UCLA-PCI) and RAND 36-Item Health Survey were used for HRQOL assessment.The data were analyzed with a random effects model for repeated measures.RESULTS: At baseline, men with prostate cancer in the screening arm reported better Sexual Function, as well as less Sexual and Urinary Bother.Long-term follow-up revealed slightly higher HRQOL scores in the screening arm in prostate cancer specific measures at 10-year post diagnosis, but the differences were statistically significant only in Urinary Bother (UCLA-PCI score 77.9; 95% CI 75.2 to 80.5 vs. 70.9; 95% CI 66.8 to 74.9 P = .005).The generic HRQOL scores were comparable between the trial arms.The overall differences in disease-specific or generic HRQOL scores by trial arm did not vary during the follow-up.CONCLUSION: No major differences were observed in HRQOL in men with prostate cancer between the prostate cancer screening and control arms during five to 15-year follow-up.",0,0,0,0
27339115,"Conventional versus hypofractionated high-dose intensity-modulated radiotherapy for prostate cancer: 5-year outcomes of the randomised, non-inferiority, phase 3 CHHiP trial.BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer might have high radiation-fraction sensitivity that would give a therapeutic advantage to hypofractionated treatment.We present a pre-planned analysis of the efficacy and side-effects of a randomised trial comparing conventional and hypofractionated radiotherapy after 5 years follow-up.METHODS: CHHiP is a randomised, phase 3, non-inferiority trial that recruited men with localised prostate cancer (pT1b-T3aN0M0).Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to conventional (74 Gy delivered in 37 fractions over 7.4 weeks) or one of two hypofractionated schedules (60 Gy in 20 fractions over 4 weeks or 57 Gy in 19 fractions over 3.8 weeks)all delivered with intensity-modulated techniques.Most patients were given radiotherapy with 3-6 months of neoadjuvant and concurrent androgen suppression.Randomisation was by computer-generated random permuted blocks, stratified by National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk group and radiotherapy treatment centre, and treatment allocation was not masked.The primary endpoint was time to biochemical or clinical failure; the critical hazard ratio (HR) for non-inferiority was 1.208.Analysis was by intention to treat.Long-term follow-up continues.The CHHiP trial is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN97182923.FINDINGS: Between Oct 18, 2002, and June 17, 2011, 3216 men were enrolled from 71 centres and randomly assigned (74 Gy group, 1065 patients; 60 Gy group, 1074 patients; 57 Gy group, 1077 patients).Median follow-up was 62.4 months (IQR 53.9-77.0).The proportion of patients who were biochemical or clinical failure free at 5 years was 88.3% (95% CI 86.0-90.2) in the 74 Gy group, 90.6% (88.5-92.3) in the 60 Gy group, and 85.9% (83.4-88.0) in the 57 Gy group.60 Gy was non-inferior to 74 Gy (HR 0.84 [90% CI 0.68-1.03], pNI=0.0018) but non-inferiority could not be claimed for 57 Gy compared with 74 Gy (HR 1.20 [0.99-1.46], pNI=0.48).Long-term side-effects were similar in the hypofractionated groups compared with the conventional group.There were no significant differences in either the proportion or cumulative incidence of side-effects 5 years after treatment using three clinician-reported as well as patient-reported outcome measures.The estimated cumulative 5 year incidence of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) grade 2 or worse bowel and bladder adverse events was 13.7% (111 events) and 9.1% (66 events) in the 74 Gy group, 11.9% (105 events) and 11.7% (88 events) in the 60 Gy group, 11.3% (95 events) and 6.6% (57 events) in the 57 Gy group, respectively.No treatment-related deaths were reported.INTERPRETATION: Hypofractionated radiotherapy using 60 Gy in 20 fractions is non-inferior to conventional fractionation using 74 Gy in 37 fractions and is recommended as a new standard of care for external-beam radiotherapy of localised prostate cancer.FUNDING: Cancer Research UK, Department of Health, and the National Institute for Health Research Cancer Research Network.",1,1,1,1
25662406,"Phase I trial of a cancer vaccine consisting of 20 mixed peptides in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer: dose-related immune boosting and suppression.The heterogeneity expression of tumor-associated antigens (TAA) and variability of human T cell repertoire suggest that effective cancer vaccine requires induction of a wide breadth of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) specificities.This can be achieved with vaccines targeting multiple TAA.We evaluated the safety and immune dynamics of a cancer vaccine consisting of 20 mixed peptides (KRM-20) designed to induce CTLs against 12 different TAA in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).Patients received each of three different randomly assigned doses of KRM-20 (6, 20, or 60 mg) once a week for 6 weeks.KRM-20 was applicable for patients with positive human leukocyte antigen (HLA) A2, A3, A11, A24, A26, A31 or A33 alleles, which cover the majority of the global population.To evaluate the minimum immunological effective dose (MIED), peptide-specific CTL and immunoglobulin G (IgG) responses, and immune suppressive subsets were evaluated during the vaccination.Total of 17 patients was enrolled.No serious adverse drug reactions were encountered.The MIED of KRM-20 in CTL or IgG response calculated by logistic regression model was set as 16 or 1.6 mg, respectively.The frequency of immune suppressive subsets was fewer in the 20 mg cohort than that in 6 or 60 mg cohort.Clinical responses determined by prostate-specific antigen levels were two partial responses (from the 20 mg cohort), five no changes and ten progressive diseases.Twenty milligrams of KRM-20 could be recommended for further studies because of the safety and ability to augment CTL activity.",0,0,0,0

PgR and Ki67 expression were significantly reduced with all treatments (means were -34% to -45%, and -75% to -85%, respectively; all P = 0.0001), with no differences between groups.CONCLUSIONS: In this short-term study, all treatments reduced ER expression, although F and F + A showed greater reductions than A. No significant differences were detected between the treatment groups in terms of PgR and Ki67 expression.No additional reduction in tumor biomarkers with combination treatment was observed, suggesting that F + A is unlikely to have further clinical benefit over F alone.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00259090.",1,1,1,1

31560068,"Addition of docetaxel to hormonal therapy in low- and high-burden metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer: long-term survival results from the STAMPEDE trial.BACKGROUND: STAMPEDE has previously reported that the use of upfront docetaxel improved overall survival (OS) for metastatic hormone naive prostate cancer patients starting long-term androgen deprivation therapy.We report on long-term outcomes stratified by metastatic burden for M1 patients.METHODS: We randomly allocated patients in 2 : 1 ratio to standard-of-care (SOC; control group) or SOC + docetaxel.Metastatic disease burden was categorised using retrospectively-collected baseline staging scans where available.Analysis used Cox regression models, adjusted for stratification factors, with emphasis on restricted mean survival time where hazards were non-proportional.RESULTS: Between 05 October 2005 and 31 March 2013, 1086 M1 patients were randomised to receive SOC (n = 724) or SOC + docetaxel (n = 362).Metastatic burden was assessable for 830/1086 (76%) patients; 362 (44%) had low and 468 (56%) high metastatic burden.Median follow-up was 78.2 months.There were 494 deaths on SOC (41% more than the previous report).There was good evidence of benefit of docetaxel over SOC on OS (HR = 0.81, 95% CI 0.69-0.95, P = 0.009) with no evidence of heterogeneity of docetaxel effect between metastatic burden sub-groups (interaction P = 0.827).Analysis of other outcomes found evidence of benefit for docetaxel over SOC in failure-free survival (HR = 0.66, 95% CI 0.57-0.76, P < 0.001) and progression-free survival (HR = 0.69, 95% CI 0.59-0.81, P < 0.001) with no evidence of heterogeneity of docetaxel effect between metastatic burden sub-groups (interaction P > 0.5 in each case).There was no evidence that docetaxel resulted in late toxicity compared with SOC: after 1 year, G3-5 toxicity was reported for 28% SOC and 27% docetaxel (in patients still on follow-up at 1 year without prior progression).CONCLUSIONS: The clinically significant benefit in survival for upfront docetaxel persists at longer follow-up, with no evidence that benefit differed by metastatic burden.We advocate that upfront docetaxel is considered for metastatic hormone naive prostate cancer patients regardless of metastatic burden.",1,1,1,1
29332135,"Sequential versus simultaneous use of chemotherapy and gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) among estrogen receptor (ER)-positive premenopausal breast cancer patients: effects on ovarian function, disease-free survival, and overall survival.OBJECTIVE: To investigate ovarian function and therapeutic efficacy among estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, premenopausal breast cancer patients treated with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) and chemotherapy simultaneously or sequentially.METHOD: This study was a phase 3, open-label, parallel, randomized controlled trial (NCT01712893).Two hundred sixteen premenopausal patients (under 45 years) diagnosed with invasive ER-positive breast cancer were enrolled from July 2009 to May 2013 and randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy combined with sequential or simultaneous GnRHa treatment.All patients were advised to receive GnRHa for at least 2 years.The primary outcome was the incidence of early menopause, defined as amenorrhea lasting longer than 12 months after the last chemotherapy or GnRHa dose, with postmenopausal or unknown follicle-stimulating hormone and estradiol levels.The menstrual resumption period and survivals were the secondary endpoints.RESULT: The median follow-up time was 56.9 months (IQR 49.5-72.4 months).One hundred and eight patients were enrolled in each group.Among them, 92 and 78 patients had complete primary endpoint data in the sequential and simultaneous groups, respectively.The rates of early menopause were 22.8% (21/92) in the sequential group and 23.1% (18/78) in the simultaneous group [simultaneous vs. sequential: OR 1.01 (95% CI 0.50-2.08); p = 0.969; age-adjusted OR 1.13; (95% CI 0.54-2.37); p = 0.737].The median menstruation resumption period was 12.0 (95% CI 9.3-14.7) months and 10.3 (95% CI 8.2-12.4) months for the sequential and simultaneous groups, respectively [HR 0.83 (95% CI 0.59-1.16); p = 0.274; age-adjusted HR 0.90 (95%CI 0.64-1.27); p = 0.567].No significant differences were evident for disease-free survival (p = 0.290) or overall survival (p = 0.514) between the two groups.CONCLUSION: For ER-positive premenopausal patients, the sequential use of GnRHa and chemotherapy showed ovarian preservation and survival outcomes that were no worse than simultaneous use.The application of GnRHa can probably be delayed until menstruation resumption after chemotherapy.",1,1,1,1
30386984,"Short-term surgical outcomes of laparoscopy-assisted versus open D2 distal gastrectomy for locally advanced gastric cancer in North China: a multicenter randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Although laparoscopic surgery has been recommended as an optional therapy for patients with early gastric cancer, whether patients with locally advanced gastric cancer (AGC) could benefit from laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy (LADG) with D2 lymphadenectomy remains elusive due to a lack of comprehensive clinical data.To evaluate the efficacy of LADG, we conducted a multi-institutional randomized controlled trial to compare laparoscopy-assisted versus open distal gastrectomy (ODG) for AGC in North China.METHODS: In this RCT, after patients were enrolled according to the eligibility criteria, they were preoperatively assigned to LADG or ODG arm randomly with a 1:1 allocation ratio.The primary endpoint was the morbidity and mortality within 30 postoperative days to evaluate the surgical safety of LADG.The secondary endpoint was 3-year disease-free survival.This trial was registered at ClinicalTrial.gov as NCT02464215.RESULTS: Between March 2014 and August 2017, a total of 446 patients with cT2-4aN0-3M0 (AJCC 7th staging system) were enrolled.Of these, 222 patients underwent LADG and 220 patients underwent ODG were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis.The compliance rate of D2 lymph node dissection was identical between the LADG and ODG arms (99.5%, P = 1.000).No significant difference was observed regarding the overall postoperative complication rate in two groups (LADG 13.1%, ODG 17.7%, P = 0.174).No operation-related death occurred in both arms.CONCLUSIONS: This trial confirmed that LADG performed by credentialed surgeons was safe and feasible for patients with AGC compared with conventional ODG.",1,1,1,1

34446053,"Durvalumab (MEDI 4736) in combination with extended neoadjuvant regimens in rectal cancer: a study protocol of a randomised phase II trial (PRIME-RT).BACKGROUND: Advances in multi-modality treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) have resulted in low local recurrence rates, but around 30% of patients will still die from distant metastatic disease.In parallel, there is increasing recognition that with radiotherapy and systemic treatment, some patients achieve a complete response and may avoid surgical resection, including in many cases, the need for a permanent stoma.Extended neoadjuvant regimes have emerged to address these concerns.The inclusion of immunotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting has the potential to further enhance this strategy by priming the local immune microenvironment and engaging the systemic immune response.METHODS: PRIME-RT is a multi-centre, open label, phase II, randomised trial for patients with newly diagnosed LARC.Eligible patients will be randomised to receive either: short course radiotherapy (25 Gray in 5 fractions over one week) with concomitant durvalumab (1500 mg administered intravenously every 4 weeks), followed by FOLFOX (85 mg/m(2) oxaliplatin, 350 mg folinic acid and 400 mg/m(2) bolus 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) given on day 1 followed by 2400 mg/m(2) 5-FU infusion over 46-48 h, all administered intravenously every 2 weeks), and durvalumab, or long course chemoradiotherapy (50 Gray to primary tumour in 25 fractions over 5 weeks with concomitant oral capecitabine 825 mg/m(2) twice per day on days of radiotherapy) with durvalumab followed by FOLFOX and durvalumab.The primary endpoint is complete response rate in each arm.Secondary endpoints include treatment compliance, toxicity, safety, overall recurrence, proportion of patients with a permanent stoma, and survival.The study is translationally rich with collection of bio-specimens prior to, during, and following treatment in order to understand the molecular and immunological factors underpinning treatment response.The trial opened and the first patient was recruited in January 2021.The main trial will recruit up to 42 patients with LARC and commence after completion of a safety run-in that will recruit at least six patients with LARC or metastatic disease.DISCUSSION: PRIME-RT will explore if adding immunotherapy to neoadjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy for patients with LARC can prime the tumour microenvironment to improve complete response rates and stoma free survival.Sequential biopsies are a key component within the trial design that will provide new knowledge on how the tumour microenvironment changes at different time-points in response to multi-modality treatment.This expectation is that the trial will provide information to test this treatment within a large phase clinical trial.Trial registration Clinicaltrials.gov NCT04621370 (Registered 9th Nov 2020) EudraCT number 2019-001471-36 (Registered 6th Nov 2020).",1,1,1,1

A prospective, randomized trial.BACKGROUND: Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (E.R.A.S.) programs are now widely accepted in colonic laparoscopic resections because of faster recovery and less perioperative complications.The aim of this study was to assess safety and feasibility of discharging patients operated on by laparoscopic colectomy on postoperative day 2, so long as the first flatus has passed and in the absence of complication-related symptoms.METHODS: This study was a non-inferiority, open-label, single-center, prospective, randomized study comparing ""Ultra"" to Classic E.R.A.S. with discharge on POD 2 and 4, respectively.Seven hundred and sixty-five patients with resectable non-metastatic colonic cancer were analyzed: 384 patients were assigned to ""Ultra"" E.R.A.S. and 381 to Classic E.R.A.S. Primary end-point was mortality; secondary end-points were morbidity, readmission and reoperation rate.Limitations are: it is a single-center experience; it is not double-blind, with the intrinsic risk of intentional or unconscious bias; exclusion criteria because of ""non-compliance"" may be considered arbitrary.RESULTS: Mortality was 0.89 % in ""Ultra"" E.R.A.S. group and 0.59 % in Classic E.R.A.S. (p = 0.571).Morbidity was 34.1 % for ""Ultra"" E.R.A.S. arm and 35.4 % for Classic E.R.A.S. (p = 0.753).Readmissions were 5.6 % for ""Ultra"" E.R.A.S. and 5.9 % for Classic E.R.A.S. (p = 0.359).Reoperation rate was 3.8 % for ""Ultra"" ERAS and 4.7 % for Classic E.R.A.S. (p = 0.713).Multivariate regression analyses using Cox's proportional hazard model showed that mortality (primary end-point), morbidity, reoperation and readmission (secondary end-points) were not significantly influenced by the two different perioperative regimens; conversely, the global cost of ""Ultra"" E.R.A.S. regimen was more economically effective.CONCLUSION: ""Ultra"" E.R.A.S. showed to be safe, actual and effective; discharge on postoperative day 2 after the first flatus passage, in the absence of complication-related symptoms, should be actively considered in a modern, multidisciplinary, multimodal laparoscopic management of colonic cancer.",0,0,0,0
23059776,"Safety, resource use, and quality of life in paramount: a phase III study of maintenance pemetrexed versus placebo after induction pemetrexed plus cisplatin for advanced nonsquamous non-small-cell lung cancer.INTRODUCTION: In a phase III, randomized, double-blind study (PARAMOUNT), maintenance pemetrexed demonstrated significant benefit in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).We present safety, resource use, and quality of life (QoL) results.METHODS: After four 21-day cycles of pemetrexed-cisplatin (N = 939), patients with advanced nonsquamous NSCLC, whose disease had not progressed and who had a performance status of 0/1, were randomized 2:1 (N = 539) to maintenance pemetrexed 500 mg/m plus best supportive care or placebo plus best supportive care every 21 days until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.QoL was measured using the EuroQol 5-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D).RESULTS: Frequently reported grade 3 to 4 drug-related toxicities with maintenance pemetrexed versus placebo were anemia (4.5% versus 0.6%; p = 0.016), fatigue (4.2% versus 0.6%; p = 0.016), and neutropenia (3.6% versus 0.0%; p < 0.006).No significant differences in drug-related grade 3 to 5 toxicities were observed with long-term pemetrexed exposure (>6 cycles), except grade 3 to 4 neutropenia, which did not result in increased infections.Patients on maintenance pemetrexed required more transfusions (13.4% versus 5.0%; p = 0.003), granulocyte colony- or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factors (5.3% versus 0.0%; p <0.001), anti-infectives (25.3% versus 16.7%; p = 0.028), and hospitalizations because of study drug (8.4% versus 3.3%, p = 0.028) than placebo-treated patients did.No significant treatment-by-time interactions, overall treatment differences, or clinically relevant changes from baseline were observed in EQ-5D scores during treatment.CONCLUSIONS: Long-term use of continuation maintenance pemetrexed was well tolerated; resource use was low, corresponding with known pemetrexed toxicities.The EQ-5D results demonstrate that patients tolerate long-term maintenance pemetrexed without worsening QoL.",0,0,0,0
31404106,"Improved detection of prostate cancer using a magneto-nanosensor assay for serum circulating autoantibodies.PURPOSE: To develop a magneto-nanosensor (MNS) based multiplex assay to measure protein and autoantibody biomarkers from human serum for prostate cancer (CaP) diagnosis.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 4-panel MNS autoantibody assay and a MNS protein assay were developed and optimized in our labs.Using these assays, serum concentration of six biomarkers including prostate-specific antigen (PSA) protein, free/total PSA ratio, as well as four autoantibodies against Parkinson disease 7 (PARK7), TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TARDBP), Talin 1 (TLN1), and Caldesmon 1 (CALD1) and were analyzed.Human serum samples from 99 patients (50 with non-cancer and 49 with clinically localized CaP) were evaluated.RESULTS: The MNS assay showed excellent performance characteristics and no cross-reactivity.All autoantibody assays showed a statistically significant difference between CaP and non-cancer samples except for PARK7.The most significant difference was the combination of the four autoantibodies as a panel in addition to the free/total PSA ratio.This combination had the highest area under the curve (AUC)- 0.916 in ROC analysis.CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that this autoantibody panel along with PSA and free PSA have potential to segregate patients without cancer from those with prostate cancer with higher sensitivity and specificity than PSA alone.",0,0,0,0

22614994,"Reach out to enhance wellness home-based diet-exercise intervention promotes reproducible and sustainable long-term improvements in health behaviors, body weight, and physical functioning in older, overweight/obese cancer survivors.PURPOSE: Diet and exercise interventions have been tested in cancer survivors as a means to reduce late effects and comorbidity, but few have assessed adherence and health outcomes long term.METHODS: Between July 2005 and May 2007, the Reach Out to Enhance Wellness (RENEW) trial accrued 641 locoregionally staged, long-term (>/= 5 years from diagnosis) colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer survivors in the United States (21 states), Canada, and the United Kingdom.All participants were sedentary (< 150 minutes of physical activity [PA] a week), overweight or obese (body mass index, 25 to 40 kg/m(2)), and over age 65 years.The trial tested a diet-exercise intervention delivered via mailed print materials and telephone counseling.RENEW used a wait-list control, cross-over design (ie, participants received the year-long intervention immediately or after a 1-year delay), which allowed the opportunity to assess program efficacy (previously reported primary outcome), durability, and reproducibility (reported herein).Measures included diet quality (DQ), PA, BMI, and physical function (PF).RESULTS: No significant relapse was observed in the immediate-intervention arm for DQ, PA, and BMI; however, rates of functional decline increased when the intervention ceased.From year 1 to year 2, significant improvements were observed in the delayed-intervention arm; mean change scores in behaviors and BMI and PF slopes were as follows: DQ score, 5.2 (95% CI, 3.4 to 7.0); PA, 45.8 min/wk (95% CI, 26.9 to 64.6 min/wk); BMI, -0.56 (95% CI, -0.75 to -0.36); and Short Form-36 PF, -1.02 versus -5.52 (P < .001 for all measures).Overall, both arms experienced significant improvements in DQ, PA, and BMI from baseline to 2-year follow-up (P < .001).CONCLUSION: Older cancer survivors respond favorably to lifestyle interventions and make durable changes in DQ and PA that contribute to sustained weight loss.These changes positively reorient functional decline trajectories during intervention delivery.",1,1,0,0
25795410,"Nivolumab versus chemotherapy in patients with advanced melanoma who progressed after anti-CTLA-4 treatment (CheckMate 037): a randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Nivolumab, a fully human IgG4 PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor antibody, can result in durable responses in patients with melanoma who have progressed after ipilimumab and BRAF inhibitors.We assessed the efficacy and safety of nivolumab compared with investigator's choice of chemotherapy (ICC) as a second-line or later-line treatment in patients with advanced melanoma.METHODS: In this randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 3 trial, we recruited patients at 90 sites in 14 countries.Eligible patients were 18 years or older, had unresectable or metastatic melanoma, and progressed after ipilimumab, or ipilimumab and a BRAF inhibitor if they were BRAF(V 600) mutation-positive.Participating investigators randomly assigned (with an interactive voice response system) patients 2:1 to receive an intravenous infusion of nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks or ICC (dacarbazine 1000 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks or paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2) combined with carboplatin area under the curve 6 every 3 weeks) until progression or unacceptable toxic effects.We stratified randomisation by BRAF mutation status, tumour expression of PD-L1, and previous best overall response to ipilimumab.We used permuted blocks (block size of six) within each stratum.Primary endpoints were the proportion of patients who had an objective response and overall survival.Treatment was given open-label, but those doing tumour assessments were masked to treatment assignment.We assessed objective responses per-protocol after 120 patients had been treated with nivolumab and had a minimum follow-up of 24 weeks, and safety in all patients who had had at least one dose of treatment.The trial is closed and this is the first interim analysis, reporting the objective response primary endpoint.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01721746.FINDINGS: Between Dec 21, 2012, and Jan 10, 2014, we screened 631 patients, randomly allocating 272 patients to nivolumab and 133 to ICC.Confirmed objective responses were reported in 38 (31.7%, 95% CI 23.5-40.8) of the first 120 patients in the nivolumab group versus five (10.6%, 3.5-23.1) of 47 patients in the ICC group.Grade 3-4 adverse events related to nivolumab included increased lipase (three [1%] of 268 patients), increased alanine aminotransferase, anaemia, and fatigue (two [1%] each); for ICC, these included neutropenia (14 [14%] of 102), thrombocytopenia (six [6%]), and anaemia (five [5%]).We noted grade 3-4 drug-related serious adverse events in 12 (5%) nivolumab-treated patients and nine (9%) patients in the ICC group.No treatment-related deaths occurred.INTERPRETATION: Nivolumab led to a greater proportion of patients achieving an objective response and fewer toxic effects than with alternative available chemotherapy regimens for patients with advanced melanoma that has progressed after ipilimumab or ipilimumab and a BRAF inhibitor.Nivolumab represents a new treatment option with clinically meaningful durable objective responses in a population of high unmet need.FUNDING: Bristol-Myers Squibb.",1,1,1,1
28412590,"Baseline carcinoembryonic antigen as a predictive factor of ramucirumab efficacy in RAISE, a second-line metastatic colorectal carcinoma phase III trial.BACKGROUND: The RAISE phase III clinical trial demonstrated that ramucirumab + (folinic acid plus 5-fluorouracil plus irinotecan) FOLFIRI significantly improved overall survival (OS) versus placebo + FOLFIRI for second-line metastatic colorectal carcinoma (mCRC) patients failing bevacizumab- and oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.73-0.98, P = 0.022).Post hoc analyses of RAISE patient data examined the association of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) subgroups with efficacy parameters.METHODS: CEA subgroups (</=10 versus >10 ng/ml) were based on 2X upper limit of normal (ULN) (5 ng/ml).The Kaplan-Meier method estimated the median OS and the progression-free survival (PFS).Log-rank test compared the survival distributions within the subgroups.Hazard ratio (HR) (95% confidence interval [CI]) and treatment-by-subgroup interaction p-values were calculated by Cox proportional hazards model.RESULTS: Ramucirumab treatment prolonged survival for the CEA </=10 subgroup (HR = 0.68; 95% CI = 0.50-0.92; P = 0.013) and CEA >10 subgroup (HR = 0.90; 95% CI = 0.76-1.07; P = 0.233).However, the ramucirumab OS benefit over placebo was greater for the CEA </=10 subgroup than for the CEA >10 subgroup (median OS: 3.6 versus 0.8 months greater, respectively).The interaction P-value between CEA level and treatment effect on OS was 0.088.This trend was observed across randomisation strata and to a lesser extent for PFS (P = 0.594).CONCLUSIONS: Although patients in both high- and low-CEA subgroups derive OS and PFS benefits from ramucirumab treatment, the low baseline CEA level may identify a subgroup of patients with mCRC who obtain greater benefit from ramucirumab.",1,1,1,1
32565319,"Efficacy of Dose-Escalated Chemoradiation on Complete Tumor Response in Patients with Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer (RECTAL-BOOST): A Phase 2 Randomized Controlled Trial.PURPOSE: Pathologic complete tumor response after chemoradiation in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) is associated with a favorable prognosis and allows organ-sparing treatment strategies.In the RECTAL-BOOST trial, we aimed to investigate the effect of an external radiation boost to the tumor before chemoradiation on pathologic or sustained clinical complete tumor response in LARC.METHODS AND MATERIALS: This multicenter, nonblinded, phase 2 randomized controlled trial followed the trials-within-cohorts design, which is a pragmatic trial design allowing cohort participants to be randomized for an experimental intervention.Patients in the intervention group are offered the intervention (and can either accept or refuse this), whereas patients in the control group are not notified about the randomization.Participants of a colorectal cancer cohort referred for chemoradiation of LARC to either of 2 radiation therapy centers were eligible.Patients were randomized to no boost or an external radiation boost (5 x 3 Gy) without concurrent chemotherapy, directly followed by standard pelvic chemoradiation (25 x 2 Gy with concurrent capecitabine).The primary outcome was pathologic complete response (ie, ypT0N0) in patients with planned surgery at 12 weeks, or, as surrogate for pathologic complete response, a 2-year sustained clinical complete response for patients treated with an organ preservation strategy.Analyses were intention to treat.The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01951521.RESULTS: Between September 2014 and July 2018, 128 patients were randomized.Fifty-one of the 64 (79.7%) patients in the intervention group accepted and received a boost.Compared with the control group, fewer patients in the intervention group had a cT4 stage and a low rectal tumor (31.3% vs 17.2% and 56.3% vs 45.3%, respectively), and more patients had a cN2 stage (59.4% vs 70.3%, respectively).Rate of pathologic or sustained clinical complete tumor response was similar between the groups: 23 of 64 (35.9%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 24.3-48.9) in the intervention group versus 24 of 64 (37.5%; 95% CI, 25.7-50.5) in the control group (odds ratio [OR] = 0.94; 95% CI, 0.46-1.92).Near-complete or complete tumor regression was more common in the intervention group (34 of 49; 69.4%) than in the control group (24 of 53; 45.3%; (OR = 2.74, 95% CI 1.21-6.18).Grade >/=3 acute toxicity was comparable: 6 of 64 (9.4%) in the intervention group versus 5 of 64 (7.8%) in the control group (OR = 1.22; 95% CI, 0.35-4.22).CONCLUSIONS: Dose escalation with an external radiation therapy boost to the tumor before neoadjuvant chemoradiation did not increase the pathologic or sustained clinical complete tumor response rate in LARC.",0,0,0,0

22104618,"Does health-related quality of life improve for advanced pancreatic cancer patients who respond to gemcitabine? Analysis of a randomized phase III trial of the cancer and leukemia group B (CALGB 80303).CONTEXT: Gemcitabine for advanced pancreatic cancer (APC) is palliative and the prognosis is poor, making health-related quality of life (HRQOL) particularly important.OBJECTIVES: We evaluated HRQOL with the EuroQol (EQ-5D) in patients with APC participating in Cancer and Leukemia Group B 80303, a multicenter, double-blind, randomized trial comparing overall survival (OS) between two treatment arms: gemcitabine with bevacizumab or gemcitabine with placebo.METHODS: A consecutive subsample of patients was invited to complete the EQ-5D surveys.Because neither clinical nor HRQOL outcomes differed based on the study arm, analyses were pooled.Changes in mean scores from baseline to eight weeks and the prognostic value of the EQ-5D were evaluated.RESULTS: Mean index scores remained stable (0.78 at baseline [n=267], 0.79 at eight weeks [n=186], P=0.34, Wilcoxon signed rank test), attributable to a modest deterioration of physical function domain scores coincident with small improvements in pain and anxiety/depression scores.A small decline in visual analogue scale scores was observed (70.7 vs. 68.2, P=0.026).HRQOL changes within chemotherapy response strata revealed stable index scores but a trend of worsened physical function among patients with disease progression compared with those with stable or improved disease.Visual analogue scale scores trended downward over time irrespective of chemotherapy response status, with a statistically meaningful deterioration in patients who progressed (68.9 vs. 64.4, P=0.029).Baseline scores from both EQ-5D scales were significant predictors of OS in Cox proportional hazard models.CONCLUSION: Response to gemcitabine treatment in APC is not associated with appreciable improvement of global HRQOL.Small improvements in pain and mood are observed despite progressive functional decline.Those who respond to gemcitabine may experience a slight slowing of functional deterioration.",0,0,0,0
30807234,"Cyclin E1 Expression and Palbociclib Efficacy in Previously Treated Hormone Receptor-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer.PURPOSE: A large-panel gene expression analysis was conducted to identify biomarkers associated with the effectiveness of adding palbociclib to fulvestrant.METHODS: The PALOMA-3 ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01942135) trial randomly assigned 521 endocrine-pretreated patients with metastatic breast cancer to receive palbociclib plus fulvestrant or placebo plus fulvestrant.Primary analysis was first conducted on 10 genes on the basis of pathway biology and evidence from previous studies followed by a systematic panel-wide search among 2,534 cancer-related genes.The association of gene expression with the effect of palbociclib on progression-free survival (PFS) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, with gene expression as a continuous variable or dichotomized by median.An independent breast cancer cohort from the Preoperative Palbociclib (POP) Clinical Trial ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02008734) was used for validation, in 61 patients with primary breast cancer treated with 2 weeks of palbociclib.RESULTS: In the PALOMA-3 trial, 302 patients had tumor tissue analyzed (palbociclib arm, 194 patients; placebo arm, 108 patients).Palbociclib efficacy was lower in patients with high versus low cyclin E1 (CCNE1) mRNA expression (median PFS: palbociclib arm, 7.6 v 14.1 months; placebo arm, 4.0 v 4.8 months, respectively; interaction P unadjusted = .00238; false discovery rate-adjusted P = .0238).CCNE1 mRNA was more predictive in metastatic than in archival primary biopsy tissue samples.No significant interaction was found between treatment and expression levels of CDK4, CDK6, cyclin D1, and RB1.Palbociclib was efficacious in both luminal A and luminal B tumors.High CCNE1 mRNA expression was associated with poor antiproliferative activity of palbociclib in the POP trial (P = .005).CONCLUSION: Addition of palbociclib to fulvestrant demonstrated efficacy in all biomarker groups, although high CCNE1 mRNA expression was associated with relative resistance to palbociclib.",1,1,1,1
31914811,"First-line trifluridine/tipiracil plus bevacizumab for unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer: SOLSTICE study design.Trifluridine/tipiracil (TT) is an orally administered combination of the thymidine-based nucleoside analogue trifluridine and the thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor tipiracil hydrochloride, which increases the bioavailability of cytotoxic trifluridine.Encouraging antitumor activity of first-line TT + bevacizumab (TT-B) has been observed in a Phase II study in patients with unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer ineligible for combination oxaliplatin- or irinotecan-based therapy.Here, we describe the design of SOLSTICE (NCT03869892), an open-label, Phase III trial in unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer patients who are not candidates for, or do not require, intensive therapy.The 854 patients were randomized 1:1 to receive first-line TT-B versus capecitabine + bevacizumab.The primary objective is to demonstrate superior progression-free survival with TT-B over capecitabine + bevacizumab.The first patient was enrolled in March 2019.",0,0,0,0
27124410,"Exploratory Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Response-Guided Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy for Hormone Positive Breast Cancer Patients.PURPOSE: Guiding response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (guided-NACT) allows for an adaptative treatment approach likely to improve breast cancer survival.In this study, our primary aim is to explore the expected cost-effectiveness of guided-NACT using as a case study the first randomized controlled trial that demonstrated effectiveness (GeparTrio trial).MATERIALS AND METHODS: As effectiveness was shown in hormone-receptor positive (HR+) early breast cancers (EBC), our decision model compared the health-economic outcomes of treating a cohort of such women with guided-NACT to conventional-NACT using clinical input data from the GeparTrio trial.The expected cost-effectiveness and the uncertainty around this estimate were estimated via probabilistic cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA), from a Dutch societal perspective over a 5-year time-horizon.RESULTS: Our exploratory CEA predicted that guided-NACT as proposed by the GeparTrio, costs additional euro110, but results in 0.014 QALYs gained per patient.This scenario of guided-NACT was considered cost-effective at any willingness to pay per additional QALY.At the prevailing Dutch willingness to pay threshold (euro80.000/QALY) cost-effectiveness was expected with 78% certainty.CONCLUSION: This exploratory CEA indicated that guided-NACT (as proposed by the GeparTrio trial) is likely cost-effective in treating HR+ EBC women.While prospective validation of the GeparTrio findings is advisable from a clinical perspective, early CEAs can be used to prioritize further research from a broader health economic perspective, by identifying which parameters contribute most to current decision uncertainty.Furthermore, their use can be extended to explore the expected cost-effectiveness of alternative guided-NACT scenarios that combine the use of promising imaging techniques together with personalized treatments.",0,0,0,0
27390378,"Communicating Findings of Delayed Diagnostic Evaluation to Primary Care Providers.BACKGROUND: We previously found that an intervention involving electronic algorithms to detect delays in follow-up of cancer-related abnormal or ""red-flag"" findings and communicating this information to primary care providers (PCPs) led to more timely diagnostic evaluation.In this study, we examined the effectiveness of various communication strategies to inform PCPs about the delayed follow-up.METHODS: After identifying follow-up delays through electronic health record-based algorithms and record reviews, we communicated this information to PCPs using 3 escalating steps.First, we sent secure E-mails.If no evidence of follow-up was found in a medical record review after 1 week, we made up to 3 attempts to reach the PCPs or their nurses via telephone.If they could not be reached, we informed clinic directors as the third and final step.In this analysis, we evaluate PCPs' follow-up in response to these methods of communication.RESULTS: A total of 733 patients with follow-up delays were identified (369 patients in the intervention group and 364 patients in the control group).Communicating information to PCPs about possible follow-up delays led to decreased times to diagnostic evaluation, but communication related to delays did not always lead to follow-up for the patients in the intervention group.Specifically, secure E-mails led to follow-up in 11.1% of cases (41 of 369), telephone calls led to follow-up in 68.6% of cases (225 of 328), and contacting clinic directors led to follow-up in 5 of 11 cases in which communication escalated to this level.CONCLUSION: Strategies to communicate to PCPs information on delayed follow-up of findings suspicious for cancer were useful, but not fail-safe.Additional back-up strategies, such as using case coordinators, might be needed.",0,0,0,0

RESULTS: A total of 24 patients were included: arm A (10), arm B (5), and arm C (9).Safety analysis showed no excessive toxicity.At the end of stage I, the PFS-6 of arm A was 20% (2/10 patients, 95% unilateral lower confidence limit: 3.7%) and the study was prematurely terminated.The overall response rates (ORR) were 40% (95% CI, 12.2-73.8) and 20% (95% CI, 0.5-71.6) in arm A and B, respectively.In arm C, PFS-6 was 37.5% (95% CI, 8.8-75.5) and ORR was 22.2% (95% CI, 2.8-60.0).Among 11 patients with an expected sensitivity according to new generation sequencing (NGS), 3 had partial response (PR), 4 remained stable disease (SD) while out of 7 potentially resistant patients, 1 had PR and 1 SD.CONCLUSION: The addition of vismodegib to TMZ did not add toxicity but failed to improve PFS-6 in SHH recurrent/refractory medulloblastoma.Prediction of sensitivity to vismodegib needs further refinements.",1,1,1,1
29413685,"PICCA study: panitumumab in combination with cisplatin/gemcitabine chemotherapy in KRAS wild-type patients with biliary cancer-a randomised biomarker-driven clinical phase II AIO study.BACKGROUND: Combination chemotherapy has shown benefit in the treatment of biliary cancer and further improvements might be achieved by the addition of a biological agent.We report here the effect of chemotherapy with the monoclonal EGFR antibody panitumumab as therapy for KRAS wild-type biliary cancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with advanced biliary tract cancer were randomised (2:1) to receive cisplatin 25 mg/m(2) and gemcitabine 1000 mg/m(2) on day 1 and day 8/q3w with (arm A) or without panitumumab (arm B; 9 mg/kg BW, i.v q3w).The primary end-point was the evaluation of progression-free survival (PFS) at 6 months.Secondary end-points included objective response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), and toxicity.In addition, a post hoc assessment of genetic alterations was performed.Finally, we performed a meta-analysis of trials with chemotherapy with and without EGFR antibodies.RESULTS: Sixty-two patients were randomised in arm A and 28 patients in arm B. Patients received 7 treatment cycles in median (1-35) with a median treatment duration of 4.7 months (141 days, 8-765).PFS rate at 6 months was 54% in patients treated with cisplatin/gemcitabine and panitumumab but was 73% in patients treated with cisplatin/gemcitabine without antibody, respectively.Secondary end-points were an ORR of 45% in treatment arm A compared with 39% receiving treatment B and a median OS of 12.8 months (arm A) and of 20.1 months (arm B), respectively.In contrast to the p53-status, genetic alterations in IDH1/2 were linked to a high response after chemotherapy and prolonged survival.In accordance with our results, the meta-analysis of 12 trials did not reveal a survival advantage for patients treated with EGFR antibodies compared with chemotherapy alone.CONCLUSIONS: Panitumumab in combination with chemotherapy does not improve ORR, PFS and OS in patients with KRAS wild-type, advanced biliary cancer.Genetic profiling should be included in CCA trials to identify and validate predictive and prognostic biomarkers.CLINICAL TRIALS NUMBER: The trial was registered with NCT01320254.",1,1,1,1
32833762,"Long-term Oncologic Results After Stenting as a Bridge to Surgery Versus Emergency Surgery for Malignant Left-sided Colonic Obstruction: A Multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial (ESCO Trial).OBJECTIVE: To assess overall (OS), time to progression (TTP), and disease-free survival (DFS) at 3 years after treatment, comparing stenting as bridge-to-surgery (SBTS) versus emergency surgery (ES) in neoplastic left colon obstruction, secondary endpoints of the previously published randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: While SBTS in neoplastic colon obstruction may reduce morbidity and need for a stoma compared with ES, concern has been raised, about long-term survival.METHODS: Individuals affected by left-sided malignant large-bowel obstruction were enrolled from 5 European hospitals and randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to receive SBTS or ES.The computer-generated randomization sequence was stratified by center on cT and concealed by the use of a web-based application.Investigators and participants were unmasked to treatment assignment.The secondary outcomes analyzed here were OS, TTP, and DFS.Analysis was by intention to treat.This study is registered, ID-code NCT00591695.RESULTS: Between March 2008 and November 2015, 144 patients were randomly assigned to undergo either SBTS or ES; 115 (SBTS n = 56, ES n = 59) were eligible for analysis, while 20 participants were excluded for a benign disease, 1 for unavailability of the endoscopist while 8 withdrew from the trial.With a median follow-up of 37 months (range 1-62), no difference was observed in the SBTS group compared with ES in terms of OS (HR 0.93 (95% CI 0.49-1.76), P = 0.822), TTP (HR 0.81 (95% CI 0.42-1.54), P = 0.512), and DFS (HR 1.01 (95% CI 0.56-1.81), P = 0.972).Planned subgroup analysis showed no difference in respect to age, sex, American Society for Anesthesiology score, body mass index, and pT between SBTS and ES groups.Those participants randomized for the SBTS group whose obstruction was located in the descending colon had a better TTP compared with ES group (HR 0.44 (95% CI 0.20-0.97), P = 0.042), but no difference was observed in terms of OS (HR 0.73 (95% CI 0.33-1.63), P = 0.442) and DFS (HR 0.68 (95% CI 0.34-1.34), P = 0.261) in the same individuals.CONCLUSIONS: This randomized controlled trial shows that, although not powered for these seconday outcomes, OS, TTP, and DFS did not differ between groups at a minimum follow-up of 36 months.",1,1,1,0

27382257,"Fondaparinux vs warfarin for the treatment of unsuspected pulmonary embolism in cancer patients.INTRODUCTION: In cancer patients, the chest computer tomography (CT) can be used to identify asymptomatic pulmonary embolism (APE).In most cases, these patients are treated with anticoagulant drugs for at least 3 months.The American College of Physicians recommend treatment of these patients as patients with symptomatic pulmonary embolism.In this study, we evaluated and compared the efficacy and safety of fondaparinux vs warfarin in the prevention of unsuspected pulmonary embolism in patients with active cancer.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective and parallel group study was performed on 64 cancer patients (29 males and 35 females) with APE.A multidetector CT angiography with high spatial and temporal resolution and quality of arterial opacification was used to make the diagnosis.Lung scintigraphy was reserved to selected patients only.Patients were randomized to either the warfarin (Group A) or the fondaparinux (Group B) for 90 days.The first end point of efficacy was the persistence, reduction, or disappearance of thrombosis after 90 days.The second end point was the reappearance of thrombosis after 1 year.The first end point of safety was the development of major bleeding.RESULTS: We enrolled 32 patients into each treatment group.We reached the first end point of efficacy and safety in Group B which showed that fondaparinux was able to induce the disappearance of thrombotic pulmonary with a lower incidence of major bleeding events compared with warfarin.No difference in the secondary end point was recorded.CONCLUSION: We suggest that the treatment of cancer patients with APE can be oriented with the administration of a standard dose of fondaparinux until the next CT lung control (3 months).However, the lack of a randomized clinical trial, including a larger patient cohort, does not allow formulation of final recommendations in these patients.A broader study would be desirable, involving a larger number of patients and a longer follow-up period.",0,0,0,0
25038874,"HER2 screening data from ToGA: targeting HER2 in gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancer.BACKGROUND: In the Trastuzumab for GAstric cancer (ToGA) study, trastuzumab plus chemotherapy improved median overall survival by 2.7 months in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive [immunohistochemistry (IHC) 3+/fluorescence in situ hybridization-positive] gastric/gastroesophageal junction cancer compared with chemotherapy alone (hazard ratio 0.74).Post hoc exploratory analyses in patients expressing higher HER2 levels (IHC 2+/fluorescence in situ hybridization-positive or IHC 3+) demonstrated a 4.2-month improvement in median overall survival with trastuzumab (hazard ratio 0.65).The ToGA study provides the largest screening dataset available on HER2 overexpression/amplification in this indication.We further analyzed correlation(s) of HER2 overexpression/amplification with clinical and epidemiological factors.METHODS: HER2-positivity was analyzed by histological subtype, tumor location, geographic region, and specimen type.Exploratory efficacy analyses were performed.RESULTS: The HER2-positivity rate was 22.1 % across analyzed tumor samples.Rates were similar between European and Asian patients (23.6 % vs. 23.9 %), but higher in intestinal- vs. diffuse-type (31.8 % vs. 6.1 %), and gastroesophageal junction cancer versus gastric tumors (32.2 % vs. 21.4 %).Across all IHC scores, variability in HER2 staining (</=30 % stained cells) was observed in almost 50 % of cases, with increasing rates in lower IHC categories, and did not affect treatment outcome.The polysomy rate was 4 %.CONCLUSIONS: HER2 expression varies by tumor location and type.All patients with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer should be tested for HER2 status, preferably using IHC initially.Due to the unique characteristics of gastric cancer, specific testing/scoring guidelines should be adhered to.",0,0,0,0
24081946,"Randomized multicenter phase II trial comparing two schedules of etirinotecan pegol (NKTR-102) in women with recurrent platinum-resistant/refractory epithelial ovarian cancer.PURPOSE: Etirinotecan pegol (NKTR-102) is a unique, long-acting topoisomerase-I inhibitor with prolonged systemic exposure to SN38 (7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin), the active metabolite of irinotecan.This randomized phase II trial investigated two dosing schedules of etirinotecan pegol in patients with platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian carcinoma.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 71 eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive etirinotecan pegol 145 mg/m(2) every 14 or 21 days until progression or unacceptable adverse events (AEs).The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR) by RECIST (version 1.0).Secondary end points included response by Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup criteria, duration of ORR, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).RESULTS: The overall confirmed ORR was 20% (95% CI, 10% to 30%): 20% for once every 14 days, and 19% for once every 21 days.Median response duration was 4.1 months for once every 14 days and 4.0 months for once every 21 days.Median PFS for every 14 and every 21 days was 4.1 and 5.3 months, respectively, and median OS was 10.0 and 11.7 months, respectively.Etirinotecan pegol was well tolerated, with the most common grade 3 to 4 AEs being dehydration (24%) and diarrhea (23%).Diarrhea, dehydration, nausea, and neutropenia were less frequent with the schedule of once every 21 days than with that of once every 14 days.CONCLUSION: Both schedules of etirinotecan pegol showed activity in patients with heavily pretreated ovarian cancer, with encouraging ORR and PFS rates.The schedule of once every 21 days was better tolerated and had slightly longer PFS and OS rates.The treatment schedule of etirinotecan pegol 145 mg/m(2) once every 21 days was selected for the expanded phase II study and is preferred for future phase III studies.These findings provide support to directly compare etirinotecan pegol versus one of the approved drugs (eg, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or topotecan) in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.",1,1,1,1
23957945,"Initial biopsy Gleason score as a predictive marker for survival benefit in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with docetaxel: data from the TAX327 study.BACKGROUND: Since 2004, docetaxel has been the standard first-line systemic therapy for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).With abiraterone recently becoming available in the predocetaxel setting, it is warranted to identify subgroups of patients who may obtain the greatest benefit from docetaxel and particularly qualify for receiving docetaxel as first-line treatment for mCRPC.OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify factors that could characterize subgroups of patients who obtain the greatest benefit from the use of docetaxel.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: TAX327 was multinational, randomized, phase 3 study that was conducted from 2000 to 2002 in 1006 men with mCRPC.INTERVENTION: Patients were randomized to receive docetaxel every 3 wk (D3), weekly docetaxel (D1), or mitoxantrone every 3 wk (M3), each with prednisone.OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: We investigated whether patients with poorly differentiated tumors (Gleason score >/=7) at diagnosis had greater benefit from D3 compared with M3 than patients with better differentiated tumors (Gleason score </=6).Using a Cox model, we compared overall survival (OS) between the treatment groups within each subgroup of Gleason score.RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: The TAX 327 data showed that the OS benefit of D3 versus M3 was greater in patients with high-grade tumors (median OS: 18.9 vs 14.5 mo; p=0.009) than in patients with low-grade tumors (median OS: 21.6 vs 20.7 mo; p=0.674).Limitations of a retrospective analysis apply.CONCLUSIONS: The survival benefit obtained with docetaxel is most pronounced in patients with high-Gleason-score tumors (Gleason >/=7).In a time of shifting paradigms in mCRPC, with abiraterone becoming available prior to docetaxel chemotherapy, Gleason score may help in selecting patients who obtain the greatest benefit from docetaxel as first-line treatment for mCRPC.Prospective validation of these findings is warranted.",1,1,1,1
27825977,"Management of women with human papillomavirus persistence: long-term follow-up of a randomized clinical trial.BACKGROUND: Introduction of human papillomavirus-based screening is ongoing in many countries, given its higher sensitivity and longer-lasting protection compared with cytology-based screening.However, optimal clinical management of human papillomavirus-positive but cytology-negative women is unclear, and additional studies with clinical follow-up are warranted.OBJECTIVE: The aim of the current study was to investigate the long-term outcomes of the clinical management used in a double-blind, randomized clinical trial of human papillomavirus screening conducted in the context of the routine, organized screening program in Sweden.STUDY DESIGN: Among 12,527 women aged 32-38 years enrolled in the trial, we followed up the 195 women who attended the colposcopy screening who were cytologically normal but persistently human papillomavirus positive (at least 12 months later; median, 19 months) in the human papillomavirus testing arm (n = 100) or were randomly selected from the control arm (n = 95).Women in the human papillomavirus testing arm were followed up with repeated human papillomavirus testing, cytologies, and colposcopies if persistently human papillomavirus-positive without cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse.A similar number of random colposcopies and tests were carried out in the control arm.Women were followed up over 13 years for the main outcome measures: cumulative incidence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 or worse.RESULTS: Among women who continued to attend and had continuous human papillomavirus persistence, all (40 of 40, 100% [95% confidence interval, 91-100%]) developed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse.There were no cases among women who cleared their human papillomavirus persistence (0 of 35, 0% (95% confidence interval, 0-10%) (P < .001).Among women who had had human papillomavirus persistence but did not continue with repeated human papillomavirus tests (unknown persistence status), 56% (15 of 27 women) developed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse.Almost all cases occurred within 6 years.The intensive clinical management in the trial appeared to result in diagnoses of earlier cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse but apparently did not prevent cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse.CONCLUSION: Women with human papillomavirus persistence will, in general, either become human papillomavirus negative or develop cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse within 6 years, even with intensive clinical follow-up.",0,0,0,0
34688374,"Neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade with toripalimab, with or without celecoxib, in mismatch repair-deficient or microsatellite instability-high, locally advanced, colorectal cancer (PICC): a single-centre, parallel-group, non-comparative, randomised, phase 2 trial.BACKGROUND: PD-1 blockade is highly effective in patients with mismatch repair-deficient or microsatellite instability-high metastatic colorectal cancer.The role of single-agent PD-1 blockade in the neoadjuvant setting for resectable mismatch repair-deficient or microsatellite instability-high colorectal cancer remains unclear.We investigated the efficacy and safety of PD-1 blockade with toripalimab, with or without the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib, as neoadjuvant treatment for mismatch repair-deficient or microsatellite instability-high, locally advanced, colorectal cancers.METHODS: The PD-1 Inhibitor in Microsatellite Instability Colorectal Cancer (PICC) trial was a single-centre, open-label, parallel-group, non-comparative, randomised, phase 2 study undertaken at the Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University (Guangzhou, China).Eligible patients were aged 18-75 years, had histologically confirmed mismatch repair-deficient or microsatellite instability-high colorectal cancer, had clinical stage T3-T4 or any T with lymph node positivity (N+), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score of 0 or 1, and adequate haematological, hepatic, and renal function.Participants were randomly assigned (1:1), without any stratification or balanced blocking, to receive toripalimab 3 mg/kg intravenously on day 1, with or without celecoxib 200 mg orally twice daily from day 1 to 14 of each 14-day cycle, for six cycles before surgical resection.Adjuvant treatment with toripalimab with or without celecoxib was permitted at the investigators' discretion.The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with pathological complete response, defined as tumours without any viable tumour cells in the resected primary tumour sample and all sampled regional lymph nodes.All efficacy and safety analyses were assessed in the modified intention-to-treat population, which included all patients who were randomly assigned to treatment and who received at least one dose of toripalimab.This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03926338, and is ongoing.FINDINGS: Between May 1, 2019, and April 1, 2021, 53 patients were screened, of whom 34 were randomly assigned to either the toripalimab plus celecoxib group (n=17) or the toripalimab monotherapy group (n=17).As of data cutoff (Aug 10, 2021), median follow-up was 14.9 months (IQR 8.8-17.0).All patients received study treatment and underwent surgical resection; there were no treatment-related surgical delays.All 34 patients had an R0 resection (>1 mm resection margin).15 of 17 patients (88% [95% CI 64-99]) in the toripalimab plus celecoxib group and 11 of 17 patients (65% [38-86]) in the toripalimab monotherapy group had a pathological complete response.All patients continued to receive adjuvant toripalimab with or without celecoxib for a total perioperative duration of 6 months and were alive and free of recurrence at data cutoff.During neoadjuvant treatment, ten (59%) patients in the toripalimab plus celecoxib group and ten (59%) in the toripalimab monotherapy group had grade 1-2 treatment-related adverse events.Only one (3%) of 34 patients, who was in the toripalimab plus celecoxib group, had a grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse event during the neoadjuvant phase, which was grade 3 increased aspartate aminotransferase levels.In the adjuvant phase, only one (3%) of 34 patients, who was in the toripalimab monotherapy group, had a grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events, which was grade 3 increased aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels.INTERPRETATION: Neoadjuvant toripalimab with or without celecoxib could be a potential therapeutic option for patients with mismatch repair deficient or microsatellite instability-high, locally advanced, colorectal cancer.This treatment was associated with a high pathological complete response rate and an acceptable safety profile, which did not compromise surgery.Longer term follow-up is needed to assess effects on survival-related endpoints.FUNDING: The National Key R&D Program of China, the National Natural Science Foundation of China, and the Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology-Junshi Biosciences Oncology Immunity Research.TRANSLATION: For the Chinese translation of the abstract see Supplementary Materials section.",1,1,1,1
30679315,"A Phase II Randomized Trial of Panitumumab, Erlotinib, and Gemcitabine Versus Erlotinib and Gemcitabine in Patients with Untreated, Metastatic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma: North Central Cancer Treatment Group Trial N064B (Alliance).LESSONS LEARNED: Dual epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-directed therapy with erlotinib and panitumumab in combination with gemcitabine was superior to gemcitabine and erlotinib, but the clinical relevance is uncertain given the limited role of gemcitabine monotherapy.A significantly longer overall survival was observed in patients receiving the dual EGFR-directed therapy.The dual EGFR-directed therapy resulted in increased toxicity.BACKGROUND: Gemcitabine is active in patients with advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma.The combination of erlotinib, an oral epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor, and gemcitabine was shown to modestly prolong overall survival when compared with gemcitabine alone.The North Central Cancer Treatment Group (now part of Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology) trial N064B compared gemcitabine plus erlotinib versus gemcitabine plus combined EGFR inhibition with erlotinib and panitumumab.METHODS: Eligible patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas were randomized to either gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m(2) on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle with erlotinib 100 mg p.o.daily (Arm A) or the same combination with the addition of panitumumab 4 mg/kg on days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle (Arm B).The primary endpoint of the trial was overall survival.Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival, the confirmed response rate, and toxicity.Comparison between arms for the primary endpoint was done with a one-sided log-rank test, and a p value less than .20 was considered statistically significant.Response rate comparison was done with Fisher's exact test.All other reported p values are two-sided.RESULTS: A total of 92 patients were randomized, 46 to each arm.The median overall survival was 4.2 months in Arm A and 8.3 months in Arm B (hazard ratio, 0.817; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.530-1.260; p = .1792).The progression-free survival was 2.0 months in Arm A and 3.6 months in Arm B (hazard ratio, 0.843; 95% CI, 0.555-1.280; p = .4190).A partial confirmed response was seen in 8.7% of patients on Arm A and 6.5% on Arm B (p = .9999).No patients had a complete response.Grade 3 and higher nonhematologic toxicities were more common in patients on Arm B compared with those on Arm A (82.6% vs. 52.2%; p = .0018).CONCLUSION: Dual EGFR-directed therapy resulted in a significant prolongation of overall survival in patients with advanced adenocarcinoma of the pancreas but was associated with substantially increased toxicities.Dual EGFR-directed therapy in combination with gemcitabine alone cannot be recommended for further study, as single-agent gemcitabine is no longer considered an appropriate therapy for otherwise fit patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.",0,0,0,0
25399973,"[Efficacies of gefitinib versus paclitaxel/carboplatin for patients with advanced pulmonary adenocarcinoma].OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical efficacies of gefitinib versus paclitaxel/carboplatin in patients with advanced pulmonary adenocarcinoma.METHODS: A total of 51 advanced pulmonary adenocarcinoma patients were recruited from Guangdong General Hospital during October 2006 to September 2007.Eligible patients were >/= 18 years old, either non-smokers or former light smokers and receiving no prior chemotherapy or biological/immunological therapy.According to performance status, smoking status and gender, they were selected with dynamic equilibrium randomized method 1: 1 to receive first-line gefitinib (250 mg/d) in gefitinib arm or carboplatin/paclitaxel (carboplatin, area under the curve 5 mg x ml(-)(1) x min(-)(1), 21-day cycle; paclitaxel, 200 mg/m(2), 21-day cycle in chemotherapy arm.The primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS). And the secondary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR) and overall survival (OS).RESULTS: They were randomized into gefitinib arm (n = 25) and paclitaxel/carboplatin arm (n = 26).The median PFS was 4.2 months in gefitinib arm and 8.3 months in paclitaxel/carboplatin arm (P = 0.422); ORR 36.0% in gefitinib arm and 42.3% in paclitaxel/carboplatin arm (P = 0.645); Median OS 14.4 months in gefitinib arm and 15.0 months in paclitaxel/carboplatin arm (P = 0.290).Multifactorial Cox regression analysis showed that age (P = 0.004), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutation status (P = 0.012) and subsequent treatments (platinum-based chemotherapy, P = 0.001; EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), P = 0.005) were the significant predictors of OS.CONCLUSIONS: No significant differences exist in terms of efficacy and survival between first-line gefitinib and paclitaxel/carboplatin for Chinese patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma who are non-smokers or former light smokers.And age, EGFR gene mutation status and subsequent treatments are significant predictor of OS.However, first-line gefitinib should not be recommended for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients only based on clinical factors, due to a very small sample-size in our study.",1,1,1,1

33460574,"Palbociclib with adjuvant endocrine therapy in early breast cancer (PALLAS): interim analysis of a multicentre, open-label, randomised, phase 3 study.BACKGROUND: Palbociclib added to endocrine therapy improves progression-free survival in hormone-receptor-positive, HER2-negative, metastatic breast cancer.The PALLAS trial aimed to investigate whether the addition of 2 years of palbociclib to adjuvant endocrine therapy improves invasive disease-free survival over endocrine therapy alone in patients with hormone-receptor-positive, HER2-negative, early-stage breast cancer.METHODS: PALLAS is an ongoing multicentre, open-label, randomised, phase 3 study that enrolled patients at 406 cancer centres in 21 countries worldwide with stage II-III histologically confirmed hormone-receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer, within 12 months of initial diagnosis.Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score of 0 or 1.Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) in permuted blocks of random size (4 or 6), stratified by anatomic stage, previous chemotherapy, age, and geographical region, by use of central telephone-based and web-based interactive response technology, to receive either 2 years of palbociclib (125 mg orally once daily on days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle) with ongoing standard provider or patient-choice adjuvant endocrine therapy (tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitor, with or without concurrent luteinising hormone-releasing hormone agonist), or endocrine therapy alone, without masking.The primary endpoint of the study was invasive disease-free survival in the intention-to-treat population.Safety was assessed in all randomly assigned patients who started palbociclib or endocrine therapy.This report presents results from the second pre-planned interim analysis triggered on Jan 9, 2020, when 67% of the total number of expected invasive disease-free survival events had been observed.The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02513394) and EudraCT (2014-005181-30).FINDINGS: Between Sept 1, 2015, and Nov 30, 2018, 5760 patients were randomly assigned to receive palbociclib plus endocrine therapy (n=2883) or endocrine therapy alone (n=2877).At the time of the planned second interim analysis, at a median follow-up of 23.7 months (IQR 16.9-29.2), 170 of 2883 patients assigned to palbociclib plus endocrine therapy and 181 of 2877 assigned to endocrine therapy alone had invasive disease-free survival events.3-year invasive disease-free survival was 88.2% (95% CI 85.2-90.6) for palbociclib plus endocrine therapy and 88.5% (85.8-90.7) for endocrine therapy alone (hazard ratio 0.93 [95% CI 0.76-1.15]; log-rank p=0.51).As the test statistic comparing invasive disease-free survival between groups crossed the prespecified futility boundary, the independent data monitoring committee recommended discontinuation of palbociclib in patients still receiving palbociclib and endocrine therapy.The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were neutropenia (1742 [61.3%] of 2840 patients on palbociclib and endocrine therapy vs 11 [0.3%] of 2903 on endocrine therapy alone), leucopenia (857 [30.2%] vs three [0.1%]), and fatigue (60 [2.1%] vs ten [0.3%]).Serious adverse events occurred in 351 (12.4%) of 2840 patients on palbociclib plus endocrine therapy versus 220 (7.6%) of 2903 patients on endocrine therapy alone.There were no treatment-related deaths.INTERPRETATION: At the planned second interim analysis, addition of 2 years of adjuvant palbociclib to adjuvant endocrine therapy did not improve invasive disease-free survival compared with adjuvant endocrine therapy alone.On the basis of these findings, this regimen cannot be recommended in the adjuvant setting.Long-term follow-up of the PALLAS population and correlative studies are ongoing.FUNDING: Pfizer.",1,1,1,1
31518715,"Absence of Iodine Staining Associates With Progression of Esophageal Lesions in a Prospective Endoscopic Surveillance Study in China.BACKGROUND & AIMS: Chromoendoscopy with iodine staining is used to identify esophageal squamous dysplasia and esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCCs)-absence of staining indicates suspicious regions of dysplasia.However, screening detects precancerous lesions (mild and moderate dysplasia) that do not require immediate treatment; it is a challenge to which lesions are at risk for progression.We investigated the association between absence of iodine staining at chromoendoscopy screening and lesion progression using 6 years of follow-up data from a population-based randomized controlled trial in China.We then constructed and validated a model to calculate risk of progression to severe dysplasia, carcinoma in situ, or ESCC.METHODS: We collected data from 1468 participants (45-69 years old) who were either negative for iodine staining at a baseline chromoendoscopy or found to have mild or moderate dysplasia in histologic analysis of biopsies in the Endoscopic Screening for Esophageal Cancer study in China, from January 2012 through September 2016; 788 of these participants were re-examined by endoscopy after a median interval of 4.2 years (development cohort).We investigated the association between absence of iodine staining and progression of esophageal lesions using Cox prediction models, considering corresponding baseline pathology findings and patient answers to a comprehensive questionnaire.Patients who did not receive a follow-up examination (n = 680) was used as the validation cohort; outcome events in these patients were identified by annual door to door active interviews or linkage with local electronic registry data.The primary outcome was incident esophageal severe dysplasia, carcinoma in situ, or ESCC.RESULTS: In the development cohort, 11 lesions that did not stain with iodine but were classified as not dysplastic in the histology analysis were found to be severe dysplasia, carcinoma in situ, or ESCC at the follow-up evaluation.These lesions accounted for 39.3% of all progressed lesions (n = 28).In the validation cohort, 6 patients with lesions did not stain with iodine but were classified as not dysplastic by histology had a later diagnosis of ESCC, determined from medical records; these patients accounted for 50.0% of all patients with lesion progression (n = 12) until the closing date of this study.We developed a model based on patient age, body mass index, pathology findings, and baseline iodine staining to calculate risk for severe dysplasia, carcinoma in situ, or ESCC.It identified patients for severe dysplasia, carcinoma in situ, or ESCC in the development set with an area under the curve of 0.868 (95% CI, 0.817-0.920) and in the validation set with an area under the curve of 0.850 (95% CI, 0.748-0.952).Almost no cases would be missed if subjects determined to be high or intermediate-high risk subjects by the model were included in surveillance.CONCLUSIONS: Absence of iodine staining at baseline chromoendoscopy identifies esophageal lesions at risk of progression with a high level of sensitivity.A model that combines results of iodine chromoendoscopy with other patient features identifies patients at risk of lesion progression with greater accuracy than histologic analysis of baseline biopsies.",0,0,0,0

32150297,"Bortezomib maintenance after R-CHOP, cytarabine and autologous stem cell transplantation in newly diagnosed patients with mantle cell lymphoma, results of a randomised phase II HOVON trial.Rituximab-containing induction followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is the standard first-line treatment for young mantle cell lymphoma patients.However, most patients relapse after ASCT.We investigated in a randomised phase II study the outcome of a chemo-immuno regimen and ASCT with or without maintenance therapy with bortezomib.Induction consisted of three cycles R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone), two cycles high-dose cytarabine, BEAM (carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, melphalan) and ASCT.Patients responding were randomised between bortezomib maintenance (1.3 mg/m(2) intravenously once every 2 weeks, for 2 years) and observation.Of 135 eligible patients, 115 (85%) proceeded to ASCT, 60 (44%) were randomised.With a median follow-up of 77.5 months for patients still alive, 5-year event-free survival (EFS) was 51% (95% CI 42-59%); 5-year overall survival (OS) was 73% (95% CI 65-80%).The median follow-up of randomised patients still alive was 71.5 months.Patients with bortezomib maintenance had a 5-year EFS of 63% (95% CI 44-78%) and 5-year OS of 90% (95% CI 72-97%).The patients randomised to observation had 5-year PFS of 60% (95% CI, 40-75%) and OS of 90% (95% CI 72-97%).In conclusion, in this phase II study we found no indication of a positive effect of bortezomib maintenance after ASCT.",1,1,1,1
24573743,"A phase II open-label randomized multicenter trial of TSU-68 in combination with S-1 and oxaliplatin versus S-1 in combination with oxaliplatin in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide.The combination of oxaliplatin-based treatments (oxaliplatin plus infusional 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin [FOLFOX] or oxaliplatin plus capecitabine [CapeOX]) and bevacizumab is a standard chemotherapy regimen for metastatic CRC (mCRC).However, several clinical studies that tested S-1 plus oxaliplatin (SOX) indicate that SOX is also a treatment option for mCRC.TSU-68 is an oral compound that inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptor and platelet-derived growth factor receptor.The recommended dose of TSU-68 + SOX was previously determined in a phase I study of mCRC patients.The goal of this trial was to evaluate the efficacy of TSU-68 in combination with SOX.METHODS: This open-label multicenter randomized phase II trial was performed in Korea.Treatment-naive mCRC patients with a performance status of 0 or 1 were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either TSU-68 + SOX or SOX alone.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS).RESULTS: A total of 105 patients (TSU-68 + SOX, 52 patients; SOX alone, 53 patients) were randomized.The median PFS was 7.0 months in the TSU-68 + SOX group (hazard ratio [HR], 1.057) and 7.2 months in the SOX group (p = 0.8401).The most frequent grade 3 and 4 adverse events were thrombocytopenia (9.6 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 26.4 % [SOX]), neutropenia (13.5 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 15.1 % [SOX]), and anemia (3.8 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 13.2 % [SOX]).We observed a difference between the 2 groups for all grades of anemia (15.4 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 32.1 % [SOX]), diarrhea (30.8 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 47.2 % [SOX]), vomiting (50.0 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 26.4 % [SOX]), and chromaturia (23.1 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 0.0 % [SOX]).Analysis using a Cox proportional hazard model showed that baseline interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels were associated with a survival benefit of TSU-68 (p = 0.012).CONCLUSION: TSU-68 + SOX had a favorable safety profile.However, TSU-68 did not have a synergistic effect on the efficacy of SOX.The baseline serum IL-6 level could be a prognostic factor for TSU-68 efficacy.",1,1,1,1
30902613,"Updated Efficacy and Safety Data and Impact of the EML4-ALK Fusion Variant on the Efficacy of Alectinib in Untreated ALK-Positive Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer in the Global Phase III ALEX Study.INTRODUCTION: At the prior data cutoff (February 9, 2017) the ALEX trial showed superior investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) for alectinib versus crizotinib in untreated, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive, advanced NSCLC (hazard ratio = 0.47, 95% confidence interval: 0.34-0.65, p < 0.001).The median PFS in the alectinib arm was not reached versus 11.1 months with crizotinib.Retrospective analyses suggest that the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 gene-ALK variant (EML4-ALK) may influence ALK-inhibitor treatment benefit.We present updated analyses, including exploratory subgroup analysis by EML4-ALK variant, after an additional 10 months' follow-up (cutoff December 1, 2017).METHODS: Patients were randomized to receive twice-daily alectinib, 600 mg, or crizotinib, 250 mg, until disease progression, toxicity, death, or withdrawal.PFS was determined by the investigators.Baseline plasma and tissue biomarker samples were analyzed by using hybrid-capture, next-generation sequencing to determine EML4-ALK variant.RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were balanced.Investigator-assessed PFS was prolonged with alectinib (stratified hazard ratio = 0.43, 95% confidence interval: 0.32-0.58).The median PFS times were 34.8 months with alectinib and 10.9 months with crizotinib.EML4-ALK fusions were detectable in 129 patient plasma samples and 124 tissue samples; variants 1, 2, and 3/ab did not affect PFS, objective response rate, or duration of response.Investigator-assessed PFS was longer for alectinib than for crizotinib across EML4-ALK variants 1, 2, and 3a/b in plasma and tissue.Despite longer treatment duration (27.0 months in the case of alectinib versus 10.8 months in the case of crizotinib), the safety of alectinib compared favorably with that of crizotinib.CONCLUSION: Alectinib continues to demonstrate superior investigator-assessed PFS versus crizotinib in untreated ALK-positive NSCLC, irrespective of EML4-ALK variant.",1,1,1,1
34543613,"Extended therapy with letrozole as adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal patients with early-stage breast cancer: a multicentre, open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: The benefit of extending aromatase inhibitor therapy beyond 5 years in the context of previous aromatase inhibitors remains controversial.We aimed to compare extended therapy with letrozole for 5 years versus the standard duration of 2-3 years of letrozole in postmenopausal patients with breast cancer who have already received 2-3 years of tamoxifen.METHODS: This multicentre, open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial was done at 69 hospitals in Italy.Women were eligible if they were postmenopausal at the time of study entry, had stage I-III histologically proven and operable invasive hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, had received adjuvant tamoxifen therapy for at least 2 years but no longer than 3 years and 3 months, had no signs of disease recurrence, and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 or lower.Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 2-3 years (control group) or 5 years (extended group) of letrozole (2.5 mg orally once a day).Randomisation, with stratification by centre, with permuted blocks of size 12, was done with a centralised, interactive, internet-based system that randomly generated the treatment allocation.Participants and investigators were not masked to treatment assignment.The primary endpoint was invasive disease-free survival in the intention-to-treat population.Safety analysis was done for patients who received at least 1 month of study treatment.This trial was registered with EudraCT, 2005-001212-44, and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01064635.FINDINGS: Between Aug 1, 2005, and Oct 24, 2010, 2056 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive letrozole for 2-3 years (n=1030; control group) or for 5 years (n=1026; extended group).After a median follow-up of 11.7 years (IQR 9.5-13.1), disease-free survival events occurred in 262 (25.4%) of 1030 patients in the control group and 212 (20.7%) of 1026 in the extended group.12-year disease-free survival was 62% (95% CI 57-66) in the control group and 67% (62-71) in the extended group (hazard ratio 0.78, 95% CI 0.65-0.93; p=0.0064).The most common grade 3 and 4 adverse events were arthralgia (22 [2.2%] of 983 patients in the control group vs 29 [3.0%] of 977 in the extended group) and myalgia (seven [0.7%] vs nine [0.9%]).There were three (0.3%) serious treatment-related adverse events in the control group and eight (0.8%) in the extended group.No deaths related to toxic effects were observed.INTERPRETATION: In postmenopausal patients with breast cancer who received 2-3 years of tamoxifen, extended treatment with 5 years of letrozole resulted in a significant improvement in disease-free survival compared with the standard 2-3 years of letrozole.Sequential endocrine therapy with tamoxifen for 2-3 years followed by letrozole for 5 years should be considered as one of the optimal standard endocrine treatments for postmenopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.FUNDING: Novartis and the Italian Ministry of Health.TRANSLATION: For the Italian translation of the abstract see Supplementary Materials section.",1,1,1,1
27081036,"Cardiotoxicity as indicated by LVEF and troponin T sensitivity following two anthracycline-based regimens in lymphoma: Results from a randomized prospective clinical trial.Anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity influences treatment selection and may negatively affect clinical outcomes in lymphoma patients.While epirubicin induced cardiotoxicity less often than the same dose of doxorubicin in breast cancer, higher doses of epirubicin are required in lymphoma regimens for equivalent efficacy.Whether a higher dosage of epirubicin also induces cardiotoxicity less often than doxorubicin in lymphoma remains unknown.We therefore administered 6-8 cycles of cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisone (CEpOP) +/- rituximab (R) with either epirubicin (CEpOP) or doxorubicin (CHOP) to patients (N=398) with untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or follicular lymphoma grade 3 (FLG3).Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and high-sensitivity serum cardiac troponin T (HsTnT) were assessed at baseline and after 4 cycles of treatment.Epirubicin (70 mg/m2/dose) was equivalent to doxorubicin (50 mg/m2/dose) in terms of 3-year progression-free survival.The risk of decreased LVEF was similar between the two regimens.CEpOP+/-R induced HsTnT elevation less often than CHOP+/-R. We conclude that CEpOP+/-R is a more acceptable regimen with short-term efficacy similar to CHOP+/-R in lymphoma patients.Longer follow-up is needed to monitor the risk of cardiac dysfunction and determine whether differences in the induction of elevated HsTnT between epirubicin and doxorubicin justify changes in clinical practice.",0,0,0,0

32948387,"Double-Needle Lavage for Effective Treatment of Difficult-Aspiration Thyroid Cystic Nodules: A Single-Center Controlled Trial.PURPOSE: To explore the safety and efficacy of double-needle lavage (DNL) in the treatment of difficult aspiration thyroid cystic nodules.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This single-center, prospective, randomized controlled trial was conducted using 100 thyroid cysts from 100 patients who were treated in our hospital from January 2018 to August 2019.These patients were placed into 2 groups; group A including 40 patients treated with single-needle aspiration (SNA), and group B including 60 patients treated with DNL.The safety and efficacy of these 2 aspiration methods were compared.RESULTS: Ten patients in group A that did not benefit from SNA were transferred to group B. No complication occurred in either group.Notably, DNL showed significantly higher efficacy than SNA.This was evidenced by the higher extraction rate of materials in the capsule (A vs B, 91 +/- 6.51% vs 98.45 +/- 1.74%, P < .001) and overall nodule volume reduction rate in group B (A vs B, 87.54 +/- 7.84% vs 95.62 +/- 3.66%, P < .001).In group B, patients who received DNL treatment with 2 needles pointed at the upper and lower extremes of the cystic nodules (B2) exhibited significantly better aspiration effects compared to patients in which the 2 needles were pointed at the same ultrasound plane (B1) (P < .05), especially for patients with maximum diameter of nodules >/=3 cm (P < .01).CONCLUSIONS: DNL treatment could efficiently and safely replace cystic material from thyroid gland.Moreover, our results indicate that DNL treatment in which 2 needles are pointed at the 2 extremes of cystic nodules yields higher efficacy in patients with maximum diameter of nodules >/=3 cm.",0,0,0,0

Results from the GEICAM/2006-03, multicenter study.Chemotherapy remains as the only systemic treatment option available for basal-like breast cancer (BC) patients.Preclinical models and several phase II studies suggested that platinum salts are active drugs in this BC subtype though there is no randomized study supporting this hypothesis.This study investigates if the addition of carboplatin to a combination of an alkylating agent together with anthracyclines and taxanes is able to increase the efficacy in the neoadjuvant treatment context.Patients with operable breast cancer and immunophenotypically defined basal-like disease (ER-/PR-/HER2- and cytokeratin 5/6+ or EGFR+) were recruited.Patients were randomized to receive EC (epirubicin 90 mg/m(2) plus cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2) for 4 cycles) followed either by D (docetaxel 100 mg/m(2) x 4 cycles; EC-D) or DCb (docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) plus carboplatin AUC 6 x 4 cycles; EC-DCb).The primary end point was pathological complete response (pCR) in the breast following the Miller and Payne criteria.Ninety-four patients were randomized (46 EC-D, 48 EC-DCb).pCR rate in the breast was seen in 16 patients (35 %) with EC-D and 14 patients (30 %) with EC-DCb (P value = 0.61).pCR in the breast and axilla was seen in 30 % of patients in both arms.The overall clinical response rate was 70 % (95 % CI 56-83) in the EC-D arm and 77 % (95 % CI 65-87) in the EC-DCb arm.Grade 3/4 toxicity was similar in both arms.The addition of carboplatin to conventional chemotherapy with EC-D in basal-like breast cancer patients did not improve the efficacy probably because they had already received an alkylating agent.These findings should be taken into consideration when developing new agents for this disease.",1,1,1,1
23559149,"FOLFOX4 plus cetuximab administered weekly or every second week in the first-line treatment of patients with KRAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer: a randomized phase II CECOG study.BACKGROUND: This randomized phase II study investigated first-line chemotherapy plus cetuximab administered every second week in KRAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients received FOLFOX4 plus either standard weekly cetuximab (arm 1) or cetuximab (500 mg/m(2)) every second week (arm 2), until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.Primary end point was the objective response rate (ORR).Progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), disease control rate (DCR) and safety were also investigated.The study was not powered to establish non-inferiority, but aimed at the estimation of treatment differences.RESULTS: Of 152 randomized eligible patients, 75 were treated in arm 1 and 77 in arm 2; ORRs [53% versus 62%, odds ratio 1.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74-2.66], PFS [median 9.5 versus 9.2 months, hazard ratio (HR) 0.92, 95% CI 0.63-1.34], OS (median 25.8 versus 23.0 months, HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.56-1.30) and DCR (87%) were comparable.HRs adjusted for baseline factors were 1.01 and 0.99 for PFS and OS, respectively.Frequencies of grade 3/4 adverse events in arms 1 versus 2 were similar: most common were neutropenia (28% versus 34%) and rash (15% versus 17%).CONCLUSIONS: Activity and safety of FOLFOX4 plus either cetuximab administered weekly or every second week were similar.",1,1,1,1
24141008,"Improved survival with ursodeoxycholic acid prophylaxis in allogeneic stem cell transplantation: long-term follow-up of a randomized study.We report the long-term results of a prospective randomized study on the use of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) for prevention of hepatic complications after allogeneic stem cell transplantation.Two hundred forty-two patients, 232 with malignant disease, were randomized to receive (n = 123) or not to receive (n = 119) UDCA from the beginning of the conditioning until 90 days post-transplantation.The results were reported after 1-year follow-up.UDCA administration reduced significantly the proportion of patients developing high serum bilirubin levels as well as the incidence of severe acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), liver GVHD, and intestinal GVHD.In the UDCA prophylaxis group, nonrelapse mortality (NRM) was lower and overall survival better than in the control group.After a 10-year follow-up, the difference in the survival and NRM in favor of the UDCA-treated group, seen at 1 year, was maintained (survival 48% versus 38%, P = .037; NRM 28% versus 41%, P = .01).A landmark analysis in patients surviving at 1 year post-transplantation showed no significant differences between the study groups in the long-term follow-up in chronic GVHD, relapse rate, NRM, disease-free survival, or overall survival.These long-term results continue to support the useful role of UDCA in the prevention of transplant-related complications in allogeneic transplantation.",1,1,1,1
33295007,"Apalutamide for metastatic, castration-sensitive prostate cancer in the Japanese population: A subgroup analysis of the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 TITAN study.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of apalutamide + androgen deprivation therapy versus androgen deprivation therapy alone in Japanese patients with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer from the phase 3, randomized, global TITAN study.METHODS: Men with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer randomly (1:1) received 240 mg apalutamide + androgen deprivation therapy or matching placebo + androgen deprivation therapy.The primary efficacy endpoints were radiographic progression-free survival and overall survival.Secondary efficacy endpoints were time to cytotoxic chemotherapy, pain progression, chronic opioid use, and skeletal-related events.Safety was also assessed.RESULTS: Of the 1052 patients included in the TITAN study, 51 (4.85%) were Japanese (apalutamide group, n = 28; placebo group, n = 23).In all, 81.8% of patients in the apalutamide and 71.8% in the placebo group did not experience radiographic progression or death, and the hazard ratio for radiographic progression-free survival favored treatment with apalutamide (hazard ratio 0.712, 95% confidence interval 0.205-2.466; P = 0.59).At 24 months, 85.7% of patients in the apalutamide group and 81.5% in the placebo group were alive, and the hazard ratio for overall survival favored apalutamide (hazard ratio 0.840, 95% confidence interval 0.210-3.361; P = 0.805).In the interim analysis, the median radiographic progression-free survival and overall survival were not reached in the apalutamide group and time to cytotoxic chemotherapy was delayed following apalutamide treatment.The safety profile of apalutamide in the Japanese subpopulation was comparable with that of the global population, except for skin rash.CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present analyses suggest that apalutamide + androgen deprivation therapy in Japanese patients had favorable efficacy compared with androgen deprivation therapy alone, and these findings are comparable to those in the overall population.Apalutamide + androgen deprivation therapy can be considered as one of the therapeutic options for a broad spectrum of metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer regardless of prior treatment and disease extent in Japanese patients.",1,1,1,1

23981402,"Self-reported use of complementary and alternative medicine therapies in a reflexology randomized clinical trial.BACKGROUND: According to the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), about one-third of American cancer patients have used complementary and alternative medicine (CAM).OBJECTIVE: The objective of this secondary analysis was an assessment of the use of other CAM by women with advanced breast cancer who were undergoing chemotherapy and who participated in a randomized clinical trial (RCT) studying the safety and efficacy of reflexology.For this secondary analysis, the research team hypothesized an increased CAM use due to exposure to the reflexology trial.METHODS/DESIGN: For this secondary analysis, the team conducted telephone interviews at baseline, wk 5, and wk 11 to assess the use of 23 common CAM therapies.SETTING: The study took place at 14 medical oncology clinics across the Midwestern United States.PARTICIPANTS: Participants included women with advanced breast cancer who were undergoing chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy.INTERVENTION: In the study related to this secondary analysis, the research team randomly assigned the women to one of three primary groups: (1) reflexology; (2) lay foot manipulation (LFM); and (3) control.In addition, the research team used two test groups to establish the study's protocol: (1) test reflexology and (2) test LFM.For this secondary analysis, the research team considered the two reflexology groups (test and intervention) and the two LFM groups (test and intervention) to be the active groups, comparing their use of CAM to the control group's use at the selected time points.PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The research team used a linear, mixed-effects model to analyze the number of therapies used at the three time points.The team performed t tests to compare therapy use at baseline for those women who completed the study vs those who dropped out.The team used the CAM-use instrument.RESULTS: In total, 385 women participated.The research team found no differences in CAM use for the active groups vs the control group over time or in those women who stayed in the study vs those who dropped out.The team found an increase in CAM use at wk 5 compared to baseline, followed by a decrease at wk 11; however, the time trends were the same in the active groups and the control group CONCLUSIONS: In women with advanced breast cancer, researchers can rely upon one assessment of CAM use during an RCT of a CAM therapy.",0,0,0,0
22071311,"Cognitive performance after postoperative pituitary radiotherapy: a dosimetric study of the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex.OBJECTIVE: The hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC) are important for memory and executive functioning and are known to be sensitive to radiotherapy (RT).Radiation dosimetry relates radiation exposure to specific brain areas.The effects of various pituitary RT techniques were studied by relating detailed dosimetry of the hippocampus and PFC to cognitive performance.METHODS: In this cross-sectional design, 75 non-functioning pituitary macroadenoma (NFA) patients (61+/-10 years) participated and were divided into irradiated (RT+, n=30) and non-irradiated (RT-, n=45) groups.The RT+ group (who all received 25 fractions of 1.8 Gy; total dose: 45 Gy) consisted of three RT technique groups: three-field technique, n=10; four-field technique, n=15; and five-field technique, n=5.Memory and executive functioning were assessed by standardized neuropsychological tests.A reconstruction of the dose distributions for the three RT techniques was made.The RT doses on 30, 50, and 70% of the volume of the left and right hippocampus and PFC were calculated.RESULTS: Cognitive test performance was not different between the four groups, despite differences in radiation doses applied to the hippocampi and PFC.Age at RT, time since RT, and the use of thyroid hormone varied significantly between the groups; however, they were not related to cognitive performance.CONCLUSION: This study showed that there were no significant differences on cognitive performance between the three-, four-, and five-field RT groups and the non-irradiated patient group.A dose-response relationship could not be established, even with a radiation dose that was higher on most of the volume of the hippocampus and PFC in case of a four-field RT technique compared with the three- and five-field RT techniques.",0,0,0,0
25395283,"Randomized, phase III trial of figitumumab in combination with erlotinib versus erlotinib alone in patients with nonadenocarcinoma nonsmall-cell lung cancer.BACKGROUND: Figitumumab (CP-751,871) is a fully human IgG2 monoclonal antibody that inhibits the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor.This multicenter, randomized, phase III study investigated the efficacy of figitumumab plus erlotinib compared with erlotinib alone in patients with pretreated, nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients (stage IIIB/IV or recurrent disease with nonadenocarcinoma histology) who had previously received at least one platinum-based regimen were randomized to receive open-label figitumumab (20 mg/kg) plus erlotinib 150 mg/day or erlotinib alone every 3 weeks.The primary end point was overall survival (OS).RESULTS: Of 583 patients randomized, 579 received treatment.The study was closed early by an independent data safety monitoring committee due to results crossing the prespecified futility boundary.At the final analysis, median OS was 5.7 months for figitumumab plus erlotinib and 6.2 months for erlotinib alone [hazard ratio (HR) 1.09; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91-1.31; P = 0.35].Median progression-free survival was 2.1 months for figitumumab plus erlotinib and 2.6 months for erlotinib alone (HR 1.08; 95% CI 0.90-1.29; P = 0.43).Treatment-related nonfatal serious adverse events occurred in 18% and 5% of patients in the figitumumab arm or erlotinib alone arm, respectively.There were nine treatment-related deaths (three related to both drugs, four related to erlotinib alone and two related to figitumumab).CONCLUSIONS: The addition of figitumumab to erlotinib did not improve OS in patients with advanced, pretreated, nonadenocarcinoma NSCLC.Clinical development of figitumumab has been discontinued.CLINICAL TRIAL ID: NCT00673049.",1,1,1,1
34551229,"Overall Survival Benefit with Tebentafusp in Metastatic Uveal Melanoma.BACKGROUND: Uveal melanoma is a disease that is distinct from cutaneous melanoma, with a low tumor mutational burden and a 1-year overall survival of approximately 50% in patients with metastatic uveal melanoma.Data showing a proven overall survival benefit with a systemic treatment are lacking.Tebentafusp is a bispecific protein consisting of an affinity-enhanced T-cell receptor fused to an anti-CD3 effector that can redirect T cells to target glycoprotein 100-positive cells.METHODS: In this open-label, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned previously untreated HLA-A*02:01-positive patients with metastatic uveal melanoma in a 2:1 ratio to receive tebentafusp (tebentafusp group) or the investigator's choice of therapy with single-agent pembrolizumab, ipilimumab, or dacarbazine (control group), stratified according to the lactate dehydrogenase level.The primary end point was overall survival.RESULTS: A total of 378 patients were randomly assigned to either the tebentafusp group (252 patients) or the control group (126 patients).Overall survival at 1 year was 73% in the tebentafusp group and 59% in the control group (hazard ratio for death, 0.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.37 to 0.71; P<0.001) in the intention-to-treat population.Progression-free survival was also significantly higher in the tebentafusp group than in the control group (31% vs. 19% at 6 months; hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.94; P = 0.01).The most common treatment-related adverse events in the tebentafusp group were cytokine-mediated events (due to T-cell activation) and skin-related events (due to glycoprotein 100-positive melanocytes), including rash (83%), pyrexia (76%), and pruritus (69%).These adverse events decreased in incidence and severity after the first three or four doses and infrequently led to discontinuation of the trial treatment (2%).No treatment-related deaths were reported.CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with tebentafusp resulted in longer overall survival than the control therapy among previously untreated patients with metastatic uveal melanoma.(Funded by Immunocore; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03070392; EudraCT number, 2015-003153-18.).",1,1,1,1
25057173,"EGFR biomarkers predict benefit from vandetanib in combination with docetaxel in a randomized phase III study of second-line treatment of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.BACKGROUND: ZODIAC was a randomized phase III study of second-line treatment in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that evaluated the addition of vandetanib to docetaxel.The study showed a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival and objective response rate, but not in overall survival for unselected patients.This study evaluated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutation, copy number gain, and protein expression, and KRAS gene mutation, in pretreatment tumor samples as potential biomarkers predicting benefit from vandetanib as second-line treatment of NSCLC.PATIENTS AND METHODS: After progression following first-line chemotherapy, 1391 patients with locally advanced or metastatic (stage IIIB/IV) NSCLC were randomized 1 : 1 to receive vandetanib (100 mg/day) plus docetaxel (75 mg/m(2) every 21 days) or placebo plus docetaxel in the ZODIAC study.Archival tumor samples (n = 570) were collected from consenting patients (n = 958) for predefined, prospective biomarker analyses.RESULTS: Of evaluable samples, 14% were EGFR mutation positive, 35% were EGFR FISH positive, 88% were EGFR protein expression positive, and 13% were KRAS mutation positive.Compared with the overall study population, in which progression-free survival (PFS) [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.79] but not OS (HR = 0.91) were significantly improved with vandetanib, there was greater relative clinical benefit for patients with EGFR mutation-positive tumors [PFS HR 0.51, confidence interval (CI) 0.25-1.06 and OS HR 0.46, CI 0.14-1.57] and EGFR FISH-positive tumors (PFS HR 0.61, CI 0.39-0.94 and OS HR 0.48, CI 0.28-0.84).Similarly, patients with EGFR mutation or FISH-positive tumor samples who received vandetanib had an increased chance of objective tumor response (odds ratios 3.34, CI 0.8-13.89, and 3.90, CI 1.02-14.82, respectively).There did not appear to be benefit for vandetanib in patients with KRAS mutation-positive tumors.CONCLUSIONS: High EGFR gene copy number or activating EGFR mutations may identify patient subgroups who receive increased clinical benefit from vandetanib in combination with docetaxel in second-line NSCLC.CLINICALTRIALSGOV: NCT00312377.",1,1,1,1
25331064,"Modified methylene blue injection improves lymph node harvest in rectal cancer.BACKGROUND: The presence of nodal metastases in rectal cancer plays an important role in accurate staging and prognosis, which depends on adequate lymph node harvest.The aim of this prospective study is to investigate the feasibility and survival benefit of improving lymph node harvest by a modified method with methylene blue injection in rectal cancer specimens.METHODS: One hundred and thirty-one patients with rectal cancer were randomly assigned to the control group in which lymph nodes were harvested by palpation and sight, or to the methylene blue group using a modified method of injection into the superior rectal artery with methylene blue.Analysis of clinicopathologic records, including a long-term follow-up, was performed.RESULTS: In the methylene blue group, 678 lymph nodes were harvested by simple palpation and sight.Methylene blue injection added 853 lymph nodes to the total harvest as well as 32 additional metastatic lymph nodes, causing a shift to node-positive stage in four patients.The average number of lymph nodes harvested was 11.7 +/- 3.4 in the control group and 23.2 +/- 4.7 in the methylene blue group, respectively.The harvest of small lymph nodes (<5 mm) and the average number of metastatic nodes were both significantly higher in the methylene blue group.The modified method of injection with methylene blue had no impact on overall survival.DISCUSSION: The modified method with methylene blue injection improved lymph node harvest in rectal cancer, especially small node and metastatic node retrieval, which provided more accurate staging.However, it was not associated with overall survival.",1,1,0,0

31560068,"Addition of docetaxel to hormonal therapy in low- and high-burden metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer: long-term survival results from the STAMPEDE trial.BACKGROUND: STAMPEDE has previously reported that the use of upfront docetaxel improved overall survival (OS) for metastatic hormone naive prostate cancer patients starting long-term androgen deprivation therapy.We report on long-term outcomes stratified by metastatic burden for M1 patients.METHODS: We randomly allocated patients in 2 : 1 ratio to standard-of-care (SOC; control group) or SOC + docetaxel.Metastatic disease burden was categorised using retrospectively-collected baseline staging scans where available.Analysis used Cox regression models, adjusted for stratification factors, with emphasis on restricted mean survival time where hazards were non-proportional.RESULTS: Between 05 October 2005 and 31 March 2013, 1086 M1 patients were randomised to receive SOC (n = 724) or SOC + docetaxel (n = 362).Metastatic burden was assessable for 830/1086 (76%) patients; 362 (44%) had low and 468 (56%) high metastatic burden.Median follow-up was 78.2 months.There were 494 deaths on SOC (41% more than the previous report).There was good evidence of benefit of docetaxel over SOC on OS (HR = 0.81, 95% CI 0.69-0.95, P = 0.009) with no evidence of heterogeneity of docetaxel effect between metastatic burden sub-groups (interaction P = 0.827).Analysis of other outcomes found evidence of benefit for docetaxel over SOC in failure-free survival (HR = 0.66, 95% CI 0.57-0.76, P < 0.001) and progression-free survival (HR = 0.69, 95% CI 0.59-0.81, P < 0.001) with no evidence of heterogeneity of docetaxel effect between metastatic burden sub-groups (interaction P > 0.5 in each case).There was no evidence that docetaxel resulted in late toxicity compared with SOC: after 1 year, G3-5 toxicity was reported for 28% SOC and 27% docetaxel (in patients still on follow-up at 1 year without prior progression).CONCLUSIONS: The clinically significant benefit in survival for upfront docetaxel persists at longer follow-up, with no evidence that benefit differed by metastatic burden.We advocate that upfront docetaxel is considered for metastatic hormone naive prostate cancer patients regardless of metastatic burden.",1,1,1,1
23002282,"A randomized phase II study evaluating the combination of carboplatin-based chemotherapy with pertuzumab versus carboplatin-based therapy alone in patients with relapsed, platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer.BACKGROUND: Pertuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)-mediated signalling, has shown activity in ovarian cancer in preclinical models and in the clinic.This randomized phase II study evaluated efficacy and safety of pertuzumab in combination with carboplatin-based chemotherapy in patients with platinum-sensitive, recurrent advanced ovarian cancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomized to receive six cycles of chemotherapy (carboplatin and either paclitaxel (Taxol) or gemcitabine) with or without pertuzumab.The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) as determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors and/or by CA 125 measurements.Secondary end points evaluated the response rate, safety profile, duration of response, time to progression and overall survival for both treatment arms.RESULTS: A total of 149 patients received either chemotherapy with pertuzumab (arm A, n=74) or chemotherapy alone (arm B, n=75).There was no significant difference either in median PFS or in the secondary end points between the two arms.No differences were seen in an exploratory biomarker analysis of HER3 mRNA expression between the two arms.Pertuzumab was well tolerated, with no increase in cardiac adverse events compared with chemotherapy alone.CONCLUSIONS: The addition of pertuzumab to carboplatin-based chemotherapy did not substantially prolong PFS in unselected patients with platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer.",1,1,1,0
34029149,"Efficacy and Safety of Cetuximab Plus Cisplatin Alone or in Combination With Paclitaxel in Patients With Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma: A Randomized Trial.OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the clinical usefulness of cetuximab and cisplatin alone or in combination with paclitaxel as the first-line treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).METHODOLOGY: Three hundred patients with confirmed HNSCC from 20 different hospitals were included in this study.Patients in group I underwent a 2-hour infusion of 400 mg/m(2) cetuximab (day 1), followed by a 1-hour infusion of 250 mg/m(2) cetuximab weekly and 1-hour infusion of 100 mg/m(2) cisplatin (days 1 and 21) per treatment cycle.Patients in group II were treated with a combination of cetuximab, cisplatin, and paclitaxel.Patients received 6 cycles of 175 mg/m(2) paclitaxel given on days 1 and 21.The primary outcome of the study was progression-free survival (PFS); overall survival (OS) and objective response rate (ORR) were the secondary endpoints.RESULTS: The median PFS was 5 months and 8 months for patients in groups I and II, respectively (HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.85-1.78; P > 0.05).Similarly, we found no significant differences in OS between the 2 groups (median OS, 13 vs. 11 months, respectively; HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.42-1.43; P = 0.198).Moreover, we observed no significant difference in ORR between the 2 groups (ORR, 63.3% vs 69.9%, respectively; HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.36-1.67; P = 0.231).CONCLUSIONS: The combination of paclitaxel with cetuximab and cisplatin did not improve patient outcomes compared to cetuximab plus cisplatin alone.Therefore, the 2-drug regimen could be used as first-line treatment in patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC.",1,1,1,1

23281805,"Randomized Phase II trial of paclitaxel and carboplatin followed by gemcitabine switch-maintenance therapy versus gemcitabine and carboplatin followed by gemcitabine continuation-maintenance therapy in previously untreated advanced non-small cell lung cancer.BACKGROUND: In recent years, maintenance chemotherapy is increasingly being recognized as a new treatment strategy to improve the outcome of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).However, the optimal maintenance strategy is still controversial.Gemcitabine is a promising candidate for single-agent maintenance therapy because of little toxicity and good tolerability.We have conducted a randomized phase II study to evaluate the validity of single-agent maintenance chemotherapy of gemcitabine and to compare continuation- and switch-maintenance.METHODS: Chemonaive patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC were randomly assigned 1:1 to either arm A or B. Patients received paclitaxel (200 mg/m2, day 1) plus carboplatin (AUC 6 mg/mL/min, day 1) every 3 weeks in arm A, or gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2, days 1 and 8) plus carboplatin (AUC 5 mg/mL/min, day1) every 3 weeks in arm B. Non-progressive patients following 3 cycles of induction chemotherapy received maintenance gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2, days 1 and 8) every 3 weeks.( TRIAL REGISTRATION: UMIN000008252)RESULTS: The study was stopped because of delayed accrual at interim analysis.Of the randomly assigned 50 patients, 49 except for one in arm B were evaluable.Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 4.6 months for arm A vs. 3.5 months for arm B (HR = 1.03; 95% CI, 0.45-2.27; p = 0.95) and median overall survival (OS) was 15.0 months for arm A vs. 14.8 months for arm B (HR = 0.79; 95% CI, 0.40-1.51; p = 0.60), showing no difference between the two arms.The response rate, disease control rate, and the transit rate to maintenance phase were 36.0% (9/25), 64.0% (16/25), and 48% (12/25) for arm A vs. 16.7% (4/24), 50.0% (12/24), and 33% (8/24) for arm B, which were also statistically similar between the two arms (p = 0.13, p = 0.32, and p = 0.30, respectively).Both induction regimens were tolerable, except that more patients experienced peripheral neuropathy in arm A. Toxicities during the maintenance phase were also minimal.CONCLUSION: Survival and overall response were not significantly different between the two arms.Gemcitabine may be well-tolerable and feasible for maintenance therapy.",1,1,1,1

22374991,"Gastric cancer incidence among Hispanics in California: patterns by time, nativity, and neighborhood characteristics.BACKGROUND: Better understanding about gastric cancer incidence patterns among Hispanics by birthplace, socioeconomic status (SES), and acculturation can improve preventive strategies and disease models.METHODS: Incidence rates, rate ratios, and estimated annual percent change (EAPC) in rates of anatomic and histologic subtype-specific gastric cancer were calculated by age, sex, and nativity among Hispanics using California Cancer Registry data from 1988 through 2004.Incidence rates in 1998 to 2002 were compared by neighborhood SES and Hispanic enclave status according to 2000 US Census data.RESULTS: Incidence rates of diffuse gastric cancer increased from 1988 through 2004 among foreign-born Hispanic men (EAPC: 3.5%, 95% CI: 1.5%-5.5%) and U.S.-born Hispanic women (EAPC: 3.0%, 95% CI: 0.7%-5.3%).During the same time period, incidence rates of intestinal gastric cancer declined significantly and both cardia and noncardia gastric cancer were steady or declined among foreign-born and U.S.-born Hispanic men and women.Noncardia and both intestinal and diffuse gastric cancer were more common in foreign-born than U.S.-born Hispanic men and women, and in those from lower SES, higher enclave neighborhoods.By contrast, among younger and middle-aged Hispanic men, cardia tumors were more common in the U.S.-born than the foreign-born, and in higher SES, lower enclave neighborhoods.CONCLUSIONS: Varying gastric cancer risk factors among Hispanic subgroups and increasing rates of diffuse gastric cancer in foreign-born Hispanic men and U.S.-born Hispanic women merit further investigation to identify separate disease etiologies.IMPACT: Age, sex, birthplace, SES, and acculturation modify gastric cancer incidence in Hispanics and should be considered when examining disease risk and prevention.",0,0,0,0
30902613,"Updated Efficacy and Safety Data and Impact of the EML4-ALK Fusion Variant on the Efficacy of Alectinib in Untreated ALK-Positive Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer in the Global Phase III ALEX Study.INTRODUCTION: At the prior data cutoff (February 9, 2017) the ALEX trial showed superior investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) for alectinib versus crizotinib in untreated, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive, advanced NSCLC (hazard ratio = 0.47, 95% confidence interval: 0.34-0.65, p < 0.001).The median PFS in the alectinib arm was not reached versus 11.1 months with crizotinib.Retrospective analyses suggest that the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 gene-ALK variant (EML4-ALK) may influence ALK-inhibitor treatment benefit.We present updated analyses, including exploratory subgroup analysis by EML4-ALK variant, after an additional 10 months' follow-up (cutoff December 1, 2017).METHODS: Patients were randomized to receive twice-daily alectinib, 600 mg, or crizotinib, 250 mg, until disease progression, toxicity, death, or withdrawal.PFS was determined by the investigators.Baseline plasma and tissue biomarker samples were analyzed by using hybrid-capture, next-generation sequencing to determine EML4-ALK variant.RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were balanced.Investigator-assessed PFS was prolonged with alectinib (stratified hazard ratio = 0.43, 95% confidence interval: 0.32-0.58).The median PFS times were 34.8 months with alectinib and 10.9 months with crizotinib.EML4-ALK fusions were detectable in 129 patient plasma samples and 124 tissue samples; variants 1, 2, and 3/ab did not affect PFS, objective response rate, or duration of response.Investigator-assessed PFS was longer for alectinib than for crizotinib across EML4-ALK variants 1, 2, and 3a/b in plasma and tissue.Despite longer treatment duration (27.0 months in the case of alectinib versus 10.8 months in the case of crizotinib), the safety of alectinib compared favorably with that of crizotinib.CONCLUSION: Alectinib continues to demonstrate superior investigator-assessed PFS versus crizotinib in untreated ALK-positive NSCLC, irrespective of EML4-ALK variant.",1,1,1,1
28743247,"A randomized phase II study of paclitaxel alone versus paclitaxel plus sorafenib in second- and third-line treatment of patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer (PASO).BACKGROUND: We conducted an open-label, randomized, two-arm multi-center study to assess the efficacy and safety of paclitaxel versus paclitaxel + sorafenib in patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer.METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive either paclitaxel monotherapy (80 mg/m(2)) weekly (3 weeks on, 1 week off) plus sorafenib 400 mg orally, twice a day taken continuously throughout 28 day cycles.Sorafenib dose was gradually escalated from a starting dose of 200 mg twice a day.The primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS).RESULTS: A pre-planned efficacy interim analysis was performed on the data of 60 patients, 30 patients in each treatment arm.Median PFS was estimated at 6.6 months (95% CI: 5.1 to 9.0) in patients randomized to single-agent paclitaxel (Arm A) and 5.6 months (95% CI: 3.8 to 6.5) in patients randomized to paclitaxel-sorafenib combination (Arm B) therapy.Contrary to the hypothesis, the treatment effect was statistically significant in favor of paclitaxel monotherapy (hazard ratio 1.80, 95% CI: 1.02 to 3.20; log-rank test P = 0.0409).It was decided to stop the trial early for futility.Median OS was also in favor of Arm A (20.7 months (95% CI: 16.4 to 26.7) versus 12.1 months (95% CI: 5.8 to 20.4) in Arm B. Clinical control was achieved in 28 patients (93.3%) in Arm A and in 21 patients 70.0% in Arm B. Overall response rate was met in 43.3% of patients in Arm A and in 40.0% in Arm B. Toxicities were increased in Arm B with higher rates of diarrhea, nausea, neutropenia, hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) and anorexia, Grad 3 and 4 toxicities were rare.CONCLUSIONS: In this pre-planned interim analysis, paclitaxel-sorafenib combination therapy was not found to be superior to paclitaxel monotherapy with regard to the primary end point, progression-free survival.The trial was therefore discontinued early.There was no indication of more favorable outcomes for combination therapy in secondary efficacy end points.As expected, the safety and toxicity profile of the combination therapy was less favorable compared to monotherapy.Overall, this trial did not demonstrate that adding sorafenib to second- or third-line paclitaxel provides any clinical benefit to patients with HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer.Cautious dosing using a sorafenib ramp up schedule might have contributed to negative results.TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered at EudraCT (No 2009-018025-73) and retrospectively registered at Clinical trials.gov on March 17, 2011 ( NCT01320111 ).",1,1,1,1

31573911,"Tailored Web-Based Information for Younger and Older Patients with Cancer: Randomized Controlled Trial of a Preparatory Educational Intervention on Patient Outcomes.BACKGROUND: Many patients with cancer, including older patients (aged >/=65 years), consult the Web to prepare for their doctor's visit.In particular, older patients have varying needs regarding the mode in which information is presented (eg, via textual, visual, or audiovisual modes) owing to age-related sensory (eg, impaired vision and hearing) and cognitive decline (eg, reduced processing speed).Therefore, Web-based information targeted at older patient populations is likely to be used and processed more effectively, and evaluated more positively, when tailored to age-related capabilities and preferences.This, in turn, may benefit patient outcomes.OBJECTIVE: This randomized controlled trial tested the effects of a Web-based tailored educational intervention among newly diagnosed younger (<65 years) and older (>/=65 years) patients with cancer.We compared the intervention group who viewed a mode-tailored website (ie, enabling patients to tailor information using textual, visual, and audiovisual modes) with 3 control groups view a nontailored website (ie, text only, text with images, and text with videos).We examined website experience outcomes (ie, website satisfaction, website involvement, knowledge, anxiety, and communication self-efficacy) and consultation experience outcomes (ie, question asking during consultation, anxiety, and information recall).METHODS: Patients from a multidisciplinary outpatient clinic (N=232) viewed a mode-tailored or nontailored website as preparation before their hospital consultations to discuss diagnosis and treatment.Data were collected before (T1), during (T2), and after (T3) visitation.Website experience outcomes were assessed with questionnaires (T1).Patients' question asking was coded from videotaped consultations, and anxiety was assessed through a questionnaire (T2).Telephone interviews were conducted to assess knowledge acquired from the website before (T1) and after consultation (T3), and information recall from the consultation (T3).RESULTS: The preparatory website was well used across all conditions (mean 34 min).Younger patients viewing the mode-tailored website were more satisfied before consultation (P=.02) and reported lower anxiety after consultation (P=.046; vs text only).This pattern was not found in older patients.Mode tailoring yielded no other significant differences in patient outcomes.Regression analyses showed that website involvement (beta=.15; P=.03) and, to a lesser extent, website satisfaction (beta=.15; P=.05) positively associated with knowledge before consultation (T1).In turn, higher knowledge before consultation (beta=.39; P<.001), together with time on the website (beta=.21; P=.002; T1), predicted information recall from consultations (T3).Patients with higher knowledge before consultation (T1) also reported higher knowledge from the website afterward (T3; beta=.22; P=.003).CONCLUSIONS: Offering preparatory online information before consultations benefits information processing and patient outcomes of both younger and older newly diagnosed patients with cancer.Younger patients benefit even more when information is offered in a mode-tailored manner.We discuss the theoretical, methodological, and practical implications for patient-provider communication research in an electronic health era.CLINICAL TRIAL: Netherlands Trial Register NTR5904; https://www.trialregister.nl/trial/5750.",1,1,0,0

Patients received paclitaxel (200 mg/m2, day 1) plus carboplatin (AUC 6 mg/mL/min, day 1) every 3 weeks in arm A, or gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2, days 1 and 8) plus carboplatin (AUC 5 mg/mL/min, day1) every 3 weeks in arm B. Non-progressive patients following 3 cycles of induction chemotherapy received maintenance gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2, days 1 and 8) every 3 weeks.( TRIAL REGISTRATION: UMIN000008252)RESULTS: The study was stopped because of delayed accrual at interim analysis.Of the randomly assigned 50 patients, 49 except for one in arm B were evaluable.Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 4.6 months for arm A vs. 3.5 months for arm B (HR = 1.03; 95% CI, 0.45-2.27; p = 0.95) and median overall survival (OS) was 15.0 months for arm A vs. 14.8 months for arm B (HR = 0.79; 95% CI, 0.40-1.51; p = 0.60), showing no difference between the two arms.The response rate, disease control rate, and the transit rate to maintenance phase were 36.0% (9/25), 64.0% (16/25), and 48% (12/25) for arm A vs. 16.7% (4/24), 50.0% (12/24), and 33% (8/24) for arm B, which were also statistically similar between the two arms (p = 0.13, p = 0.32, and p = 0.30, respectively).Both induction regimens were tolerable, except that more patients experienced peripheral neuropathy in arm A. Toxicities during the maintenance phase were also minimal.CONCLUSION: Survival and overall response were not significantly different between the two arms.Gemcitabine may be well-tolerable and feasible for maintenance therapy.",1,1,1,1
25399973,"[Efficacies of gefitinib versus paclitaxel/carboplatin for patients with advanced pulmonary adenocarcinoma].OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical efficacies of gefitinib versus paclitaxel/carboplatin in patients with advanced pulmonary adenocarcinoma.METHODS: A total of 51 advanced pulmonary adenocarcinoma patients were recruited from Guangdong General Hospital during October 2006 to September 2007.Eligible patients were >/= 18 years old, either non-smokers or former light smokers and receiving no prior chemotherapy or biological/immunological therapy.According to performance status, smoking status and gender, they were selected with dynamic equilibrium randomized method 1: 1 to receive first-line gefitinib (250 mg/d) in gefitinib arm or carboplatin/paclitaxel (carboplatin, area under the curve 5 mg x ml(-)(1) x min(-)(1), 21-day cycle; paclitaxel, 200 mg/m(2), 21-day cycle in chemotherapy arm.The primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS). And the secondary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR) and overall survival (OS).RESULTS: They were randomized into gefitinib arm (n = 25) and paclitaxel/carboplatin arm (n = 26).The median PFS was 4.2 months in gefitinib arm and 8.3 months in paclitaxel/carboplatin arm (P = 0.422); ORR 36.0% in gefitinib arm and 42.3% in paclitaxel/carboplatin arm (P = 0.645); Median OS 14.4 months in gefitinib arm and 15.0 months in paclitaxel/carboplatin arm (P = 0.290).Multifactorial Cox regression analysis showed that age (P = 0.004), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutation status (P = 0.012) and subsequent treatments (platinum-based chemotherapy, P = 0.001; EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), P = 0.005) were the significant predictors of OS.CONCLUSIONS: No significant differences exist in terms of efficacy and survival between first-line gefitinib and paclitaxel/carboplatin for Chinese patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma who are non-smokers or former light smokers.And age, EGFR gene mutation status and subsequent treatments are significant predictor of OS.However, first-line gefitinib should not be recommended for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients only based on clinical factors, due to a very small sample-size in our study.",1,1,1,1
22710258,"The impact of healing touch on pediatric oncology patients.HYPOTHESES: Healing Touch (HT) is an energy therapy that has been shown to lower stress, pain, and fatigue in adult oncology patients.This study evaluated the feasibility of administering HT in pediatric oncology inpatient and outpatient units at Kapi'olani Medical Center for Women and Children.STUDY DESIGN: This study was a 1-year randomized prospective study consisting of 2 study arms.The HT arm was considered the treatment group, and reading/play activity was designated as the control group.Participants were randomly assigned to each arm on enrollment in the study.METHODS: They were recruited by the pediatric oncology social worker.Interested participants were asked to provide informed consent and were randomized to either the HT arm or the reading/play activity arm of the study.They received their designated intervention for 30 minutes at each inpatient or outpatient encounter.Participants, parents, and care providers were asked to complete preintervention and postintervention assessments.RESULTS: In all, 15 participants, aged 3 to 18 years old, were approached about the study between July 2009 and June 2010.A total of 9 participants enrolled (recruitment rate of 60%); 6 patients were randomized to receive HT sessions, and 3 patients received reading/play activities; 2 participants dropped out of the study because of prolonged hospitalizations and complicated treatments.An additional participant expired while in the study because of disease progression.Those in the HT group showed significant decreases in the scores for pain, stress, and fatigue for participants, parents, and caregivers.Furthermore, parents' perception of their children's pain decreased significantly for the HT group when compared with the group receiving reading/play activity.CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the feasibility of using energy therapy in the pediatric oncology patient population.There also seems to be an interest in this treatment modality for this patient population.Furthermore, these findings suggest that HT has a positive impact on pain, stress, and fatigue related to oncology treatment.",0,0,0,0
31591063,"Ramucirumab plus erlotinib in patients with untreated, EGFR-mutated, advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (RELAY): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Dual blockade of the EGFR and VEGF pathways in EGFR-mutated metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is supported by preclinical and clinical data, yet the approach is not widely implemented.RELAY assessed erlotinib, an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) standard of care, plus ramucirumab, a human IgG1 VEGFR2 antagonist, or placebo in patients with untreated EGFR-mutated metastatic NSCLC.METHODS: This is a worldwide, double-blind, phase 3 trial done in 100 hospitals, clinics, and medical centres in 13 countries.Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older (20 years or older in Japan and Taiwan) at the time of study entry, had stage IV NSCLC, with an EGFR exon 19 deletion (ex19del) or exon 21 substitution (Leu858Arg) mutation, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, and no CNS metastases.We randomly assigned eligible patients in a 1:1 ratio to receive oral erlotinib (150 mg/day) plus either intravenous ramucirumab (10 mg/kg) or matching placebo once every 2 weeks.Randomisation was done by an interactive web response system with a computer-generated sequence and stratified by sex, geographical region, EGFR mutation type, and EGFR testing method.The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population.Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment.This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02411448, and is ongoing for long-term survival follow-up.FINDINGS: Between Jan 28, 2016, and Feb 1, 2018, 449 eligible patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to treatment with ramucirumab plus erlotinib (n=224) or placebo plus erlotinib (n=225).Median duration of follow-up was 20.7 months (IQR 15.8-27.2).At the time of primary analysis, progression-free survival was significantly longer in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib group (19.4 months [95% CI 15.4-21.6]) than in the placebo plus erlotinib group (12.4 months [11.0-13.5]), with a stratified hazard ratio of 0.59 (95% CI 0.46-0.76; p<0.0001).Grade 3-4 treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 159 (72%) of 221 patients in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib group versus 121 (54%) of 225 in the placebo plus erlotinib group.The most common grade 3-4 treatment-emergent adverse events in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib group were hypertension (52 [24%]; grade 3 only) and dermatitis acneiform (33 [15%]), and in the placebo plus erlotinib group were dermatitis acneiform (20 [9%]) and increased alanine aminotransferase (17 [8%]).Treatment-emergent serious adverse events were reported in 65 (29%) of 221 patients in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib group and 47 (21%) of 225 in the placebo plus erlotinib group.The most common serious adverse events of any grade in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib group were pneumonia (seven [3%]) and cellulitis and pneumothorax (four [2%], each); the most common in the placebo plus erlotinib group were pyrexia (four [2%]) and pneumothorax (three [1%]).One on-study treatment-related death due to an adverse event occurred (haemothorax after a thoracic drainage procedure for a pleural empyema) in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib group.INTERPRETATION: Ramucirumab plus erlotinib demonstrated superior progression-free survival compared with placebo plus erlotinib in patients with untreated EGFR-mutated metastatic NSCLC.Safety was consistent with the safety profiles of the individual compounds in advanced lung cancer.The RELAY regimen is a viable new treatment option for the initial treatment of EGFR-mutated metastatic NSCLC.FUNDING: Eli Lilly.",1,1,1,1
29370781,"The PANDA study: a randomized phase II study of first-line FOLFOX plus panitumumab versus 5FU plus panitumumab in RAS and BRAF wild-type elderly metastatic colorectal cancer patients.BACKGROUND: Few data are available regarding the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer elderly patients with anti-EGFR agents in combination with chemotherapy.FOLFOX plus panitumumab is a standard first-line option for RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer.Slight adjustments in chemo-dosage are commonly applied in clinical practice to elderly patients, but those modified schedules have never been prospectively tested.Clinical definition of elderly (>/=70 years old) patients that may deserve a more or less intensive combination therapy is still debated.Several geriatric screening tools have been developed to predict survival and risk of toxicity from treatment.Among those, the G8 screening tool has been tested in cancer patients showing the strongest prognostic value for overall survival, while the CRASH score can stratify patients according to an estimated risk of treatment-related toxicities.METHODS: The PANDA study is a prospective, open-label, multicenter, randomized phase II trial of first-line therapy with panitumumab in combination with dose-adjusted FOLFOX or with 5-fluorouracil monotherapy, in previously untreated elderly patients (>/=70 years) with RAS and BRAF wild-type unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer.RAS and BRAF analyses are centralized.Geriatric assessment by means of G8 and CRASH score is planned at baseline and G8 will be re-evaluated at disease progression.The primary endpoint is duration of progression-free survival in both arms.Secondary endpoints include prospective evaluation of the prognostic role of G8 score and the correlation of CRASH risk categories with toxicity.DISCUSSION: The PANDA study aims at exploring safety and efficacy of panitumumab in combination with FOLFOX or with 5FU/LV in elderly patients affected by RAS and BRAF wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer, to identify the most promising treatment strategy in this setting.Additionally, this is the first trial in which the prognostic role of the G8 score will be prospectively evaluated.Results of this study will drive further experimental developments for one or both combinations.TRIAL REGISTRATION: PANDA is registered at Clinicaltrials.gov : NCT02904031 , July 11, 2016.PANDA is registered at EudraCT-No.: 2015-003888-10, September 3, 2015.",1,1,1,1

24447190,"Trait and state disgust: an experimental investigation of disgust and avoidance in colorectal cancer decision scenarios.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether trait and experimentally manipulated state disgust independently and/or interactively predict immediate and anticipated avoidance in decision scenarios related to colorectal cancer (CRC).METHOD: Eighty participants, aged 18 to 66 years, completed questionnaires assessing trait disgust prior to a laboratory session.Participants were gender block randomized to disgust or control conditions before completing tasks assessing immediate avoidance of a CRC disgust elicitor (stoma bag) and anticipated avoidance in hypothetical CRC scenarios.RESULTS: Manipulation checks confirmed the elicitation of disgust in the experimental condition.Persons in the experimental condition were more likely to exhibit immediate avoidance behaviors in response to a commonly used bowel disease device (stoma bag), and trait disgust predicted time to touch the device.Trait disgust also moderated the influence of state disgust on anticipated avoidance, namely delay in help seeking for bowel symptoms and predicted rating disgusting side effects as more deterring to adherence.CONCLUSIONS: The current report suggests the importance of examining disgust in CRC contexts and provides the first empirical demonstration that state and trait aspects of disgust may interactively operate to deter certain types of decisions.It thus furthers understanding of emotions and avoidance in a health context that has had surprisingly little focus to date.",0,0,0,0
33485464,"First-line nivolumab plus ipilimumab in unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma (CheckMate 743): a multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Approved systemic treatments for malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) have been limited to chemotherapy regimens that have moderate survival benefit with poor outcomes.Nivolumab plus ipilimumab has shown clinical benefit in other tumour types, including first-line non-small-cell lung cancer.We hypothesised that this regimen would improve overall survival in MPM.METHODS: This open-label, randomised, phase 3 study (CheckMate 743) was run at 103 hospitals across 21 countries.Eligible individuals were aged 18 years and older, with previously untreated, histologically confirmed unresectable MPM, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1.Eligible participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to nivolumab (3 mg/kg intravenously once every 2 weeks) plus ipilimumab (1 mg/kg intravenously once every 6 weeks) for up to 2 years, or platinum plus pemetrexed chemotherapy (pemetrexed [500 mg/m(2) intravenously] plus cisplatin [75 mg/m(2) intravenously] or carboplatin [area under the concentration-time curve 5 mg/mL per min intravenously]) once every 3 weeks for up to six cycles.The primary endpoint was overall survival among all participants randomly assigned to treatment, and safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of study treatment.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02899299, and is closed to accrual.FINDINGS: Between Nov 29, 2016, and April 28, 2018, 713 patients were enrolled, of whom 605 were randomly assigned to either nivolumab plus ipilimumab (n=303) or chemotherapy (n=302).467 (77%) of 605 participants were male and median age was 69 years (IQR 64-75).At the prespecified interim analysis (database lock April 3, 2020; median follow-up of 29.7 months [IQR 26.7-32.9]), nivolumab plus ipilimumab significantly extended overall survival versus chemotherapy (median overall survival 18.1 months [95% CI 16.8-21.4] vs 14.1 months [12.4-16.2]; hazard ratio 0.74 [96.6% CI 0.60-0.91]; p=0.0020).2-year overall survival rates were 41% (95% CI 35.1-46.5) in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab group and 27% (21.9-32.4) in the chemotherapy group.Grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events were reported in 91 (30%) of 300 patients treated with nivolumab plus ipilimumab and 91 (32%) of 284 treated with chemotherapy.Three (1%) treatment-related deaths occurred in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab group (pneumonitis, encephalitis, and heart failure) and one (<1%) in the chemotherapy group (myelosuppression).INTERPRETATION: Nivolumab plus ipilimumab provided significant and clinically meaningful improvements in overall survival versus standard-of-care chemotherapy, supporting the use of this first-in-class regimen that has been approved in the USA as of October, 2020, for previously untreated unresectable MPM.FUNDING: Bristol Myers Squibb.",0,0,0,0
29534639,"Cytokeratin-18 fragments predict treatment response and overall survival in gastric cancer in a randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer is common malignancy and exhibits a poor prognosis.At the time of diagnosis, the majority of patients present with metastatic disease which precludes curative treatment.Non-invasive biomarkers which discriminate early from advanced stages or predict the response to treatment are urgently required.This study explored the cytokeratin-18 fragment M30 and full-length cytokeratin-18 M65 in predicting treatment response and survival in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of advanced gastric cancer.METHODS: Patients enrolled in the SUN-CASE study received sunitinib or placebo as an adjunct to standard therapy with leucovorin (Ca-folinate), 5-fluorouracil, and irinotecan in second or third line.Treatment response rates, progression-free survival and overall survival were assessed during a follow-up period of 12 months.Cytokeratin-18 fragments were analyzed in 52 patients at baseline and day 14 of therapy.RESULTS: Levels of M30 correlated with the presence of metastasis and lymph node involvement and decreased significantly during chemotherapy.Importantly, baseline levels of M30 were significantly higher in patients who failed therapy.In addition, patients who did not respond to treatment were also identifiable at day 14 based on elevated M30 levels.By stepwise regression analysis, M30 at day 14 was identified as independent predictor of treatment response.Likewise, serum levels of full-length cytokeratin-18 M65 at baseline also correlated with treatment failure and progression-free survival.The addition of sunitinib did not exert any effects on serum levels of M30 or M65.CONCLUSION: The cytokeratin-18 fragment M30 at day 14 identifies patients that fail to second- or third-line therapy for advanced gastric cancer.Validation of this non-invasive biomarker in gastric cancer is warranted.",1,1,1,1
29034009,"A multicenter, randomized study of decitabine as epigenetic priming with induction chemotherapy in children with AML.BACKGROUND: Decitabine is a deoxycytidine nucleoside derivative inhibitor of DNA-methyltransferases, which has been studied extensively and is approved for myelodysplastic syndrome in adults but with less focus in children.Accordingly, we conducted a phase 1 multicenter, randomized, open-label study to evaluate decitabine pre-treatment before standard induction therapy in children with newly diagnosed AML to assess safety and tolerability and explore a number of biologic endpoints.RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were fully assessable for all study objectives per protocol (10 in Arm A = epigenetic priming induction, 14 in Arm B = standard induction).All patients experienced neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.The most common grade 3 and 4 non-hematologic adverse events observed were gastrointestinal toxicities and hypophosphatemia.Plasma decitabine PK were similar to previously reported adult data.Overall CR/CRi was similar for the two arms.MRD negativity at end-induction was 85% in Arm A versus 67% in Arm B patients.DNA methylation measured in peripheral blood over the course of treatment tracked with blast clearance and matched marrow aspirates at day 0 and day 21.Unlike end-induction marrow analyses, promoter methylation in blood identified an apparent reversal of response in the lone treatment failure, 1 week prior to the patient's marrow aspirate confirming non-response.Decitabine-induced effects on end-induction (day 35-43 following initiation of treatment) marrows in Arm A were reflected by changes in DNA methylation in matched paired marrow diagnostic aspirates.CONCLUSIONS: This first-in-pediatrics trial demonstrates that decitabine prior to standard combination chemotherapy is feasible and well tolerated in children with newly diagnosed AML.Pre-treatment with decitabine may represent a newer therapeutic option for pediatric AML, especially as it appears to induce important epigenetic alterations.The novel biological correlates studied in this trial offer a clinically relevant window into disease progression and remission.Additional studies are needed to definitively assess whether decitabine can enhance durability responses in children with AML.TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT01177540.",1,1,1,1
34446053,"Durvalumab (MEDI 4736) in combination with extended neoadjuvant regimens in rectal cancer: a study protocol of a randomised phase II trial (PRIME-RT).BACKGROUND: Advances in multi-modality treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) have resulted in low local recurrence rates, but around 30% of patients will still die from distant metastatic disease.In parallel, there is increasing recognition that with radiotherapy and systemic treatment, some patients achieve a complete response and may avoid surgical resection, including in many cases, the need for a permanent stoma.Extended neoadjuvant regimes have emerged to address these concerns.The inclusion of immunotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting has the potential to further enhance this strategy by priming the local immune microenvironment and engaging the systemic immune response.METHODS: PRIME-RT is a multi-centre, open label, phase II, randomised trial for patients with newly diagnosed LARC.Eligible patients will be randomised to receive either: short course radiotherapy (25 Gray in 5 fractions over one week) with concomitant durvalumab (1500 mg administered intravenously every 4 weeks), followed by FOLFOX (85 mg/m(2) oxaliplatin, 350 mg folinic acid and 400 mg/m(2) bolus 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) given on day 1 followed by 2400 mg/m(2) 5-FU infusion over 46-48 h, all administered intravenously every 2 weeks), and durvalumab, or long course chemoradiotherapy (50 Gray to primary tumour in 25 fractions over 5 weeks with concomitant oral capecitabine 825 mg/m(2) twice per day on days of radiotherapy) with durvalumab followed by FOLFOX and durvalumab.The primary endpoint is complete response rate in each arm.Secondary endpoints include treatment compliance, toxicity, safety, overall recurrence, proportion of patients with a permanent stoma, and survival.The study is translationally rich with collection of bio-specimens prior to, during, and following treatment in order to understand the molecular and immunological factors underpinning treatment response.The trial opened and the first patient was recruited in January 2021.The main trial will recruit up to 42 patients with LARC and commence after completion of a safety run-in that will recruit at least six patients with LARC or metastatic disease.DISCUSSION: PRIME-RT will explore if adding immunotherapy to neoadjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy for patients with LARC can prime the tumour microenvironment to improve complete response rates and stoma free survival.Sequential biopsies are a key component within the trial design that will provide new knowledge on how the tumour microenvironment changes at different time-points in response to multi-modality treatment.This expectation is that the trial will provide information to test this treatment within a large phase clinical trial.Trial registration Clinicaltrials.gov NCT04621370 (Registered 9th Nov 2020) EudraCT number 2019-001471-36 (Registered 6th Nov 2020).",1,1,1,1

32822287,"Phase III, Randomized Study of Dual Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) Blockade With Lapatinib Plus Trastuzumab in Combination With an Aromatase Inhibitor in Postmenopausal Women With HER2-Positive, Hormone Receptor-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer: Updated Results of ALTERNATIVE.PURPOSE: Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) targeting plus endocrine therapy (ET) improved clinical benefit in HER2-positive, hormone receptor (HR)-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) versus ET alone.Dual HER2 blockade enhances clinical benefit versus single HER2 blockade.The ALTERNATIVE study evaluated the efficacy and safety of dual HER2 blockade plus aromatase inhibitor (AI) in postmenopausal women with HER2-positive/HR-positive MBC who received prior ET and prior neo(adjuvant)/first-line trastuzumab (TRAS) plus chemotherapy.This updated article reflects minor numerical corrections in some secondary efficacy analyses that resulted from programming errors and that do not change the major conclusions of the study.METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive lapatinib (LAP) plus TRAS plus AI, TRAS plus AI, or LAP plus AI.Patients for whom chemotherapy was intended were excluded.The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS; investigator assessed) with LAP plus TRAS plus AI versus TRAS plus AI.Secondary end points were PFS (comparison of other arms), overall survival (OS), overall response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), and safety.RESULTS: Three hundred fifty-five patients were included in this analysis: LAP plus TRAS plus AI (n = 120), TRAS plus AI (n = 117), and LAP plus AI (n = 118).Baseline characteristics were balanced.The study met its primary end point; superior PFS was observed with LAP plus TRAS plus AI versus TRAS plus AI (median PFS, 11 v 5.6 months; hazard ratio, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.45 to 0.88]; P = .0063).A consistent PFS benefit was observed in predefined subgroups.ORR, CBR, and OS also favored LAP plus TRAS plus AI.The median PFS with LAP plus AI versus TRAS plus AI was 8.3 versus 5.6 months (hazard ratio, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.62 to 1.17]; P = .3159).Common adverse events (AEs; >/= 15%) with LAP plus TRAS plus AI, TRAS plus AI, and LAP plus AI were diarrhea (69%, 9%, and 51%, respectively), rash (36%, 2%, and 28%, respectively), nausea (22%, 9%, and 22%, respectively), and paronychia (30%, 0%, and 15%, respectively), mostly grade 1 or 2.Serious AEs were reported similarly across the 3 groups, and AEs leading to discontinuation were lower with LAP plus TRAS plus AI.CONCLUSION: Dual HER2 blockade with LAP plus TRAS plus AI showed superior PFS benefit versus TRAS plus AI in patients with HER2-positive/HR-positive MBC.This combination offers an effective and safe chemotherapy-sparing alternative treatment regimen for this patient population.",1,1,1,1
23234763,"Adjuvant lapatinib for women with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer: a randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Worldwide, many patients with HER2-positive early stage breast cancer do not receive trastuzumab-the standard adjuvant treatment.We investigated the efficacy and safety of adjuvant lapatinib for patients with trastuzumab-naive HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer, started at any time after diagnosis.METHODS: This study was a placebo-controlled, multicentre, randomised phase 3 trial.Women outpatients from 405 [corrected] centres in 33 countries [corrected] with HER2-positive early-breast cancer who had previously received adjuvant chemotherapy but not trastuzumab were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive daily lapatinib (1500 mg) or daily placebo for 12 months.Randomisation was done with a computer-generated sequence, stratified by time since diagnosis, lymph node involvement at diagnosis, and tumour hormone-receptor status.Investigators, site staff, and patients were masked to treatment assignment.The primary endpoint was disease-free survival in the intention-to-treat population.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00374322.FINDINGS: Between August, 2006, and May, 2008, 3161 women were enrolled and 3147 were assigned to lapatinib (n=1571) or placebo (n=1576).After a median follow-up of 47.4 months (range 0.4-60.0) in the lapatinib group and 48.3 (0.7-61.3) in the placebo group, 210 (13%) disease-free survival events had occurred in the lapatinib group versus 264 (17%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.83, 95% CI 0.70-1.00; p=0.053).Central review of HER2 status showed that only 2490 (79%) of the randomised women were HER2-positive.157 (13%) of 1230 confirmed HER2-positive patients in the lapatinib group and in 208 (17%) of 1260 in the placebo group had a disease-free survival event (HR 0.82, 95% 0.67-1.00; p=0.04).Serious adverse events occurred in 99 (6%) of 1573 patients taking lapatinib and 77 (5%) of 1574 patients taking placebo, with higher incidences of grade 3-4 diarrhoea (97 [6%] vs nine [<1%]), rash (72 [5%] vs three [<1%]), and hepatobiliary disorders (36 [2%] vs one [<1%]).INTERPRETATION: Our data show that there was no significant difference in disease-free survival between groups when analysed in the intention-to-treat population.However, exploratory analyses restricted to patients who had HER2-positive disease confirmed by central fluorescence in-situ hybridisation review suggested marginal benefit with lapatinib in terms of disease-free survival.Thus lapatinib might be an option for women with HER2-positive breast cancer who do not or cannot receive adjuvant trastuzumab.FUNDING: GlaxoSmithKline.",1,1,1,1
28078860,"Effects of two different anesthetic methods on cellular immunity of patients after liver cancer resection.This study aims to investigate the effects of epidural block in combination with general anesthesia and general anesthesia alone on the immune function of patients undergoing primary liver cancer resection.Twenty-four patients with liver cancer who received treatment in the Third Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Heilongjiang, China, were enrolled and randomly allocated into group A and group B, with 12 in each group.The data on the T lymphocyte subpopulation, pro-inflammatory cytokines and antiinflammatory cytokines were recorded before, immediately after and 24 h after liver cancer resection to compare differences and changes.It was found that CD4+ of patients who underwent combined anesthesia decreased after surgery and CD8+ of those patients was lower than that of the general anesthesia group.The content of interleukin (IL)-10 of patients who underwent general anesthesia combined with epidural block showed a decreasing tendency immediately after surgery, but increased 24 h after surgery, and the increase was greater than that of the general anesthesia group; furthermore, those patients had lower levels of IL-1beta and interferon (IFN)-gamma.In addition, patients who underwent epidural block and general anesthesia had a higher ratio of IFN-gamma to IL-4 (Th1/Th2).These findings suggest that general anesthesia combined with epidural block has little passive influence on the cellular immunity of the body and can be selected as an anesthetic approach for patients with liver cancer.",1,1,0,0

26438237,"The effects of short-term fasting on tolerance to (neo) adjuvant chemotherapy in HER2-negative breast cancer patients: a randomized pilot study.BACKGROUND: Preclinical evidence shows that short-term fasting (STF) protects healthy cells against side effects of chemotherapy and makes cancer cells more vulnerable to it.This pilot study examines the feasibility of STF and its effects on tolerance of chemotherapy in a homogeneous patient group with early breast cancer (BC).METHODS: Eligible patients had HER2-negative, stage II/III BC.Women receiving (neo)-adjuvant TAC (docetaxel/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide) were randomized to fast 24 h before and after commencing chemotherapy, or to eat according to the guidelines for healthy nutrition.Toxicity in the two groups was compared.Chemotherapy-induced DNA damage in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was quantified by the level of gamma-H2AX analyzed by flow cytometry.RESULTS: Thirteen patients were included of whom seven were randomized to the STF arm.STF was well tolerated.Mean erythrocyte- and thrombocyte counts 7 days post-chemotherapy were significantly higher (P = 0.007, 95 % CI 0.106-0.638 and P = 0.00007, 95 % CI 38.7-104, respectively) in the STF group compared to the non-STF group.Non-hematological toxicity did not differ between the groups.Levels of gamma-H2AX were significantly increased 30 min post-chemotherapy in CD45 + CD3- cells in non-STF, but not in STF patients.CONCLUSIONS: STF during chemotherapy was well tolerated and reduced hematological toxicity of TAC in HER2-negative BC patients.Moreover, STF may reduce a transient increase in, and/or induce a faster recovery of DNA damage in PBMCs after chemotherapy.Larger studies, investigating a longer fasting period, are required to generate more insight into the possible benefits of STF during chemotherapy.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01304251 , March 2011.",1,1,1,1

32660748,"Concomitant Antibiotic Use and Survival in Urothelial Carcinoma Treated with Atezolizumab.Antibiotic effects on the gut microbiota may negatively impact survival with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs).However, there is minimal evidence regarding whether antibiotic impacts are specific to ICIs or impacts in urothelial carcinoma (UC).In a post hoc analysis of IMvigor210 (single-arm atezolizumab) and IMvigor211 (phase III randomised trial of atezolizumab vs chemotherapy), the association between antibiotic use and overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) was assessed via Cox proportional hazard analysis.Antibiotic use was defined as any antibiotic administration between 30 d prior to and 30 d after treatment initiation.Antibiotic use was associated with worse OS (n = 847, hazard ratio or HR [95% confidence interval {CI}] = 1.44 [1.19-1.73]) and PFS (1.24 [1.05-1.46]) with atezolizumab, but not chemotherapy (n = 415, 1.15 [0.91-1.46] and 1.09 [0.88-1.36], respectively).In the randomised cohort of IMvigor211, the OS treatment effect (HR [95% CI]) of atezolizumab versus chemotherapy was 0.95 (95% CI 0.71-1.25) for antibiotic users, compared with 0.73 (0.60-0.88) for nonusers (p[interaction] = 0.1).Similar associations were noted in the PD-L1 IC2/3 population.In conclusion, antibiotic use was associated with worse survival outcomes in UC patients treated with atezolizumab.The study does not justify a change in antibiotic selection for infections; however antibiotic overuse occurs in cancer care and this needs to be evaluated for ICIs.PATIENT SUMMARY: In this report from clinical trials IMvigor210 and IMvigor211, it was demonstrated that antibiotic use is consistently associated with worse survival in patients with urothelial carcinoma treated with atezolizumab.No antibiotic association was observed in patients treated with chemotherapy, suggesting that antibiotics may specifically reduce the effectiveness of cancer immunotherapies.Future research will continue to explore the effect of antibiotics on other immune checkpoint inhibitors and confirm whether immune checkpoint inhibitors remain the treatment of choice in cancer patients requiring antibiotics.",0,0,0,0

26946057,"BRCA1-like profile predicts benefit of tandem high dose epirubicin-cyclophospamide-thiotepa in high risk breast cancer patients randomized in the WSG-AM01 trial.BRCA1 is an important protein in the repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), which are induced by alkylating chemotherapy.A BRCA1-like DNA copy number signature derived from tumors with a BRCA1 mutation is indicative for impaired BRCA1 function and associated with good outcome after high dose (HD) and tandem HD DSB inducing chemotherapy.We investigated whether BRCA1-like status was a predictive biomarker in the WSG AM 01 trial.WSG AM 01 randomized high-risk breast cancer patients to induction (2x epirubicin-cyclophosphamide) followed by tandem HD chemotherapy with epirubicin, cyclophosphamide and thiotepa versus dose dense chemotherapy (4x epirubicin-cyclophospamide followed by 3x cyclophosphamide-methotrexate-5-fluorouracil).We generated copy number profiles for 143 tumors and classified them as being BRCA1-like or non-BRCA1-like.Twenty-six out of 143 patients were BRCA1-like.BRCA1-like status was associated with high grade and triple negative tumors.With regard to event-free-survival, the primary endpoint of the trial, patients with a BRCA1-like tumor had a hazard rate of 0.2, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.07-0.63, p = 0.006.In the interaction analysis, the combination of BRCA1-like status and HD chemotherapy had a hazard rate of 0.19, 95% CI: 0.067-0.54, p = 0.003.Similar results were observed for overall survival.These findings suggest that BRCA1-like status is a predictor for benefit of tandem HD chemotherapy with epirubicin-thiotepa-cyclophosphamide.",1,1,1,1
30975219,"Re-endothelialisation after Synergy stent and Absorb bioresorbable vascular scaffold implantation in acute myocardial infarction: COVER-AMI study.BACKGROUND/AIMS: Drug eluting stent (DES) decrease the risk of restenosis by reducing the neointimal response.However, DES may impair strut coverage, and this has been associated with late stent/scaffold thrombosis.Bioresorbable vascular scaffold (BVS) may overcome the risk of stent/scaffold thrombosis when completely resorbed.The purpose of this randomised trial was to compare the arterial healing response in the short term, as a surrogate for safety and efficacy, between the metallic everolimus-eluting stent (Synergy; Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA, USA) and the everolimus BVS (Absorb; Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, CA, USA) in the particular setting of acute myocardial infarction (AMI).This pilot study sought to compare the neointimal response of metallic everolimus DES (Synergy) with polymeric everolimus BVS (Absorb) by optical coherence tomography (OCT) 3 months after an AMI.METHODS: COVER-AMI was a single-centre, single-blind, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial.Patients with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) who underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention were randomly allocated (1:1) to treatment with the Synergy DES or Absorb BVS.The primary endpoint was the 3-month neointimal response assessed as the percentage of uncovered struts, neointimal thickness, in-stent/scaffold area obstruction, and pattern of neointima.The main secondary endpoint included the device-oriented composite endpoint according to the Academic Research Consortium definition.RESULTS: Twenty patients without clinical and/or angiographic complications (Synergy (n = 10) or BVS (n = 10); mean age 59.0 years; 20% female) were enrolled in our centre.The stent diameter was higher in the Synergy group (3.7 +/- 0.4 mm vs 3.4 +/- 0.4 mm in the BVS group, p = 0.01).At 3 months, no significant differences in angiographic lumen loss were observed between the everolimus DES and everolimus BVS (0.04 mm (IQR 0.00-0.07) vs 0.11 mm (IQR 0.04-0.31), p = 0.165).OCT analysis of 420 cross-sections showed that the total neointimal area and in-stent obstruction were lower in the Synergy group, while OCT analysis at the strut level (n = 3942 struts) showed that the rate of uncovered struts was lower in the BVS group.CONCLUSIONS: Stenting of culprit lesions in the setting of STEMI resulted in a nearly complete arterial healing for both the Synergy and the BVS devices.Lower neointimal thickness and in-stent obstruction but a higher rate of uncovered struts were observed in the Synergy group.These findings provide the basis for further exploration in clinically oriented outcome trials.",0,0,0,0
29522362,"Quality of Life During Treatment With Chemohormonal Therapy: Analysis of E3805 Chemohormonal Androgen Ablation Randomized Trial in Prostate Cancer.Purpose Chemohormonal therapy with docetaxel and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT+D) for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer improves overall survival as compared with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) alone.We compared the quality of life (QOL) between patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer who were treated with ADT+D and those who were treated with ADT alone.Methods Men were randomly assigned to ADT+ D (six cycles) or to ADT alone.QOL was assessed by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P), FACT-Taxane, Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue, and the Brief Pain Inventory at baseline and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to examine changes over time.Mixed-effect models compared the QOL between arms at each time point.Results Seven hundred ninety men were randomly assigned (ADT+D [n = 397] and ADT[ n = 393]) and completed FACT-P (90% at baseline, 86% at 3 months, 83% at 6 months, 78% at 9 months, and 77% at 12 months).ADT+D patients reported a statistically significant decline in FACT-P at 3 months ( P < .001) but FACT-P did not differ significantly between baseline and 12 months ( P = .38).ADT+D FACT-P scores were significantly lower at 3 months ( P = .02) but significantly higher at 12 months ( P = .04) when compared with ADT FACT-P scores.Differences did not exceed the minimal clinically important difference at any time point.ADT+D patients reported significantly lower Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue scores at 3 months than did ADT patients ( P < .001).Over time, both arms reported significantly poorer FACT-Taxane scores ( P < .001) when compared with baseline.Brief Pain Inventory scores were similar between arms.Conclusion Although ADT+D was associated with statistically worse QOL at 3 months, QOL was better at 12 months for ADT+D patients than for ADT patients.Both arms reported a similar minimally changed QOL over time, suggesting that ADT+D is not associated with a greater long-term negative impact on QOL.",1,1,1,1
29753305,"A prospective, randomized, within-subject study of ALA-PDT for actinic keratoses using different irradiation regimes.BACKGROUND: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) can be used to treat large fields of actinic keratoses (AKs) with high clearance rates.A notable downside is the amount of pain that accompany the treatment.This study aimed to optimize the illumination protocol during conventional PDT in order to reduce pain without compromising treatment effectiveness.METHODS: In this prospective, randomized study with a split-face design, patients with, symmetrically distributed AKs were included.All patients were treated using a ALA 78 mg/g gel.One side was illuminated with the Aktilite((R)) CL-128 lamp and the other side with the RhodoLED((R)) lamp in which the light intensity gradually increased to a maximum of 60%.Both sides received a total light dose of 37 J/cm(2) .Pain during the treatment was measured using a visual analogue scale.The clinical effectiveness of the 2 treated sides was assessed after 12 weeks.RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients with 399 AKs were included.Illumination with the gradually increasing light intensity resulted in a decrease in the median visual analogue scale score by 1.1 points.Clearance rates were similar between the 2 lamps.CONCLUSION: Minimizing the light intensity during the illumination phase of PDT reduces pain, while still preserving a high clearance rate of AKs.",0,0,0,0

27884679,"Risk-stratified staging in paediatric hepatoblastoma: a unified analysis from the Children's Hepatic tumors International Collaboration.BACKGROUND: Comparative assessment of treatment results in paediatric hepatoblastoma trials has been hampered by small patient numbers and the use of multiple disparate staging systems by the four major trial groups.To address this challenge, we formed a global coalition, the Children's Hepatic tumors International Collaboration (CHIC), with the aim of creating a common approach to staging and risk stratification in this rare cancer.METHODS: The CHIC steering committee-consisting of leadership from the four major cooperative trial groups (the International Childhood Liver Tumours Strategy Group, Children's Oncology Group, the German Society for Paediatric Oncology and Haematology, and the Japanese Study Group for Paediatric Liver Tumours)-created a shared international database that includes comprehensive data from 1605 children treated in eight multicentre hepatoblastoma trials over 25 years.Diagnostic factors found to be most prognostic on initial analysis were PRETreatment EXTent of disease (PRETEXT) group; age younger than 3 years, 3-7 years, and 8 years or older; alpha fetoprotein (AFP) concentration of 100 ng/mL or lower and 101-1000 ng/mL; and the PRETEXT annotation factors metastatic disease (M), macrovascular involvement of all hepatic veins (V) or portal bifurcation (P), contiguous extrahepatic tumour (E), multifocal tumour (F), and spontaneous rupture (R).We defined five clinically relevant backbone groups on the basis of established prognostic factors: PRETEXT I/II, PRETEXT III, PRETEXT IV, metastatic disease, and AFP concentration of 100 ng/mL or lower at diagnosis.We then carried the additional factors into a hierarchical backwards elimination multivariable analysis and used the results to create a new international staging system.RESULTS: Within each backbone group, we identified constellations of factors that were most predictive of outcome in that group.The robustness of candidate models was then interrogated using the bootstrapping procedure.Using the clinically established PRETEXT groups I, II, III, and IV as our stems, we created risk stratification trees based on 5 year event-free survival and clinical applicability.We defined and adopted four risk groups: very low, low, intermediate, and high.INTERPRETATION: We have created a unified global approach to risk stratification in children with hepatoblastoma on the basis of rigorous statistical interrogation of what is, to the best of our knowledge, the largest dataset ever assembled for this rare paediatric tumour.This achievement provides the structural framework for further collaboration and prospective international cooperative study, such as the Paediatric Hepatic International Tumour Trial (PHITT).FUNDING: European Network for Cancer Research in Children and Adolescents, funded through the Framework Program 7 of the European Commission (grant number 261474); Children's Oncology Group CureSearch grant contributed by the Hepatoblastoma Foundation; Practical Research for Innovative Cancer Control and Project Promoting Clinical Trials for Development of New Drugs and Medical Devices, Japan Agency for Medical Research; and Swiss Cancer Research grant.",0,0,0,0

29648580,"Bevacizumab plus hypofractionated radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone in elderly patients with glioblastoma: the randomized, open-label, phase II ARTE trial.Background: The addition of bevacizumab to temozolomide-based chemoradiotherapy (TMZ/RT --> TMZ) did not prolong overall survival (OS) in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma in phase III trials.Elderly and frail patients are underrepresented in clinical trials, but early reports suggested preferential benefit in this population.Patients and methods: ARTE was a 2 : 1 randomized, multi-center, open-label, non-comparative phase II trial of hypofractionated RT (40 Gy in 15 fractions) with bevacizumab (10 mg/kgx14 days) (arm A, N = 50) or without bevacizumab (arm B, N = 25) in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma aged >/=65 years.The primary objective was to obtain evidence for prolongation of median OS by the addition of bevacizumab to RT.Response was assessed by RANO criteria.Quality of life (QoL) was monitored by the EORTC QLQ-C30/BN20 modules.Exploratory studies included molecular subtyping by 450k whole methylome and gene expression analyses.Results: Median PFS was longer in arm A than in arm B (7.6 and 4.8 months, P = 0.003), but OS was similar (12.1 and 12.2 months, P = 0.77).Clinical deterioration was delayed and more patients came off steroids in arm A. Prolonged PFS in arm A was confined to tumors with the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) I methylation subtype (HR 0.25, P = 0.014) and proneural gene expression (HR 0.29, P = 0.025).In a Cox model of OS controlling for established prognostic factors, associations with more favorable outcome were identified for age <70 years (HR 0.52, P = 0.018) and Karnofsky performance score 90%-100% (HR 0.51, P = 0.026).Including molecular subtypes into that model identified an association of the RTK II gene methylation subtype with inferior OS (HR 1.73, P = 0.076).Conclusion: Efficacy outcomes and exploratory analyses of ARTE do not support the hypothesis that the addition of bevacizumab to RT generally prolongs survival in elderly glioblastoma patients.Molecular biomarkers may identify patients with preferential benefit from bevacizumab.Clinical trial registration number: NCT01443676.",1,1,1,1
33617184,"Deep learning applied to two-dimensional color Doppler flow imaging ultrasound images significantly improves diagnostic performance in the classification of breast masses: a multicenter study.BACKGROUND: The current deep learning diagnosis of breast masses is mainly reflected by the diagnosis of benign and malignant lesions.In China, breast masses are divided into four categories according to the treatment method: inflammatory masses, adenosis, benign tumors, and malignant tumors.These categorizations are important for guiding clinical treatment.In this study, we aimed to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) for classification of these four breast mass types using ultrasound (US) images.METHODS: Taking breast biopsy or pathological examinations as the reference standard, CNNs were used to establish models for the four-way classification of 3623 breast cancer patients from 13 centers.The patients were randomly divided into training and test groups (n = 1810 vs. n = 1813).Separate models were created for two-dimensional (2D) images only, 2D and color Doppler flow imaging (2D-CDFI), and 2D-CDFI and pulsed wave Doppler (2D-CDFI-PW) images.The performance of these three models was compared using sensitivity, specificity, area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), positive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV), positive (LR+) and negative likelihood ratios (LR-), and the performance of the 2D model was further compared between masses of different sizes with above statistical indicators, between images from different hospitals with AUC, and with the performance of 37 radiologists.RESULTS: The accuracies of the 2D, 2D-CDFI, and 2D-CDFI-PW models on the test set were 87.9%, 89.2%, and 88.7%, respectively.The AUCs for classification of benign tumors, malignant tumors, inflammatory masses, and adenosis were 0.90, 0.91, 0.90, and 0.89, respectively (95% confidence intervals [CIs], 0.87-0.91, 0.89-0.92, 0.87-0.91, and 0.86-0.90).The 2D-CDFI model showed better accuracy (89.2%) on the test set than the 2D (87.9%) and 2D-CDFI-PW (88.7%) models.The 2D model showed accuracy of 81.7% on breast masses </=1 cm and 82.3% on breast masses >1 cm; there was a significant difference between the two groups (P < 0.001).The accuracy of the CNN classifications for the test set (89.2%) was significantly higher than that of all the radiologists (30%).CONCLUSIONS: The CNN may have high accuracy for classification of US images of breast masses and perform significantly better than human radiologists.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chictr.org, ChiCTR1900021375; http://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.aspx?proj=33139.",0,0,0,0
24608924,"Influence of interferon-alpha combined with chemo (radio) therapy on immunological parameters in pancreatic adenocarcinoma.Prognosis of patients with carcinoma of the exocrine pancreas is particularly poor.A combination of chemotherapy with immunotherapy could be an option for treatment of pancreatic cancer.The aim of this study was to perform an immunomonitoring of 17 patients with pancreatic cancer from the CapRI-2 study, and tumor-bearing mice treated with combination of chemo (radio) therapies with interferon-2alpha.Low doses of interferon-2alpha led to a decrease in total leukocyte and an increase in monocyte counts.Furthermore, we observed a positive effect of interferon-2alpha therapy on the dendritic cells and NK (natural killer) cell activation immediately after the first injection.In addition, we recorded an increased amount of interferon-gamma and IL-10 in the serum following the interferon-2alpha therapy.These data clearly demonstrate that pancreatic carcinoma patients also show an immunomodulatory response to interferon-2alpha therapy.Analysis of immunosuppressive cells in the Panc02 orthotopic mouse model of pancreatic cancer revealed an accumulation of the myeloid-derived suppressor cells in spleens and tumors of the mice treated with interferon-2alpha and 5-fluorouracil.The direct effect of the drugs on myeloid-derived suppressor cells was also registered in vitro.These data expose the importance of immunosuppressive mechanisms induced by combined chemo-immunotherapy.",0,0,0,0
31750855,"Effect of Supplementation With Marine omega-3 Fatty Acid on Risk of Colorectal Adenomas and Serrated Polyps in the US General Population: A Prespecified Ancillary Study of a Randomized Clinical Trial.Importance: Marine omega-3 fatty acid has been suggested to protect against colorectal cancer.Objective: To assess the effect of daily marine omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on the risk of colorectal cancer precursors, including conventional adenomas and serrated polyps.Design, Setting, and Participants: This study was a prespecified ancillary study of the placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial VITAL (Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial).An intention-to-treat analysis was used to examine the effect of daily marine omega-3 supplements among 25871 adults in the US general population (including 5106 African American persons) free of cancer and cardiovascular disease at enrollment.Randomization was from November 2011 to March 2014, and intervention ended as planned on December 31, 2017.Interventions: Marine omega-3 fatty acid, 1 g daily (which included eicosapentaenoic acid, 460 mg, and docosahexaenoic acid, 380 mg) and vitamin D3 (2000 IU daily) supplements.Main Outcomes and Measures: Risk of conventional adenomas (including tubular adenoma, tubulovillous adenoma, villous adenoma, and adenoma with high-grade dysplasia) or serrated polyps (including hyperplastic polyp, traditional serrated adenoma, and sessile serrated polyp).In a subset of participants who reported receiving a diagnosis of polyp on follow-up questionnaires, endoscopic and pathologic records were obtained to confirm the diagnosis.Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were calculated using logistic regression, after adjusting for age, sex, vitamin D treatment assignment, and use of endoscopy.Secondary analyses were performed according to polyp features and participants' characteristics.Results: The demographic characteristics of participants at randomization were well balanced between the treatment and placebo groups; for example, 50.6% vs 50.5% were women, and 19.7% vs 19.8% were African American persons were included in each group.The mean (SD) age was 67.1 (7.1) years in the placebo group and 67.2 (7.1) in the omega-3 treatment group.During a median follow-up of 5.3 years (range, 3.8-6.1 years), 294 cases of conventional adenomas were documented in the omega-3 group and 301 in the control group (multivariable OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.83-1.15) (1:1 ratio between number of cases and number of participants).In addition, 174 cases of serrated polyps were documented in the omega-3 group and 167 in the control group (OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.84-1.29).Null associations were found for polyp subgroups according to size, location, multiplicity, or histology.In secondary analyses, marine omega-3 treatment appeared to be associated with lower risk of conventional adenomas among individuals with low plasma levels of omega-3 index at baseline (OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.57-1.02; P = .03 for interaction by omega-3 index).A beneficial association of supplementation was also noted in the African American population (OR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.35-1.00) but not in other racial/ethnic groups (P = .11 for interaction).Conclusions and Relevance: Supplementation with marine omega-3 fatty acids, 1 g per day, was not associated with reduced risk of colorectal cancer precursors.A potential benefit of this supplementation for individuals with low baseline omega-3 levels or for African American persons requires further confirmation.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01169259.",0,0,0,0

30866887,"Improving cancer symptom awareness and help-seeking among adults living in socioeconomically deprived communities in the UK using a facilitated health check: A protocol for the Awareness and Beliefs About Cancer (ABACus) Randomised Control Trial.BACKGROUND: Cancer survival is lower in socioeconomically deprived communities, partly due to low awareness of symptoms, negative beliefs and delayed help-seeking.We developed an interactive health check questionnaire facilitated by trained lay advisors.It entails 29 questions about background, lifestyle and health with tailored behaviour change advice.Personalised results are printed using a traffic light (red/amber/green) system, highlighting areas where action should be taken.This is an individually randomised control trial to test effectiveness of the health check on symptom recognition.METHODS: A total 246 participants aged 40+ years will be recruited from community and healthcare settings in socioeconomically deprived areas of Yorkshire and South Wales.Participants will be randomised to receive the health check or standard care (1:1 ratio).Outcome measures include: adapted Awareness and Beliefs about Cancer (primary outcome), brief State Trait Anxiety Inventory, intentions and motivation to adopt recommended health behaviours (early symptom presentation, cancer screening and lifestyle behaviours), adapted Client Service Receipt Inventory, brief medical history/screening and demographic questionnaire at: baseline; 2-weeks; and 6-months post-randomisation.A purposive sample of intervention sessions will be audio-recorded (n = 24) and half will additionally be observed (n = 12).Semi-structured interviews will take place at 2-weeks (n = 30) and 6-months (n = 15-20) post-randomisation.The primary analysis will compare cancer symptom recognition scores between arms at 2-weeks.Secondary analysis will assess cancer beliefs, barriers/time to presentation, screening and lifestyle behaviours, anxiety and costs.A process evaluation will assess intervention fidelity, dose and contamination.The London-Surrey NHS Research Ethics Committee (Ref: 17/LO/1507) approved this trial.DISCUSSION: This is a trial of a theoretically underpinned complex intervention which has undergone phase 1 and 2 development work.The findings will evaluate evidence about the effect of the health check on symptom awareness.Although there are few exclusion criteria there are limitations regarding the population we are able to reach, who may have even higher risks of late diagnosis and poor cancer prognosis.However, the health check has the potential to improve cancer symptom awareness and encourage early help-seeking behaviour in deprived populations, thereby reducing inequalities in longer term cancer outcomes.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Retrospectively registered with ISRCTN (Ref: ISRCTN16872545 ) on 12.01.2018.",0,0,0,0
30606137,"A phase II randomized controlled trial of three exercise delivery methods in men with prostate cancer on androgen deprivation therapy.BACKGROUND: Existing evidence demonstrates that 1:1 personal training (PT) improves many adverse effects of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).Whether less resource-intensive exercise delivery models are as effective remains to be established.We determined the feasibility of conducting a multi-center non-inferiority randomized controlled trial comparing PT with supervised group (GROUP) and home-based (HOME) exercise programs, and obtained preliminary efficacy estimates for GROUP and HOME compared to PT on quality of life (QOL) and physical fitness.METHODS: Men with prostate cancer on ADT were recruited from one of two experienced Canadian centres and randomized 1:1:1 to PT, GROUP, or HOME.Randomization was stratified by length of ADT use and site.Participants completed moderate intensity aerobic and resistance exercises 4-5 days per week for 6 months with a target 150 min per week of exercise.Exercise prescriptions were individualized and progressed throughout the trial.Feasibility endpoints included recruitment, retention, adherence, and participant satisfaction.The efficacy endpoints QOL, fatigue, and fitness (VO2 peak, grip strength, and timed chair stands) in GROUP and HOME were compared for non-inferiority to PT.Descriptive analyses were used for feasibility endpoints.Between-group differences for efficacy endpoints were examined using Bayesian linear mixed effects models.RESULTS: Fifty-nine participants (mean age 69.9 years) were enrolled.The recruitment rate was 25.4% and recruitment was slower than projected.Retention was 71.2%.Exercise adherence as measured through attendance was high for supervised sessions but under 50% by self-report and accelerometry.Satisfaction was high and there was no difference in this measure between all three groups.Between-group differences (comparing both GROUP and HOME to PT) were smaller than the minimum clinically important difference on most measures of QOL, fatigue, and fitness.However, two of six outcomes for GROUP and four of six outcomes for HOME had a > 20% probability of being inferior for GROUP.CONCLUSIONS: Feasibility endpoints were generally met.Both GROUP and HOME interventions in men with PC on ADT appeared to be similar to PT for multiple efficacy outcomes, although conclusions are limited by a small sample size and cost considerations have not been incorporated.Efforts need to be targeted to improving recruitment and adherence.A larger trial is warranted.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02046837 .Date of registration: January 20, 2014.",0,0,0,0

31512101,"A Prospective Randomized Trial Comparing Jejunostomy and Nasogastric Feeding in Minimally Invasive McKeown Esophagectomy.BACKGROUND: Early postoperative enteral nutrition is recommended for patients undergoing esophagectomy; however, the optimum method of tube feeding remains controversial.Thus, the aim of this study is to assess two common enteral nutrition methods after minimally invasive McKeown esophagectomy.METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was performed with 120 patients who underwent minimally invasive McKeown esophagectomy from January 2017 to December 2018.The patients were randomly divided so that 58 patients were in the jejunostomy feeding (JF) group and 62 patients were in the nasogastric feeding (NF) group.The postoperative outcomes, including complications, nutritional status, quality of life, and survival rate, were studied and used as the main parameters to compare the abovementioned tube feeding methods.RESULTS: The incidence of overall complications was equivalent between the two groups (P = 0.625), except for bowel obstruction (which occurred 4 times in the JF group but did not occur in the NF group).In the first month after surgery (postoperative month 1, POM1), a significantly higher body mass index (BMI) was observed in the JF group (23.6 +/- 3.2) than in the NF group (20.9 +/- 3.5, P = 0.032).The global quality-of-life scores were better in the JF group than in the NF group (P < 0.001).In addition, there were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of disease-free survival (DFS) (P = 0.816) and overall survival (OS) (P = 0.564).CONCLUSIONS: Compared with NF, JF provides more safety, efficacy, and utility as nutritional support for minimally invasive McKeown esophagectomy patients who have a high incidence of anastomotic leakage.However, the higher risk of intestinal obstruction after JF requires attention.",0,0,0,0
26291768,"Docetaxel Alone or in Combination With a Therapeutic Cancer Vaccine (PANVAC) in Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer: A Randomized Clinical Trial.IMPORTANCE: Previous phase 1 and 2 trials of PANVAC, a poxviral-based cancer vaccine, have suggested clinical efficacy in some patients with breast, ovarian, and colorectal cancer and have shown evidence of immunologic activity.Preclinical data have shown that docetaxel can modify tumor phenotype, making tumor cells more amenable to T cell-mediated killing.OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to determine if the treatment combination of docetaxel and PANVAC improves clinical outcomes in patients with metastatic breast cancer compared with docetaxel treatment alone.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Between May 2006 and February 2012, this open-label, phase 2 randomized clinical trial enrolled 48 patients with metastatic breast cancer of all subtypes, without limitation on other lines of previous therapy, to receive treatment with either docetaxel with PANVAC (arm A) or docetaxel alone (arm B).Final clinical data were collected on September 16, 2013.All patients were treated at either the National Cancer Institute or the Department of Breast Medical Oncology, MD Anderson Cancer Center.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS), using a phase 2.5 statistical design, with the intent of identifying a trend toward benefit (defined as 1-sided P</=.10) to guide a larger trial design.Secondary end points included safety and immunologic correlative studies.RESULTS: Forty-eight participants were enrolled: 25 were randomized to the combination treatment arm A, and 23 to arm B. No patient remained in the study at the time of the final analysis.Patient and tumor characteristics were well matched.Analysis of adverse events in both treatment arms demonstrated very little difference between the 2 groups.In the combination treatment arm (arm A), statistically significant increases were noted in the frequency of grades 1 and 2 edema (P=.02, likely related to greater median number of docetaxel cycles) and injection-site reactions (P<.001).In the final data analysis, median PFS was 7.9 months in arm A vs 3.9 months in arm B (hazard ratio, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.34-1.14]; P=.09).CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results suggest that the combination of PANVAC with docetaxel in metastatic breast cancer may provide a clinical benefit.This study was hypothesis generating and provides both rationale and statistical assumptions for a larger definitive randomized study.TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00179309.",1,1,1,0
30677780,"[A group intervention to promote work ability in patients with head and neck cancer].INTRODUCTION: Despite high distress the majority of head and neck cancer patients does not use any psycho-oncological counselling or psychotherapeutic support.Additionally, patients with head and neck cancer have an increased risk of not returning to work compared to other cancer patients.Therefore, we have developed a group intervention program which aims at improving work ability in patients with head and neck cancer as well as their quality of life, self-efficacy and psychological well-being.MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a randomized controlled trial head and neck cancer patients either receive a group intervention or socio-legal counselling.Male head and neck cancer patients with elevated levels of psychological and work-related distress are included.The group intervention consists of eight sessions.Groups are led by both a psychotherapist and a former head and neck cancer patient (peer).Feasibility and acceptability of the group intervention were tested by means of a pilot group.Each session was evaluated by pilot group participants.Semi-structured interviews were used to assess relevance of content and practicability.RESULTS: 113 patients were personally addressed, of which four patients participated in the pilot group.Patients reported that the intervention fit very well with their daily life and expressed satisfaction with it.Three patients emphasized the importance of the peer.DISCUSSION: The presence of the peer as identification figure seems to be of crucial importance.To increase recruitment numbers inclusion criteria will be modified and participation costs will be reduced.",0,0,0,0
27343254,"Does patient time spent viewing computer-tailored colorectal cancer screening materials predict patient-reported discussion of screening with providers?The main aim is to examine whether patients' viewing time on information about colorectal cancer (CRC) screening before a primary care physician (PCP) visit is associated with discussion of screening options during the visit.We analyzed data from a multi-center randomized controlled trial of a tailored interactive multimedia computer program (IMCP) to activate patients to undergo CRC screening, deployed in primary care offices immediately before a visit.We employed usage time information stored in the IMCP to examine the association of patient time spent using the program with patient-reported discussion of screening during the visit, adjusting for previous CRC screening recommendation and reading speed.On average, patients spent 33 minutes on the program.In adjusted analyses, 30 minutes spent using the program was associated with a 41% increase in the odds of the patient having a discussion with their PCP (1.04, 1.59, 95% CI).In a separate analysis of the tailoring modules; the modules encouraging adherence to the tailored screening recommendation and discussion with the patient's PCP yielded significant results.Other predictors of screening discussion included better self-reported physical health and increased patient activation.Time spent on the program predicted greater patient-physician discussion of screening during a linked visit.Usage time information gathered automatically by IMCPs offers promise for objectively assessing patient engagement around a topic and predicting likelihood of discussion between patients and their clinician.",0,0,0,0

25091846,"Perioperative patient-reported outcomes predict serious postoperative complications: a secondary analysis of the COST trial.BACKGROUND: Decreased survival after colon cancer surgery has been reported in patients with deficient preoperative quality of life.We hypothesized that deficits in preoperative quality of life are associated with postoperative complications.PATIENT AND METHODS: A secondary analysis of the Clinical Outcomes Surgical Therapy trial NCCTG 93-46-53 (INT 0146, Alliance) was performed.Quality of life deficit was defined as overall quality of life score <50 on a 100-point scale and used for univariate and multivariate analysis.RESULTS: Of 431 patients enrolled in the quality of life portion of the trial, 81 patients (19%) experienced complications including two deaths (0.5%).Fifty-five patients (13%) had a preoperative quality of life score <50.Patients with a preoperative deficit were more likely to have a serious early complication (16 vs 6%, p = 0.023).Using stepwise logistic model, the variables significantly associated with having any early complications (yes/no) were age, ASA III and change in ""activity"" from baseline to day 14.Patients with an early complication experienced a 3.5-day longer hospital stay (p = 0.0001).Gender, race, tumor stage, and laparoscopic or open approach were not associated with an increased frequency of complications.After adjusting for demographics, tumor stage, ASA, and operative approach, significant predictors for readmission were preoperative pain (odds ratio (OR) 1.61, confidence interval (CI) 1.11-2.34, p = 0.0125), and changes from baseline to day 2 in fatigue (OR 1.34, CI 1.03-1.74, p = 0.032).CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that quality of life can provide an early indicator for patients at risk of complications.Further studies should evaluate how perioperative quality of life assessment may assist to improve outcomes.",0,0,0,0
22610153,"Extended benefit from sequential administration of docetaxel after standard fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide regimen for node-positive breast cancer: the 8-year follow-up results of the UNICANCER-PACS01 trial.PURPOSE: The initial report from the Programme Action Concertee Sein (PACS) PACS01 trial demonstrated a benefit at 5 years for disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) rates with the sequential administration of docetaxel after FEC100 (fluorouracil 500 mg/m(2), epirubicin 100 mg/m(2), and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m(2)) for patients with node-positive, operable breast cancer.We evaluate here the impact of this regimen at 8 years.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between June 1997 and March 2000, a total of 1,999 patients (age <65) with localized, resectable, non-pretreated, unilateral breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive either standard FEC100 for 6 cycles or 3 cycles of FEC100 followed by 3 cycles of 100 mg/m(2) docetaxel (FEC-D), both given every 21 days.Radiotherapy was mandatory after conservative surgery and tamoxifen was given for 5 years to hormone receptor (HR)-positive patients.Five-year DFS was the trial's main endpoint.Updated 8-year survival data are presented.RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 92.8 months, 639 patients experienced at least one event.A total number of 383 deaths were registered.Eight-year DFS rates were 65.8% with FEC alone and 70.2% with FEC-D. OS rates at 8 years were 78% with FEC alone and 83.2% with FEC-D. Cox regression analysis adjusted for age and number of positive nodes showed a 15% reduction in the relative risk of relapse and a 25% reduction in the relative risk of death in favor of FEC-D. Significant relative risk reductions were observed in the HR-positive, HER2-positive, and Ki67 >/=20% subpopulations.CONCLUSION: Benefits for DFS and OS rates with the sequential FEC-D regimen are fully confirmed at 8 years.",1,1,1,1
32915972,"Ibrutinib added to 10-day decitabine for older patients with AML and higher risk MDS.The treatment of older, unfit patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is challenging.Based on preclinical data of Bruton tyrosine kinase expression/phosphorylation and ibrutinib cytotoxicity in AML blasts, we conducted a randomized phase 2 multicenter study to assess the tolerability and efficacy of the addition of ibrutinib to 10-day decitabine in unfit (ie, Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Comorbidity Index >/=3) AML patients and higher risk myelodysplasia patients (HOVON135/SAKK30/15 trial).In total, 144 eligible patients were randomly (1:1) assigned to either 10-day decitabine combined with ibrutinib (560 mg; sequentially given, starting the day after the last dose of decitabine) (n = 72) or to 10-day decitabine (n = 72).The addition of ibrutinib was well tolerated, and the number of adverse events was comparable for both arms.In the decitabine plus ibrutinib arm, 41% reached complete remission/complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery (CR/CRi), the median overall survival (OS) was 11 months, and 2-year OS was 27%; these findings compared with 50% CR/CRi, median OS of 11.5 months, and 2-year OS of 21% for the decitabine group (not significant).Extensive molecular profiling at diagnosis revealed that patients with STAG2, IDH2, and ASXL1 mutations had significantly lower CR/CRi rates, whereas patients with mutations in TP53 had significantly higher CR/CRi rates.Furthermore, multicolor flow cytometry revealed that after 3 cycles of treatment, 28 (49%) of 57 patients with available bone marrow samples had no measurable residual disease.In this limited number of cases, measurable residual disease revealed no apparent impact on event-free survival and OS.In conclusion, the addition of ibrutinib does not improve the therapeutic efficacy of decitabine.This trial was registered at the Netherlands Trial Register (NL5751 [NTR6017]) and has EudraCT number 2015-002855-85.",1,1,1,1

34323924,"Metformin in Combination With Chemoradiotherapy in Locally Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: The OCOG-ALMERA Randomized Clinical Trial.Importance: Unresected locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC) shows poor survival outcomes even after aggressive concurrent chemoradiotherapy.Whether metformin, a diabetes agent that inhibits the mitochondria oxidative phosphorylation chain, could improve radiotherapy and chemotherapy response in LA-NSCLC remains to be studied.Objective: To examine whether metformin, given concurrently with chemoradiotherapy and as consolidation treatment, could improve outcomes in patients with LA-NSCLC.Design, Setting, and Participants: The Ontario Clinical Oncology Group Advanced Lung Cancer Treatment With Metformin and Chemoradiotherapy (OCOG-ALMERA) study was a multicenter phase 2 randomized clinical trial.Patients were stratified for stage IIIA vs IIIB LA-NSCLC and use of consolidation chemotherapy.The trial was designed to enroll 96 patients with unresected LA-NSCLC who did not have diabetes.The trial was conducted from September 24, 2014, to March 8, 2019.Interventions: Patients were randomized to platinum-based chemotherapy, concurrent with chest radiotherapy (60-63 Gy), with or without consolidation chemotherapy or the same treatment plus metformin, 2000 mg/d, during chemoradiotherapy and afterward for up to 12 months.Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who experienced a failure event (ie, locoregional disease progression, distant metastases, death, and discontinuation of trial treatment or planned evaluations for any reason within 12 months).Proportions were compared using a 2-sided Fisher exact test.Conventional progression-free and overall survival were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.Adverse events were graded with Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.03.All randomized patients were included in an intention-to-treat analysis.Results: The trial was stopped early due to slow accrual.Between 2014 and 2019, 54 patients were randomized (26 in experimental arm and 28 in control arm).Participants included 30 women (55.6%); mean (SD) age was 65.6 (7.6) years.Treatment failure was detected in 18 patients (69.2%) receiving metformin within 1 year vs 12 (42.9%) control patients (P = .05).The 1-year progression-free survival rate was 34.8% (95% CI, 16.6%-53.7%) in the metformin arm and 63.0% (95% CI, 42.1%-78.1%) in the control arm (hazard ratio, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.14-5.10) The overall survival rates were 47.4% (95% CI, 26.3%-65.9%) in the metformin arm and 85.2% (95% CI, 65.2%-94.2%) in the control arm (hazard ratio, 3.80; 95% CI, 1.49-9.73).More patients in the experimental arm vs control arm (53.8% vs 25.0%) reported at least 1 grade 3 or higher adverse event.Conclusions and Relevance: In this randomized clinical trial, the addition of metformin to chemoradiotherapy was associated with worse treatment efficacy and increased toxic effects compared with combined modality therapy alone.Metformin is not recommended in patients with LA-NSCLC who are candidates for chemoradiotherapy.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02115464.",0,0,0,0
33460574,"Palbociclib with adjuvant endocrine therapy in early breast cancer (PALLAS): interim analysis of a multicentre, open-label, randomised, phase 3 study.BACKGROUND: Palbociclib added to endocrine therapy improves progression-free survival in hormone-receptor-positive, HER2-negative, metastatic breast cancer.The PALLAS trial aimed to investigate whether the addition of 2 years of palbociclib to adjuvant endocrine therapy improves invasive disease-free survival over endocrine therapy alone in patients with hormone-receptor-positive, HER2-negative, early-stage breast cancer.METHODS: PALLAS is an ongoing multicentre, open-label, randomised, phase 3 study that enrolled patients at 406 cancer centres in 21 countries worldwide with stage II-III histologically confirmed hormone-receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer, within 12 months of initial diagnosis.Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score of 0 or 1.Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) in permuted blocks of random size (4 or 6), stratified by anatomic stage, previous chemotherapy, age, and geographical region, by use of central telephone-based and web-based interactive response technology, to receive either 2 years of palbociclib (125 mg orally once daily on days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle) with ongoing standard provider or patient-choice adjuvant endocrine therapy (tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitor, with or without concurrent luteinising hormone-releasing hormone agonist), or endocrine therapy alone, without masking.The primary endpoint of the study was invasive disease-free survival in the intention-to-treat population.Safety was assessed in all randomly assigned patients who started palbociclib or endocrine therapy.This report presents results from the second pre-planned interim analysis triggered on Jan 9, 2020, when 67% of the total number of expected invasive disease-free survival events had been observed.The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02513394) and EudraCT (2014-005181-30).FINDINGS: Between Sept 1, 2015, and Nov 30, 2018, 5760 patients were randomly assigned to receive palbociclib plus endocrine therapy (n=2883) or endocrine therapy alone (n=2877).At the time of the planned second interim analysis, at a median follow-up of 23.7 months (IQR 16.9-29.2), 170 of 2883 patients assigned to palbociclib plus endocrine therapy and 181 of 2877 assigned to endocrine therapy alone had invasive disease-free survival events.3-year invasive disease-free survival was 88.2% (95% CI 85.2-90.6) for palbociclib plus endocrine therapy and 88.5% (85.8-90.7) for endocrine therapy alone (hazard ratio 0.93 [95% CI 0.76-1.15]; log-rank p=0.51).As the test statistic comparing invasive disease-free survival between groups crossed the prespecified futility boundary, the independent data monitoring committee recommended discontinuation of palbociclib in patients still receiving palbociclib and endocrine therapy.The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were neutropenia (1742 [61.3%] of 2840 patients on palbociclib and endocrine therapy vs 11 [0.3%] of 2903 on endocrine therapy alone), leucopenia (857 [30.2%] vs three [0.1%]), and fatigue (60 [2.1%] vs ten [0.3%]).Serious adverse events occurred in 351 (12.4%) of 2840 patients on palbociclib plus endocrine therapy versus 220 (7.6%) of 2903 patients on endocrine therapy alone.There were no treatment-related deaths.INTERPRETATION: At the planned second interim analysis, addition of 2 years of adjuvant palbociclib to adjuvant endocrine therapy did not improve invasive disease-free survival compared with adjuvant endocrine therapy alone.On the basis of these findings, this regimen cannot be recommended in the adjuvant setting.Long-term follow-up of the PALLAS population and correlative studies are ongoing.FUNDING: Pfizer.",1,1,1,1
25057173,"EGFR biomarkers predict benefit from vandetanib in combination with docetaxel in a randomized phase III study of second-line treatment of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.BACKGROUND: ZODIAC was a randomized phase III study of second-line treatment in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that evaluated the addition of vandetanib to docetaxel.The study showed a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival and objective response rate, but not in overall survival for unselected patients.This study evaluated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutation, copy number gain, and protein expression, and KRAS gene mutation, in pretreatment tumor samples as potential biomarkers predicting benefit from vandetanib as second-line treatment of NSCLC.PATIENTS AND METHODS: After progression following first-line chemotherapy, 1391 patients with locally advanced or metastatic (stage IIIB/IV) NSCLC were randomized 1 : 1 to receive vandetanib (100 mg/day) plus docetaxel (75 mg/m(2) every 21 days) or placebo plus docetaxel in the ZODIAC study.Archival tumor samples (n = 570) were collected from consenting patients (n = 958) for predefined, prospective biomarker analyses.RESULTS: Of evaluable samples, 14% were EGFR mutation positive, 35% were EGFR FISH positive, 88% were EGFR protein expression positive, and 13% were KRAS mutation positive.Compared with the overall study population, in which progression-free survival (PFS) [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.79] but not OS (HR = 0.91) were significantly improved with vandetanib, there was greater relative clinical benefit for patients with EGFR mutation-positive tumors [PFS HR 0.51, confidence interval (CI) 0.25-1.06 and OS HR 0.46, CI 0.14-1.57] and EGFR FISH-positive tumors (PFS HR 0.61, CI 0.39-0.94 and OS HR 0.48, CI 0.28-0.84).Similarly, patients with EGFR mutation or FISH-positive tumor samples who received vandetanib had an increased chance of objective tumor response (odds ratios 3.34, CI 0.8-13.89, and 3.90, CI 1.02-14.82, respectively).There did not appear to be benefit for vandetanib in patients with KRAS mutation-positive tumors.CONCLUSIONS: High EGFR gene copy number or activating EGFR mutations may identify patient subgroups who receive increased clinical benefit from vandetanib in combination with docetaxel in second-line NSCLC.CLINICALTRIALSGOV: NCT00312377.",1,1,1,1

33464318,"Cost-effectiveness of Pembrolizumab as a Second-Line Therapy for Hepatocellular Carcinoma.Importance: Immune checkpoint inhibitors have been approved for use as a second-line therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients who previously received sorafenib.Pembrolizumab has shown substantial antitumor activity and a favorable toxicity profile as a second-line treatment of HCC.However, considering the high cost of pembrolizumab, there is a need to assess its value by considering both the clinical efficacy and cost.Objective: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab vs placebo as second-line therapy in patients with HCC from the US payer perspective.Design, Setting, and Participants: A Markov model was developed to compare the lifetime cost and efficacy of pembrolizumab as a second-line treatment of HCC with those of placebo using outcome data from the KEYNOTE-240 randomized placebo-controlled trial, which included 413 patients with advanced HCC previously treated with sorafenib and randomized patients to receive pembrolizumab plus best supportive care or placebo plus best supportive care in a 2:1 ratio.Main Outcomes and Measures: Life-years, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), lifetime costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were estimated at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150000 per QALY.One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to account for the parameter of uncertainty.A cost-threshold analysis was also performed.The study was conducted from January 31 to July 29, 2020.Results: The base-case model found that treatment with pembrolizumab was associated with increased overall cost by $47057 and improved effectiveness by 0.138 QALYs compared with placebo, leading to an ICER of $340409 per QALY.The model was most sensitive to the hazard ratio of overall survival (range, 0.61-1.00), health utility of placebo (range, 0.59-0.93), price of pembrolizumab (range, $5531-$8297), and price of postprogression therapies (range, $5596-$7944 for pembrolizumab and $4770-$7156 for placebo).The ICER of pembrolizumab was larger than $150000 per QALY in most of the sensitivity and subgroup analyses.The price of pembrolizumab needed to be reduced by 57.7% to $2925 per cycle to achieve cost-effectiveness.Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this cost-effectiveness analysis suggest that, at its current price, pembrolizumab is not a cost-effective second-line therapy for HCC in the US, with a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150000 per QALY.",0,0,0,0
30357310,"Dose tailoring of adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer based on hematologic toxicities: further results from the prospective PANTHER study with focus on obese patients.Background: Adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) for breast cancer improves relapse-free survival (BCRFS) and overall survival.Differences in terms of efficacy and toxicity could partly be explained by the significant interpatient variability in pharmacokinetics which cannot be captured by dosing according to body surface area.Consequently, tailored dosing was prospectively evaluated in the PANTHER trial.Patients and methods: PANTHER is a multicenter, open-label, randomized phase III trial which compared tailored, dose-dense (DD) epirubicin/cyclophosphamide (E/C) and tailored docetaxel (D) (tDD) with standard interval 5-fluorouracil/E/C and D. The primary end point was BCRFS and the primary efficacy analysis has been previously published.In this secondary analysis, we aimed to retrospectively explore the concept of dose tailoring.Our two hypotheses were that BCRFS would not vary depending on the cumulative administered epirubicin dose; and that dose tailoring would lead to appropriate dosing and improved outcomes for obese patients, who are known to have worse prognosis and increased toxicity after DD ACT.Results: Patients treated with tDD had similar BCRFS regardless of the cumulative epirubicin dose (P = 0.495), while obese patients in this group [body mass index (BMI) >/=30] had improved BCRFS compared with nonobese ones (BMI <30) [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.30-0.89, P = 0.02].Moreover, tDD was associated with improved BCRFS compared with standard treatment only in obese patients (HR = 0.49, 95% CI 0.26-0.90, P = 0.022) but not in nonobese ones (HR = 0.79, 95% CI 0.60-1.04, P = 0.089).The differences were not formally statistically significant (P for interaction 0.175).There were no differences in terms of toxicity across the epirubicin dose levels or the BMI groups.Conclusions: Dose tailoring is a feasible strategy that can potentially improve outcomes in obese patients without increasing toxicity and should be pursued in further clinical studies.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00798070.",0,0,0,0
23127215,"Associations of soluble fiber, whole fruits/vegetables, and juice with plasma Beta-carotene concentrations in a free-living population of breast cancer survivors.OBJECTIVE: Soluble fiber and the physical state of fruits/vegetables affect plasma ss-carotene concentrations; however, most of this research was conducted in laboratory-based settings.These analyses investigated the relationship between soluble fiber and juiced versus whole fruits/vegetables to plasma ss-carotene concentrations in a free-living population.METHOD: This cross-sectional analysis used 12-month follow-up data from the Women's Healthy Eating & Living Study (1995-2006), a study to improve diet in breast cancer survivors in the Western United States.The dietary nutrients considered in this analysis included intake of soluble fiber (g), ss-carotene from fruit/vegetable juice (mg), and ss-carotene from whole fruits/vegetables (mg).A linear regression model was used to assess the relationship of the variables to plasma ss-carotene concentrations.RESULTS: Out of 3,088 women enrolled in the Women's Healthy Eating & Living Study, 2,397 women had complete data (mean age = 54).The final model accounted for approximately 49% of the explained variance in plasma ss-carotene concentrations.Fruit/vegetable juice had the largest positive relation to plasma ss-carotene concentrations (standardized parameter estimate = 0.23, p < 0.01), followed by whole fruits/vegetables (standardized parameter estimate = 0.09, p < 0.01).CONCLUSION: Soluble fiber may inhibit ss-carotene absorption; therefore, consumption of juice may increase plasma ss-carotene concentrations more than whole fruits/vegetables in free-living populations.",0,0,0,0

21553314,"Compression garments versus compression bandaging in decongestive lymphatic therapy for breast cancer-related lymphedema: a randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Lymphedema as a result of curative surgery for breast cancer can lead to long-term morbidity.Decongestive lymphatic therapy (DLT) is recognized as an optimal management strategy for patients with moderate symptomatologies, but there is little data in regard to the most effective means of providing compression therapy within a DLT protocol.We conducted a randomized trial of two forms of compression therapy within the initial treatment phase of a DLT protocol for breast cancer-related lymphedema.METHODS: Subjects were required to have mild-moderate lymphedema (10-40% volume difference) acquired as a result of curative breast cancer surgery and were randomized to compression bandaging or garments within the initial treatment phase of a DLT protocol.Primary endpoint was change in affected limb volume assessed via volumetry, and secondary endpoints were symptom control and upper extremity function assessed via visual analogue scales and the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire, respectively.Endpoints were assessed at day 10 of treatment and at 3 months and compared to baseline.RESULTS: Twenty-one subjects were available for analysis.The group receiving bandaging experienced greater median volume reductions at 10 days (70 vs. 5 mL; p = 0.387) and at 3 months (97.5 vs. 50 mL; p = 0.182).The bandaging group also experienced a greater increase in median DASH scores at 10 days (+20.9 vs. +5; p = 0.143) and at 3 months (+18.4 vs. +3.3; p = 0.065).CONCLUSION: Within the initial treatment phase of a DLT protocol for acquired, breast cancer-related lymphedema, compression bandaging may lead to greater volume reduction but worse upper extremity functional status (higher DASH scores) as compared to compression garments.",0,0,0,0
22565002,"Randomized phase II trial of everolimus in combination with tamoxifen in patients with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative metastatic breast cancer with prior exposure to aromatase inhibitors: a GINECO study.PURPOSE: Cross-talk between signal transduction pathways likely contributes to hormone resistance in metastatic breast cancer (mBC).Everolimus, an oral inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin, has restored sensitivity in endocrine-resistance models and shown anticancer activity in early-phase mBC clinical trials.This analysis evaluated efficacy and safety of everolimus in combination with tamoxifen in patients with mBC resistant to aromatase inhibitors (AIs).PATIENTS AND METHODS: This open-label, phase II study randomly assigned postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative, AI-resistant mBC to tamoxifen 20 mg/d plus everolimus 10 mg/d (n = 54) or tamoxifen 20 mg/d alone (n = 57).Randomization was stratified by primary and secondary hormone resistance.Primary end point was clinical benefit rate (CBR), defined as the percentage of all patients with a complete or partial response or stable disease at 6 months.No formal statistical comparison between groups was planned.RESULTS: The 6-month CBR was 61% (95% CI, 47 to 74) with tamoxifen plus everolimus and 42% (95% CI, 29 to 56) with tamoxifen alone.Time to progression (TTP) increased from 4.5 months with tamoxifen alone to 8.6 months with tamoxifen plus everolimus, corresponding to a 46% reduction in risk of progression with the combination (hazard ratio [HR], 0.54; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.81).Risk of death was reduced by 55% with tamoxifen plus everolimus versus tamoxifen alone (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.24 to 0.81).The main toxicities associated with tamoxifen plus everolimus were fatigue (72% v 53% with tamoxifen alone), stomatitis (56% v 7%), rash (44% v 7%), anorexia (43% v 18%), and diarrhea (39% v 11%).CONCLUSION: This study suggests that tamoxifen plus everolimus increased CBR, TTP, and overall survival compared with tamoxifen alone in postmenopausal women with AI-resistant mBC.",1,1,1,1

33775558,"Patient-Reported Outcomes with Durvalumab With or Without Tremelimumab Versus Standard Chemotherapy as First-Line Treatment of Metastatic Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (MYSTIC).BACKGROUND: The phase 3 MYSTIC study of durvalumab +/- tremelimumab versus chemotherapy in metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with tumor cell (TC) programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression >/= 25% did not meet its primary endpoints.We report patient-reported outcomes (PROs).PATIENTS AND METHODS: Treatment-naive patients were randomized (1:1:1) to durvalumab, durvalumab+tremelimumab, or chemotherapy.PROs were assessed in patients with PD-L1 TC >/= 25% using EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ)-C30/LC13.Changes from baseline (12 months) for prespecified PRO endpoints of interest were analyzed by mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) and time to deterioration (TTD) by stratified log-rank tests.RESULTS: There were no between-arm differences in baseline PROs (N=488).Between-arm differences in MMRM-adjusted mean changes from baseline favored at least one of the durvalumab-containing arms versus chemotherapy (nominal P < .01) for C30 fatigue: durvalumab (-9.5; 99% confidence interval [CI], -17.0 to -2.0), durvalumab+tremelimumab (-11.7; 99% CI, -19.4 to -4.1); and for C30 appetite loss: durvalumab (-11.9; 99% CI, -21.1 to -2.7).TTD was longer with at least one of the durvalumab-containing arms versus chemotherapy (nominal P < .01) for global health status/quality of life: durvalumab (hazard ratio [HR]=0.7; 95% CI, 0.5-1.0), durvalumab+tremelimumab (HR=0.7; 95% CI, 0.5-1.0); and for physical functioning: durvalumab (HR=0.6; 95% CI, 0.4-0.8), durvalumab+tremelimumab (HR=0.6; 95% CI, 0.5-0.9) (both C30); as well as for the key symptoms of dyspnea: durvalumab (HR=0.6; 95% CI, 0.5-0.9), durvalumab+tremelimumab (HR=0.7; 95% CI, 0.5-1.0) (both LC13); fatigue: durvalumab+tremelimumab (HR=0.6; 95% CI, 0.4-0.8); and appetite loss: durvalumab (HR=0.5; 95% CI, 0.4-0.7), durvalumab+tremelimumab (HR=0.7; 95% CI, 0.5-0.9) (both C30).CONCLUSION: Durvalumab +/- tremelimumab versus chemotherapy reduced symptom burden and improved TTD of PROs, suggesting it had no detrimental effects on quality of life in metastatic NSCLC patients.",1,1,1,1
32979042,"Quality of life outcomes from a randomized controlled trial of patient navigation in Latina breast cancer survivors.INTRODUCTION: Breast cancer survivorship is a life-long process involving challenges to health-care communities and individuals, especially Latinas.Patient Navigation has shown some success in meeting these challenges.The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of an enhanced Patient Navigation program (Intervention; PN+) vs Control (PN) over time on general cancer and breast cancer-specific quality of life (QoL) in Latina breast cancer survivors (BCS).METHODS: We conducted a 2-year, two-arm randomized controlled trial of the ""Staying Healthy"" program among Latina BCS.The design compared PN+ vs PN over time.We recruited 60 patients into each study arm and randomized them by sequential numerical assignment.PN+ participants received culturally tailored educational materials and active, personalized Patient Navigation services, including phone calls, transportation, and care coordination.PN participants were navigated only upon request.Primary outcomes included general cancer (Functional Assessments of Cancer Therapy [FACTS]-G) and breast cancer-specific (FACT-B) QoL. RESULTS: PN+ participants had significantly improved QoL measures compared to PN at 6-month follow-up on all subscales (P-values .007-.04) except physical well-being (PWB; P = .11).Intervention effect size coefficient (standard error) for FACT-G overall was 7.9 (3.1); P = .01.For FACT-B, it was 10.9 (3.9); P = .006.Again, all subscales showed significant effects [range 1.7-3.1 (0.8-1.2); P-values .006-.04], except for PWB [1.5 (1.0); P = .16] and social/family well-being (SWB) [2.1 (1.1); P = .06].There were no differences between groups at baseline.DISCUSSION: Multiple cultural, psychosocial, and socioeconomic variables contributing to these intervention effects will be addressed in future studies.As the national BCS population continues to increase, more Patient Navigation-focused partnerships among patients, health-care professionals, research groups, and community organizations are needed to improve BCS experiences.The Staying Healthy program has the potential to serve as a national survivorship care model for improving Latina BCS QoL.",0,0,0,0

29370781,"The PANDA study: a randomized phase II study of first-line FOLFOX plus panitumumab versus 5FU plus panitumumab in RAS and BRAF wild-type elderly metastatic colorectal cancer patients.BACKGROUND: Few data are available regarding the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer elderly patients with anti-EGFR agents in combination with chemotherapy.FOLFOX plus panitumumab is a standard first-line option for RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer.Slight adjustments in chemo-dosage are commonly applied in clinical practice to elderly patients, but those modified schedules have never been prospectively tested.Clinical definition of elderly (>/=70 years old) patients that may deserve a more or less intensive combination therapy is still debated.Several geriatric screening tools have been developed to predict survival and risk of toxicity from treatment.Among those, the G8 screening tool has been tested in cancer patients showing the strongest prognostic value for overall survival, while the CRASH score can stratify patients according to an estimated risk of treatment-related toxicities.METHODS: The PANDA study is a prospective, open-label, multicenter, randomized phase II trial of first-line therapy with panitumumab in combination with dose-adjusted FOLFOX or with 5-fluorouracil monotherapy, in previously untreated elderly patients (>/=70 years) with RAS and BRAF wild-type unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer.RAS and BRAF analyses are centralized.Geriatric assessment by means of G8 and CRASH score is planned at baseline and G8 will be re-evaluated at disease progression.The primary endpoint is duration of progression-free survival in both arms.Secondary endpoints include prospective evaluation of the prognostic role of G8 score and the correlation of CRASH risk categories with toxicity.DISCUSSION: The PANDA study aims at exploring safety and efficacy of panitumumab in combination with FOLFOX or with 5FU/LV in elderly patients affected by RAS and BRAF wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer, to identify the most promising treatment strategy in this setting.Additionally, this is the first trial in which the prognostic role of the G8 score will be prospectively evaluated.Results of this study will drive further experimental developments for one or both combinations.TRIAL REGISTRATION: PANDA is registered at Clinicaltrials.gov : NCT02904031 , July 11, 2016.PANDA is registered at EudraCT-No.: 2015-003888-10, September 3, 2015.",1,1,1,1
27332902,"Adapted Treatment Guided by Interim PET-CT Scan in Advanced Hodgkin's Lymphoma.BACKGROUND: We tested interim positron-emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) as a measure of early response to chemotherapy in order to guide treatment for patients with advanced Hodgkin's lymphoma.METHODS: Patients with newly diagnosed advanced classic Hodgkin's lymphoma underwent a baseline PET-CT scan, received two cycles of ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine) chemotherapy, and then underwent an interim PET-CT scan.Images were centrally reviewed with the use of a 5-point scale for PET findings.Patients with negative PET findings after two cycles were randomly assigned to continue ABVD (ABVD group) or omit bleomycin (AVD group) in cycles 3 through 6.Those with positive PET findings after two cycles received BEACOPP (bleomycin, etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone).Radiotherapy was not recommended for patients with negative findings on interim scans.The primary outcome was the difference in the 3-year progression-free survival rate between randomized groups, a noninferiority comparison to exclude a difference of 5 or more percentage points.RESULTS: A total of 1214 patients were registered; 937 of the 1119 patients (83.7%) who underwent an interim PET-CT scan according to protocol had negative findings.With a median follow-up of 41 months, the 3-year progression-free survival rate and overall survival rate in the ABVD group were 85.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 82.1 to 88.6) and 97.2% (95% CI, 95.1 to 98.4), respectively; the corresponding rates in the AVD group were 84.4% (95% CI, 80.7 to 87.5) and 97.6% (95% CI, 95.6 to 98.7).The absolute difference in the 3-year progression-free survival rate (ABVD minus AVD) was 1.6 percentage points (95% CI, -3.2 to 5.3).Respiratory adverse events were more severe in the ABVD group than in the AVD group.BEACOPP was given to the 172 patients with positive findings on the interim scan, and 74.4% had negative findings on a third PET-CT scan; the 3-year progression-free survival rate was 67.5% and the overall survival rate 87.8%.A total of 62 patients died during the trial (24 from Hodgkin's lymphoma), for a 3-year progression-free survival rate of 82.6% and an overall survival rate of 95.8%.CONCLUSIONS: Although the results fall just short of the specified noninferiority margin, the omission of bleomycin from the ABVD regimen after negative findings on interim PET resulted in a lower incidence of pulmonary toxic effects than with continued ABVD but not significantly lower efficacy.(Funded by Cancer Research UK and Others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00678327.).",0,0,0,0

34461224,"Simvastatin modulates estrogen signaling in uterine leiomyoma via regulating receptor palmitoylation, trafficking and degradation.Uterine leiomyomas or fibroids are the most common tumors of the female reproductive tract.Estrogen (E2), a steroid-derived hormone, and its receptors (ERs), particularly ER-alpha, are important drivers for the development and growth of leiomyomas.We previously demonstrated that simvastatin, a drug used for hyperlipidemia, also possesses anti-leiomyoma properties.The aim of this work is to investigate the impact of simvastatin on ER-alpha signaling in leiomyoma cells, including its expression, downstream signaling, transcriptional activity, post-translational modification, trafficking and degradation.Primary and immortalized human uterine leiomyoma (HuLM) cells were used for in vitro experiments.Immunodeficient mice xenografted with human leiomyoma tissue explants were used for in vivo studies.Leiomyoma samples were obtained from patients enrolled in an ongoing double-blinded, phase II, randomized controlled trial.Here, we found that simvastatin significantly reduced E2-induced proliferation and PCNA expression.In addition, simvastatin reduced total ER-alpha expression in leiomyoma cells and altered its subcellular localization by inhibiting its trafficking to the plasma membrane and nucleus.Simvastatin also inhibited E2 downstream signaling, including ERK and AKT pathways, E2/ER transcriptional activity and E2-responsive genes.To explain simvastatin effects on ER-alpha level and trafficking, we examined its effects on ER-alpha post-translational processing.We noticed that simvastatin reduced ER-alpha palmitoylation; a required modification for its stability, trafficking to plasma membrane, and signaling.We also observed an increase in ubiquitin-mediated ER-alpha degradation.Importantly, we found that the effects of simvastatin on ER-alpha expression were recapitulated in the xenograft leiomyoma mouse model and human tissues.Thus, our data suggest that simvastatin modulates several E2/ER signaling targets with potential implications in leiomyoma therapy and beyond.",0,0,0,0

29482649,"A randomized phase 3 trial comparing paclitaxel plus 5-fluorouracil versus cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil in Chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced esophageal carcinoma-the ESO-shanghai 1 trial protocol.BACKGROUND: Concurrent chemoradiotherapy is a standard modality for locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients.Cisplatin combined with 5-fluorouracil continuous infusion (PF) remains the standard concurrent chemotherapy regimen.However, radiotherapy concurrent with PF showed a high incidence of severe side effects.Paclitaxel showed a promising radiosensitivity enhancement in the treatment of esophageal carcinoma in both vitro and vivo studies.The ESO-Shanghai 1 trial examines the hypothesis that paclitaxel plus 5-fluorouracil (TF) concurrent with radiotherapy has better overall survival and lower toxicity for patients with local advanced ESCC.METHOD: Four hundred thirty-six ESCC patients presenting with stage IIa to IVa will be enrolled in a prospective multicenter randomized phase 3 study.Patients will be randomized to either concurrent chemoradiotherapy with PF (cisplatin 25 mg/m(2)/d, d1-3, plus 5-fluorouracil 1800 mg/m(2), continuous infusion for 72 h) once every 4 weeks for 2 cycles followed by consolidation chemotherapy for 2 cycles or concurrent chemoradiotherapy with weekly TF (5-fluorouracil 300 mg/m(2), continuous infusion for 96 h plus paclitaxel 50 mg/m(2), d1) for 5 weeks followed by consolidation chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil 1800 mg/m(2), continuous infusion for 72 h, plus paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2) d1) once every 4 weeks for 2 cycles.The radiotherapy dose is 61.2 Gy delivered in 34 fractions to the primary tumor including lymph nodes.The primary end-point is the 3-yr overall survival analyzed by intention to treat.The secondary endpoints are disease progression-free survival, local progression-free survival, and number and grade of participants with adverse events.DISCUSSION: The aim of this phase 3 study is to determine whether the TF regimen could replace the standard PF regimen for inoperable ESCC patients.An overall survival benefit of 12% at 3 years should be expected in the TF group to achieve this goal.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01591135 .Registered 18 April 2012.",0,0,0,0
34446053,"Durvalumab (MEDI 4736) in combination with extended neoadjuvant regimens in rectal cancer: a study protocol of a randomised phase II trial (PRIME-RT).BACKGROUND: Advances in multi-modality treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) have resulted in low local recurrence rates, but around 30% of patients will still die from distant metastatic disease.In parallel, there is increasing recognition that with radiotherapy and systemic treatment, some patients achieve a complete response and may avoid surgical resection, including in many cases, the need for a permanent stoma.Extended neoadjuvant regimes have emerged to address these concerns.The inclusion of immunotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting has the potential to further enhance this strategy by priming the local immune microenvironment and engaging the systemic immune response.METHODS: PRIME-RT is a multi-centre, open label, phase II, randomised trial for patients with newly diagnosed LARC.Eligible patients will be randomised to receive either: short course radiotherapy (25 Gray in 5 fractions over one week) with concomitant durvalumab (1500 mg administered intravenously every 4 weeks), followed by FOLFOX (85 mg/m(2) oxaliplatin, 350 mg folinic acid and 400 mg/m(2) bolus 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) given on day 1 followed by 2400 mg/m(2) 5-FU infusion over 46-48 h, all administered intravenously every 2 weeks), and durvalumab, or long course chemoradiotherapy (50 Gray to primary tumour in 25 fractions over 5 weeks with concomitant oral capecitabine 825 mg/m(2) twice per day on days of radiotherapy) with durvalumab followed by FOLFOX and durvalumab.The primary endpoint is complete response rate in each arm.Secondary endpoints include treatment compliance, toxicity, safety, overall recurrence, proportion of patients with a permanent stoma, and survival.The study is translationally rich with collection of bio-specimens prior to, during, and following treatment in order to understand the molecular and immunological factors underpinning treatment response.The trial opened and the first patient was recruited in January 2021.The main trial will recruit up to 42 patients with LARC and commence after completion of a safety run-in that will recruit at least six patients with LARC or metastatic disease.DISCUSSION: PRIME-RT will explore if adding immunotherapy to neoadjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy for patients with LARC can prime the tumour microenvironment to improve complete response rates and stoma free survival.Sequential biopsies are a key component within the trial design that will provide new knowledge on how the tumour microenvironment changes at different time-points in response to multi-modality treatment.This expectation is that the trial will provide information to test this treatment within a large phase clinical trial.Trial registration Clinicaltrials.gov NCT04621370 (Registered 9th Nov 2020) EudraCT number 2019-001471-36 (Registered 6th Nov 2020).",1,1,1,1

32962673,"Assessment of the effect of platelet rich plasma on the healing of operated sacrococcygeal pilonidal sinus by lay-open technique: a randomized clinical trial.BACKGROUND: Sacrococcygeal pilonidal sinus disease (PSD) is an infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue at the upper part of the natal cleft of the buttocks.Excision and healing by granulation ""lay-open"" method is still more preferable than other methods of midline closure or using flaps but the healing time is lengthy.The present study was performed to assess the healing promotion effect of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) on the pilonidal sinus wounds treated by the lay-open method.METHODS: One hundred patients suffering from PSD were randomly divided into two groups, they were treated by the lay-open method, at General surgery department, Kafr El-Sheik University hospital, Egypt, during the period from December 2018 to December 2019.Group (A) was adopted the regular dressing postoperatively, while group (B) was treated with PRP injection into the wound at 4 and 12 postoperative days.RESULTS: Accelerated rate of wound healing was detected in group (B) in day 10, with a significant difference detected in days 15, 20, 25 and 30 postoperative, with a mean time of complete healing 45 +/- 2.6 days in group B, while it was 57 +/- 2.4 days in group A with a p-value of 0.001 which indicates considerable effect in the treated group.CONCLUSIONS: PRP injection is an effective new technique in accelerating the healing of pilonidal wound after surgery, with a significant decrease in post-operative pain, complications and an early return to work.TRIAL REGISTRATION: retrospectively registered.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: 12/35/1016 issued on December 2018 from the Institution Review Board at Kafr El Sheikh University.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04430413.",0,0,0,0
22065199,"Temozolomide plus radiotherapy for glioblastoma in a Canadian province: efficacy versus effectiveness and the impact of O6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase promoter methylation.BACKGROUND: Radiotherapy with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide has been the standard of care for newly diagnosed glioblastoma in adults since the pivotal trial by Roger Stupp and colleagues.The effectiveness of this regimen has not been evaluated in Canada.Additionally, the impact of O6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation on patient survival has not been confirmed.Hence, survival outcomes and MGMT predictive value were compared for the patients in Alberta versus the Stupp trial population.METHODS: Retrospective chart review of 215 adult glioblastoma patients who started radiotherapy and temozolomide between January 2007 and December 2010 at the Cross Cancer Institute (Edmonton, Alberta) or the Tom Baker Cancer Centre (Calgary, Alberta).RESULTS: In the Alberta population, median overall survival was 14.3 months (vs. 14.6 months in trial, p = NS) and median progression-free survival was 5.8 months (vs. 6.9 months in trial, p = NS).However, unlike the trial, the Alberta MGMT subgroup analysis for overall survival was not statistically significant, despite a hazard ratio of 0.65 in favor of the methylated group.More Alberta patients received corticosteroids (p < 0.0001) and fewer underwent complete resection (p = 0.0001) or a postprogression second surgery (p = 0.01) than the Stupp population, but characteristics were otherwise similar.CONCLUSION: Current practice in Alberta enables patients to achieve overall and progression-free survival similar to the clinical trial.Further follow-up is required to confirm the predictive value of the MGMT assay.Until that is clarified or better treatments are developed, it is reasonable to continue offering this treatment regimen to patients regardless of MGMT methylation status.",0,0,0,0
26918279,"Effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of TAS-102 and its efficacy and safety in patients with advanced solid tumors.TAS-102, a novel oral antitumor agent, consists of trifluridine and tipiracil hydrochloride (molar ratio, 1:0.5).We investigated the effects of food on trifluridine and tipiracil hydrochloride.The efficacy and safety of TAS-102 were evaluated in patients with advanced solid tumors.We analyzed drug pharmacokinetics using a randomized, single-dose, two-treatment (fed versus fasting), two-period, two-sequence cross-over design, followed by repeated administration.Patients were given single doses of TAS-102 (35 mg/m(2) ) in the pharmacokinetic phase and received twice-daily doses of TAS-102 in 28-day cycles in the repeated administration phase for evaluating efficacy and safety.Food showed no effect on the area under the curve from 0 to 12 h or 0 h-infinity values of trifluridine following administration of TAS-102 under fasting and fed conditions, whereas those of tipiracil hydrochloride decreased by approximately 40%.Maximum concentrations of both drugs decreased by approximately 40%, indicating that food influenced the absorption and bioavailability of trifluridine and tipiracil hydrochloride, respectively.During the repeated administration, stable disease was observed in nine patients with rectal, small-cell lung, breast, thymic, duodenal, and prostate cancers.Major adverse events were neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia, and nausea.Postprandial administration was optimal for TAS-102 because trifluridine's area under the curve was not changed by food, indicating that its clinical efficacy would not be affected.Additionally, postprandial administration was reasonable because the maximum concentration of trifluridine decreased in neutrophils, which correlated with previous studies.These results suggest that TAS-102 would be an effective treatment for small-cell lung, thymic, and colorectal cancers.This trial is registered with the Japan Pharmaceutical Information Center (no.

22749428,"Stamp test delivers message on erectile dysfunction after high-dose intensity-modulated radiotherapy for prostate cancer.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate erectile function after high-dose radiotherapy for prostate cancer using the International Index of Erectile Function, Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite, and stamp test.METHODS: Men with favorable and intermediate-risk prostate cancer were assigned to receive prostate intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) versus an erectile tissue-sparing IMRT technique in a Phase III randomized, prospective study.The stamp test and International Index of Erectile Function and Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite questionnaires were completed at baseline and 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years after IMRT.The Sexual Health Inventory for Men scores were abstracted from the International Index of Erectile Function questionnaire.A partner questionnaire, designated IIEF-P, modeled after the International Index of Erectile Function questionnaire but from the perspective of the partner, was also collected.RESULTS: The data from 94 men who were enrolled in the trial and who had completed >/=1 questionnaire or 1 stamp test were analyzed.The median age of the patient population was 62.5 years.The median radiation dose was 76 Gy (range 74-80).At 6 months and 1 year after high-dose IMRT, a positive stamp result correlated significantly with the median Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite sexual summary, sexual function, and bother subscale scores.Additionally, 6 months after IMRT, the stamp test correlated with the median International Index of Erectile Function, International Index of Erectile Function sexual function domain, and Sexual Health Inventory for Men scores.Robust concordance for the International Index of Erectile Function and Sexual Health Inventory for Men scores was appreciated between responding patient and partner pairs.CONCLUSION: Nocturnal tumescence, as indicated by a positive stamp test, correlated well with established quality of life questionnaires after IMRT.The stamp test should strongly be considered as an objective measure of erectile function in future studies of erectile dysfunction in patients with prostate cancer.",0,0,0,0
30386984,"Short-term surgical outcomes of laparoscopy-assisted versus open D2 distal gastrectomy for locally advanced gastric cancer in North China: a multicenter randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Although laparoscopic surgery has been recommended as an optional therapy for patients with early gastric cancer, whether patients with locally advanced gastric cancer (AGC) could benefit from laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy (LADG) with D2 lymphadenectomy remains elusive due to a lack of comprehensive clinical data.To evaluate the efficacy of LADG, we conducted a multi-institutional randomized controlled trial to compare laparoscopy-assisted versus open distal gastrectomy (ODG) for AGC in North China.METHODS: In this RCT, after patients were enrolled according to the eligibility criteria, they were preoperatively assigned to LADG or ODG arm randomly with a 1:1 allocation ratio.The primary endpoint was the morbidity and mortality within 30 postoperative days to evaluate the surgical safety of LADG.The secondary endpoint was 3-year disease-free survival.This trial was registered at ClinicalTrial.gov as NCT02464215.RESULTS: Between March 2014 and August 2017, a total of 446 patients with cT2-4aN0-3M0 (AJCC 7th staging system) were enrolled.Of these, 222 patients underwent LADG and 220 patients underwent ODG were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis.The compliance rate of D2 lymph node dissection was identical between the LADG and ODG arms (99.5%, P = 1.000).No significant difference was observed regarding the overall postoperative complication rate in two groups (LADG 13.1%, ODG 17.7%, P = 0.174).No operation-related death occurred in both arms.CONCLUSIONS: This trial confirmed that LADG performed by credentialed surgeons was safe and feasible for patients with AGC compared with conventional ODG.",1,1,1,1
29340815,"Comparison between submucosal tunneling endoscopic resection and video-assisted thoracoscopic enucleation for esophageal submucosal tumors originating from the muscularis propria layer: a randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Surgical resection is considered the first treatment option for submucosal tumors (SMTs) originating from the muscularis propria layer while submucosal tunneling endoscopic resection (STER) is proved to be a safe and effective method for treating SMTs.This study aimed to compare video-assisted thoracoscopic enucleation (VATE) with STER for treating esophageal SMTs.METHODS: Sixty-six patients with small esophageal SMTs were prospectively randomized from July 2014 to December 2015.After exclusion of 8 patients, 58 subjects scheduled for STER or VATE were enrolled.Clinicopathological, endoscopic, and adverse events (AEs) data were collected and analyzed between STER and VATE.RESULTS: Forty-six males and 12 females with a mean age of 46.1 +/- 9.4 years were randomized to the STER (n = 30) and VATE (n = 28) groups, respectively.Demographics and lesion features were similar between the two groups.Median procedure time was shorter in the STER group than the VATE group (44.5 vs. 106.5 min, P < 0.001); cost was lower in the STER group (4499.46 vs. 6137.32 USD, P = 0.010).Median decrease in hemoglobin levels post-procedure was - 1.6 g/L in the STER group and 14.7 g/L after VATE (P = 0.001).Lower postoperative pain scores were found in the STER group compared with the VATE group (2 vs. 4, P < 0.001).No recurrent or residual tumors were found in either group.En bloc resection rates, complete resection rates, hospital times, and post-procedure AEs were similar between two groups.The en bloc resection rates for SMTs < 20.0 mm were 100% in both groups while STER achieved only 71.4% en bloc resection rate for SMTs >/= 20.0 mm.CONCLUSION: STER and VATE are comparably effective for esophageal SMTs; however, STER is superior to VATE with shorter operation time and decreased cost, and seems safer than VATE.STER is recommended for SMTs < 20.0 mm while VATE is recommended for SMTs with a transverse diameter > 35.0 mm.Clinical trail registration statement: This study is registered at http://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.aspx?proj=4814 .The registration identification number is ChiCTR-TRC-14004759.The registration date is April 30, 2014.",0,0,0,0

29327085,"Acceptance and commitment therapy for symptom interference in metastatic breast cancer patients: a pilot randomized trial.PURPOSE: Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality in women worldwide.With medical advances, metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients often live for years with many symptoms that interfere with activities.However, there is a paucity of efficacious interventions to address symptom-related suffering and functional interference.Thus, this study examined the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of telephone-based acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) for symptom interference with functioning in MBC patients.METHODS: Symptomatic MBC patients (N = 47) were randomly assigned to six telephone sessions of ACT or six telephone sessions of education/support.Patients completed measures of symptom interference and measures assessing the severity of pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance, depressive symptoms, and anxiety.RESULTS: The eligibility screening rate (64%) and high retention (83% at 8 weeks post-baseline) demonstrated feasibility.When examining within-group change, ACT participants showed decreases in symptom interference (i.e., fatigue interference and sleep-related impairment; Cohen's d range = - 0.23 to - 0.31) at 8 and 12 weeks post-baseline, whereas education/support participants showed minimal change in these outcomes (d range = - 0.03 to 0.07).Additionally, at 12 weeks post-baseline, ACT participants showed moderate decreases in fatigue and sleep disturbance (both ds = - 0.43), whereas education/support participants showed small decreases in these outcomes (ds = - 0.24 and - 0.18 for fatigue and sleep disturbance, respectively).Both the ACT and education/support groups showed reductions in depressive symptoms (ds = - 0.27 and - 0.28) at 12 weeks post-baseline.Group differences in all outcomes were not statistically significant.CONCLUSIONS: ACT shows feasibility and promise in improving fatigue and sleep-related outcomes in MBC patients and warrants further investigation.",0,0,0,0
23850170,"Which patients benefit most from primary surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy in stage IIIC or IV ovarian cancer? An exploratory analysis of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer 55971 randomised trial.BACKGROUND: To investigate whether biomarkers consisting of baseline characteristics of advanced stage ovarian cancer patients can help in identifying subgroups of patients who would benefit more from primary surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy.METHODS: We used data of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 55971 trial in which 670 patients were randomly assigned to primary surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy.The primary outcome was overall survival.Ten baseline clinical and pathological characteristics were selected as potential biomarkers.Using Subpopulation Treatment Effect Pattern Plots (STEPP), biomarkers with a statistically significant qualitative additive interaction with treatment were considered as potentially informative for treatment selection.We also combined selected biomarkers to form a multimarker treatment selection rule.FINDINGS: The size of the largest metastatic tumour and clinical stage were significantly associated with the magnitude of the benefit from treatment, in terms of five-year survival (p for interaction: 0.008 and 0.016, respectively).Stage IIIC patients with metastatic tumours 45 mm benefited more from primary surgery while stage IV patients with metastatic tumours >45 mm benefited more from neoadjuvant chemotherapy.In stage IIIC patients with larger metastatic tumours and in stage IV patients with less extensive metastatic tumours both treatments were equally effective.We estimated that by selecting treatments for patients based on largest metastatic tumour and clinical stage, the potential five-year survival rate in the population of treated patients would be 27.3% (95% confidence interval (CI) 21.9-33.0), 7.8% higher than if all were treated with primary surgery, and 5.6% higher if all were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.INTERPRETATION: Although survival was comparable after primary surgery and neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the overall group of patients with ovarian cancer in the EORTC 55971 trial, we found in this exploratory analysis that patients with stage IIIC and less extensive metastatic tumours had higher survival with primary surgery, while patients with stage IV disease and large metastatic tumours had higher survival with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.For patients who did not meet these criteria, both treatment options led to comparable survival rates.",1,1,1,1
22149921,"ABVD alone versus radiation-based therapy in limited-stage Hodgkin's lymphoma.BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy plus radiation treatment is effective in controlling stage IA or IIA nonbulky Hodgkin's lymphoma in 90% of patients but is associated with late treatment-related deaths.Chemotherapy alone may improve survival because it is associated with fewer late deaths.METHODS: We randomly assigned 405 patients with previously untreated stage IA or IIA nonbulky Hodgkin's lymphoma to treatment with doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD) alone or to treatment with subtotal nodal radiation therapy, with or without ABVD therapy.Patients in the ABVD-only group, both those with a favorable risk profile and those with an unfavorable risk profile, received four to six cycles of ABVD.Among those assigned to subtotal nodal radiation therapy, patients who had a favorable risk profile received subtotal nodal radiation therapy alone and patients with an unfavorable risk profile received two cycles of ABVD plus subtotal nodal radiation therapy.The primary end point was 12-year overall survival.RESULTS: The median length of follow-up was 11.3 years.At 12 years, the rate of overall survival was 94% among those receiving ABVD alone, as compared with 87% among those receiving subtotal nodal radiation therapy (hazard ratio for death with ABVD alone, 0.50; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.25 to 0.99; P=0.04); the rates of freedom from disease progression were 87% and 92% in the two groups, respectively (hazard ratio for disease progression, 1.91; 95% CI, 0.99 to 3.69; P=0.05); and the rates of event-free survival were 85% and 80%, respectively (hazard ratio for event, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.54 to 1.43; P=0.60).Among the patients randomly assigned to ABVD alone, 6 patients died from Hodgkin's lymphoma or an early treatment complication and 6 died from another cause; among those receiving radiation therapy, 4 deaths were related to Hodgkin's lymphoma or early toxic effects from the treatment and 20 were related to another cause.CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma, ABVD therapy alone, as compared with treatment that included subtotal nodal radiation therapy, was associated with a higher rate of overall survival owing to a lower rate of death from other causes.(Funded by the Canadian Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute; HD.6 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00002561.).",1,1,1,1
30267257,"Cost-utility of Sunitinib Versus Pazopanib in Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma in Canada using Real-world Evidence.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The development of new targeted therapies in kidney cancer has shaped disease management in the metastatic phase.Our study aims to conduct a cost-utility analysis of sunitinib versus pazopanib in first-line setting in Canada for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) patients using real-world data.METHODS: A Markov model with Monte-Carlo microsimulations was developed to estimate the clinical and economic outcomes of patients treated in first-line with sunitinib versus pazopanib.Transition probabilities were estimated using observational data from a Canadian database where real-life clinical practice was captured.The costs of therapies, disease progression, and management of adverse events were included in the model in Canadian dollars ($Can).Utility and disutility values were included for each health state.Incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were calculated for a time horizon of 5 years, from the Canadian Healthcare System perspective.RESULTS: The cost difference was $36,303 and the difference in quality-adjusted life year (QALY) was 0.54 in favour of sunitinib with an ICUR of $67,227/QALY for sunitinib versus pazopanib.The major cost component (56%) is related to best supportive care (BSC) where patients tend to stay for a longer period of time compared to other states.The difference in life years gained (LYG) between sunitinib and pazopanib was 1.21 LYG (33.51 vs 19.03 months) and the ICER was $30,002/LYG.Sensitivity analysis demonstrated the robustness of the model with a high probability of sunitinib being a cost-effective option when compared to pazopanib.CONCLUSION: When using real-world evidence, sunitinib is found to be a cost-effective treatment compared to pazopanib in mRCC patients in Canada.",0,0,0,0
28743247,"A randomized phase II study of paclitaxel alone versus paclitaxel plus sorafenib in second- and third-line treatment of patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer (PASO).BACKGROUND: We conducted an open-label, randomized, two-arm multi-center study to assess the efficacy and safety of paclitaxel versus paclitaxel + sorafenib in patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer.METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive either paclitaxel monotherapy (80 mg/m(2)) weekly (3 weeks on, 1 week off) plus sorafenib 400 mg orally, twice a day taken continuously throughout 28 day cycles.Sorafenib dose was gradually escalated from a starting dose of 200 mg twice a day.The primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS).RESULTS: A pre-planned efficacy interim analysis was performed on the data of 60 patients, 30 patients in each treatment arm.Median PFS was estimated at 6.6 months (95% CI: 5.1 to 9.0) in patients randomized to single-agent paclitaxel (Arm A) and 5.6 months (95% CI: 3.8 to 6.5) in patients randomized to paclitaxel-sorafenib combination (Arm B) therapy.Contrary to the hypothesis, the treatment effect was statistically significant in favor of paclitaxel monotherapy (hazard ratio 1.80, 95% CI: 1.02 to 3.20; log-rank test P = 0.0409).It was decided to stop the trial early for futility.Median OS was also in favor of Arm A (20.7 months (95% CI: 16.4 to 26.7) versus 12.1 months (95% CI: 5.8 to 20.4) in Arm B. Clinical control was achieved in 28 patients (93.3%) in Arm A and in 21 patients 70.0% in Arm B. Overall response rate was met in 43.3% of patients in Arm A and in 40.0% in Arm B. Toxicities were increased in Arm B with higher rates of diarrhea, nausea, neutropenia, hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) and anorexia, Grad 3 and 4 toxicities were rare.CONCLUSIONS: In this pre-planned interim analysis, paclitaxel-sorafenib combination therapy was not found to be superior to paclitaxel monotherapy with regard to the primary end point, progression-free survival.The trial was therefore discontinued early.There was no indication of more favorable outcomes for combination therapy in secondary efficacy end points.As expected, the safety and toxicity profile of the combination therapy was less favorable compared to monotherapy.Overall, this trial did not demonstrate that adding sorafenib to second- or third-line paclitaxel provides any clinical benefit to patients with HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer.Cautious dosing using a sorafenib ramp up schedule might have contributed to negative results.TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered at EudraCT (No 2009-018025-73) and retrospectively registered at Clinical trials.gov on March 17, 2011 ( NCT01320111 ).",1,1,1,1

26724840,"Role of Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Prostate Cancer Screening: A Pilot Study Within the Goteborg Randomised Screening Trial.BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and targeted biopsies (TB) have shown potential to more accurately detect significant prostate cancer compared with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and systematic biopsies (SB).OBJECTIVE: To compare sequential screening (PSA+MRI) with conventional PSA screening.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Of 384 attendees in the 10th screening round of the Goteborg randomised screening trial, 124 men, median age 69.5 yr, had a PSA of >/= 1.8 ng/ml and underwent a prebiopsy MRI.Men with suspicious lesions on MRI and/or PSA >/= 3.0ng/ml were referred for biopsy.SB was performed blinded to MRI results and TB was performed in men with tumour-suspicious findings on MRI.Three screening strategies were compared (PSA >/= 3.0+SB; PSA >/= 3.0+MRI+TB and PSA >/= 1.8+MRI+TB).OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Cancer detection rates, sensitivity, and specificity were calculated per screening strategy and compared using McNemar's test.RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: In total, 28 cases of prostate cancer were detected, of which 20 were diagnosed in biopsy-naive men.Both PSA >/= 3.0+MRI and PSA >/= 1.8+MRI significantly increased specificity compared with PSA >/= 3.0+SB (0.92 and 0.79 vs 0.52; p<0.002 for both), while sensitivity was significantly higher for PSA >/= 1.8+MRI compared with PSA >/= 3.0+MRI (0.73 vs 0.46, p=0.008).The detection rate of significant cancer was higher with PSA >/= 1.8+MRI compared with PSA >/= 3.0+SB (5.9% vs 4.0%), while the detection rate of insignificant cancer was lowered by PSA >/= 3.0+MRI (0.3% vs 1.2%).The primary limitation of this study is the small sample of men.CONCLUSION: A screening strategy with a lowered PSA cut-off followed by TB in MRI-positive men seems to increase the detection of significant cancers while improving specificity.If replicated, these results may contribute to a paradigm shift in future screening.PATIENT SUMMARY: Major concerns in prostate-specific antigen screening are overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis.We evaluated whether prostate magnetic resonance imaging could improve the balance of benefits to harm in prostate cancer screening screening, and we found a promising potential of using magnetic resonance imaging in addition to prostate-specific antigen.",0,0,0,0
32791985,"A monocentric, open-label randomized standard-of-care controlled study of XONRID(R), a medical device for the prevention and treatment of radiation-induced dermatitis in breast and head and neck cancer patients.BACKGROUND: This study was an open-label, 2-arms, monocentric, randomized clinical trial comparing Xonrid(R), a topical medical device, versus standard of care (SOC) in preventing and treating acute radiation dermatitis (ARD) in Head and Neck Cancer (HNC) and Breast Cancer (BC) patients undergoing radiotherapy (RT).METHODS: Eligible HNC and BC patients were randomized 1:1 to receive Xonrid(R) + SOC or SOC during RT.Patients were instructed to apply Xonrid(R) on the irradiated area three times daily, starting on the first day of RT and until 2 weeks after RT completion or until the development of grade >/= 3 skin toxicity.The primary endpoint was to evaluate the proportion of patients who developed an ARD grade < 2 at the 5th week in both groups.Secondary endpoints were median time to grade 2 (G2) skin toxicity onset; changes in skin erythema and pigmentation and trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL); patient-reported skin symptoms.All patients were evaluated at baseline, weekly during RT and 2 weeks after treatment completion.The evaluation included: clinical toxicity assessment; reflectance spectrometry (RS) and TEWL examination; measurement of patients' quality of life (QoL) through Skindex-16 questionnaire.RESULTS: Eighty patients (40 for each cancer site) were enrolled between June 2017 and July 2018.Groups were well balanced for population characteristics.All BC patients underwent 3-Dimensional Conformal RT (3D-CRT) whereas HNC patients underwent Volumetric-Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT).At week 5 the proportion of BC patients who did not exhibit G2 ARD was higher in Xonrid(R) + SOC group (p = 0.091).In the same group the onset time of G2 ARD was significantly longer than in SOC-alone group (p < 0.0491).For HNC groups there was a similar trend, but it did not reach statistical significance.For both cancer sites, patients' QoL, measured by the Skindex-16 score, was always lower in the Xonrid(R) + SOC group.CONCLUSION: Despite the failure to achieve the primary endpoint, this study suggests that Xonrid(R) may represent a valid medical device in the prevention and treatment of ARD at least in BC patients, delaying time to develop skin toxicity and reducing the proportion of patients who experienced G2 ARD during RT treatment and 2 weeks later.TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori di Milano (INT 52/14 - NCT02261181 ).Registered on ClinicalTrial.gov on 21st August 2017.",0,0,0,0

29233673,"Conventional versus traction-assisted endoscopic submucosal dissection for gastric neoplasms: a multicenter, randomized controlled trial (with video).BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The aim of this study was to clarify whether dental floss clip (DFC) traction improves the technical outcomes of endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD).METHODS: A superiority, randomized control trial was conducted at 14 institutions across Japan.Patients with single gastric neoplasm meeting the indications of the Japanese guidelines for gastric treatment were enrolled and assigned to receive conventional ESD or DFC traction-assisted ESD (DFC-ESD).Randomization was performed according to a computer-generated random sequence with stratification by institution, tumor location, tumor size, and operator experience.The primary endpoint was ESD procedure time, defined as the time from the start of the submucosal injection to the end of the tumor removal procedure.RESULTS: Between July 2015 and September 2016, 640 patients underwent randomization.Of these, 316 patients who underwent conventional ESD and 319 patients who underwent DFC-ESD were included in our analysis.The mean ESD procedure time was 60.7 and 58.1 minutes for conventional ESD and DFC-ESD, respectively (P = .45).Perforation was less frequent in the DFC-ESD group (2.2% vs .3%, P = .04).For lesions located in the greater curvature of the upper or middle stomach, the mean procedure time was significantly shorter in the DFC-ESD group (104.1 vs 57.2 minutes, P = .01).CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that DFC-ESD does not result in shorter procedure time in the overall patient population, but it can reduce the risk of perforation.When selectively applied to lesions located in the greater curvature of the upper or middle stomach, DFC-ESD provides a remarkable reduction in procedure time.",0,0,0,0
23943299,"Adjuvant leuprolide with or without docetaxel in patients with high-risk prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy (TAX-3501): important lessons for future trials.BACKGROUND: The current trial evaluated 2 common therapies for patients with advanced prostate cancer, docetaxel and hormonal therapy (HT), in the surgical adjuvant setting.METHODS: TAX-3501 was a randomized, phase 3, adjuvant study post-radical prostatectomy (RP) in high-risk patients with prostate cancer (n=228) comparing 18 months of HT with (CHT) without docetaxel chemotherapy either immediately (I) or deferred (D).High-risk disease was defined as a 5-year freedom-from-disease-progression rate of </= 60% as predicted by a post-RP nomogram.Progression-free survival (PFS), including prostate-specific antigen disease recurrence, was the primary endpoint.The authors also assessed the accuracy of the nomogram and analyzed testosterone recovery in 108 patients treated with HT who had at least 1 posttreatment testosterone value.RESULTS: Between December 2005 and September 2007, 228 patients were randomized between the treatment cohorts.TAX-3501 was terminated prematurely because of enrollment challenges, leaving it underpowered to detect differences in PFS.After a median follow-up of 3.4 years (interquartile range, 2.3-3.8 years), 39 of 228 patients (17%) demonstrated PSA disease progression, and metastatic disease progression occurred in 1 patient.The median time to baseline testosterone recovery after the completion of treatment was prolonged at 487 days (95% confidence interval, 457-546 days).The nomogram's predicted versus observed freedom from disease progression was significantly different for the combination D(HT) and D(CHT) group (P<.00001).CONCLUSIONS: TAX-3501 illustrated several difficulties involved in conducting postoperative adjuvant systemic trials in men with high-risk prostate cancer: the lack of consensus regarding patient selection and treatment, the need for long follow-up time, nonvalidated intermediate endpoints, evolving standard approaches, and the need for long-term research support.Except for selected patients at very high-risk of disease recurrence and death, surgical adjuvant trials in patients with prostate cancer may not be feasible.",0,0,0,0
27283862,"Occurrence and lung cancer probability of new solid nodules at incidence screening with low-dose CT: analysis of data from the randomised, controlled NELSON trial.BACKGROUND: US guidelines now recommend lung cancer screening with low-dose CT for high-risk individuals.Reports of new nodules after baseline screening have been scarce and are inconsistent because of differences in definitions used.We aimed to identify the occurrence of new solid nodules and their probability of being lung cancer at incidence screening rounds in the Dutch-Belgian Randomized Lung Cancer Screening Trial (NELSON).METHODS: In the ongoing, multicentre, randomised controlled NELSON trial, between Dec 23, 2003, and July 6, 2006, 15 822 participants who had smoked at least 15 cigarettes a day for more than 25 years or ten cigarettes a day for more than 30 years and were current smokers, or had quit smoking less than 10 years ago, were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive either screening with low-dose CT (n=7915) or no screening (n=7907).From Jan 28, 2004, to Dec 18, 2006, 7557 individuals underwent baseline screening with low-dose CT; 7295 participants underwent second and third screening rounds.We included all participants with solid non-calcified nodules, registered by the NELSON radiologists as new or smaller than 15 mm(3) (study detection limit) at previous screens.Nodule volume was generated semiautomatically by software.We calculated the maximum volume doubling time for nodules with an estimated percentage volume change of 25% or more, representing the minimum growth rate for the time since the previous scan.Lung cancer diagnosis was based on histology, and benignity was based on histology or stable size for at least 2 years.The NELSON trial is registered at trialregister.nl, number ISRCTN63545820.FINDINGS: We analysed data for participants with at least one solid non-calcified nodule at the second or third screening round.In the two incidence screening rounds, the NELSON radiologists registered 1222 new solid nodules in 787 (11%) participants.A new solid nodule was lung cancer in 49 (6%) participants with new solid nodules and, in total, 50 lung cancers were found, representing 4% of all new solid nodules.34 (68%) lung cancers were diagnosed at stage I. Nodule volume had a high discriminatory power (area under the receiver operating curve 0.795 [95% CI 0.728-0.862]; p<0.0001).Nodules smaller than 27 mm(3) had a low probability of lung cancer (two [0.5%] of 417 nodules; lung cancer probability 0.5% [95% CI 0.0-1.9]), nodules with a volume of 27 mm(3) up to 206 mm(3) had an intermediate probability (17 [3.1%] of 542 nodules; lung cancer probability 3.1% [1.9-5.0]), and nodules of 206 mm(3) or greater had a high probability (29 [16.9%] of 172 nodules; lung cancer probability 16.9% [12.0-23.2]).A volume cutoff value of 27 mm(3) or greater had more than 95% sensitivity for lung cancer.INTERPRETATION: Our study shows that new solid nodules are detected at each screening round in 5-7% of individuals who undergo screening for lung cancer with low-dose CT.These new nodules have a high probability of malignancy even at a small size.These findings should be considered in future screening guidelines, and new solid nodules should be followed up more aggressively than nodules detected at baseline screening.FUNDING: Zorgonderzoek Nederland Medische Wetenschappen and Koningin Wilhelmina Fonds Kankerbestrijding.",0,0,0,0

29445928,"Efficacy and safety of trastuzumab, lapatinib, and paclitaxel neoadjuvant treatment with or without prolonged exposure to anti-HER2 therapy, and with or without hormone therapy for HER2-positive primary breast cancer: a randomised, five-arm, multicentre, open-label phase II trial.BACKGROUND: Dual blockade of HER2 promises increased pathological complete response (pCR) rate compared with single blockade in the presence of chemotherapy for HER2-positive (+) primary breast cancer.Many questions remain regarding optimal duration of treatment and combination impact of endocrine therapy for luminal HER2 disease.METHODS: We designed a randomised phase II, five-arm study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lapatinib and trastuzumab (6 weeks) followed by lapatinib and trastuzumab plus weekly paclitaxel (12 weeks) with/without prolongation of anti-HER2 therapy prior to chemotherapy (18 vs. 6 weeks), and with/without endocrine therapy in patients with HER2+ and/or oestrogen receptor (ER)+ disease.The primary endpoint was comprehensive pCR (CpCR) rate.Among the secondary endpoints, pCR (yT0-isyN0) rate, safety, and clinical response were evaluated.RESULTS: In total, 215 patients were enrolled; 212 were included in the full analysis set (median age 53.0 years; tumour size = T2, 65%; and tumour spread = N0, 55%).CpCR was achieved in 101 (47.9%) patients and was significantly higher in ER- patients than in ER+ patients (ER- 63.0%, ER+ 36.1%; P = 0.0034).pCR with pN0 was achieved in 42.2% of patients (ER- 57.6%, ER+ 30.3%).No significant difference was observed in pCR rate between prolonged exposure groups and standard groups.Better clinical response outcomes were obtained in the prolongation phase of the anti-HER2 therapy.No surplus was detected in pCR rate by adding endocrine treatment.No major safety concern was recognised by prolonging the anti-HER2 treatment or adding endocrine therapy.CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed the therapeutic impact of lapatinib, trastuzumab, and paclitaxel therapy for each ER- and ER+ subgroup of HER2+ patients.Development of further strategies and tools is required, particularly for luminal HER2 disease.",1,1,1,1
33295007,"Apalutamide for metastatic, castration-sensitive prostate cancer in the Japanese population: A subgroup analysis of the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 TITAN study.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of apalutamide + androgen deprivation therapy versus androgen deprivation therapy alone in Japanese patients with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer from the phase 3, randomized, global TITAN study.METHODS: Men with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer randomly (1:1) received 240 mg apalutamide + androgen deprivation therapy or matching placebo + androgen deprivation therapy.The primary efficacy endpoints were radiographic progression-free survival and overall survival.Secondary efficacy endpoints were time to cytotoxic chemotherapy, pain progression, chronic opioid use, and skeletal-related events.Safety was also assessed.RESULTS: Of the 1052 patients included in the TITAN study, 51 (4.85%) were Japanese (apalutamide group, n = 28; placebo group, n = 23).In all, 81.8% of patients in the apalutamide and 71.8% in the placebo group did not experience radiographic progression or death, and the hazard ratio for radiographic progression-free survival favored treatment with apalutamide (hazard ratio 0.712, 95% confidence interval 0.205-2.466; P = 0.59).At 24 months, 85.7% of patients in the apalutamide group and 81.5% in the placebo group were alive, and the hazard ratio for overall survival favored apalutamide (hazard ratio 0.840, 95% confidence interval 0.210-3.361; P = 0.805).In the interim analysis, the median radiographic progression-free survival and overall survival were not reached in the apalutamide group and time to cytotoxic chemotherapy was delayed following apalutamide treatment.The safety profile of apalutamide in the Japanese subpopulation was comparable with that of the global population, except for skin rash.CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present analyses suggest that apalutamide + androgen deprivation therapy in Japanese patients had favorable efficacy compared with androgen deprivation therapy alone, and these findings are comparable to those in the overall population.Apalutamide + androgen deprivation therapy can be considered as one of the therapeutic options for a broad spectrum of metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer regardless of prior treatment and disease extent in Japanese patients.",1,1,1,1
32220893,"Disease Monitoring Using Post-induction Circulating Tumor DNA Analysis Following First-Line Therapy in Patients with Metastatic Colorectal Cancer.PURPOSE: We assessed plasma circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) level as a prognostic marker for progression-free survival (PFS) following first-line metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) therapy.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The Sequencing Triplet With Avastin and Maintenance (STEAM) was a randomized, phase II trial investigating efficacy of bevacizumab (BEV) plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin/oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin/irinotecan (FOLFIRI), administered concurrently or sequentially, versus FOLFOX-BEV in first-line mCRC.Evaluation of biomarkers associated with treatment outcomes was an exploratory endpoint.Patients in the biomarker-evaluable population (BEP) had 1 tissue sample, 1 pre-induction plasma sample, and 1 post-induction plasma sample collected </=60 days of induction from last drug date.RESULTS: Among the 280 patients enrolled in STEAM, 183 had sequenced and evaluable tumor tissue, 118 had matched pre-induction plasma, and 54 (BEP) had ctDNA-evaluable sequencing data for pre- and post-induction plasma.The most common somatic variants in tumor tissue and pre-induction plasma were TP53, APC, and KRAS.Patients with lower-than-median versus higher-than-median post-induction mean allele fraction (mAF) levels had longer median PFS (17.7 vs. 7.5 months, HR, 0.33; 95% confidence interval, 0.17-0.63).Higher levels of post-induction mAF and post-induction mean mutant molecules per milliliter (mMMPM), and changes in ctDNA (stratified by a 10-fold or 100-fold reduction in mAF between pre- and post-induction plasma), were associated with shorter PFS.Post-induction mAF and mMMPM generally correlated with each other (rho = 0.987, P < 0.0001).CONCLUSIONS: ctDNA quantification in post-induction plasma may serve as a prognostic biomarker for mCRC post-treatment outcomes.",1,1,1,1

29678994,"Can exercise delay transition to active therapy in men with low-grade prostate cancer? A multicentre randomised controlled trial.INTRODUCTION: Active surveillance is a strategy for managing low-risk, localised prostate cancer, where men are observed with serial prostate-specific antigen assessments to identify signs of disease progression.Currently, there are no strategies to support active surveillance compliance nor are there interventions that can prevent or slow disease progression, ultimately delaying transition to active treatment before it is clinically required.Recently, we proposed that exercise may have a therapeutic potential in delaying the need for active treatment in men on active surveillance.METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A single-blinded, two arm, multicentre randomised controlled trial will be undertaken with 168 patients randomly allocated in a ratio of 1:1 to exercise or usual care.Exercise will consist of supervised resistance and aerobic exercise performed three times per week for the first 6 months in an exercise clinical setting, and during months 7-12, a progressive stepped down approach will be used with men transitioning to once a week supervised training.Thereafter, for months 13 to 36, the men will self-manage their exercise programme.The primary endpoint will be the time until the patients begin active therapy.Secondary endpoints include disease progression (prostate specific antigen), body composition and muscle density, quality of life, distress and anxiety and an economic analysis will be performed.Measurements will be undertaken at 6 and 12 months (postintervention) and at 24 and 36 months follow-up.The primary outcome (time to initiation of curative therapy) will be analysed using Cox proportional hazards regression.Outcomes measured repeatedly will be analysed using mixed effects models to examine between-group differences.Data will be analysed using an intention-to-treat approach.ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Outcomes from the study will be published in peer-reviewed academic journals and presented in scientific, consumer and clinical meetings.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER:",0,0,0,0

24338990,"Risk factors for clinician-reported symptom clusters in patients with advanced head and neck cancer in a phase 3 randomized clinical trial: RTOG 0129.BACKGROUND: Chemoradiotherapy has become the standard of care for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma; however, those patients often experience multiple treatment-related symptoms or symptom clusters.Two symptom clusters have been identified for this population.Little is known about the risk factors of these symptom clusters.METHODS: Subjects comprised 684 patients who were treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy in a phase 3 randomized clinical trial.This trial compared standard fractionation radiotherapy to accelerated fractionation radiotherapy.Symptom clusters were evaluated at the end of the first and the second cycle of chemotherapy, and 3 months after the start of radiotherapy.Mixed-effect modeling was used to observe risk factors for symptom clusters.RESULTS: Race and education were independent predictors for the head and neck cluster, whereas sex and history of tobacco use were independent predictors for the gastrointestinal cluster.Primary cancer site was only significant for the head and neck cluster when other factors were not controlled: patients with oropharyngeal cancer had more severe symptoms in the head and neck clusters than did patients with laryngeal cancer.In addition, patients receiving accelerated fractionation radiotherapy experienced more symptoms of radiomucositis, pain, and nausea at 3 months after the start of radiotherapy than those receiving standard fractionation radiotherapy.CONCLUSIONS: Demographic characteristics were more predictive to symptom clusters, whereas clinical characteristics, such as cancer site and treatment arms, were more significant for individual symptoms.Knowing the risk factors will enhance the capability of clinicians to evaluate patients' risk of severe symptom clusters and to personalize management strategies.",0,0,0,0
23355041,"A randomized phase II study of gemcitabine and S-1 combination therapy versus gemcitabine monotherapy for advanced biliary tract cancer.PURPOSE: In order to confirm the impact of adding S-1 to gemcitabine, we conducted a randomized phase II study to compare the combination therapy of gemcitabine plus S-1 to gemcitabine monotherapy in patients with advanced biliary tract cancer.METHODS: Sixty-two patients with advanced cholangiocarcinoma or gallbladder cancer were randomized to either the combination therapy of gemcitabine and S-1 (gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 15 and S-1 40 mg/m(2) b.i.d.on days 1-14, repeated every 4 weeks) or gemcitabine monotherapy (gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m(2) on days 1, 8, and 15, repeated every 4 weeks).The primary endpoint of this study was response rate, and the regimen which showed the better response rate was selected as a candidate of phase III study.Tumor response was assessed every two cycles using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria version 1.0.RESULTS: The response rates of the combination therapy and the monotherapy were 20.0 and 9.4 %, respectively.The median time-to-progressions and overall survivals of these two treatments were nearly the same (5.6 vs. 4.3 months; 8.9 vs. 9.2 months).Adverse events occurred more frequently in the combination arm.CONCLUSIONS: The combination therapy of gemcitabine and S-1 showed the better response rate, but the superiority of this combination therapy was not clear in total.Because the standard of care changed to the combination therapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin during this study, it is difficult to select this combination therapy with a 4-week regimen as a candidate of phase III study.",1,1,1,1
27873451,"A prospective randomized trial comparing piperacillin/tazobactam with meropenem as empirical antibiotic treatment of febrile neutropenic children and adolescents with hematologic and malignant disorders.BACKGROUND: This randomized prospective study was designed to assess whether piperacillin/tazobactam (PIPC/TAZ) is as effective as meropenem (MEPM) as a first-line antibiotic treatment for febrile neutropenia (FN).PROCEDURE: FN episodes were randomly assigned to receive either PIPC/TAZ (337.5 mg/kg per day in three doses, 1-hr DIV, maximum 13.5 g per day) or MEPM (120 mg/kg per day in three doses, 1-hr DIV, maximum 3 g per day).Clinical responses were evaluated 120 hr after the DIV.RESULTS: A total of 434 febrile episodes in 105 patients (42 females and 63 males) with a median age of 8 years (range 0-25) were included in this trial.Blood cultures were positive in 47 out of the 434 episodes (10.8%).Regarding responses to the treatment, success rates between the PIPC/TAZ and MEPM groups were similar (62.4 vs. 65.9%, P = 0.484), even if patients were restricted to those with bacteremia (26.1 vs 37.5%, P = 0.534).Mortality rates did not significantly differ between the two groups (0.8 vs. 0%, P = 0.500).CONCLUSION: Both PIPC/TAZ and MEPM appeared to be equally efficacious and safe.Carbapenems are now broadly used to treat FN; however, this may increase the prevalence of drug-resistant bacteria.In this regard, the treatment using PIPC/TAZ for FN is more beneficial.",0,0,0,0

30386984,"Short-term surgical outcomes of laparoscopy-assisted versus open D2 distal gastrectomy for locally advanced gastric cancer in North China: a multicenter randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Although laparoscopic surgery has been recommended as an optional therapy for patients with early gastric cancer, whether patients with locally advanced gastric cancer (AGC) could benefit from laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy (LADG) with D2 lymphadenectomy remains elusive due to a lack of comprehensive clinical data.To evaluate the efficacy of LADG, we conducted a multi-institutional randomized controlled trial to compare laparoscopy-assisted versus open distal gastrectomy (ODG) for AGC in North China.METHODS: In this RCT, after patients were enrolled according to the eligibility criteria, they were preoperatively assigned to LADG or ODG arm randomly with a 1:1 allocation ratio.The primary endpoint was the morbidity and mortality within 30 postoperative days to evaluate the surgical safety of LADG.The secondary endpoint was 3-year disease-free survival.This trial was registered at ClinicalTrial.gov as NCT02464215.RESULTS: Between March 2014 and August 2017, a total of 446 patients with cT2-4aN0-3M0 (AJCC 7th staging system) were enrolled.Of these, 222 patients underwent LADG and 220 patients underwent ODG were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis.The compliance rate of D2 lymph node dissection was identical between the LADG and ODG arms (99.5%, P = 1.000).No significant difference was observed regarding the overall postoperative complication rate in two groups (LADG 13.1%, ODG 17.7%, P = 0.174).No operation-related death occurred in both arms.CONCLUSIONS: This trial confirmed that LADG performed by credentialed surgeons was safe and feasible for patients with AGC compared with conventional ODG.",1,1,1,1
32719000,"Once, Twice, Three Times a Finding: Reproducibility of Dendritic Cell Vaccine Trials Targeting Cytomegalovirus in Glioblastoma.Despite standard of care for glioblastoma, including gross total resection, high-dose radiation, and dose-limited chemotherapy, this tumor remains one of the most aggressive and therapeutically challenging.The relatively small number of patients with this diagnosis compared with more common solid tumors in clinical trials commits new glioblastoma therapies to testing in small, underpowered, nonrandomized settings.Among approximately 200 registered glioblastoma trials identified between 2005 and 2015, nearly half were single-arm studies with sample sizes not exceeding 50 patients.These constraints have made demonstrating efficacy for novel therapies difficult in glioblastoma and other rare and aggressive cancers.Novel immunotherapies for glioblastoma such as vaccination with dendritic cells (DC) have yielded mixed results in clinical trials.To address limited numbers, we sequentially conducted three separate clinical trials utilizing cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific DC vaccines in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma whereby each follow-up study had nearly doubled in sample size.Follow-up data from the first blinded, randomized phase II clinical trial (NCT00639639) revealed that nearly one third of this cohort is without tumor recurrence at 5 years from diagnosis.A second clinical trial (NCT00639639) resulted in a 36% survival rate at 5 years from diagnosis.Results of the first two-arm trial (NCT00639639) showed increased migration of the DC vaccine to draining lymph nodes, and this increased migration has been recapitulated in our larger confirmatory clinical study (NCT02366728).We have now observed that nearly one third of the glioblastoma study patient population receiving CMV-specific DC vaccines results in exceptional long-term survivors.",0,0,0,0

26761561,"Physical exercise for functional capacity, blood immune function, fatigue, and quality of life in high-risk prostate cancer patients during radiotherapy: a prospective, randomized clinical study.BACKGROUND: During radiotherapy (RT), prostate cancer (PCa) patients may report cancer related fatigue (CRF), which impairs functional capacity, psychological status, and quality of life (QoL).RT can induce cytokine responses that could play a role in mediating radiation toxicity by increasing inflammation.While it is known that physical exercise plays an important anti-inflammatory role in healthy adults, its specific anti-inflammatory effects in PCa patients with CRF have not yet been determined.AIM: Previous studies have shown that physical exercise in cancer patients undergoing RT improves cardiac fitness, muscle strength, and QoL, however it is still unknown how physical exercise affects inflammation and its specific consequences in PCa patients.Therefore, the purpose of this trial was to examine the effect of supervised physical exercise on inflammatory blood markers, as well as the relationship of these parameters with functional capacity, fatigue, and QoL in high-risk PCa patients undergoing RT.DESIGN: This was a prospective, two-arm randomized controlled clinical trial.SETTING: The study was performed in our outpatients center.POPULATION: Fifty-four high-risk PCa men were randomly allocated to two groups prior to undergoing RT.METHODS: Twenty-seven patients performed supervised, moderate-intensity physical exercise (exercise group; EG) and the other 27 formed a control group that carried out normal daily physical activity (usual group; UG).The following parameters were assessed before and after RT: functional capacity, changes in blood count variables and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL]-1beta, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha), fatigue, and QoL (using FACT-F score and EORTC questionnaires).RESULTS: No significant differences existed between the study groups at baseline assessment.After RT, there was a significant improvement in functional capacity (P<0.05) and a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokine levels (P>0.05) and fatigue (P<0.05) in the EG compared to the UG.Fatigue level was significantly higher in the UG (F[2.126]; P<0.05) after RT than before.Physical exercise had no effect on the correlation between inflammatory blood markers and functional capacity and fatigue scores provided by study participants.CONCLUSIONS: Regular, moderate-intensity physical exercise improves functional capacity, decreases the production of inflammatory markers and fatigue, and has a positive influence on QoL in high-risk PCa patients during RT.CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: This is one of the first studies to examine the effects of supervised exercise training on pro-inflammatory cytokine levels during RT in PCa patients by measuring functional capacity, fatigue, and QoL.",0,0,0,0
22795327,"Selected polymorphisms of GSTP1 and TERT were associated with glioma risk in Han Chinese.BACKGROUND: Current evidence suggests that a majority of the inherited risks play a major role in glioma susceptibility, and glioma is due to the co-inheritance of multiple low-risk variants.These variants can be identified through association studies including such as genome-wide association studies (GWAS), which has led the glioma epidemiology researchers to focus on identifying potential disease-causing factors.METHODS: We evaluated and validated 10 tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (tSNPs) in seven genes associated with glioma susceptibility in a Han Chinese population, including 301 glioma cases and 302 controls, using a multiplexed single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) MassEXTEND assay.We ascertained the genotypic frequencies for each tSNP in control subjects were within Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) using an exact test, and then compared the genotype and allele frequencies of glioma patients and control subjects using the chi2 test.We then applied three genetic models (dominant, recessive, and additive) using PLINK software to assess the association of each tSNP with glioma risk.RESULTS: We identified two tSNPs to be associated with glioma susceptibility (rs1695, GSTP1, P = 0.019; rs2853676, TERT, P = 0.039), which we confirmed using dominant and additive model analyses.The genotype &ldquo;GA&rdquo; for rs1695 was recognized to be a protective genotype for glioma (OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.47-0.96; P = 0.027), while the genotype &ldquo;AG&rdquo; for rs2853676 was shown to be a risk genotype for glioma (OR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.05-2.15; P = 0.025).CONCLUSION: Our results, and those from previous studies, suggest potential genetic contributes for GSTP1 and TERT in glioma development.",0,0,0,0

27130929,"Comparing Breast Cancer Multiparameter Tests in the OPTIMA Prelim Trial: No Test Is More Equal Than the Others.BACKGROUND: Previous reports identifying discordance between multiparameter tests at the individual patient level have been largely attributed to methodological shortcomings of multiple in silico studies.Comparisons between tests, when performed using actual diagnostic assays, have been predicted to demonstrate high degrees of concordance.OPTIMA prelim compared predicted risk stratification and subtype classification of different multiparameter tests performed directly on the same population.METHODS: Three hundred thirteen women with early breast cancer were randomized to standard (chemotherapy and endocrine therapy) or test-directed (chemotherapy if Oncotype DX recurrence score >25) treatment.Risk stratification was also determined with Prosigna (PAM50), MammaPrint, MammaTyper, NexCourse Breast (IHC4-AQUA), and conventional IHC4 (IHC4).Subtype classification was provided by Blueprint, MammaTyper, and Prosigna.RESULTS: Oncotype DX predicted a higher proportion of tumors as low risk (82.1%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 77.8% to 86.4%) than were predicted low/intermediate risk using Prosigna (65.5%, 95% CI = 60.1% to 70.9%), IHC4 (72.0%, 95% CI = 66.5% to 77.5%), MammaPrint (61.4%, 95% CI = 55.9% to 66.9%), or NexCourse Breast (61.6%, 95% CI = 55.8% to 67.4%).Strikingly, the five tests showed only modest agreement when dichotomizing results between high vs low/intermediate risk.Only 119 (39.4%) tumors were classified uniformly as either low/intermediate risk or high risk, and 183 (60.6%) were assigned to different risk categories by different tests, although 94 (31.1%) showed agreement between four of five tests.All three subtype tests assigned 59.5% to 62.4% of tumors to luminal A subtype, but only 121 (40.1%) were classified as luminal A by all three tests and only 58 (19.2%) were uniformly assigned as nonluminal A. Discordant subtyping was observed in 123 (40.7%) tumors.CONCLUSIONS: Existing evidence on the comparative prognostic information provided by different tests suggests that current multiparameter tests provide broadly equivalent risk information for the population of women with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancers.However, for the individual patient, tests may provide differing risk categorization and subtype information.",0,0,0,0
34082019,"Molecular determinants of clinical outcomes with pembrolizumab versus paclitaxel in a randomized, open-label, phase III trial in patients with gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma.BACKGROUND: In the phase III KEYNOTE-061 trial (NCT02370498), pembrolizumab did not significantly improve overall survival versus paclitaxel as second-line therapy for gastric/gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma with programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) combined positive score (CPS) >/=1 tumors.The association of tissue tumor mutational burden (tTMB) status and clinical outcomes was determined, including the relationship with CPS and microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) status.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In patients with whole exome sequencing (WES) data [420/592 (71%); pembrolizumab, 218; paclitaxel, 202], the association of tTMB with objective response rate (ORR; logistic regression), progression-free survival (PFS; Cox proportional hazards regression), and overall survival (OS; Cox proportional hazards regression) were measured using one-sided (pembrolizumab) and two-sided [paclitaxel] P values.tTMB was also evaluated using FoundationOne(R)CDx [205/592 (35%)].Prespecified equivalent cut-offs of 175 mut/exome for WES and 10 mut/Mb for FoundationOne(R)CDx were used.RESULTS: WES-tTMB was significantly associated with ORR, PFS, and OS in pembrolizumab-treated (all P < 0.001) but not paclitaxel-treated patients (all P > 0.6) in univariate analysis.The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve for WES-tTMB and response was 0.68 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.56-0.81] for pembrolizumab and 0.51 (95% CI 0.39-0.63) for paclitaxel in univariate analysis.There was low correlation between WES-tTMB and CPS in both treatment groups (r </= 0.16).WES-tTMB remained significantly associated with all clinical endpoints with pembrolizumab after adjusting for CPS and with PFS and OS after excluding known MSI-H tumors (n = 26).FoundationOne(R)CDx-tTMB demonstrated a positive association with ORR, PFS, and OS in pembrolizumab-treated patients (all P </= 0.003) but not PFS or OS in paclitaxel-treated patients (P > 0.1).CONCLUSION: This exploratory analysis from KEYNOTE-061 is the first to demonstrate a strong association between tTMB and efficacy with pembrolizumab but not paclitaxel in patients with gastric/GEJ adenocarcinoma in a randomized setting.Data further suggest tTMB is a significant and independent predictor beyond PD-L1 status.",1,1,1,1
29554321,"Robotic Radiosurgery for Brain Metastases Diagnosed With Either SPACE or MPRAGE Sequence (CYBER-SPACE)-A Single-Center Prospective Randomized Trial.BACKGROUND: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) of brain metastases (BM) is recommended in oligometastatic scenarios as a less toxic treatment alternative to whole-brain radiotherapy.Recent findings support SRS for patients with multiple (>3) BM.Furthermore, advances in MR imaging have facilitated the detection of very small BM, as advances in SRS technology have facilitated the highly conformal and simultaneous treatment of multiple target lesions.OBJECTIVE: To compare efficacy and toxicity of repeated frameless robotic SRS of up to 10 simultaneous BM through a single-center prospective randomized trial.METHODS: Two hundred patients will be randomized and receive imaging and treatment based on either the highly sensitive SPACE (sampling perfection with application optimized contrasts using different flip angle evolution) or the MPRAGE (magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo) magnetic resonance imaging sequence.If during follow-up new metastases are detected, treatment is repeated.The primary endpoint is reached when a patient develops more than 10 simultaneous new BM and is thus deemed unsuitable for further SRS.Overall survival will be assessed as secondary endpoint.Quality of life and neurocognition will be evaluated every 3 mo using CANTAB tests and EORTC (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer) questionnaires.EXPECTED OUTCOMES: We expect to show that repeated SRS based on sensitive imaging can delay intracranial dissemination while preserving neurocognitive function and quality of life.DISCUSSION: The present study is the first to prospectively assess the benefit of sensitive imaging and repeated stereotactic irradiation in the treatment of patients with multiple BM.It represents a novel approach, where in a palliative setting advanced technology in treatment and diagnostics is employed to improve tumor control while also reducing toxicity and preserving quality of life.",0,0,0,0

24963497,"Low-dose decitabine-based chemoimmunotherapy for patients with refractory advanced solid tumors: a phase I/II report.Aberrant DNA methylation is one of the main drivers of tumor initiation and progression.The reversibility of methylation modulation makes it an attractive target for novel anticancer therapies.Clinical studies have demonstrated that high-dose decitabine, a hypomethylating agent, results in some clinical benefits in patients with refractory advanced tumors; however, they are extremely toxic.Low doses of decitabine minimize toxicity while potentially improving the targeted effects of DNA hypomethylation.Based on these mechanisms, low-dose decitabine combined with chemoimmunotherapy may be a new treatment option for patients with refractory advanced tumors.We proposed the regimen of low-dose decitabine-based chemoimmunotherapy for patients with refractory advanced solid tumors.A favorable adverse event profile was observed in our trial that was highlighted by the finding that most of these adverse events were grades 1-2.Besides, the activity of our cohort was optimistic and the clinical benefit rate was up to 60%, and the median PFS was prolonged compared with PFS to previous treatment.We also identified a significant correlation between the PFS to previous treatment and clinical response.The low-dose DAC decitabine-based chemoimmunotherapy might be a promising protocol for improving the specificity and efficiency of patients with refractory advanced solid tumors.This trial is registered in the ClinicalTrials.gov database (identifier NCT01799083).",0,0,0,0

24296288,"Development of a new biochemical test to diagnose and monitor neuroblastoma in Vietnam: homovanillic and vanillylmandelic acid by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to develop an accurate robust testing method to simultaneously measure urine levels of HVA and VMA using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS) and to establish age-specific reference intervals of HVA and VMA in random urines for Vietnamese children.DESIGN AND METHODS: The assay for urinary HVA and VMA was developed based on a classical urinary organic acid profiling method.Briefly, this incorporated 3-phenyl butyric acid as the internal standard and liquid-liquid extraction with ethyl acetate followed by derivatization with BSTFA.The Agilent 7890A GC and 5975C Mass Selective Detector in single ion monitoring mode was used for analysis.Reference intervals were developed from random urine samples collected from 634 disease free Vietnamese children and compared to 50 known neuroblastoma patient samples.Results were reported relative to creatinine concentration.Age related 95% reference intervals for urinary HVA and VMA were estimated from sample quantiles.The analytes (expressed as analyte/creatinine ratios) diagnostic values were determined by calculating the related sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratios.RESULTS: HVA and VMA were linear to at least 193 and 221mumol/L, respectively.The limit of quantitation for both analytes was 0.9mumol/L. Using the bi-level control (n=15), the within-batch coefficients of variations (CVs) were less than 3% for both analytes across the assay range.The between-batch CVs (n=20 over three months), were 3.6% at 11mumol/L and 2.1% at 88mumol/L for HVA, 6.6% at 18.2mumol/L and 2.6% at 90.6mumol/L for VMA.Vietnamese age related reference intervals were established for urinary HVA and VMA per creatinine.HVA for children <6months (n=91) was 5.3-37.0mumol/mmol; 6months to <1year (n=141) was 2.7-27.7mumol/mmol; 1 to 5years (n=139) was 3.4-17.9mumol/mmol; 6 to 10years (n=136) was 2.7-8.8mumol/mmol; and 11 to 15years (n=127) was 1.1-9.4mumol/mmol.VMA for children <6months was 1.8-12.2mumol/mmol; 6months to <1year was 1.5-9.3mumol/mmol; 1 to 5years was 1.9-7.8mumol/mmol; 6 to 10years was 1.6-5.1mumol/mmol; and 11 to 15years was <0.9-6.3mumol/mmol.CONCLUSIONS: A robust testing method for simultaneous quantitation of urinary HVA and VMA by GCMS was developed.This method is accurate, precise and fit for its clinical purpose and suitable for developing countries.Age-related reference intervals of urinary HVA and VMA were established for Vietnamese children and the intervals declined progressively with increasing age for each analyte.",0,0,0,0

Canadian Cancer Trials Group (CCTG) IND.219.INTRODUCTION: Activation of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway may confer resistance to chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Selumetinib (AZD6244, ARRY142886), a MEK1/2 inhibitor combined with chemotherapy in patients with NSCLC was evaluated in two schedules to evaluate efficacy and toxicity.METHODS: IND.219 was a three-arm study of first line pemetrexed/platinum chemotherapy with two schedules of selumetinib (Arm A: intermittent given on days 2-19; Arm B: continuous given on days 1-21) versus chemotherapy alone (Arm C).The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR); secondary objectives were tolerability, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS).The trial was stopped at the planned interim analysis.RESULTS: Arms A/B/C enrolled 20/21/21 patients, ORR was 35% (95% CI 15-59% median duration 3.8 months), 62% (95% CI 38-82%; median duration 6.3 months), 24% (95% CI 8-47%; median duration 11.6 months) respectively.The PFS (months Arm A, B, C) was 7.5, 6.7, 4.0 respectively (hazard ratio (HR) PFS Arm A over Arm C: 0.76 [95% CI, 0.38-1.51, 2-sided p = 0.42]; Arm B over Arm C 0.75 [95% CI 0.37-1.54, p = 0.43].Skin and gastrointestinal adverse events were more common with the addition of selumetinib.A high incidence of venous thromboembolism was seen in all arms.CONCLUSIONS: Selumetinib combined with chemotherapy was associated with a higher response rate.Continuous selumetinib appeared to be superior to an intermittent schedule.PFS was prolonged with the addition of selumetinib, however this was not statistically significant.",1,1,1,1
33207094,"First-Line Lorlatinib or Crizotinib in Advanced ALK-Positive Lung Cancer.BACKGROUND: Lorlatinib, a third-generation inhibitor of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), has antitumor activity in previously treated patients with ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).The efficacy of lorlatinib, as compared with that of crizotinib, as first-line treatment for advanced ALK-positive NSCLC is unclear.METHODS: We conducted a global, randomized, phase 3 trial comparing lorlatinib with crizotinib in 296 patients with advanced ALK-positive NSCLC who had received no previous systemic treatment for metastatic disease.The primary end point was progression-free survival as assessed by blinded independent central review.Secondary end points included independently assessed objective response and intracranial response.An interim analysis of efficacy was planned after approximately 133 of 177 (75%) expected events of disease progression or death had occurred.RESULTS: The percentage of patients who were alive without disease progression at 12 months was 78% (95% confidence interval [CI], 70 to 84) in the lorlatinib group and 39% (95% CI, 30 to 48) in the crizotinib group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.19 to 0.41; P<0.001).An objective response occurred in 76% (95% CI, 68 to 83) of the patients in the lorlatinib group and 58% (95% CI, 49 to 66) of those in the crizotinib group; among those with measurable brain metastases, 82% (95% CI, 57 to 96) and 23% (95% CI, 5 to 54), respectively, had an intracranial response, and 71% of the patients who received lorlatinib had an intracranial complete response.The most common adverse events with lorlatinib were hyperlipidemia, edema, increased weight, peripheral neuropathy, and cognitive effects.Lorlatinib was associated with more grade 3 or 4 adverse events (mainly altered lipid levels) than crizotinib (in 72% vs. 56%).Discontinuation of treatment because of adverse events occurred in 7% and 9% of the patients, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: In an interim analysis of results among patients with previously untreated advanced ALK-positive NSCLC, those who received lorlatinib had significantly longer progression-free survival and a higher frequency of intracranial response than those who received crizotinib.The incidence of grade 3 or 4 adverse events was higher with lorlatinib than with crizotinib because of the frequent occurrence of altered lipid levels.(Funded by Pfizer; CROWN ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03052608.).",1,1,1,1
29864379,"Improvement in Overall Survival in a Randomized Study That Compared Dacomitinib With Gefitinib in Patients With Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer and EGFR-Activating Mutations.Purpose ARCHER 1050, a randomized, open-label, phase III study of dacomitinib versus gefitinib in treatment-naive patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and activating mutations in EGFR, reported significant improvement in progression-free survival with dacomitinib.The mature overall survival (OS) analysis for the intention-to-treat population is presented here.Patients and Methods In this multinational, multicenter study, patients age 18 years or older (>/= 20 years in Japan and Korea) who had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 and newly diagnosed NSCLC with activating mutations in EGFR (exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R) were enrolled and randomly assigned in a 1:1 manner to dacomitinib (n = 227) or gefitinib (n = 225).Random assignment was stratified by race (Japanese, Chinese, other East Asian, or non-Asian) and EGFR mutation type.The final OS analysis was conducted with a data cutoff date of February 17, 2017; at that time 220 deaths (48.7%) were observed.Results During a median follow-up time of 31.3 months, 103 (45.4%) and 117 (52.0%) deaths occurred in the dacomitinib and gefitinib arms, respectively.The estimated hazard ratio for OS was 0.760 (95% CI, 0.582 to 0.993; two-sided P = .044).The median OS was 34.1 months with dacomitinib versus 26.8 months with gefitinib.The OS probabilities at 30 months were 56.2% and 46.3% with dacomitinib and gefitinib, respectively.Preliminary subgroup analyses for OS that are based on baseline characteristics were consistent with the primary OS analysis.Conclusion In patients with advanced NSCLC and EGFR activating mutations, dacomitinib is the first second-generation epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) to show significant improvement in OS in a phase III randomized study compared with a standard-of-care TKI.Dacomitinib should be considered one of the standard treatment options for these patients.",1,1,1,1
30522967,"Regorafenib compared with lomustine in patients with relapsed glioblastoma (REGOMA): a multicentre, open-label, randomised, controlled, phase 2 trial.BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma is a highly vascularised tumour and there are few treatment options after disease recurrence.Regorafenib is an oral multikinase inhibitor of angiogenic, stromal, and oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinases.We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of regorafenib in the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma.METHODS: REGOMA is a randomised, multicentre, open-label phase 2 trial done in ten centres in Italy.Eligible patients (aged >/=18 years) with histologically confirmed glioblastoma, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 or 1, and documented disease progression after surgery followed by radiotherapy and temozolomide chemoradiotherapy were randomly assigned (1:1) by a web-based system, stratified by centre and surgery at recurrence (yes vs no), to receive regorafenib 160 mg once daily for the first 3 weeks of each 4-week cycle or lomustine 110 mg/m(2) once every 6 weeks until disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicity, or consent withdrawal.The primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population.This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02926222, and is currently in follow-up.FINDINGS: Between Nov 27, 2015, and Feb 23, 2017, 124 patients were screened and 119 eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive regorafenib (n=59) or lomustine (n=60).Median follow-up was 15.4 months (IQR 13.8-18.1).At the analysis cutoff date, 99 (83%) of 119 patients had died: 42 (71%) of 59 in the regorafenib group and 57 (95%) of 60 in the lomustine group.Overall survival was significantly improved in the regorafenib group compared with the lomustine group, with a median overall survival of 7.4 months (95% CI 5.8-12.0) in the regorafenib group and 5.6 months (4.7-7.3) in the lomustine group (hazard ratio 0.50, 95% CI 0.33-0.75; log-rank p=0.0009).Grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 33 (56%) of 59 patients treated with regorafenib and 24 (40%) of 60 with lomustine.The most frequent grade 3 or 4 adverse events related to regorafenib were hand-foot skin reaction, increased lipase, and blood bilirubin increased (in six [10%] of 59 patients each).In the lomustine group, the most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were decreased platelet count (eight [13%] of 60 patients), decreased lymphocyte count (eight [13%]), and neutropenia (seven [12%]).No death was considered by the investigators to be drug related.INTERPRETATION: REGOMA showed an encouraging overall survival benefit of regorafenib in recurrent glioblastoma.This drug might be a new potential treatment for these patients and should be investigated in an adequately powered phase 3 study.FUNDING: Veneto Institute of Oncology and Bayer Italy.",1,1,1,0

25975527,"Clip closure of defect after endoscopic resection in patients with larger colorectal tumors decreased the adverse events.BACKGROUND: Clip closure of large colorectal mucosal defects may reduce the rate of adverse events in a cost-effective manner.OBJECTIVE: To assess the adverse events and outcomes of clip closure of defects after endoscopic resection in patients with large colorectal tumors.DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, controlled study.SETTING: Single tertiary referral center.PATIENTS AND INTERVENTIONS: Patients with lesions measuring 1 to 4 cm who were scheduled for endoscopic resection between March 2012 and December 2014 were randomly assigned to a clip-closure group and a no-closure group.In the clip-closure group, the defect of the resection site was completely closed with an endoclip.In the no-closure group, the defect was left open.The following primary outcome measures were assessed: delayed postoperative bleeding, postpolypectomy coagulation syndrome, perforation, and abdominal pain.Secondary outcome measures of length of hospital stay, time required for procedure, and patient's satisfaction were also assessed.RESULTS: Patients and lesions had similar characteristics across both groups.For patients who underwent clip closure (n = 174), the rates of delayed postoperative bleeding (1.1% [2/174]) and postpolypectomy coagulation syndrome (0.6% [1/174]) were lower than those in the no-closure group (6.9% [12/174], P = .01 and 4.6% [8/174], P = .03).Two patients experienced perforation, 1 in each group.In the clip-closure group, 4 patients reported abdominal pain as opposed to 26 in the no-closure group (2.8% vs 16.7%, P < .01).The procedure took longer in the closure group (38.1 minutes vs 30.9 minutes, P = .04).The length of hospitalization was shorter in the closure group (3.1 days vs 4.7 days, P = .03).Total medical expense was similar between the 2 groups.Patients who underwent closure reported greater satisfaction.LIMITATION: This was a single-center analysis.CONCLUSIONS: Clip closure of endoscopic resection defects in patients with large colorectal tumors decreased the rate of procedure-related adverse events and did not increase the cost of hospitalization.",1,1,1,0
33539944,"A phase II randomized trial of cobimetinib plus chemotherapy, with or without atezolizumab, as first-line treatment for patients with locally advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (COLET): primary analysis.BACKGROUND: Resistance to standard chemotherapy in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) is associated with upregulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway.Cobimetinib, an MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK) inhibitor, may increase sensitivity to taxanes and programmed death-ligand 1 inhibitors.COLET is a three-cohort phase II study evaluating first-line cobimetinib plus chemotherapy, with or without atezolizumab, in patients with locally advanced or mTNBC.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were >/=18 years with locally advanced or mTNBC.Following a safety run-in, patients in cohort I were randomized 1:1 to cobimetinib (60 mg, D3-D23 of each 28-day cycle) or placebo, plus paclitaxel (80 mg/m(2), D1, 8, and 15).Additional patients were randomized (1:1) to cohort II or III to receive cobimetinib plus atezolizumab (840 mg, D1 and D15) and either paclitaxel (cohort II) or nab-paclitaxel [cohort III (100 mg/m(2), D1, D8, and D15)].Primary endpoints were investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) (cohort I) and confirmed objective response rate (ORR) (cohorts II/III).Safety and tolerability were also assessed.RESULTS: In the expansion stages, median PFS was 5.5 months for cobimetinib/paclitaxel versus 3.8 months for placebo/paclitaxel in cohort I [hazard ratio 0.73; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.43-1.24; P = 0.25].In cohort I, ORR was 38.3% (95% CI 24.40-52.20) for cobimetinib/paclitaxel and 20.9% (95% CI 8.77-33.09) for placebo/paclitaxel; ORRs in cohorts II and III were 34.4% (95% CI 18.57-53.19) and 29.0% (95% CI 14.22-48.04), respectively.Diarrhea was the most common grade >/=3 adverse events across all cohorts.CONCLUSIONS: Cobimetinib added to paclitaxel did not lead to a statistically significant increase in PFS or ORR, although a nonsignificant trend toward a numerical increase was observed.Cobimetinib plus atezolizumab and a taxane did not appear to increase ORR.This demonstrates the potential activity of a combinatorial MEK inhibitor, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy in this difficult-to-treat population.",1,1,1,1
24105720,"Treatment trade-offs in myeloma: A survey of consecutive patients about contemporary maintenance strategies.BACKGROUND: Two randomized trials have demonstrated improved progression-free survival (PFS) with lenalidomide maintenance after autologous transplantation for multiple myeloma (MM).Overall survival (OS) results are conflicting, and quality-of-life (QOL) data are lacking.The authors conducted a systematic survey of patients with MM regarding what constitutes a meaningful benefit that would make burdens of maintenance treatments (toxicity and cost) acceptable.METHODS: A self-administered survey was mailed to 1159 consecutive, living patients who were evaluated at Mayo Clinic.The survey provided background information on the standard of care for MM and data on maintenance.Patients were asked to estimate the magnitude of OS benefit that would be acceptable for various degrees of toxicity and cost.RESULTS: Of 1159 surveys sent, 886 patients (83.2%) responded, and 736 patients returned a completed survey (66% raw response rate).The most worrisome potential toxicity was identified as peripheral neuropathy by 27% of patients, cytopenias by 24%, deep vein thrombosis by 20%, fatigue by 15%, nausea by 8%, and diarrhea/constipation by 7%.If treatment was free, had no toxicity, and the OS benefit was </=1 year, then 49% of patients indicated that they would choose maintenance; with moderate toxicity, this proportion decreased to 42%.Adding a treatment cost of $25 per month decreased the proportion that would choose maintenance to 39% of patients.CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicated that willingness to receive maintenance treatment declined when actual benefits were provided in concrete numeric terms compared with a general statement of PFS benefit.The authors also observed that the magnitude of benefit required to consider maintenance was affected by cost and toxicity.",0,0,0,0
34304292,"Improvements in strength and agility measures of functional fitness following a telehealth-delivered home-based exercise intervention in endometrial cancer survivors.PURPOSE: Endometrial cancer is strongly linked to obesity and inactivity; however, increased physical activity has important benefits even in the absence of weight loss.Resistance (strength) training can deliver these benefits; yet few women participate in resistance exercise.The purpose of this study was to describe both physiological and functional changes following a home-based strength training intervention.METHODS: Forty post-treatment endometrial cancer survivors within 5 years of diagnosis were enrolled in a pilot randomized trial, comparing twice-weekly home-based strength exercise to wait list control.Participants conducted the exercises twice per week for 10 supervised weeks with 5 weeks of follow-up.Measures included DXA-measured lean mass, functional fitness assessments, blood biomarkers, and quality of life outcomes.RESULTS: On average, participants were 60.9 years old (SD = 8.7) with BMI of 39.9 kg/m(2) (SD = 15.2).At baseline, participants had 51.2% (SD = 6.0) body fat, which was not different between groups.Improvements were seen in the 30-s chair sit to stand (d = .99), the 30-s arm curl (d = .91), and the 8-ft up-and-go test (d = .63).No changes were measured for HbA1c or C-reactive protein.No changes were observed for flexibility (chair sit and reach, back scratch tests), 6-min walk test, maximum handgrip test, anxiety, depression, fatigue, or self-efficacy for exercise.CONCLUSIONS: Home-based muscle-strengthening exercise led to favorable and clinically relevant improvements in 3 of 7 physical function assessments.Physical function, body composition, blood biomarkers, and patient-reported outcomes were feasible to measure.These fitness improvements were observed over a relatively short time frame of 10 weeks.",0,0,0,0

26202595,"Randomized phase II study evaluating veliparib (ABT-888) with temozolomide in patients with metastatic melanoma.BACKGROUND: Veliparib (ABT-888) is a potent, orally bioavailable, small-molecule inhibitor of the DNA repair enzymes poly ADP-ribose polymerase-1 and -2.Veliparib enhances the efficacy of temozolomide (TMZ) and other cytotoxic agents in preclinical tumor models.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this multicenter, double-blind trial, adults with unresectable stage III or IV metastatic melanoma were randomized 1:1:1 to TMZ plus veliparib 20 or 40 mg, or placebo twice daily.Efficacy end points included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and objective response rate (ORR).RESULTS: Patients (N = 346) were randomized between February 2009 and January 2010.Median [95% confidence interval (CI)] PFS was 3.7 (3.0-5.5), 3.6 (1.9-4.1), and 2 (1.9-3.7) months in the 20-mg, 40-mg, and placebo arms, respectively.Median (95% CI) OS was 10.8 (9.0-13.1), 13.6 (11.4-15.9), and 12.9 (9.8-14.3) months, respectively; ORR was 10.3%, 8.7%, and 7.0%.Exploratory analyses showed patients with low ERCC1 expression had longer PFS when TMZ was combined with veliparib.Toxicities were as expected for TMZ.The frequencies of thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and leukopenia were significantly increased in the veliparib groups.Grade 3 or 4 adverse events, mainly hematologic toxicities, were seen in 55%, 63%, and 41% of patients in the 20-mg, 40-mg, and placebo arms, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Median PFS with 20 and 40 mg veliparib almost doubled numerically compared with placebo, but the improvements did not reach statistical significance.OS was not increased with veliparib.Toxicities were similar to TMZ monotherapy, but with increased frequency.",1,1,1,1
27981431,"Adjusting Overall Survival Estimates after Treatment Switching: a Case Study in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.BACKGROUND: If patients in oncology trials receive subsequent therapy, standard intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses may inaccurately estimate the overall survival (OS) effect of the investigational product.In this context, a post-hoc analysis of the phase 3 PREVAIL study was performed with the aim to compare enzalutamide with placebo in terms of OS, adjusting for potential confounding from switching to antineoplastic therapies that are not part of standard metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) treatment pathways in some jurisdictions.METHODS: The PREVAIL study, which included 1717 chemotherapy-naive men with mCRPC randomized to treatment with enzalutamide 160 mg/day or placebo, was stopped after a planned interim survival analysis revealed a benefit in favor of enzalutamide.Data from this cutoff point were confounded by switching from both arms and so were evaluated in terms of OS using two switching adjustment methods: the two-stage accelerated failure time model (two-stage method) and inverse probability of censoring weights (IPCW).RESULTS: Following adjustment for switching to nonstandard antineoplastic therapies by 14.8 (129/872 patients) and 21.3% (180/845 patients) of patients initially randomized to enzalutamide and placebo, respectively, the two-stage and IPCW methods both resulted in numerical reductions in the hazard ratio (HR) for OS [HR 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57-0.81 and HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.52-0.75, respectively] for enzalutamide compared to placebo versus the unadjusted ITT analysis (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.60-0.84).These results suggest a slightly greater effect of enzalutamide on OS than originally reported.CONCLUSION: In the PREVAIL study, switching to nonstandard antineoplastic mCRPC therapies resulted in the ITT analysis of primary data underestimating the benefit of enzalutamide on OS.",1,1,1,1
31125276,"Palbociclib Plus Letrozole as First-Line Therapy in Postmenopausal Asian Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer: Results From the Phase III, Randomized PALOMA-2 Study.PURPOSE: In PALOMA-2, palbociclib plus letrozole significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) as initial treatment of estrogen receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative advanced breast cancer.We assessed the benefit of palbociclib plus letrozole in Asians.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Of 666 enrolled postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative advanced breast cancer (no prior treatment of advanced disease), 95 were Asian.Patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive palbociclib plus letrozole or placebo plus letrozole.The primary end point was investigator-assessed PFS.Secondary end points were overall survival, objective response, patient-reported outcomes, pharmacokinetics, and safety.RESULTS: Median PFS was significantly longer in Asian patients who received palbociclib plus letrozole versus placebo plus letrozole (25.7 months [95% CI, 19.2 months to not estimable] v 13.9 months [95% CI, 7.4 to 22.0 months]; hazard ratio, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.87; P = .007).The most common toxicities with palbociclib were hematologic and more frequent among Asians versus non-Asians: neutropenia (any grade, 95.4% v 76.8%; grade 3/4, 89.2% v 62.5%), leukopenia (43.1% v 38.3%; 32.3% v 23.5%), and thrombocytopenia (27.7% v 13.5%; 4.6% v 1.1%).No Asians had febrile neutropenia.Discontinuation rates as a result of adverse events were similar among Asian and non-Asian patients who received palbociclib plus letrozole (10.8% and 9.5%).In Asians, quality of life (QOL) was maintained with no significant differences observed between treatments from baseline in breast cancer-specific QOL and general health status scores.Change from baseline in EuroQol five dimensions index scores was significantly higher with palbociclib plus letrozole (0.013 v -0.069; P = .0132).Geometric mean palbociclib trough concentration values were higher in Asians versus non-Asians (93.8 v 61.7 ng/mL).CONCLUSION: Consistent with the overall study population, the addition of palbociclib to letrozole significantly improved PFS in Asians.Hematologic toxicities were more frequent in Asians versus non-Asians but manageable with early dose modifications while maintaining QOL.",1,1,1,1
30160789,"Multicenter randomized trial of arsenic trioxide and Realgar-Indigo naturalis formula in pediatric patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia: Interim results of the SCCLG-APL clinical study.Intravenous arsenic trioxide (ATO) has been adopted as the first-line treatment for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL).Another arsenic compound named the Realgar-Indigo naturalis formula (RIF), an oral traditional Chinese medicine containing As4 S4 , has been shown to be highly effective in treating adult APL.In the treatment of pediatric APL, the safety and efficacy of RIF remains to be confirmed.This randomized, multicenter, and noninferiority trial was conducted to determine whether intravenous ATO can be substituted by oral RIF in the treatment of pediatric APL.From September 2011 to January 2017, among 92 patients who were 16 years old or younger with newly diagnosed PML-RARa positive APL, 82 met eligible criteria and were randomly assigned to ATO (n = 42) or RIF (n = 40) group.The remaining 10 patients did not fulfilled eligible criteria because five did not accept randomization, four died and one had hemiplegia prior to arsenic randomization due to intracranial hemorrhage or cerebral thrombosis.Induction and consolidation treatment contained ATO or RIF, all-trans-retinoic acid and low intensity chemotherapy.End points included event-free survival (EFS), adverse events and hospital days.After a median 3-year follow-up, the estimated 5-year EFS was 100% in both groups, and adverse events were mild.However, patients in the RIF group had significantly less hospital stay than those in the ATO group.This interim analysis shows that oral RIF is as effective and safe as intravenous ATO for the treatment of pediatric APL, with the advantage of reducing hospital stay.Final trial analysis will reveal mature outcome data.",1,1,1,1
24231627,"Docetaxel or pemetrexed with or without cetuximab in recurrent or progressive non-small-cell lung cancer after platinum-based therapy: a phase 3, open-label, randomised trial.BACKGROUND: Available preclinical and phase 2 clinical data suggest that the addition of cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody directed against the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), to chemotherapy might improve outcome in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).We aimed to assess whether the addition of cetuximab to chemotherapy improved progression-free survival in patients with recurrent or progressive NSCLC after platinum-based therapy.METHODS: In this unmasked, open-label randomised phase 3 trial we enrolled patients with metastatic, unresectable, or locally advanced NSCLC from 121 sites in Canada and the USA.Eligible patients were those aged 18 years or older who had experienced progressive disease during or after one previous platinum-based regimen.Initially, patients were randomly assigned to receive either pemetrexed (500 mg/m(2)) or docetaxel (75 mg/m(2)) and then randomly assigned within each group to receive their chemotherapy with or without cetuximab (400 mg/m(2) at first dose and 250 mg/m(2) weekly thereafter) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.However, after a change in the standard of care, investigators chose whether to treat with pemetrexed or docetaxel on a patient-by-patient basis.The primary analysis was changed to compare progression-free survival with cetuximab plus pemetrexed versus pemetrexed, on an intention-to-treat basis.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00095199.FINDINGS: Between Jan 10, 2005, and Feb 10, 2010, we enrolled 939 patients; data for one patient was accidentally discarded.Of the remaining 938 patients, 605 received pemetrexed (301 patients with cetuximab and 304 alone) and 333 received docetaxel (167 in combination with cetuximab and 166 alone).Median progression-free survival with cetuximab plus pemetrexed was 2.9 months (95% CI 2.7-3.2) versus 2.8 months (2.5-3.3) with pemetrexed (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.87-1.21; p=0.76).The most common grade 3-4 adverse events with cetuximab plus pemetrexed were fatigue (33 [11%] of 292 patients), acneiform rash (31 [11%]), dyspnoea (29 [10%]), and decreased neutrophil count (28 [10%]), and with pemetrexed alone were dyspnoea (35 [12%] of 289 patients), decreased neutrophil count (26 [9%]), and fatigue (23 [8%]).A significantly higher proportion of patients in the cetuximab plus pemetrexed group (119 [41%] of 292 patients) experienced at least one serious adverse event than those patients in the pemetrexed group (85 [29%] of 289 patients; p=0.0054).Nine (3%) of 292 treated patients in the cetuximab and pemetrexed group died of adverse events compared with five (2%) of 289 treated patients in the pemetrexed alone group.INTERPRETATION: The use of cetuximab is not recommended in combination with chemotherapy in patients previously treated with platinum-based therapy.FUNDING: Eli Lilly and Company and ImClone Systems LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Eli Lilly and Company.",0,0,0,0
29070044,"Neoadjuvant everolimus plus letrozole versus fluorouracil, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide for ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer: study protocol for a randomized pilot trial.BACKGROUND: The response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) varies by estrogen receptor (ER) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) statuses, with responses being lower in ER-positive, HER2-negative tumors as compared with ER-negative, HER2-positive or triple-negative tumors.Neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (NET) is an attractive alternative to NAC for ER-positive, HER2-negative cancer.However, a prior trial comparing NET with standard NAC in ER-positive tumor showed that the difference of response was not significant.Studies demonstrated that the mTOR inhibitor everolimus could sensitize breast tumors to endocrine therapy.A pilot open-label, randomized trial has been designed to evaluate the feasibility, efficacy and tolerability of neoadjuvant everolimus plus letrozole versus NAC in treating postmenopausal women with ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer.METHODS: Forty postmenopausal women with non-metastatic ER-positive, HER2-negative invasive breast cancer with a primary tumor > 2 cm or positive axillary lymph node(s) proved by biopsy will be randomly (1:1) enrolled from Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital to receive neoadjuvant everolimus plus letrozole for 18 weeks or fluorouracil, epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide (FEC) for six cycles before surgery.Primary outcome is the feasibility of the trial.Secondary outcome measures include ultrasound response rate, pathological complete response rate, breast-conserving surgery rate, toxicities, and changes in the percentages of peripheral blood CD4(+) T cells, CD8(+) T cells, T helper cells, regulatory T cells, and NK cells.DISCUSSION: This is the first study to determine the feasibility, efficacy and tolerability of head-to-head neoadjuvant everolimus plus letrozole versus neoadjuvant FEC in treating postmenopausal women with ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer.The trial will provide evidence to assess the feasibility of a future multicenter, randomized controlled trial, and will provide valuable clinical data of the immunoregulatory effect of everolimus in breast cancer.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov registry, ID: NCT02742051 .Registered on 7 April 2016.",1,1,1,1

Mean day 43 Cmin in Arm A was ~37% lower than that seen in metastatic breast cancer.The safety profiles were similar between arms and treatment was well tolerated.Partial responses were achieved by 86% and 55% of patients in Arms A and B, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the pharmacokinetic and safety data, the 840 mg q3w pertuzumab dose has been selected for a phase III study of pertuzumab, trastuzumab and chemotherapy in HER2-positive aGC.",1,1,1,1
30902613,"Updated Efficacy and Safety Data and Impact of the EML4-ALK Fusion Variant on the Efficacy of Alectinib in Untreated ALK-Positive Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer in the Global Phase III ALEX Study.INTRODUCTION: At the prior data cutoff (February 9, 2017) the ALEX trial showed superior investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) for alectinib versus crizotinib in untreated, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive, advanced NSCLC (hazard ratio = 0.47, 95% confidence interval: 0.34-0.65, p < 0.001).The median PFS in the alectinib arm was not reached versus 11.1 months with crizotinib.Retrospective analyses suggest that the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 gene-ALK variant (EML4-ALK) may influence ALK-inhibitor treatment benefit.We present updated analyses, including exploratory subgroup analysis by EML4-ALK variant, after an additional 10 months' follow-up (cutoff December 1, 2017).METHODS: Patients were randomized to receive twice-daily alectinib, 600 mg, or crizotinib, 250 mg, until disease progression, toxicity, death, or withdrawal.PFS was determined by the investigators.Baseline plasma and tissue biomarker samples were analyzed by using hybrid-capture, next-generation sequencing to determine EML4-ALK variant.RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were balanced.Investigator-assessed PFS was prolonged with alectinib (stratified hazard ratio = 0.43, 95% confidence interval: 0.32-0.58).The median PFS times were 34.8 months with alectinib and 10.9 months with crizotinib.EML4-ALK fusions were detectable in 129 patient plasma samples and 124 tissue samples; variants 1, 2, and 3/ab did not affect PFS, objective response rate, or duration of response.Investigator-assessed PFS was longer for alectinib than for crizotinib across EML4-ALK variants 1, 2, and 3a/b in plasma and tissue.Despite longer treatment duration (27.0 months in the case of alectinib versus 10.8 months in the case of crizotinib), the safety of alectinib compared favorably with that of crizotinib.CONCLUSION: Alectinib continues to demonstrate superior investigator-assessed PFS versus crizotinib in untreated ALK-positive NSCLC, irrespective of EML4-ALK variant.",1,1,1,1

26014129,"BCG+MMC trial: adding mitomycin C to BCG as adjuvant intravesical therapy for high-risk, non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer: a randomised phase III trial (ANZUP 1301).BACKGROUND: Despite adequate trans-urethral resection of the bladder tumour (TURBT), non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) is associated with high rates of recurrence and progression.Instillation of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) into the urinary bladder after TURBT (adjuvant intravesical administration) reduces the risk of both recurrence and progression, and this is therefore the standard of care for high-risk tumours.However, over 30 % of people still recur or progress despite optimal delivery of BCG.Our meta-analysis suggests that outcomes might be improved further by using an adjuvant intravesical regimen that includes both mitomycin and BCG.These promising findings require corroboration in a definitive, large scale, randomised phase III trial using standard techniques for intravesical administration.METHODS AND DESIGN: The BCG + MMC trial (ANZUP 1301) is an open-label, randomised, stratified, two-arm multi-centre phase III trial comparing the efficacy and safety of standard intravesical therapy (BCG alone) against experimental intravesical therapy (BCG and mitomycin) in the treatment of adults with resected, high-risk NMIBC.Participants in the control group receive standard treatment with induction (weekly BCG for six weeks) followed by maintenance (four-weekly BCG for ten months).Participants in the experimental group receive induction (BCG weeks 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8; mitomycin weeks 3, 6, and 9) followed by four-weekly maintenance (mitomycin weeks 13, 17, 25, 29, 37, and 41; BCG weeks 21, 33, and 45).The trial aims to include 500 participants who will be centrally randomised to one of the two treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio stratified by T-stage, presence of CIS, and study site.The primary endpoint is disease-free survival; secondary endpoints are disease activity, time to recurrence, time to progression, safety, health-related quality of life, overall survival, feasibility, and resource use.TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ( ACTRN12613000513718 ).",0,0,0,0
23374147,"Immunomodulatory effects of total intravenous and balanced inhalation anesthesia in patients with bladder cancer undergoing elective radical cystectomy: preliminary results.BACKGROUND: Although surgery and anesthesia induce immunesuppression, remains largely unknown whether various anesthetic techniques have different immunosuppressive effects on cancer patients.Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the influence of total intravenous anesthesia with target-controlled infusion (TIVA-TCI) and balanced inhalation anesthesia (BAL) on the peri-operative levels of inflammatory cytokines and regulatory T cells (Tregs) in patients with bladder cancer undergoing surgery.METHODS: Twenty eight consecutive patients with bladder cancer who underwent radical cystectomy were prospectively randomized into two groups to receive TIVA-TCI (n = 14) or BAL (n = 14).Before the induction of anesthesia (T0), 6-8 hours (T1) post-surgery, and 5 days post-surgery (T2), Tregs and serum levels of interleukin -1beta (IL-1beta), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin -2 (IL-2), interleukin -6 (IL-6), and interleukin -10 (IL-10) were measured.RESULTS: In the peri-operative period all cancer patients showed a marked and significant increase in IL-6.Moreover, TIVA-TCI patients also showed a higher increase in IFN-gamma, whereas in BAL patients Tregs were reduced by approximately 30% during surgery.The incidence of infections, metastases, and death was similar in both groups.CONCLUSIONS: The increase in the Th1 response in the TIVA-TCI group and the reduction in Tregs in the BAL group seem to balance the immunosuppressive effect induced by IL-6.Therefore TIVA-TCI and BAL can be both used in major surgery in patients with bladder cancer without worsening the outcome.",0,0,0,0
34021033,"Randomized phase II trial of lymphodepletion plus adoptive cell transfer of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, with or without dendritic cell vaccination, in patients with metastatic melanoma.BACKGROUND: The adoptive transfer of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) has demonstrated robust efficacy in metastatic melanoma patients.Tumor antigen-loaded dendritic cells (DCs) are believed to optimally activate antigen-specific T lymphocytes.We hypothesized that the combined transfer of TIL, containing a melanoma antigen recognized by T cells 1 (MART-1) specific population, with MART-1-pulsed DC will result in enhanced proliferation and prolonged survival of transferred MART-1 specific T cells in vivo ultimately leading to improved clinical responses.DESIGN: We tested the combination of TIL and DC in a phase II clinical trial of patients with advanced stage IV melanoma.HLA-A0201 patients whose early TIL cultures demonstrated reactivity to MART-1 peptide were randomly assigned to receive TIL alone or TIL +DC pulsed with MART-1 peptide.The primary endpoint was to evaluate the persistence of MART-1 TIL in the two arms.Secondary endpoints were to evaluate clinical response and survival.RESULTS: Ten patients were given TIL alone while eight patients received TIL+DC vaccine.Infused MART-1 reactive CD8(+) TIL were tracked in the blood over time by flow cytometry and results show good persistence in both arms, with no difference in the persistence of MART-1 between the two arms.The objective response rate was 30% (3/10) in the TIL arm and 50% (4/8) in the TIL+DC arm.All treatments were well tolerated.CONCLUSIONS: The combination of TIL +DC showed no difference in the persistence of MART-1 TIL compared with TIL therapy alone.Although more patients showed a clinical response to TIL+DC therapy, this study was not powered to resolve differences between groups.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT00338377.",1,1,1,1
34856936,"Avelumab as neoadjuvant therapy in patients with urothelial non-metastatic muscle invasive bladder cancer: a multicenter, randomized, non-comparative, phase II study (Oncodistinct 004 - AURA trial).INTRODUCTION: Cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) followed by surgery is the standard treatment for patients with non-metastatic muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC).Unfortunately, many patients are not candidates to receive cisplatin due to renal impairment.Additionally, no predictive biomarkers for pathological complete response (pCR) are currently validated in clinical practice.Studies evaluating immune checkpoint inhibitors in the peri-operative setting are emerging with promising results.Clinical trials are clearly required in the neoadjuvant setting in order to improve therapeutic strategies.METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Oncodistinct 004 - AURA is an ongoing multicenter phase II randomized trial assessing the efficacy and safety of avelumab single-agent or combined to different NAC regimens in patients with non-metastatic MIBC.Patients are enrolled in two distinct cohorts according to their eligibility to receive cisplatin-based NAC.In the cisplatin eligible cohort, patients are randomized in a 1:1 fashion to receive avelumab combined with cisplatin-gemcitabine or with dose-dense methotrexate-vinblastine-doxorubicin-cisplatin.In the cisplatin ineligible cohort, patients are randomized at a 1:1 ratio to paclitaxel-gemcitabine associated to avelumab or avelumab alone.Primary endpoint is pCR.Secondary endpoints are pathological response and safety.ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study is approved by ethics committee from all participating centers.All participants provide informed consent prior inclusion to the study.Once completed, results will be published in peer-reviewed journals.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03674424).",0,0,0,0

26822398,"Afatinib plus vinorelbine versus trastuzumab plus vinorelbine in patients with HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer who had progressed on one previous trastuzumab treatment (LUX-Breast 1): an open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Trastuzumab resistance is a key therapeutic challenge in metastatic breast cancer.We postulated that broader inhibition of ErbB receptors with afatinib would improve clinical outcomes compared with HER2 inhibition alone in patients who had progressed on previous trastuzumab treatment.LUX-Breast 1 compared afatinib plus vinorelbine with trastuzumab plus vinorelbine for such patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.METHODS: We did this open-label trial at 350 hospitals in 41 countries worldwide.We enrolled female patients with HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer who had progressed on or following adjuvant trastuzumab or first-line treatment of metastatic disease with trastuzumab.Participants were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive oral afatinib (40 mg/day) plus intravenous vinorelbine (25 mg/m(2) per week) or intravenous trastuzumab (2 mg/kg per week after 4 mg/kg loading dose) plus vinorelbine.Randomisation was done centrally and stratified by previous trastuzumab treatment (adjuvant vs first-line treatment), hormone receptor status (oestrogen receptor and progesterone receptor positive vs others), and region.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, assessed in the intention-to-treat population.This trial is closed to enrolment and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01125566.FINDINGS: Between Aug 26, 2010, and April 26, 2013, we enrolled 508 patients: 339 assigned to the afatinib group and 169 assigned to the trastuzumab group.Recruitment was stopped on April 26, 2013, after a benefit-risk assessment by the independent data monitoring committee was unfavourable for the afatinib group.Patients on afatinib plus vinorelbine had to switch to trastuzumab plus vinorelbine, afatinib monotherapy, vinorelbine monotherapy, or receive treatment outside of the trial.Median follow-up was 9.3 months (IQR 3.7-16.0).Median progression-free survival was 5.5 months (95% CI 5.4-5.6) in the afatinib group and 5.6 months (5.3-7.3) in the trastuzumab group (hazard ratio 1.10 95% CI 0.86-1.41; p=0.43).The most common drug-related adverse events of grade 3 or higher were neutropenia (190 [56%] of 337 patients in the afatinib group vs 102 [60%] of 169 patients in the trastuzumab group), leucopenia (64 [19%] vs 34 [20%]), and diarrhoea (60 [18%] vs none).INTERPRETATION: Trastuzumab-based therapy remains the treatment of choice for patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who had progressed on trastuzumab.FUNDING: Boehringer Ingelheim.",1,1,1,1
22473163,"Multicenter randomized phase II clinical trial comparing neoadjuvant oxaliplatin, capecitabine, and preoperative radiotherapy with or without cetuximab followed by total mesorectal excision in patients with high-risk rectal cancer (EXPERT-C).PURPOSE: To evaluate the addition of cetuximab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy before chemoradiotherapy in high-risk rectal cancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with operable magnetic resonance imaging-defined high-risk rectal cancer received four cycles of capecitabine/oxaliplatin (CAPOX) followed by capecitabine chemoradiotherapy, surgery, and adjuvant CAPOX (four cycles) or the same regimen plus weekly cetuximab (CAPOX+C).The primary end point was complete response (CR; pathologic CR or, in patients not undergoing surgery, radiologic CR) in patients with KRAS/BRAF wild-type tumors.Secondary end points were radiologic response (RR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety in the wild-type and overall populations and a molecular biomarker analysis.RESULTS: One hundred sixty-five eligible patients were randomly assigned.Ninety (60%) of 149 assessable tumors were KRAS or BRAF wild type (CAPOX, n = 44; CAPOX+C, n = 46), and in these patients, the addition of cetuximab did not improve the primary end point of CR (9% v 11%, respectively; P = 1.0; odds ratio, 1.22) or PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.65; P = .363).Cetuximab significantly improved RR (CAPOX v CAPOX+C: after chemotherapy, 51% v 71%, respectively; P = .038; after chemoradiation, 75% v 93%, respectively; P = .028) and OS (HR, 0.27; P = .034).Skin toxicity and diarrhea were more frequent in the CAPOX+C arm.CONCLUSION: Cetuximab led to a significant increase in RR and OS in patients with KRAS/BRAF wild-type rectal cancer, but the primary end point of improved CR was not met.",1,1,1,1
24906586,"Effectiveness of energy healing on Quality of Life: a pragmatic intervention trial in colorectal cancer patients.PURPOSE: Our aim was to explore the effectiveness of energy healing, a commonly used complementary and alternative therapy, on well-being in cancer patients while assessing the possible influence on the results of participating in a randomized controlled trial.METHODS: 247 patients treated for colorectal cancer (response rate: 31.5%) were either (a) randomized to healing (RH) or control (RC) or (b) had self selected the healing (SH) or control condition (SC), and completed questionnaires assessing well-being (QoL, depressive symptoms, mood, and sleep quality), attitude toward complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), and faith/spirituality at baseline, 1 week, and 2 months post-intervention.They also indicated, at baseline, whether they considered QoL, depressive symptoms, mood, and sleep quality as important outcomes to them.RESULTS: Multilevel linear models revealed no overall effect of healing on QoL (p = 0.156), depressive symptoms (p = 0.063), mood (p = 0.079), or sleep quality (p = 0.346) in the intervention groups (RH, SH) compared with control (SC).Effects of healing on mood were only found for patients who had a positive attitude toward CAM and considered the outcome in question as important (SH: Regression coefficient: -8.78; SE: 2.64; CI: -13.96 to -3.61; p = 0.001, and RH: Regression coefficient -7.45; SE: 2.76; CI: -12.86 to -2.04; p = 0.007).CONCLUSION: Whereas it is generally assumed that CAMs such as healing have beneficial effects on well-being, our results indicated no overall effectiveness of energy healing on QoL, depressive symptoms, mood, and sleep quality in colorectal cancer patients.Effectiveness of healing on well-being was, however, related to factors such as self-selection and a positive attitude toward the treatment.",0,0,0,0
28216660,"Results of the randomized phase IIB ADMIRE trial of FCR with or without mitoxantrone in previously untreated CLL.ADMIRE was a multicenter, randomized-controlled, open, phase IIB superiority trial in previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia.Conventional front-line therapy in fit patients is fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab (FCR).Initial evidence from non-randomized phase II trials suggested that the addition of mitoxantrone to FCR (FCM-R) improved remission rates.Two hundred and fifteen patients were recruited to assess the primary end point of complete remission (CR) rates according to International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia criteria.Secondary end points were progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), overall response rate, minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity and safety.At final analysis, CR rates were 69.8 FCR vs 69.3% FCM-R (adjusted odds ratio (OR): 0.97; 95% confidence interval (CI): (0.53-1.79), P=0.932).MRD-negativity rates were 59.3 FCR vs 50.5% FCM-R (adjusted OR: 0.70; 95% CI: (0.39-1.26), P=0.231).During treatment, 60.0% (n=129) of participants received granulocyte colony-stimulating factor as secondary prophylaxis for neutropenia, a lower proportion on FCR compared with FCM-R (56.1 vs 63.9%).The toxicity of both regimens was acceptable.There are no significant differences between the treatment groups for PFS and OS.The trial demonstrated that the addition of mitoxantrone to FCR did not increase the depth of response.Oral FCR was well tolerated and resulted in impressive responses in terms of CR rates and MRD negativity compared with historical series with intravenous chemotherapy.",0,0,0,0
23650416,"Randomized phase II, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of exemestane with or without entinostat in postmenopausal women with locally recurrent or metastatic estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer progressing on treatment with a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor.PURPOSE: Entinostat is an oral isoform selective histone deacetylase inhibitor that targets resistance to hormonal therapies in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer.This randomized, placebo-controlled, phase II study evaluated entinostat combined with the aromatase inhibitor exemestane versus exemestane alone.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Postmenopausal women with ER+ advanced breast cancer progressing on a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor were randomly assigned to exemestane 25 mg daily plus entinostat 5 mg once per week (EE) or exemestane plus placebo (EP).The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS).Blood was collected in a subset of patients for evaluation of protein lysine acetylation as a biomarker of entinostat activity.RESULTS: One hundred thirty patients were randomly assigned (EE group, n = 64; EP group, n = 66).Based on intent-to-treat analysis, treatment with EE improved median PFS to 4.3 months versus 2.3 months with EP (hazard ratio [HR], 0.73; 95% CI, 0.50 to 1.07; one-sided P = .055; two-sided P = .11 [predefined significance level of .10, one-sided]).Median overall survival was an exploratory end point and improved to 28.1 months with EE versus 19.8 months with EP (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.97; P = .036).Fatigue and neutropenia were the most frequent grade 3/4 toxicities.Treatment discontinuation because of adverse events was higher in the EE group versus the EP group (11% v 2%).Protein lysine hyperacetylation in the EE biomarker subset was associated with prolonged PFS.CONCLUSION: Entinostat added to exemestane is generally well tolerated and demonstrated activity in patients with ER+ advanced breast cancer in this signal-finding phase II study.Acetylation changes may provide an opportunity to maximize clinical benefit with entinostat.Plans for a confirmatory study are underway.",1,1,1,1

29097444,"RAZOR: A Phase II Open Randomized Trial of Screening Plus Goserelin and Raloxifene Versus Screening Alone in Premenopausal Women at Increased Risk of Breast Cancer.Background: Ovarian suppression in premenopausal women is known to reduce breast cancer risk.This study aimed to assess uptake and compliance with ovarian suppression using the luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) analogue, goserelin, with add-back raloxifene, as a potential regimen for breast cancer prevention.Methods: Women at >/=30% lifetime risk breast cancer were approached and randomized to mammographic screening alone (C-Control) or screening in addition to monthly subcutaneous injections of 3.6 mg goserelin and continuous 60 mg raloxifene daily orally (T-Treated) for 2 years.The primary endpoint was therapy adherence.Secondary endpoints were toxicity/quality of life, change in bone density, and mammographic density.Results: A total of 75/950 (7.9%) women approached agreed to randomization.In the T-arm, 20 of 38 (52%) of women completed the 2-year period of study compared with the C-arm (27/37, 73.0%).Dropouts were related to toxicity but also the wish to have established risk-reducing procedures and proven chemoprevention.As relatively few women completed the study, data are limited, but those in the T-arm reported significant increases in toxicity and sexual problems, no change in anxiety, and less cancer worry.Lumbar spine bone density declined by 7.0% and visually assessed mammographic density by 4.7% over the 2-year treatment period.Conclusions: Uptake is somewhat lower than comparable studies with tamoxifen for prevention with higher dropout rates.Raloxifene may preserve bone density, but reduction in mammographic density reversed after treatment was completed.Impact: This study indicates that breast cancer risk reduction may be possible using LHRH agonists, but reducing toxicity and preventing bone changes would make this a more attractive option.Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 27(1); 58-66.(c)2017 AACR.",0,0,0,0
23871490,"2 years versus 1 year of adjuvant trastuzumab for HER2-positive breast cancer (HERA): an open-label, randomised controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Trastuzumab has established efficacy against breast cancer with overexpression or amplification of the HER2 oncogene.The standard of care is 1 year of adjuvant trastuzumab, but the optimum duration of treatment is unknown.We compared 2 years of treatment with trastuzumab with 1 year of treatment, and updated the comparison of 1 year of trastuzumab versus observation at a median follow-up of 8 years, for patients enrolled in the HERceptin Adjuvant (HERA) trial.METHODS: The HERA trial is an international, multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial comparing treatment with trastuzumab for 1 and 2 years with observation after standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy, adjuvant chemotherapy, or both in 5102 patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer.The primary endpoint was disease-free survival.The comparison of 2 years versus 1 year of trastuzumab treatment involved a landmark analysis of 3105 patients who were disease-free 12 months after randomisation to one of the trastuzumab groups, and was planned after observing at least 725 disease-free survival events.The updated intention-to-treat comparison of 1 year trastuzumab treatment versus observation alone in 3399 patients at a median follow-up of 8 years (range 0-10) is also reported.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00045032.FINDINGS: We recorded 367 events of disease-free survival in 1552 patients in the 1 year group and 367 events in 1553 patients in the 2 year group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.99, 95% CI 0.85-1.14, p=0.86).Grade 3-4 adverse events and decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction during treatment were reported more frequently in the 2 year treatment group than in the 1 year group (342 [20.4%] vs 275 [16.3%] grade 3-4 adverse events, and 120 [7.2%] vs 69 [4.1%] decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction, respectively).HRs for a comparison of 1 year of trastuzumab treatment versus observation were 0.76 (95% CI 0.67-0.86, p<0.0001) for disease-free survival and 0.76 (0.65-0.88, p=0.0005) for overall survival, despite crossover of 884 (52%) patients from the observation group to trastuzumab therapy.INTERPRETATION: 2 years of adjuvant trastuzumab is not more effective than is 1 year of treatment for patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer.1 year of treatment provides a significant disease-free and overall survival benefit compared with observation and remains the standard of care.FUNDING: F Hoffmann-La Roche (Roche).",1,1,1,1
29648580,"Bevacizumab plus hypofractionated radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone in elderly patients with glioblastoma: the randomized, open-label, phase II ARTE trial.Background: The addition of bevacizumab to temozolomide-based chemoradiotherapy (TMZ/RT --> TMZ) did not prolong overall survival (OS) in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma in phase III trials.Elderly and frail patients are underrepresented in clinical trials, but early reports suggested preferential benefit in this population.Patients and methods: ARTE was a 2 : 1 randomized, multi-center, open-label, non-comparative phase II trial of hypofractionated RT (40 Gy in 15 fractions) with bevacizumab (10 mg/kgx14 days) (arm A, N = 50) or without bevacizumab (arm B, N = 25) in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma aged >/=65 years.The primary objective was to obtain evidence for prolongation of median OS by the addition of bevacizumab to RT.Response was assessed by RANO criteria.Quality of life (QoL) was monitored by the EORTC QLQ-C30/BN20 modules.Exploratory studies included molecular subtyping by 450k whole methylome and gene expression analyses.Results: Median PFS was longer in arm A than in arm B (7.6 and 4.8 months, P = 0.003), but OS was similar (12.1 and 12.2 months, P = 0.77).Clinical deterioration was delayed and more patients came off steroids in arm A. Prolonged PFS in arm A was confined to tumors with the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) I methylation subtype (HR 0.25, P = 0.014) and proneural gene expression (HR 0.29, P = 0.025).In a Cox model of OS controlling for established prognostic factors, associations with more favorable outcome were identified for age <70 years (HR 0.52, P = 0.018) and Karnofsky performance score 90%-100% (HR 0.51, P = 0.026).Including molecular subtypes into that model identified an association of the RTK II gene methylation subtype with inferior OS (HR 1.73, P = 0.076).Conclusion: Efficacy outcomes and exploratory analyses of ARTE do not support the hypothesis that the addition of bevacizumab to RT generally prolongs survival in elderly glioblastoma patients.Molecular biomarkers may identify patients with preferential benefit from bevacizumab.Clinical trial registration number: NCT01443676.",1,1,1,1

22321061,"Effects of exemestane and tamoxifen on hormone levels within the Tamoxifen Exemestane Adjuvant Multicentre (TEAM) trial: results of a German substudy.AIM: The aim of this study was to compare the effects of exemestane and tamoxifen on hormone levels in postmenopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer within a Germany substudy of the Tamoxifen Exemestane Adjuvant Multinational (TEAM) trial.METHODS: Within the TEAM trial, patients were randomized to receive adjuvant treatment with exemestane for 5 years or tamoxifen for 2.5-3 years followed by exemestane for 2-2.5 years.Serum levels of testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and parathyroid hormone (PTH)-intact were measured at screening and after 3, 6 and 12 months of treatment.RESULTS: Data on hormone levels were available from 63 patients in the tamoxifen arm and 68 patients in the exemestane arm.Treatment with exemestane resulted in decreases from baseline in SHBG and PTH-intact levels, and increases from baseline in testosterone, DHEAS and FSH levels.Tamoxifen treatment resulted in increases from baseline in SHBG and PTH-intact, whereas levels of testosterone and FSH decreased and DHEAS levels did not change.At all time points assessed, the absolute change from baseline was significantly different between tamoxifen and exemestane for testosterone, SHBG, FSH and PTH-intact (all p < 0.0001).CONCLUSIONS: Exemestane and tamoxifen had statistically significantly different effects on hormone levels, including testosterone, SHBG, FSH and PTH-intact.",1,1,1,1
22610153,"Extended benefit from sequential administration of docetaxel after standard fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide regimen for node-positive breast cancer: the 8-year follow-up results of the UNICANCER-PACS01 trial.PURPOSE: The initial report from the Programme Action Concertee Sein (PACS) PACS01 trial demonstrated a benefit at 5 years for disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) rates with the sequential administration of docetaxel after FEC100 (fluorouracil 500 mg/m(2), epirubicin 100 mg/m(2), and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m(2)) for patients with node-positive, operable breast cancer.We evaluate here the impact of this regimen at 8 years.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between June 1997 and March 2000, a total of 1,999 patients (age <65) with localized, resectable, non-pretreated, unilateral breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive either standard FEC100 for 6 cycles or 3 cycles of FEC100 followed by 3 cycles of 100 mg/m(2) docetaxel (FEC-D), both given every 21 days.Radiotherapy was mandatory after conservative surgery and tamoxifen was given for 5 years to hormone receptor (HR)-positive patients.Five-year DFS was the trial's main endpoint.Updated 8-year survival data are presented.RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 92.8 months, 639 patients experienced at least one event.A total number of 383 deaths were registered.Eight-year DFS rates were 65.8% with FEC alone and 70.2% with FEC-D. OS rates at 8 years were 78% with FEC alone and 83.2% with FEC-D. Cox regression analysis adjusted for age and number of positive nodes showed a 15% reduction in the relative risk of relapse and a 25% reduction in the relative risk of death in favor of FEC-D.

25596266,"The genotype of MLH1 identifies a subgroup of follicular lymphoma patients who do not benefit from doxorubicin: FIL-FOLL study.Though most follicular lymphoma biomarkers rely on tumor features, the host genetic background may also be relevant for outcome.Here we aimed at verifying the contribution of candidate polymorphisms of FCgamma receptor, DNA repair and detoxification genes to prognostic stratification of follicular lymphoma treated with immunochemotherapy.The study was based on 428 patients enrolled in the FOLL05 prospective trial that compared three standard-of-care regimens (rituximab-cyclophosphamide-vincristine-prednisone versus rituximab-cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-vincristine-prednisone versus rituximab-fludarabine-mitoxantrone) for the first line therapy of advanced follicular lymphoma.Polymorphisms were genotyped on peripheral blood DNA samples.The primary endpoint was time to treatment failure.Polymorphisms of FCGR2A and FCGR3A, which have been suggested to influence the activity of rituximab as a single agent, did not affect time to treatment failure in the pooled analysis of the three FOLL05 treatment arms that combined rituximab with chemotherapy (P=0.742, P=0.252, respectively).These results were consistent even when the analysis was conducted by intention to treat, indicating that different chemotherapy regimens and loads did not interact differentially with the FCGR2A and FCGR3A genotypes.The genotype of MLH1, which regulates the genotoxic effect of doxorubicin, significantly affected time to treatment failure in patients in the rituximab-cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-vincristine-prednisone arm (P=0.001; q<0.1), but not in arms in which patients did not receive doxorubicin (i.e., the rituximab-cyclophosphamide-vincristine-prednisone and rituximab-fludarabine-mitoxantrone arms).The impact of MLH1 on time to treatment failure was independent after adjusting for the Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index and other potential confounding variables by multivariate analysis.These data indicate that MLH1 genotype is a predictor of failure to benefit from rituximab-cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-vincristine-prednisone treatment in advanced follicular lymphoma and confirm that FCGR2A and FCGR3A polymorphisms have no impact when follicular lymphoma is treated with rituximab plus chemotherapy (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT00774826).",0,0,0,0

32402832,"Transrectal Natural Orifice Specimen Extraction (NOSE) With Oncological Safety: A Prospective and Randomized Trial.BACKGROUND: In the present paper, we introduce our experience with the novel method during laparoscopic anterior resection of upper rectal or sigmoid colon cancer by transrectal natural orifice specimen extraction (NOSE).METHODS: A prospective randomized controlled trial was performed from June 2016 to May 2019.Patients with upper rectal or sigmoid colon cancer were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the NOSE group and the non-NOSE group.Preoperative and postoperative clinical variables were analyzed and compared between groups.Postoperative pain was analyzed utilizing a visual analog scale.Postoperative overall survival was analyzed using a Kaplan-Meier curve.RESULTS: A total of 276 patients were enrolled, of whom 254 were randomly divided into the NOSE group (n = 122) and the conventional laparoscopic group (n = 119).NOSE failed in 22 cases, which were converted to transabdominal specimen extraction.Intention-to-treat analysis was performed, and these 22 cases were included in the NOSE group.The incidence of postoperative complications was significantly lower in the NOSE group (11/122, 9%) than in the non-NOSE group (25/119, 21%).The NOSE group had a longer operation time, less blood loss, and a lower postoperative visual analog scale score than the non-NOSE group.The time for intestinal function recovery (ventilation) and the length of hospital stay were significantly longer in the non-NOSE group.The Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed no statistically significant difference in the disease-free survival rate between the NOSE group and the non-NOSE group.CONCLUSIONS: The novel NOSE method is safe and feasible to use in patients having colorectal cancer.Compared with traditional laparoscopic surgery, the postoperative complication rates of NOSE surgery were lower with an improved short-term clinical recovery.",0,0,0,0
28430159,"Efficacy of Low-Molecular-Weight Fucoidan as a Supplemental Therapy in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Patients: A Double-Blind Randomized Controlled Trial.BACKGROUND: Low-molecular-weight fucoidan (LMF) is widely used as a food supplement for cancer patients.However, all of the studies are in vitro or were conducted using mice.Therefore, powerful clinical evidence for LMF use is relatively weak.This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of LMF as a supplemental therapy to chemo-target agents in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients.METHODS: We conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of LMF as a supplemental therapy to chemotarget agents in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).Sixty eligible patients with mCRC were included.Finally, 54 patients were enrolled, of whom 28 were included in the study group and 26 in the control group.The primary endpoint was the disease control rate (DCR), and secondary endpoints included the overall response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), adverse effects (AEs), and quality of life (QOL).RESULTS: The DCRs were 92.8% and 69.2% in the study and control groups, respectively (p = 0.026), in a median follow-up period of 11.5 months.The OS, PFS, ORR, AEs, and QOL did not significantly differ between the two groups.CONCLUSION: This is the first clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of LMF as a supplemental therapy in the management of patients with mCRC.The results indicate that LMF combined with chemotarget agents significantly improved the DCR.",1,1,1,1
33238829,"Intraoperative Ureteral Stent Use at Radical Cystectomy is Associated with Higher 30-Day Complication Rates.PURPOSE: Radical cystectomy/urinary diversion is a high risk procedure.Intraoperative stents are commonly utilized to decrease ureteroenteric anastomosis related complications.Institutionally some surgeons routinely use intraoperative stents while others do not, providing an opportunity to compare complication differences.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We queried a prospective database of 283 patients enrolled in a randomized controlled trial evaluating 30-day perioperative complications with goal directed fluid therapy following open radical cystectomy/urinary diversion between 2014 and 2018.Ureteroenteric anastomosis specific complications (ureteral obstruction, urinary leak, urinary infections/sepsis and intra-abdominal abscess) were compared between groups (intraoperative stent vs nonintraoperative stent group) using Fisher exact test and quantified using logistic regression.RESULTS: The nonintraoperative stent group (77 of 283 patients, 27%) was older (median 72 vs 69 years) and was more likely to receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy (53% vs 40%), have baseline renal insufficiency (43% vs 30%) and undergo an ileal conduit (92% vs 53%).However, despite higher comorbidity, the nonintraoperative stent group had a significantly lower rate of ureteroenteric anastomosis complications (14% vs 32%, p=0.004).Since continent diversions may be associated with higher complications, the nonintraoperative stent group with ileal conduit was also compared to intraoperative stent cohorts with ileal conduit, and ureteroenteric anastomosis complications remained lower in the nonintraoperative stent group (14% vs 28%, p=0.043).Multivariable logistic regression showed significantly increased odds of urinary complications with intraoperative stent use (OR 3.55, 95% CI 2.93-4.31; p <0.0001).Importantly there was no obstruction and only 1 leak (1.3%) in the nonintraoperative stent group.CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to conventional belief, we found intraoperative stent use in radical cystectomy/urinary diversion was associated with significantly higher infectious complications and urgent care visits, and significantly increased the odds of 30-day ureteroenteric anastomosis associated complications.",0,0,0,0

25018037,"Impact of baseline corticosteroids on survival and steroid androgens in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: exploratory analysis from COU-AA-301.BACKGROUND: Corticosteroids have been used to mitigate mineralocorticoid-related effects and restore sensitivity to abiraterone acetate.Corticosteroids may also mediate glucocorticoid receptor or mutated androgen receptor activation and adversely influence outcome.OBJECTIVE: This post hoc exploratory analysis investigated whether baseline corticosteroids were an independent prognostic factor and its level of contribution in the presence of other prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) in study COU-AA-301.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: COU-AA-301 was a randomised study of abiraterone plus prednisone versus prednisone in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients after docetaxel.INTERVENTION: Patients were randomised 2:1 to abiraterone 1000 mg plus prednisone 5mg by mouth twice daily versus prednisone.OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Association of OS with baseline corticosteroids was determined by univariate and multivariate Cox models.RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: At study entry, 33% of patients received corticosteroids, had worse disease characteristics (p<0.05 except liver metastases), and were more likely to have testosterone levels below the median (odds ratio:2.92; chi-square p<0.0001).Associations between prostate-specific antigen response as well as circulating tumour cell decline and higher baseline androgen levels were demonstrated.Patients taking baseline corticosteroids had inferior OS in univariate analysis (hazard ratio: 1.48; p<0.0001); however, in multivariate stepwise selection modelling, baseline corticosteroids did not add substantially to the model.This analysis is limited as a retrospective analysis and restricted to patients after docetaxel.CONCLUSIONS: In the COU-AA-301 study, baseline corticosteroids were associated with adverse prognostic features, inferior OS, and lower baseline androgen levels but did not add substantial information to the final prognostic model.Thus in these data from study COU-AA-301, concurrent baseline corticosteroids did not have an independent impact on OS.PATIENT SUMMARY: Baseline corticosteroids did not adversely affect abiraterone clinical benefit in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.Their use was associated with patients having worse disease characteristics.",1,1,1,1
28181131,"Randomized trial of aromatherapy versus conventional care for breast cancer patients during perioperative periods.PURPOSE: Several studies focused on the effect of aromatherapy on mood, quality of life (QOL), and physical symptoms in patients with cancer.We compared the effects on QOL, vital signs, and sleep quality between aromatherapy and conventional therapy during perioperative periods of the breast cancer patients in this study.METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive aromatherapy or usual care.The primary endpoint was QOL, which was assessed using the quality of life questionnaire QLQ-C30, Version 3.0 of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Study Group on quality of life.Secondary endpoints included the necessity of hypnotics, vital signs including blood pressure and heart rate and adverse events.In addition, we also summarized the patients' perception of the experience from a free description-type questionnaire.RESULTS: A total of 249 patients had breast cancer surgery and 162 patients gave physician consent and were recruited; 110 were randomly assigned to aromatherapy group (eight patients showed incomplete EORTC QLQ-C30) and 52 to control group (one patient showed incomplete EORTC QLQ-C30).There were no statistically significant differences between the aromatherapy group and control group in the EORTC QLQ-C30 at the surgery day.As for the results of the post-operation day 1, trends for differentiations of physical functioning and role functioning were detected between aromatherapy group and control group, but the differences did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.08 and 0.09).There were no significant differences of systolic and diastolic blood pressures between aromatherapy group and control group (p = 0.82 and 0.68).There was no statistically significant difference in heart rates between aromatherapy group (70.6 +/- 11.0 bpm) and control group (71.2 +/- 9.8 bpm) (p = 0.73).Likewise, the rate of hypnotic use was not statistically significant (p = 0.10).No adverse events were reported after aromatherapy and all impressions from aromatherapy group were positive with descriptors such as relaxed, comfortable, and enjoyable being common.CONCLUSION: The results showed no effects of aromatherapy on QOL, sleep quality, and vital sign.However, there was not any harm or adverse event for using aromatherapy.All impressions from self-reporting were positive such as relaxed, comfortable, and enjoyable by the aromatherapy group.Therefore, we can use aromatherapy during perioperative periods in order to meet the expectations of the patients.",0,0,0,0
27129176,"Thalidomide enhanced the efficacy of CHOP chemotherapy in the treatment of diffuse large B cell lymphoma: A phase II study.Cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone plus rituximab (R-CHOP) is the standard treatment for patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL).However, rituximab cannot be popularly applied in a considerable number of patients with DLBCL because of economic reasons.To develop a new regimen to improve the outcome of these patients is extremely important.In our study, sixty five patients with DLBCL were randomly assigned to thalidomide plus CHOP group (n=32) or to CHOP alone group (n=33).Objective response rates (ORR) and complete remission rates (CRR) were 96.7% and 80.6% in T-CHOP group versus 78.9 % and 57.8 % in CHOP group, respectively (P <0.05).At a median follow-up of 96 months, median PFS for T-CHOP group was still not reached yet, and in CHOP group it was 22.9 months (95% CI [0-50.4]).(P=0.163).Median overall survival (OS) for T-CHOP group was also not reached, and the estimated median OS for CHOP group was 83.5 months, the difference of OS between the two groups is not significant (p=0.263). But, in patients with Bcl-2 positive and Bcl-6 negative, the median PFS in T-CHOP group was longer than that in CHOP group (111.0 vs 8.5 months (P=0.017).In addition, thalidomide did not significantly increase the grade 3/4 toxicity of CHOP.We concluded that the addition of thalidomide to the CHOP regimen significantly improved the CRR and showed a trend of improving clinical outcome in patients with DLBCL, especially for patients with Bcl-2 positive and Bcl-6 negative B-cell phenotype, without increased toxicity.",1,1,1,1
26686313,"Anastrozole versus tamoxifen for the prevention of locoregional and contralateral breast cancer in postmenopausal women with locally excised ductal carcinoma in situ (IBIS-II DCIS): a double-blind, randomised controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Third-generation aromatase inhibitors are more effective than tamoxifen for preventing recurrence in postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive invasive breast cancer.However, it is not known whether anastrozole is more effective than tamoxifen for women with hormone-receptor-positive ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).Here, we compare the efficacy of anastrozole with that of tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive DCIS.METHODS: In a double-blind, multicentre, randomised placebo-controlled trial, we recruited women who had been diagnosed with locally excised, hormone-receptor-positive DCIS.Eligible women were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio by central computer allocation to receive 1 mg oral anastrozole or 20 mg oral tamoxifen every day for 5 years.Randomisation was stratified by major centre or hub and was done in blocks (six, eight, or ten).All trial personnel, participants, and clinicians were masked to treatment allocation and only the trial statistician had access to treatment allocation.The primary endpoint was all recurrence, including recurrent DCIS and new contralateral tumours.All analyses were done on a modified intention-to-treat basis (in all women who were randomised and did not revoke consent for their data to be included) and proportional hazard models were used to compute hazard ratios and corresponding confidence intervals.This trial is registered at the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN37546358.RESULTS: Between March 3, 2003, and Feb 8, 2012, we enrolled 2980 postmenopausal women from 236 centres in 14 countries and randomly assigned them to receive anastrozole (1449 analysed) or tamoxifen (1489 analysed).Median follow-up was 7.2 years (IQR 5.6-8.9), and 144 breast cancer recurrences were recorded.We noted no statistically significant difference in overall recurrence (67 recurrences for anastrozole vs 77 for tamoxifen; HR 0.89 [95% CI 0.64-1.23]).The non-inferiority of anastrozole was established (upper 95% CI <1.25), but its superiority to tamoxifen was not (p=0.49).A total of 69 deaths were recorded (33 for anastrozole vs 36 for tamoxifen; HR 0.93 [95% CI 0.58-1.50], p=0.78), and no specific cause was more common in one group than the other.The number of women reporting any adverse event was similar between anastrozole (1323 women, 91%) and tamoxifen (1379 women, 93%); the side-effect profiles of the two drugs differed, with more fractures, musculoskeletal events, hypercholesterolaemia, and strokes with anastrozole and more muscle spasm, gynaecological cancers and symptoms, vasomotor symptoms, and deep vein thromboses with tamoxifen.CONCLUSIONS: No clear efficacy differences were seen between the two treatments.Anastrozole offers another treatment option for postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive DCIS, which may be be more appropriate for some women with contraindications for tamoxifen.Longer follow-up will be necessary to fully evaluate treatment differences.FUNDING: Cancer Research UK, National Health and Medical Research Council Australia, Breast Cancer Research Fund, AstraZeneca, Sanofi Aventis.",1,1,1,1
34446053,"Durvalumab (MEDI 4736) in combination with extended neoadjuvant regimens in rectal cancer: a study protocol of a randomised phase II trial (PRIME-RT).BACKGROUND: Advances in multi-modality treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) have resulted in low local recurrence rates, but around 30% of patients will still die from distant metastatic disease.In parallel, there is increasing recognition that with radiotherapy and systemic treatment, some patients achieve a complete response and may avoid surgical resection, including in many cases, the need for a permanent stoma.Extended neoadjuvant regimes have emerged to address these concerns.The inclusion of immunotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting has the potential to further enhance this strategy by priming the local immune microenvironment and engaging the systemic immune response.METHODS: PRIME-RT is a multi-centre, open label, phase II, randomised trial for patients with newly diagnosed LARC.Eligible patients will be randomised to receive either: short course radiotherapy (25 Gray in 5 fractions over one week) with concomitant durvalumab (1500 mg administered intravenously every 4 weeks), followed by FOLFOX (85 mg/m(2) oxaliplatin, 350 mg folinic acid and 400 mg/m(2) bolus 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) given on day 1 followed by 2400 mg/m(2) 5-FU infusion over 46-48 h, all administered intravenously every 2 weeks), and durvalumab, or long course chemoradiotherapy (50 Gray to primary tumour in 25 fractions over 5 weeks with concomitant oral capecitabine 825 mg/m(2) twice per day on days of radiotherapy) with durvalumab followed by FOLFOX and durvalumab.The primary endpoint is complete response rate in each arm.Secondary endpoints include treatment compliance, toxicity, safety, overall recurrence, proportion of patients with a permanent stoma, and survival.The study is translationally rich with collection of bio-specimens prior to, during, and following treatment in order to understand the molecular and immunological factors underpinning treatment response.The trial opened and the first patient was recruited in January 2021.The main trial will recruit up to 42 patients with LARC and commence after completion of a safety run-in that will recruit at least six patients with LARC or metastatic disease.DISCUSSION: PRIME-RT will explore if adding immunotherapy to neoadjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy for patients with LARC can prime the tumour microenvironment to improve complete response rates and stoma free survival.Sequential biopsies are a key component within the trial design that will provide new knowledge on how the tumour microenvironment changes at different time-points in response to multi-modality treatment.This expectation is that the trial will provide information to test this treatment within a large phase clinical trial.Trial registration Clinicaltrials.gov NCT04621370 (Registered 9th Nov 2020) EudraCT number 2019-001471-36 (Registered 6th Nov 2020).",1,1,1,1
32234755,"A Randomized, Open-label, Presurgical, Window-of-Opportunity Study Comparing the Pharmacodynamic Effects of the Novel Oral SERD AZD9496 with Fulvestrant in Patients with Newly Diagnosed ER(+) HER2(-) Primary Breast Cancer.PURPOSE: Fulvestrant, the first-in-class selective estrogen receptor (ER) degrader (SERD), is clinically effective in patients with ER(+) breast cancer, but it has administration and pharmacokinetic limitations.Pharmacodynamic data suggest complete ER degradation is not achieved at fulvestrant's clinically feasible dose.This presurgical study (NCT03236974) compared the pharmacodynamic effects of fulvestrant with AZD9496, a novel, orally bioavailable, nonsteroidal, potent SERD, in treatment-naive patients with ER(+) HER2(-) primary breast cancer awaiting curative intent surgery.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive AZD9496 250 mg twice daily from day 1 for 5-14 days, or fulvestrant 500 mg on day 1.On-treatment imaging-guided core tumor biopsies were taken between day 5 and 14 and compared with pretreatment diagnostic biopsies.The primary objective was to compare the effects of AZD9496 and fulvestrant on ER expression.Secondary objectives included changes in progesterone receptor (PR) and Ki-67 pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships and safety.RESULTS: Forty-six women received treatment (AZD9496 n = 22; fulvestrant n = 24); 35 paired biopsies were evaluable (AZD9496 n = 15; fulvestrant n = 20).The least square mean estimate for ER H-score reduction was 24% after AZD9496 versus 36% after fulvestrant treatment (P = 0.86).AZD9496 also reduced PR H-scores (-33.3%) and Ki-67 levels (-39.9%) from baseline, but was also not superior to fulvestrant (PR: -68.7%, P = 0.97; Ki-67: -75.4%, P = 0.98).No new safety findings were identified.CONCLUSIONS: This was the first presurgical study to demonstrate that an oral SERD affects its key biological targets.However, AZD9496 was not superior to fulvestrant at the dose tested.",1,1,1,1
24150234,"Abiraterone acetate in combination with prednisone for the treatment of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: U.S. Food and Drug Administration drug approval summary.On December 10, 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted full approval for a modified indication for abiraterone acetate (Zytiga tablets; Janssen Biotech, Inc.) in combination with prednisone for the treatment of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).The approval was based on clinical trial COU-AA-302, which randomly allocated asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients with chemotherapy-naive mCRPC and no visceral metastases to either abiraterone acetate plus prednisone (N = 546) or placebo plus prednisone (N = 542).The coprimary endpoints were radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) and overall survival (OS).The median rPFS was 8.3 months in the placebo arm and had not yet been reached in the abiraterone acetate arm {HR, 0.43 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.35-0.52]; P < 0.0001}. A prespecified interim analysis demonstrated an improvement in OS favoring the abiraterone acetate arm [HR, 0.79 (95% CI, 0.66-0.96)] but did not cross the O'Brien-Fleming boundary for statistical significance.Safety data confirmed the known adverse reaction profile of abiraterone acetate.Full approval was granted on the basis of a large magnitude of effect on rPFS, a favorable trend in OS, and internal consistency across multiple secondary endpoints and exploratory patient-reported pain data.This is the first drug approval for mCRPC to use rPFS as the primary endpoint.Importantly, this approval was granted in the context of a prior statistically significant OS benefit that formed the basis of the original April 28, 2011, approval of abiraterone acetate for patients with mCRPC who had received prior chemotherapy containing docetaxel.",0,0,0,0
25012645,"The effect of resistance training during radiotherapy on spinal bone metastases in cancer patients - a randomized trial.PURPOSE: To compare the effects of resistance training versus passive physical therapy on bone density in the metastatic bone during radiation therapy (RT) as combined treatment in patients with spinal bone metastases.Secondly, to quantify pathological fractures after combined treatment.MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this randomized trial, 60 patients were allocated from September 2011 until March 2013 into one of the two groups: resistance training (group A) or passive physical therapy (group B) with thirty patients in each group during RT.Bone density in metastatic and non-metastatic vertebral bone was assessed at baseline, 3 and 6 months after RT.RESULTS: Bone density in all metastases increased significantly by 28.3% (IQR 11.4-139.0) and 80.3% (IQR 32.6-250.6) after 3 and 6 months in group A (both p < 0.01).The bone density in group A was significantly increased compared to control group after 3 and 6months (both p < 0.01, median 59.7; IQR 21.1-98.3 and median 62.9; IQR -9.7 to 161.7).The bone density data in group B showed no significant increase over the course of time (p = 0.289, median 5.5, IQR 0.0-62.2 and p = 0.057, median 52.1, IQR 0.0-162.7).23.3% of the patients in group A and 30.0% of the patients in group B had pathological fractures, no fracture was assigned to intervention, and no difference between groups after 3 and 6 months was observed (p = 0.592 and p = 0.604).CONCLUSIONS: Our trial demonstrated that resistance training concomitant to RT can improve bone density in spinal bone metastases.This combined treatment is effective, practicable, and without side effects for patients.Importantly, the pathological fracture rate in the intervention group was not increased.The results offer a rationale for future large controlled investigations to confirm these findings.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical trial identifier NCT01409720.",0,0,0,0

25893930,"A randomized double-blind placebo controlled phase I-II study on clinical and molecular effects of dietary supplements in men with precancerous prostatic lesions. Chemoprevention or ""chemopromotion""?BACKGROUND: Antioxidants effectiveness in prostate cancer (PCa) chemoprevention has been severely questioned, especially after the recent results of the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial.We present the results of a double-blind randomized controlled trial (dbRCT) on the pharmacokinetic, clinical, and molecular activity of dietary supplements containing lycopene, selenium, and green tea catechins (GTCs) in men with multifocal high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (mHGPIN) and/or atypical small acinar proliferation (ASAP).METHODS: From 2009 to 2014, we conducted a dbRCT including 60 patients with primary mHGPIN and/or ASAP receiving daily lycopene 35 mg, selenium 55 microg, and GTCs 600 mg, or placebo for 6 months.Pharmacokinetic analysis were performed with UV-Visible spectrophotometric assay under standard (SC) and accelerated (AC) conditions.Upon plasma lycopene concentrations falling within the expected range (1.2-90 mcg/l) and no side-effects of grade >1, study proceeded to phase II (n = 50).After unblinding of results, eight men (4 per arm, 2 without and 2 with PCa, respectively) were randomly selected and totRNA extracted from ""non-pathological"" tissues.MicroRNA profiling was performed with the Agilent platform.Raw data processing used R-statistical language and linear models for microarray analysis.RESULTS: Samples were stable except for lycopene, showing significant degradation (SC = 56%, AC = 59%) and consequently stabilized under vacuum in a dark packaging.Mean plasmatic lycopene concentration was 1,45 +/- 0,4 muM. At 6 months, 53 men underwent re-biopsy and 13 (24.5%) were diagnosed with PCa (supplementation n = 10, placebo n = 3 [P = 0.053]).At a mean 37 months follow-up, 3 additional PCa were found in the placebo group.No significant variations in PSA, IPSS, and PR25 questionnaires were observed.Stronger modulation of miRNAs was present on re-biopsy in the supplementation group compared to the placebo, including: (i) overexpression of miRNAs present in PCa versus non-cancer tissue; (ii) underexpression of miRNAs suppressing PCa proliferation; (iii) detection of 35 miRNAs in PCa patients versus disease-free men, including androgen-regulated miR-125b-5p and PTEN-targeting miR-92a-3p (both upregulated).CONCLUSION: Administration of high doses of lycopene, GTCs, and selenium in men harboring HGPIN and/or ASAP was associated with a higher incidence of PCa at re-biopsy and expression of microRNAs implicated in PCa progression at molecular analysis.The use of these supplements should be avoided.",0,0,0,0
32975708,"Randomized phase II clinical trial and biomarker analysis of paclitaxel plus epirubicin versus vinorelbine plus epirubicin as neoadjuvant chemotherapy in locally advanced HER2-negative breast cancer with TEKT4 variations.PURPOSE: Resistance to paclitaxel remains a major challenge in treating breast cancer.Our preclinical study suggested that TEKT4 germline variations in breast cancer are associated with paclitaxel resistance and increase vinorelbine sensitivity.This clinical trial compared the efficacy of paclitaxel and vinorelbine in breast cancer neoadjuvant chemotherapy.METHODS: In this open-label, single-center, phase II trial, female patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, stage IIB-IIIC breast cancer harboring TEKT4 germline variations were randomly assigned to the paclitaxel plus epirubicin (PE) or vinorelbine plus epirubicin (NE).The primary endpoint was the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate, and the secondary endpoints were the objective response rate (ORR) and safety.Targeted sequencing of a panel comprising 484 breast-related genes was performed to identify pCR-associated somatic mutations in each group.RESULTS: 91 Patients were assigned to PE (46 patients) or NE (45 patients).NE numerically increased the pCR rate (22.2% versus 8.7%, P = 0.074).The ORRs for NE and PE were 82.2% and 76.1%, respectively.Interestingly, NE (15.4%) showed a significantly higher pCR rate than PE (0%) in the hormone receptor (HR)-positive subgroup (P = 0.044).Both regimens were well tolerated, with grade 3 and 4 toxicities reported at the expected levels.The biomarker analysis showed that UNC13D mutation predicted the pCR rate in NE (P = 0.011).CONCLUSIONS: Although the primary endpoint was not met, NE might bring clinical benefit to HR-positive patients or patients simultaneously carrying UNC13D mutations.",1,1,1,1

23732774,"Equal efficacy of endoscopic and surgical cystogastrostomy for pancreatic pseudocyst drainage in a randomized trial.BACKGROUND & AIMS: Although surgery is the standard technique for drainage of pancreatic pseudocysts, use of endoscopic methods is increasing.We performed a single-center, open-label, randomized trial to compare endoscopic and surgical cystogastrostomy for pancreatic pseudocyst drainage.METHODS: Patients with pancreatic pseudocysts underwent endoscopic (n = 20) or surgical cystogastrostomy (n = 20).The primary end point was pseudocyst recurrence after a 24-month follow-up period.Secondary end points were treatment success or failure, complications, re-interventions, length of hospital stay, physical and mental health scores, and total costs.RESULTS: At the end of the follow-up period, none of the patients who received endoscopic therapy had a pseudocyst recurrence, compared with 1 patient treated surgically.There were no differences in treatment successes, complications, or re-interventions between the groups.However, the length of hospital stay was shorter for patients who underwent endoscopic cystogastrostomy (median, 2 days, vs 6 days in the surgery group; P < .001).Although there were no differences in physical component scores and mental health component scores (MCS) between groups at baseline on the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form General Survey questionnaire, longitudinal analysis showed significantly better physical component scores (P = .019) and mental health component scores (P = .025) for the endoscopy treatment group.The total mean cost was lower for patients managed by endoscopy than surgery ($7011 vs $15,052; P = .003).CONCLUSIONS: In a randomized trial comparing endoscopic and surgical cystogastrostomy for pancreatic pseudocyst drainage, none of the patients in the endoscopy group had pseudocyst recurrence during the follow-up period, therefore there is no evidence that surgical cystogastrostomy is superior.However, endoscopic treatment was associated with shorter hospital stays, better physical and mental health of patients, and lower cost.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00826501.",0,0,0,0
29445029,"Pantoprazole, an Inhibitor of the Organic Cation Transporter 2, Does Not Ameliorate Cisplatin-Related Ototoxicity or Nephrotoxicity in Children and Adolescents with Newly Diagnosed Osteosarcoma Treated with Methotrexate, Doxorubicin, and Cisplatin.LESSONS LEARNED: Using a randomized crossover design and continuous variables such as change in hearing threshold and biomarkers of acute renal injury as short-term endpoints, it was determined that pantoprazole, an organic cation transporter 2 inhibitor, did not ameliorate cisplatin-associated nephrotoxicity or ototoxicity.Cystatin C is a robust method to estimate glomerular filtration rate in patients with cancer.Using a patient-reported outcome survey, all patients identified tinnitus and subjective hearing loss occurring ""at least rarely"" after cycle 1, prior to objective high-frequency hearing loss measured by audiograms.New therapies that improve outcome with less acute and long-term toxicity are needed.BACKGROUND: Organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2), which is a cisplatin uptake transporter expressed on renal tubules and cochlear hair cells but not on osteosarcoma cells, mediates cisplatin uptake.Pantoprazole inhibits OCT2 and could ameliorate cisplatin ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity.Using a randomized crossover design, we evaluated audiograms, urinary acute kidney injury (AKI) biomarkers, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimated from cystatin C (GFRcysC) in patients receiving cisplatin with and without pantoprazole.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cisplatin (60 mg/m(2) x 2 days per cycle) was administered concurrently with pantoprazole (intravenous [IV], 1.6 mg/kg over 4 hours) on cycles 1 and 2 or cycles 3 and 4 in 12 patients with osteosarcoma (OS) with a median (range) age of 12.8 (5.6-19) years.Audiograms, urinary AKI biomarkers, and serum cystatin C were monitored during each cycle.RESULTS: Pantoprazole had no impact on decrements in hearing threshold at 4-8 kHz, post-treatment elevation of urinary AKI biomarkers, or GFRcysC (Fig. 1, Table 1).Histological response (percent necrosis) after two cycles was similar with or without pantoprazole.All eight patients with localized OS at diagnosis are alive and in remission; three of four patients with metastases at diagnosis have died.CONCLUSION: Pantoprazole did not ameliorate cisplatin ototoxicity or nephrotoxicity.The decrease in GFRcysC and increase in N-acetyl-ss-glucosaminidase (NAG) and creatinine demonstrate that these biomarkers can quantify cisplatin glomerular and proximal tubular toxicity.OCT2 inhibition by pantoprazole did not appear to alter antitumor response or survival.",1,1,1,1

21679921,"A randomized controlled trial of emergency treatment of bleeding esophageal varices in cirrhosis for hepatocellular carcinoma.BACKGROUND: Ninety percent of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have cirrhosis.Bleeding esophageal varices (BEV) is a frequent complication of cirrhosis.Detection of HCC in cirrhotic patients with BEV has not been studied.METHODS: Two hundred eleven unselected patients with cirrhosis and BEV were randomized to endoscopic sclerotherapy (n = 106) or emergency portacaval shunt (n = 105).Diagnostic workup and treatment were initiated within 8 hours.Ninety-six percent had >10 years of follow-up.HCC screening involved serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) every 3 months, ultrasonography every 6 months, and selective computed tomography (CT).RESULTS: HCC occurred in 15 patients, all incurable, a mean of 2.94 years after entry.They died a mean 1.33 years after discovery.Serial AFP and ultrasound examinations were unrevealing over a mean of 2.3 years.The mean model of end-stage liver disease score was 12.7 at entry and 17.4 at HCC diagnosis.CONCLUSIONS: Long-term screening by AFP and ultrasound plus selective CT failed to detect HCC at a curable stage.The detection of HCC in cirrhotic patients with BEV remains a serious, unsolved problem.The use of CT for routine screening warrants consideration despite increased costs.",0,0,0,0
31398258,"Randomized controlled trial on the effect of an online decision aid for young female cancer patients regarding fertility preservation.STUDY QUESTION: Does the use of an online decision aid (DA) about fertility preservation (FP), in addition to standard counselling by a specialist in reproductive medicine, reduce decisional conflict compared to standard counselling alone?SUMMARY ANSWER: Female cancer patients who could make use of the online DA had a significantly lower short-term decisional conflict score.WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Nowadays, female cancer patients have several options for preserving fertility, but having to decide whether to opt for FP within a short time frame after cancer diagnosis and before the start of treatment is challenging.According to previous studies focussing mainly on breast cancer patients, decisional conflict among these women is high, and they have expressed the need for additional support.STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: The study was a randomized controlled trial including female cancer patients who were referred by their treating oncologist to a specialist in reproductive medicine for fertility counselling.Participants were randomly assigned to the control group (counselling only) or to the intervention group (counselling and additional use of the online DA immediately after counselling).Recruitment was ongoing from July 2016 to December 2017 at eight fertility centres in Switzerland and Germany.PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The online DA was developed by an interdisciplinary team of specialists in reproductive medicine, gynaecologists, oncologists and psychologists.Of 79 recruited participants, 59 completed the first assessment and could therefore be enrolled in the study.They were asked to complete an online questionnaire at three time points: at T1, after counselling (control group, n = 27) or after counselling and the additional use of the DA (intervention group, n = 24); at T2, 1 month later (N = 41: control group, n = 23; intervention group, n = 18); and at T3, 12 months later (N = 37: control group, n = 20; intervention group, n = 17).The survey comprised questions about fertility-related knowledge, attitude towards FP, willingness to undergo FP and socio-demographic data, as well as the decisional conflict and decisional regret scales.MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: All participants showed low decisional conflict scores.Women who used the online DA in addition to counselling (intervention group) showed a significantly lower total score on the Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS) compared to the control group at T1 (P = 0.008; M = 12.15, SD = 4.38; 95% CI, 3.35-20.95) and at T2 (P = 0.043; M = 9.35, SD = 4.48; 95% CI, 0.31-18.38).At T3, the mean total score of the DCS was still lower in the intervention group compared to the control group; however, this group difference was no longer significant (P = 0.199, M = 6.86, SD = 5.24; 95% CI, -3.78 to 17.51).The majority of participants had already made a decision regarding FP (yes or no) at T1 (72.5%): 91.7% in the intervention group compared to 55.6% in the control group (P = 0.014).Those who had decided already at T1 showed significantly lower decisional conflict (P = 0.007; M = 13.69, SD = 4.89; 95% CI, 3.86-23.52).The average number of DA sessions per user was 2.23, and 80.8% of the participants completed the DA's value clarification exercises.Participants in the intervention group were satisfied with the DA and would recommend it to other patients.LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The recruitment of participants was challenging because of the emotionally difficult situation patients were in.This led to the limited sample size for final analysis.Education levels were high in two-thirds of the participants.It is difficult to say whether the DA would be equally effective in women with a lower educational background.WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: There is evidence that the DA served as a helpful complement to the decision-making process for young female cancer patients qualifying for FP.This is, to our knowledge, the first randomized controlled trial evaluating a DA targeted at patients with several cancer types and in a language other than English (i.e. German).This study contributes to extending the range of the still limited number of DAs in the context of FP.STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): The study was supported by a research grant of the Swiss Cancer Research.The authors declare that no competing interests exist.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: Clinicaltrials.gov, trial no.

23358966,"Postinduction dexamethasone and individualized dosing of Escherichia Coli L-asparaginase each improve outcome of children and adolescents with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia: results from a randomized study--Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ALL Consortium Protocol 00-01.PURPOSE: We assessed the toxicity and efficacy of dexamethasone and a novel dosing method of Escherichia coli L-asparaginase (EC-Asnase) in children and adolescents with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients achieving complete remission (CR) on Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ALL Consortium Protocol 00-01 were eligible for random assignment to 1) dexamethasone or prednisone, administered as 5-day pulses, every 3 weeks, and 2) weekly EC-Asnase, administered as a 25,000 IU/m(2) fixed dose (FD) or individualized dose (ID) starting at 12,500-IU/m(2), adjusted every 3 weeks based on nadir serum asparaginase activity (NSAA) determinations.RESULTS: Between 2000 and 2004, 492 evaluable patients (ages 1 to 18 years) enrolled; 473 patients (96%) achieved CR.Four hundred eight patients (86%) participated in the corticosteroid randomization and 384 patients (81%) in the EC-Asnase randomization.With 4.9 years of median follow-up, dexamethasone was associated with superior 5-year event-free survival (EFS; 90% v 81% for prednisone; P = .01) but higher rates of infection (P = .03) and, in older children, higher cumulative incidence of osteonecrosis (P = .02) and fracture (P = .06).ID EC-Asnase had superior 5-year EFS (90% v 82% for FD; P = .04), but did not reduce the frequency of asparaginase-related toxicity.Multivariable analysis identified both dexamethasone and ID EC-Asnase as independent predictors of favorable EFS.CONCLUSION: There was no overall difference in skeletal toxicity by corticosteroid type; dexamethasone was associated with more infections and, in older children, increased incidence of osteonecrosis and fracture.There was no difference in asparaginase-related toxicity by EC-Asnase dosing method.Dexamethasone and ID EC-Asnase were each associated with superior EFS.Monitoring NSAA during treatment with EC-Asnase may be an effective strategy to improve outcome in pediatric ALL.",1,1,1,1
23494582,"Transient swelling versus lymphoedema in the first year following surgery for breast cancer.PURPOSE: The aim was to better understand the incidence, time course and risk factors for swelling in the arm on the side of surgery over the first year following surgery for breast cancer.METHOD: Women (n = 160) were assessed 1 month following surgery and then randomised to the exercise or control group.Reassessment occurred 3, 9 and 15 months following surgery.Potential risk factors for swelling included age, body mass index, side of surgery and surgical and medical treatments for their breast cancer, physical measures of shoulder range of motion and strength, inter-limb arm circumference difference and the group to which they were randomised.Swelling was determined using bioimpedance spectroscopy with reference to previously established cut-offs for lymphoedema.RESULTS: The number of women with swelling at 3, 9 and 15 months was 15, 15 and 13, respectively; however, at 15 months only 5/13 presented with swelling in either of the preceding assessments.The risk of swelling increased at 3, 9 and 15 months for each centimetre increase in the baseline inter-limb difference in sum of arm circumferences by 1.30, 1.17 and 1.14.In addition, risk of swelling at 3 months was 2.6 times greater for women in the control group; at 9 months, 7 times greater for women who had taxane-based chemotherapy; and at 15 months, the risk increased 1.16 times for each day the drain was in situ.CONCLUSION: Swelling in the first year is likely to be transient, and factors including exercise and taxane chemotherapy affect the risk of developing swelling.",0,0,0,0
23871490,"2 years versus 1 year of adjuvant trastuzumab for HER2-positive breast cancer (HERA): an open-label, randomised controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Trastuzumab has established efficacy against breast cancer with overexpression or amplification of the HER2 oncogene.The standard of care is 1 year of adjuvant trastuzumab, but the optimum duration of treatment is unknown.We compared 2 years of treatment with trastuzumab with 1 year of treatment, and updated the comparison of 1 year of trastuzumab versus observation at a median follow-up of 8 years, for patients enrolled in the HERceptin Adjuvant (HERA) trial.METHODS: The HERA trial is an international, multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial comparing treatment with trastuzumab for 1 and 2 years with observation after standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy, adjuvant chemotherapy, or both in 5102 patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer.The primary endpoint was disease-free survival.The comparison of 2 years versus 1 year of trastuzumab treatment involved a landmark analysis of 3105 patients who were disease-free 12 months after randomisation to one of the trastuzumab groups, and was planned after observing at least 725 disease-free survival events.The updated intention-to-treat comparison of 1 year trastuzumab treatment versus observation alone in 3399 patients at a median follow-up of 8 years (range 0-10) is also reported.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00045032.FINDINGS: We recorded 367 events of disease-free survival in 1552 patients in the 1 year group and 367 events in 1553 patients in the 2 year group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.99, 95% CI 0.85-1.14, p=0.86).Grade 3-4 adverse events and decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction during treatment were reported more frequently in the 2 year treatment group than in the 1 year group (342 [20.4%] vs 275 [16.3%] grade 3-4 adverse events, and 120 [7.2%] vs 69 [4.1%] decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction, respectively).HRs for a comparison of 1 year of trastuzumab treatment versus observation were 0.76 (95% CI 0.67-0.86, p<0.0001) for disease-free survival and 0.76 (0.65-0.88, p=0.0005) for overall survival, despite crossover of 884 (52%) patients from the observation group to trastuzumab therapy.INTERPRETATION: 2 years of adjuvant trastuzumab is not more effective than is 1 year of treatment for patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer.1 year of treatment provides a significant disease-free and overall survival benefit compared with observation and remains the standard of care.FUNDING: F Hoffmann-La Roche (Roche).",1,1,1,1
26070652,"Comparison of conventional L-thyroxine withdrawal and moderate hypothyroidism in preparation for whole-body 131-I scan and thyroglobulin testing.PURPOSE: After thyroidectomy for thyroid cancer, patients often withdraw L-T4 for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes, showing signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism.A slighter hypothyroidism (reducing L-T4 to one-half) has been proposed to limit these inconveniences.We evaluated half-dose L-T4 protocol, in comparison to conventional L-T4 withdrawal, in terms of effectiveness and improvement of clinical and biochemical disorders.METHODS: We randomized 55 thyroid cancer patients into two groups: 29 patients underwent 5 weeks of half-dose of previous L-T4 treatment (HD group); 26 patients replaced L-T4 with L-T3 for 3 weeks followed by 2 weeks of withdrawal (TW group).Clinical features (Zulewsky clinical score) and biochemical parameters (lipids, liver, and muscle enzymes) were evaluated in all patients at baseline and after 5 weeks.RESULTS: Total cholesterol, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase increased at 5 weeks in both groups, but significantly more in TW, but no difference was found by clinical score.Patients who achieved the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) target value (25 microU/ml) were 92.3% in TW group and 48.3% in HD group (p < 0.001).In the HD group, only basal TSH statistically correlated with the achievement of the TSH target.Receiver operating characteristic curves indicated that a basal TSH >/=0.52 muU/ml is required to reach an adequate TSH level.CONCLUSIONS: Half-dose L-T4 protocol, compared to conventional L-T4 withdrawal, is associated with less biochemical disorders but no significant clinical advantage.Therefore, the half-dose protocol reaches an adequate TSH target in 48.3% of patients and is not effective unless basal serum TSH is >/=0.52 muU/ml.",0,0,0,0
23899063,"Pathologic response and long-term follow-up in breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy: a comparison between classifications and their practical application.CONTEXT: Breast cancer is increasingly treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy to improve surgical resectability and evaluate tumor response, which is assessed histopathologically.Several histopathologic classification systems have been previously described for assessment of treatment response.OBJECTIVES: To test performance in a side-by-side comparison of several histopathologic classification systems after neoadjuvant chemotherapy with clinical outcome.DESIGN: Sixty-two patients were enrolled in a randomized trial receiving sequential neoadjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin and paclitaxel.Histologic sections from the patients' tumors sampled before (core biopsy) and after treatment (excision or mastectomy) were reviewed.Histologic response was assessed following National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project protocol B18, Miller-Payne grading, Sataloff tumor and nodes, Residual Cancer Burden (RCB), and Residual Disease in Breast and Nodes (RDBN).Pathologic classification results were correlated with survival using Kaplan-Meier and Cox hazards regression with a median follow-up of 93 months.RESULTS: RDBN was associated with distant disease-free survival by univariate and multivariate analysis (P = .01 and .004, respectively), as were lymph node metastases (P = .02 and .01, respectively).Five patients (8%) had complete pathologic response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and none of them relapsed during the study period.Survival was shorter among patients with higher Residual Cancer Burden scores, but the associations were not significant.Miller-Payne grading and Sataloff tumor scores were not correlated with survival.CONCLUSIONS: Evaluation of breast specimens after neoadjuvant chemotherapy by the composite index RDBN correlates with long-term outcome.The residual disease in breast and nodes system is suitable for routinely processed pathology cases.This study confirms the importance of lymph node status after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and favorable outcome in patients with pathologic complete response.",0,0,0,0
32987492,"Evaluation of postoperative pain in patients undergoing modified radical mastectomy with pectoralis or serratus-intercostal fascial plane blocks.BACKGROUND: Regional nerve blocks are an integral part of multimodal analgesia and should be chosen based on their efficacy, convenience, and minimal side effects.Here, we compare the use of pectoral (PEC II) and serratus-intercostal fascial plane (SIFP) blocks in breast carcinoma cases undergoing modified radical mastectomy (MRM) in terms of the postoperative analgesic efficacy and shoulder mobility.METHODS: The primary outcome of this prospective controlled study was to compare the postoperative static and dynamic pain scores, and the secondary outcome was to assess the shoulder pain, range of shoulder joint motion, and hemodynamic parameters.Sixty patients were randomly allocated to three groups and given general anesthesia.All patients received paracetamol, diclofenac, and rescue doses of tramadol based on the Institute's Acute Pain Service (APS) policy.No block was performed in group C (control), whereas groups P and S received PEC II and SIFP blocks, respectively, before surgical incision.RESULTS: The groups were comparable in terms of age, weight, height, and body mass index distribution (P > 0.05).Dynamic pain relief was significantly better 12 and 24 h postoperatively in groups P (P = 0.034 and P = 0.04, respectively) and S (P = 0.01 and P = 0.02, respectively) compared to group C.

25982801,"Prostate genetic score (PGS-33) is independently associated with risk of prostate cancer in the PLCO trial.BACKGROUND: To investigate the ability of the prostate genetic score (PGS-33), a germ-line biomarker of prostate cancer (PCa) risk, to categorize men participating in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial.METHODS: We obtained the genetic data from the Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility (CGEMS), a nested case control study examining germ-line DNA in the screened arm of the PLCO trial.A PGS-33 was calculated based on their genotype at 33 PCa associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).The primary outcome was the diagnosis of PCa and primary predictor was PGS-33.RESULTS: We identified 2,244 subjects (no cancer, N = 1017) and cases (N = 1227).The PGS-33 (P<0.001), prostate specific antigen (PSA; P < 0.001), family history of PCa (< 0.001), abnormal digital rectal exam (DRE, P < 0.001), and history of ever smoking (P = 0.037) were associated with a PCa diagnosis.In multivariable analysis, the log (PGS-33) was associated with PCa diagnosis with an odds ratio of 1.68 (95% CI 1.36-2.08, P < 0.001), log (PSA) (OR 8.2; 95% CI 6.75-10.04, P < 0.001), and family history of PCa (OR 2.01; 95% CI 1.26-3.20, P = 0.003).PGS-33 quartiles noted an increasing rate of PCa detection in addition to PSA: 43.2% (Q1), 47.8% (Q2), 58.8% (Q3), and 69.4 (Q4) (P < 0.001) and improvement in PSA performance (P < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Germ-line DNA in the form of the PGS-33 is able to risk stratify men regarding their risk of PCa.The PGS-33 may have implications regarding who may benefit most from PCa screening and possibly add to PSA performance.",0,0,0,0
32852553,"Effect of a Daily Text Messaging and Directly Supervised Therapy Intervention on Oral Mercaptopurine Adherence in Children With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia: A Randomized Clinical Trial.Importance: Suboptimal adherence to oral mercaptopurine treatment in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) increases the risk of relapse.A frequently expressed barrier to adherence is forgetfulness, which is often overcome by parental vigilance.Objective: To determine whether a multicomponent intervention, compared with education alone, will result in a higher proportion of patients with ALL who have mercaptopurine adherence rates 95% or higher, for all study participants and among patients younger than 12 years and vs those aged 12 years and older.Design, Setting, and Participants: The adherence intervention trial was an investigator-initiated, multi-institutional, parallel-group, unblinded, randomized clinical trial conducted between July 16, 2012, and August 8, 2018, at 59 Children's Oncology Group institutions in the US, enrolling patients with ALL diagnosed through age 21 years and receiving mercaptopurine for maintenance.The date of final follow-up was January 2, 2019.Data analysis was performed from February to October 2019.Interventions: Patients were randomized 1:1 to education alone or the intervention package, which consisted of education and personalized text message reminders daily to prompt directly supervised therapy.Four weeks of baseline adherence monitoring were followed with a 16-week intervention.Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was the proportion of patients with adherence rates 95% or higher over the duration of the intervention for all study participants, and for those younger than 12 years vs those aged 12 years and older.Results: There were 444 evaluable patients (median age, 8.1 years; interquartile range, 5.3-14.3 years), including 230 in the intervention group and 214 in the education group.Three hundred two patients (68.0%) were boys, 180 (40.5%) were non-Hispanic White, 170 (38.3%) were Hispanic, 43 (9.7%) were African American, and 51 (11.5%) were Asian or of mixed race/ethnicity.The proportion of patients with adherence rates 95% or higher did not differ between the intervention vs education groups (65% vs 59%; odds ratio, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.0-2.0; P = .08).Exploratory analyses showed that among patients aged 12 years and older, those in the intervention group had higher mean (SE) adherence rates than those in the education group (93.1% [1.1%] vs 90.0% [1.3%]; difference, 3.1%; 95% CI, 0.1%-6.0%; P = .04).In particular, among patients aged 12 years and older with baseline adherence less than 90%, those in the intervention group had higher mean (SE) adherence rates than those in the education group (83.4% [2.5%] vs 74.6% [3.4%]; difference, 8.8%; 95% CI, 2.2%-15.4%; P = .008).No safety concerns were identified.Conclusions and Relevance: Although this multicomponent intervention did not result in an increase in the proportion of patients with ALL who had mercaptopurine adherence rates 95% or higher, it did identify a high-risk subpopulation to target for future adherence intervention strategies: adolescents with low baseline adherence.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01503632.",0,0,0,0
32877884,"Reduced morbidity by using LigaSure compared to conventional inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy in vulvar cancer patients: A randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy (IFL) is part of the surgical treatment of different malignancies of the genital tract and/or the lower limb including vulvar carcinoma, penile carcinoma and melanoma.IFL is associated with morbidity in up to 85% of the patients.The aims of this MAMBO-IC study (Morbidity And Measurement of the Body) are to study the feasibility of using LigaSure for IFL and to assess the differences in the incidence of short-term complications using LigaSure versus conventional IFL randomized within each individual patient.METHODS: In this multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT), women diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva with an indication for bilateral IFL were included.It was randomly assigned for which groin the LigaSure was used; the other groin was treated with conventional IFL (sharp/diathermia).We estimated the incidence of >/=1 complication(s) per groin using logistic regression and compared this between the two surgical methods, adjusting for possible confounders.RESULTS: We included 40 groins of 20 patients.The estimated incidence of >/=1 complication(s) was 29% after LigaSure versus 70% after conventional IFL (risk difference 41% (95% CI 19-62), p < 0.001).Patients' reported restriction of daily living activities and maximum pain score were equal for both treatment methods.There were no differences in the surgeon reported workload scores.CONCLUSIONS: This RCT shows that LigaSure for IFL is feasible and associated with significantly less short-term surgical complications compared to conventional IFL.Further studies with a larger sample size are needed to validate our findings.ISRCTN15057626.",1,1,0,0
24081946,"Randomized multicenter phase II trial comparing two schedules of etirinotecan pegol (NKTR-102) in women with recurrent platinum-resistant/refractory epithelial ovarian cancer.PURPOSE: Etirinotecan pegol (NKTR-102) is a unique, long-acting topoisomerase-I inhibitor with prolonged systemic exposure to SN38 (7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin), the active metabolite of irinotecan.This randomized phase II trial investigated two dosing schedules of etirinotecan pegol in patients with platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian carcinoma.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 71 eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive etirinotecan pegol 145 mg/m(2) every 14 or 21 days until progression or unacceptable adverse events (AEs).The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR) by RECIST (version 1.0).Secondary end points included response by Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup criteria, duration of ORR, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).RESULTS: The overall confirmed ORR was 20% (95% CI, 10% to 30%): 20% for once every 14 days, and 19% for once every 21 days.Median response duration was 4.1 months for once every 14 days and 4.0 months for once every 21 days.Median PFS for every 14 and every 21 days was 4.1 and 5.3 months, respectively, and median OS was 10.0 and 11.7 months, respectively.Etirinotecan pegol was well tolerated, with the most common grade 3 to 4 AEs being dehydration (24%) and diarrhea (23%).Diarrhea, dehydration, nausea, and neutropenia were less frequent with the schedule of once every 21 days than with that of once every 14 days.CONCLUSION: Both schedules of etirinotecan pegol showed activity in patients with heavily pretreated ovarian cancer, with encouraging ORR and PFS rates.The schedule of once every 21 days was better tolerated and had slightly longer PFS and OS rates.The treatment schedule of etirinotecan pegol 145 mg/m(2) once every 21 days was selected for the expanded phase II study and is preferred for future phase III studies.These findings provide support to directly compare etirinotecan pegol versus one of the approved drugs (eg, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or topotecan) in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.",1,1,1,1
29656304,"The gentamicin-collagen implant and the risk of distant metastases of rectal cancer following short-course radiotherapy and curative resection: the long-term outcomes of a randomized study.PURPOSE: A previous randomized study conducted by our group showed that application of gentamicin-collagen implant (GCI) into the pelvic cavity after total mesorectal excision (TME) reduced the incidence of distant metastases.Therefore, we decided to conduct a confirmatory study.METHODS: Patients with rectal cancer were included in the study if they met the following criteria: adenocarcinoma of the rectum, preoperative short-term radiotherapy (5 x 5 Gy), and WHO performance score 0-1.RESULTS: One hundred seventy-six patients were randomly assigned either to an experimental group in which GCI was applied (n = 81) or to a control group without GCI (n = 81).Median follow-up was 80 months.Cumulative incidence of distant metastases at 5 years was higher in the control group compared to the experimental group: 23.5 vs 8.6% (HR 2.4 [95% CI 1.1-5.5], P = 0.005).Overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and cancer-specific survival (CSS) did not differ between the experimental group and the control group: HR 0.95 [95% CI 0.55-1.70], P = 0.864; HR 0.85 [95% CI 0.50-1.45], P = 0.548, and HR 0.5 [95%CI 0.22-1.22], P = 0.093, respectively.The predefined by the protocol subgroup analysis for yp stage III disease showed better DFS in the experimental group compared to the control group; HR 0.47 [95%CI 0.23-0.97], P = 0.042).CONCLUSIONS: The results confirmed our previous finding that GCI applied in the pelvis significantly reduced the rate of distant metastases in patients after radical rectal cancer resection.",0,0,0,0
33539944,"A phase II randomized trial of cobimetinib plus chemotherapy, with or without atezolizumab, as first-line treatment for patients with locally advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (COLET): primary analysis.BACKGROUND: Resistance to standard chemotherapy in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) is associated with upregulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway.Cobimetinib, an MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK) inhibitor, may increase sensitivity to taxanes and programmed death-ligand 1 inhibitors.COLET is a three-cohort phase II study evaluating first-line cobimetinib plus chemotherapy, with or without atezolizumab, in patients with locally advanced or mTNBC.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were >/=18 years with locally advanced or mTNBC.Following a safety run-in, patients in cohort I were randomized 1:1 to cobimetinib (60 mg, D3-D23 of each 28-day cycle) or placebo, plus paclitaxel (80 mg/m(2), D1, 8, and 15).Additional patients were randomized (1:1) to cohort II or III to receive cobimetinib plus atezolizumab (840 mg, D1 and D15) and either paclitaxel (cohort II) or nab-paclitaxel [cohort III (100 mg/m(2), D1, D8, and D15)].Primary endpoints were investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) (cohort I) and confirmed objective response rate (ORR) (cohorts II/III).Safety and tolerability were also assessed.RESULTS: In the expansion stages, median PFS was 5.5 months for cobimetinib/paclitaxel versus 3.8 months for placebo/paclitaxel in cohort I [hazard ratio 0.73; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.43-1.24; P = 0.25].In cohort I, ORR was 38.3% (95% CI 24.40-52.20) for cobimetinib/paclitaxel and 20.9% (95% CI 8.77-33.09) for placebo/paclitaxel; ORRs in cohorts II and III were 34.4% (95% CI 18.57-53.19) and 29.0% (95% CI 14.22-48.04), respectively.Diarrhea was the most common grade >/=3 adverse events across all cohorts.CONCLUSIONS: Cobimetinib added to paclitaxel did not lead to a statistically significant increase in PFS or ORR, although a nonsignificant trend toward a numerical increase was observed.Cobimetinib plus atezolizumab and a taxane did not appear to increase ORR.This demonstrates the potential activity of a combinatorial MEK inhibitor, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy in this difficult-to-treat population.",1,1,1,1

Subgroup analysis from a randomized trial (TARGIT-A).Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) with low-energy x-rays is increasingly used in breast-conserving therapy (BCT).Previous non-randomized studies have observed mammographic changes in the tumor bed to be more pronounced after IORT.The purpose of this study was to reassess the postoperative changes in a randomized single-center subgroup of patients from a multicenter trial (TARGIT-A).In this subgroup (n = 48) 27 patients received BCT with IORT, 21 patients had BCT with standard whole-breast radiotherapy serving as controls.Overall 258 postoperative mammograms (median follow-up 4.3 years, range 3-8) were retrospectively evaluated by two radiologists in consensus focusing on changes in the tumor bed.Fat necroses showed to be significantly more frequent (56% versus 24%) and larger (8.7 versus 1.6 sq cm, median) after IORT than those in controls.Scar calcifications were also significantly more frequent after IORT (63% versus 19%).The high incidence of large fat necroses in our study confirms previous study findings.However, the overall higher incidence of calcifications in the tumor bed after IORT represents a new finding, requiring further attention.",0,0,0,0
28189429,"Regular Aspirin Use and the Risk of Lethal Prostate Cancer in the Physicians' Health Study.BACKGROUND: Regular aspirin use probably protects against some malignancies including prostate cancer (PC), but its impact on lethal PC is particularly unclear.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between regular aspirin and (1) the risk of lethal PC in a large prospective cohort and (2) survival after PC diagnosis.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In 1981/82, the Physicians' Health Study randomized 22 071 healthy male physicians to aspirin, beta-carotene, both, or placebo.After the trial ended in 1988, annual questionnaires have obtained data on aspirin use, cancer diagnoses, and outcomes up to 2009 for the whole cohort, and to 2015 for PC patients.OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: We evaluated the relationship between regular aspirin (>3 tablets/week) and lethal PC (metastases or PC death).Cox proportional-hazards models estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for the risk of lethal PC in the whole cohort and postdiagnosis survival among men initially diagnosed with nonlethal PC.RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Risk analysis revealed that 502 men developed lethal PC by 2009.Current and past regular aspirin was associated with a lower risk of lethal PC (current: HR 0.68, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.52-0.89; past: HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.40-0.74) compared to never users.In the survival analysis, 407/3277 men diagnosed with nonlethal PC developed lethal disease by 2015.Current postdiagnostic aspirin was associated with lower risks of lethal PC (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.52-0.90) and overall mortality (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61-0.9).We could not assess aspirin dose, and inconsistencies were observed in some sensitivity analyses.CONCLUSIONS: Current regular aspirin use was associated with a lower risk of lethal PC among all participants.Current postdiagnostic use was associated with improved survival after diagnosis, consistent with a potential inhibitory effect of aspirin on PC progression.A randomized trial is warranted to confirm or refute these findings.PATIENT SUMMARY: We examined the potential effect of regular aspirin use on lethal prostate cancer.We found that taking aspirin was associated with a lower risk of lethal prostate cancer, and taking it after diagnosis may help to prevent prostate cancer from becoming fatal.",0,0,0,0
25057173,"EGFR biomarkers predict benefit from vandetanib in combination with docetaxel in a randomized phase III study of second-line treatment of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.BACKGROUND: ZODIAC was a randomized phase III study of second-line treatment in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that evaluated the addition of vandetanib to docetaxel.The study showed a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival and objective response rate, but not in overall survival for unselected patients.This study evaluated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutation, copy number gain, and protein expression, and KRAS gene mutation, in pretreatment tumor samples as potential biomarkers predicting benefit from vandetanib as second-line treatment of NSCLC.PATIENTS AND METHODS: After progression following first-line chemotherapy, 1391 patients with locally advanced or metastatic (stage IIIB/IV) NSCLC were randomized 1 : 1 to receive vandetanib (100 mg/day) plus docetaxel (75 mg/m(2) every 21 days) or placebo plus docetaxel in the ZODIAC study.Archival tumor samples (n = 570) were collected from consenting patients (n = 958) for predefined, prospective biomarker analyses.RESULTS: Of evaluable samples, 14% were EGFR mutation positive, 35% were EGFR FISH positive, 88% were EGFR protein expression positive, and 13% were KRAS mutation positive.Compared with the overall study population, in which progression-free survival (PFS) [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.79] but not OS (HR = 0.91) were significantly improved with vandetanib, there was greater relative clinical benefit for patients with EGFR mutation-positive tumors [PFS HR 0.51, confidence interval (CI) 0.25-1.06 and OS HR 0.46, CI 0.14-1.57] and EGFR FISH-positive tumors (PFS HR 0.61, CI 0.39-0.94 and OS HR 0.48, CI 0.28-0.84).Similarly, patients with EGFR mutation or FISH-positive tumor samples who received vandetanib had an increased chance of objective tumor response (odds ratios 3.34, CI 0.8-13.89, and 3.90, CI 1.02-14.82, respectively).There did not appear to be benefit for vandetanib in patients with KRAS mutation-positive tumors.CONCLUSIONS: High EGFR gene copy number or activating EGFR mutations may identify patient subgroups who receive increased clinical benefit from vandetanib in combination with docetaxel in second-line NSCLC.CLINICALTRIALSGOV: NCT00312377.",1,1,1,1
33891194,"Clinical usefulness of eribulin as first- or second-line chemotherapy for recurrent HER2-negative breast cancer: a randomized phase II study (JBCRG-19).BACKGROUND: Anthracycline (A) or taxane T-based regimens are the standard early-line chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer (BC).A previous study has shown a survival benefit of eribulin in heavily pretreated advanced/recurrent BC patients.The present study aimed to compare the benefit of eribulin with treatment of physician's choice (TPC) as first- or second-line chemotherapy for recurrent HER2-negative BC.METHODS: Patients with recurrent HER2-negative BC previously receiving anthracycline and taxane AT-based chemotherapy in the adjuvant or first-line setting were eligible for this open-label, randomized, parallel-group study.Patients were randomized 1:1 by the minimization method to receive either eribulin (1.4 mg/m(2) on day one and eight of each 21-day cycle) or TPC (paclitaxel, docetaxel, nab-paclitaxel or vinorelbine) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS).Secondary endpoints included time to treatment failure (TTF), overall response rate (ORR), duration of response, and safety (UMIN000009886).RESULTS: Between May 2013 and January 2017, 58 patients were randomized, 57 of whom (26 eribulin and 31 TPC) were analyzed for efficacy.The median PFS was 6.6 months with eribulin versus 4.2 months with TPC (hazard ratio: 0.72 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.40-1.30], p = 0.276).Median TTF was 6.0 months with eribulin versus 3.6 months with TPC (hazard ratio: 0.66 [95% CI, 0.39-1.14], p = 0.136).Other endpoints were also similar between groups.The most common grade >/= 3 adverse event was neutropenia (22.2% with eribulin versus 16.1% with TPC).CONCLUSIONS: Eribulin seemed to improve PFS or TTF compared with TPC without statistical significance.Further validation studies are needed.",1,1,1,1
27557302,"Daratumumab, Bortezomib, and Dexamethasone for Multiple Myeloma.BACKGROUND: Daratumumab, a human IgGkappa monoclonal antibody that targets CD38, induces direct and indirect antimyeloma activity and has shown substantial efficacy as monotherapy in heavily pretreated patients with multiple myeloma, as well as in combination with bortezomib in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.METHODS: In this phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 498 patients with relapsed or relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma to receive bortezomib (1.3 mg per square meter of body-surface area) and dexamethasone (20 mg) alone (control group) or in combination with daratumumab (16 mg per kilogram of body weight) (daratumumab group).The primary end point was progression-free survival.RESULTS: A prespecified interim analysis showed that the rate of progression-free survival was significantly higher in the daratumumab group than in the control group; the 12-month rate of progression-free survival was 60.7% in the daratumumab group versus 26.9% in the control group.After a median follow-up period of 7.4 months, the median progression-free survival was not reached in the daratumumab group and was 7.2 months in the control group (hazard ratio for progression or death with daratumumab vs. control, 0.39; 95% confidence interval, 0.28 to 0.53; P<0.001).The rate of overall response was higher in the daratumumab group than in the control group (82.9% vs. 63.2%, P<0.001), as were the rates of very good partial response or better (59.2% vs. 29.1%, P<0.001) and complete response or better (19.2% vs. 9.0%, P=0.001).Three of the most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events reported in the daratumumab group and the control group were thrombocytopenia (45.3% and 32.9%, respectively), anemia (14.4% and 16.0%, respectively), and neutropenia (12.8% and 4.2%, respectively).Infusion-related reactions that were associated with daratumumab treatment were reported in 45.3% of the patients in the daratumumab group; these reactions were mostly grade 1 or 2 (grade 3 in 8.6% of the patients), and in 98.2% of these patients, they occurred during the first infusion.CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with relapsed or relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, daratumumab in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone resulted in significantly longer progression-free survival than bortezomib and dexamethasone alone and was associated with infusion-related reactions and higher rates of thrombocytopenia and neutropenia than bortezomib and dexamethasone alone.(Funded by Janssen Research and Development; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02136134.).",1,1,1,1

29034009,"A multicenter, randomized study of decitabine as epigenetic priming with induction chemotherapy in children with AML.BACKGROUND: Decitabine is a deoxycytidine nucleoside derivative inhibitor of DNA-methyltransferases, which has been studied extensively and is approved for myelodysplastic syndrome in adults but with less focus in children.Accordingly, we conducted a phase 1 multicenter, randomized, open-label study to evaluate decitabine pre-treatment before standard induction therapy in children with newly diagnosed AML to assess safety and tolerability and explore a number of biologic endpoints.RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were fully assessable for all study objectives per protocol (10 in Arm A = epigenetic priming induction, 14 in Arm B = standard induction).All patients experienced neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.The most common grade 3 and 4 non-hematologic adverse events observed were gastrointestinal toxicities and hypophosphatemia.Plasma decitabine PK were similar to previously reported adult data.Overall CR/CRi was similar for the two arms.MRD negativity at end-induction was 85% in Arm A versus 67% in Arm B patients.DNA methylation measured in peripheral blood over the course of treatment tracked with blast clearance and matched marrow aspirates at day 0 and day 21.Unlike end-induction marrow analyses, promoter methylation in blood identified an apparent reversal of response in the lone treatment failure, 1 week prior to the patient's marrow aspirate confirming non-response.Decitabine-induced effects on end-induction (day 35-43 following initiation of treatment) marrows in Arm A were reflected by changes in DNA methylation in matched paired marrow diagnostic aspirates.CONCLUSIONS: This first-in-pediatrics trial demonstrates that decitabine prior to standard combination chemotherapy is feasible and well tolerated in children with newly diagnosed AML.Pre-treatment with decitabine may represent a newer therapeutic option for pediatric AML, especially as it appears to induce important epigenetic alterations.The novel biological correlates studied in this trial offer a clinically relevant window into disease progression and remission.Additional studies are needed to definitively assess whether decitabine can enhance durability responses in children with AML.TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT01177540.",1,1,1,1
26425050,"Effect of Propofol and Desflurane on Immune Cell Populations in Breast Cancer Patients: A Randomized Trial.Several factors can affect the perioperative immune function.We evaluated the effect of propofol and desflurane anesthesia on the surgery-induced immune perturbation in patients undergoing breast cancer surgery.The patients were randomly assigned to receive propofol (n = 20) or desflurane (n = 20) anesthesia.The total and differential white blood cell counts were determined with lymphocyte subpopulations before and 1 hr after anesthesia induction and at 24 hr postoperatively.Plasma concentrations of interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-4 were also measured.Both propofol and desflurane anesthesia preserved the IL-2/IL-4 and CD4(+)/CD8(+) T cell ratio.Leukocytes were lower in the propofol group than in the desflurane group at 1 hr after induction (median [quartiles], 4.98 [3.87-6.31] vs. 5.84 [5.18-7.94] 10(3)/microL) and 24 hr postoperatively (6.92 [5.54-6.86] vs. 7.62 [6.22-9.21] 10(3)/microL).NK cells significantly decreased 1 hr after induction in the propofol group (0.41 [0.34-0.53] to 0.25 [0.21-0.33] 10(3)/microL), but not in the desflurane group (0.33 [0.29-0.48] to 0.38 [0.30-0.56] 10(3)/microL).Our findings indicate that both propofol and desflurane anesthesia for breast cancer surgery induce a favorable immune response in terms of preservation of IL-2/IL-4 and CD4(+)/CD8(+) T cell ratio in the perioperative period.With respect to leukocytes and NK cells, desflurane anesthesia is associated with less adverse immune responses than propofol anesthesia during surgery for breast cancer.(Clinical trial registration at https://cris.nih.go.kr/cris number: KCT0000939).",0,0,0,0
27098346,"Fitness outcomes from a randomised controlled trial of exercise training for men with prostate cancer: the ENGAGE study.PURPOSE: The main purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a 12-week, clinician-referred, community-based exercise training program with supervised and unsupervised sessions for men with prostate cancer.The secondary purpose was to determine whether androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) modified responses to exercise training.METHODS: Secondary analysis was undertaken on data from a multicentre cluster randomised controlled trial in which 15 clinicians were randomly assigned to refer eligible patients to an exercise training intervention (n = 8) or to provide usual care (n = 7).Data from 119 patients (intervention n = 53, control n = 66) were available for this analysis.Outcome measures included fitness and physical function, anthropometrics, resting heart rate, and blood pressure.RESULTS: Compared to the control condition, men in the intervention significantly improved their 6-min walk distance (M diff = 49.98 m, p adj = 0.001), leg strength (M diff = 21.82 kg, p adj = 0.001), chest strength (M diff = 6.91 kg, p adj = 0.001), 30-s sit-to-stand result (M diff = 3.38 reps, p adj = 0.001), and reach distance (M diff = 4.8 cm, p adj = 0.024).A significant difference (unadjusted for multiplicity) in favour of men in the intervention was also found for resting heart rate (M diff = -3.76 beats/min, p = 0.034).ADT did not modify responses to exercise training.CONCLUSIONS: Men with prostate cancer who act upon clinician referrals to community-based exercise training programs can improve their strength, physical functioning, and, potentially, cardiovascular health, irrespective of whether or not they are treated with ADT.IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Clinicians should inform men with prostate cancer about the benefits of exercise and refer them to appropriately qualified exercise practitioners and suitable community-based programs.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australia and New Zealand Clinical Trials Register (ANZCTR): ACTRN12610000609055.",0,0,0,0

25712685,"Rilotumumab exposure-response relationship in patients with advanced or metastatic gastric cancer.PURPOSE: Rilotumumab is an investigational, fully human monoclonal antibody to hepatocyte growth factor.In a randomized phase II study, trends toward improved survival were observed with rilotumumab (7.5 or 15 mg/kg) plus epirubicin, cisplatin, and capecitabine (ECX) versus placebo plus ECX in gastric/gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer patients, especially in MET-positive patients.Here, we quantitatively characterized the longitudinal exposure-response [tumor growth (TG) and overall survival (OS)] relationship for rilotumumab.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Rilotumumab concentrations, tumor sizes, and survival time from the phase II study were pooled to develop a longitudinal exposure versus TG model and parametric OS model that explored predictive/prognostic/treatment effects (MET expression, rilotumumab exposure, relative tumor size).Model evaluation included visual predictive checks, nonparametric bootstrap, and normalized prediction distribution errors.Simulations were undertaken to predict the relationship between rilotumumab dose and OS.RESULTS: Rilotumumab exhibited linear time-independent pharmacokinetics not affected by MET expression.The TG model adequately described tumor size across arms.A Weibull distribution best described OS.Rilotumumab exposure and change in tumor size from baseline at week 24 were predictive of OS.MET-positive patients showed shorter survival and responded better to rilotumumab than MET-negative patients.Simulations predicted a median (95% confidence interval) HR of 0.38 (0.18-0.60) in MET-positive patients treated with 15 mg/kg rilotumumab Q3W.CONCLUSIONS: Rilotumumab plus ECX demonstrated concentration-dependent effects on OS, influenced by MET expression, and tumor size in gastric/GEJ cancer patients.These findings support the phase II testing of rilotumumab 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks in MET-positive gastric/GEJ cancer (RILOMET-1; NCT01697072).",0,0,0,0
26897518,"TOPical Imiquimod treatment of high-grade Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (TOPIC trial): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) is the premalignant condition of cervical cancer.Whereas not all high grade CIN lesions progress to cervical cancer, the natural history and risk of progression of individual lesions remain unpredictable.Therefore, high-grade CIN is currently treated by surgical excision: large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ).This procedure has potential complications, such as acute haemorrhage, prolonged bleeding, infection and preterm birth in subsequent pregnancies.These complications could be prevented by development of a non-invasive treatment modality, such as topical imiquimod treatment.The primary study objective is to investigate the efficacy of topical imiquimod 5% cream for the treatment of high-grade CIN and to develop a biomarker profile to predict clinical response to imiquimod treatment.Secondary study objectives are to assess treatment side-effects, disease recurrence and quality of life during and after different treatment modalities.METHODS/DESIGN: The study design is a randomized controlled trial.One hundred forty women with a histological diagnosis of high-grade CIN (CIN 2-3) will be randomized into two arms: imiquimod treatment during 16 weeks (experimental arm) or immediate LLETZ (standard care arm).Treatment efficacy will be evaluated by colposcopy with diagnostic biopsies at 20 weeks for the experimental arm.Successful imiquimod treatment is defined as regression to CIN 1 or less, successful LLETZ treatment is defined as PAP 1 after 6 months.Disease recurrence will be evaluated by cytology at 6, 12 and 24 months after treatment.Side-effects will be evaluated using a standardized report form.Quality of life will be evaluated using validated questionnaires at baseline, 20 weeks and 1 year after treatment.Biomarkers, reflecting both host and viral factors in the pathophysiology of CIN, will be tested at baseline with the aim of developing a predictive biomarker profile for the clinical response to imiquimod treatment.DISCUSSION: Treatment of high-grade CIN lesions with imiquimod in a selected patient population may diminish complications as a result of surgical intervention.More knowledge on treatment efficacy, side effects and long-term recurrence rates after treatment is necessary.TRIAL REGISTRATION: EU Clinical Trials Register EU-CTR2013-001260-34 .Registered 18 March 2013.Medical Ethical Committee approval number: NL44336.068.13 (Medical Ethical Committee Maastricht University Hospital, University of Maastricht).Affiliation: Maastricht University Hospital.Registration number ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02329171.",1,1,1,1

Results from the GEICAM/2006-03, multicenter study.Chemotherapy remains as the only systemic treatment option available for basal-like breast cancer (BC) patients.Preclinical models and several phase II studies suggested that platinum salts are active drugs in this BC subtype though there is no randomized study supporting this hypothesis.This study investigates if the addition of carboplatin to a combination of an alkylating agent together with anthracyclines and taxanes is able to increase the efficacy in the neoadjuvant treatment context.Patients with operable breast cancer and immunophenotypically defined basal-like disease (ER-/PR-/HER2- and cytokeratin 5/6+ or EGFR+) were recruited.Patients were randomized to receive EC (epirubicin 90 mg/m(2) plus cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2) for 4 cycles) followed either by D (docetaxel 100 mg/m(2) x 4 cycles; EC-D) or DCb (docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) plus carboplatin AUC 6 x 4 cycles; EC-DCb).The primary end point was pathological complete response (pCR) in the breast following the Miller and Payne criteria.Ninety-four patients were randomized (46 EC-D, 48 EC-DCb).pCR rate in the breast was seen in 16 patients (35 %) with EC-D and 14 patients (30 %) with EC-DCb (P value = 0.61).pCR in the breast and axilla was seen in 30 % of patients in both arms.The overall clinical response rate was 70 % (95 % CI 56-83) in the EC-D arm and 77 % (95 % CI 65-87) in the EC-DCb arm.Grade 3/4 toxicity was similar in both arms.The addition of carboplatin to conventional chemotherapy with EC-D in basal-like breast cancer patients did not improve the efficacy probably because they had already received an alkylating agent.These findings should be taken into consideration when developing new agents for this disease.",1,1,1,1
26796802,"[A multicenter, randomized, controlled, phase clinical study of PEG-rhG-CSF for preventing chemotherapy-induced neutropenia in patients with breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer].OBJECTIVE: To explore the safety and efficacy of pegylated recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (PEG-rhG-CSF) in preventing chemotherapy-induced neutropenia in patients with breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and to provide the basis for clinical application.METHODS: According to the principle of open-label, randomized, parallel-group controlled clinical trial, all patients were randomized by 1ratio1ratio1 into three groups to receive PEG-rhG-CSF 100 mug/kg, PEG-rhG-CSF 6 mg, or rhG-CSF 5 mug/kg, respectively.The patients with breast cancer received two chemotherapy cycles, and the NSCLC patients received 1-2 cycles of chemotherapy according to their condition.All patients were treated with the combination chemotherapy of TAC (docetaxel+ epirubicin+ cyclophosphamide) or TA (docetaxel+ epirubicin), or the chemotherapy of docetaxel combined with carboplatin, with a 21 day cycle.RESULTS: The duration of grade 3-4 neutropenia in the PEG-rhG-CSF 100 mug/kg and PEG-rhG-CSF 6 mg groups were similar with that in the rhG-CSF 5 mug/kg group (P>0.05 for all).The incidence rate of grade 3-4 neutropenia in the PEG-rhG-CSF 100 mug/kg group, PEG-rhG-CSF 6 mg group, and G-CSF 5 mug/kg group were 69.7%, 68.4%, and 69.5%, respectively, with a non-significant difference among the three groups (P=0.963).The incidence rate of febrile neutropenia in the PEG-rhG-CSF 100 mug/kg group, PEG-rhG-CSF 6 mg group and G-CSF 5 mug/kg group were 6.1%, 6.4%, and 5.5%, respectively, showing no significant difference among them (P=0.935).The incidence rate of adverse events in the PEG-rhG-CSF 100 mug/kg group, PEG-rhG-CSF 6 mg group and G-CSF 5 mug / kg group were 6.7%, 4.1%, and 5.5%, respectively, showing a non-significant difference among them (P=0.581).CONCLUSIONS: In patients with breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) undergoing TAC/TA chemotherapy, a single 100 mug/kg injection or a single fixed 6 mg dose of PEG-rhG-CSF at 48 hours after chemotherapy show definite therapeutic effect with a low incidence of adverse events and mild adverse reactions.Compared with the continuous daily injection of rhG-CSF 5 mug/kg/d, a single 100 mug/kg injection or a single fixed 6 mg dose of PEG-rhG-CSF has similar effect and is more advantageous in preventing chemotherapy-induced neutropenia.",0,0,0,0
28756902,"Bevacizumab for advanced cervical cancer: final overall survival and adverse event analysis of a randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 3 trial (Gynecologic Oncology Group 240).BACKGROUND: On Aug 14, 2014, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the antiangiogenesis drug bevacizumab for women with advanced cervical cancer on the basis of improved overall survival (OS) after the second interim analysis (in 2012) of 271 deaths in the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) 240 trial.In this study, we report the prespecified final analysis of the primary objectives, OS and adverse events.METHODS: In this randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 3 trial, we recruited patients with metastatic, persistent, or recurrent cervical carcinoma from 81 centres in the USA, Canada, and Spain.Inclusion criteria included a GOG performance status score of 0 or 1; adequate renal, hepatic, and bone marrow function; adequately anticoagulated thromboembolism; a urine protein to creatinine ratio of less than 1; and measurable disease.Patients who had received chemotherapy for recurrence and those with non-healing wounds or active bleeding conditions were ineligible.We randomly allocated patients 1:1:1:1 (blocking used; block size of four) to intravenous chemotherapy of either cisplatin (50 mg/m(2) on day 1 or 2) plus paclitaxel (135 mg/m(2) or 175 mg/m(2) on day 1) or topotecan (0.75 mg/m(2) on days 1-3) plus paclitaxel (175 mg/m(2) on day 1) with or without intravenous bevacizumab (15 mg/kg on day 1) in 21 day cycles until disease progression, unacceptable toxic effects, voluntary withdrawal by the patient, or complete response.We stratified randomisation by GOG performance status (0 vs 1), previous radiosensitising platinum-based chemotherapy, and disease status (recurrent or persistent vs metastatic).We gave treatment open label.Primary outcomes were OS (analysed in the intention-to-treat population) and adverse events (analysed in all patients who received treatment and submitted adverse event information), assessed at the second interim and final analysis by the masked Data and Safety Monitoring Board.The cutoff for final analysis was 450 patients with 346 deaths.This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00803062.FINDINGS: Between April 6, 2009, and Jan 3, 2012, we enrolled 452 patients (225 [50%] in the two chemotherapy-alone groups and 227 [50%] in the two chemotherapy plus bevacizumab groups).By March 7, 2014, 348 deaths had occurred, meeting the prespecified cutoff for final analysis.The chemotherapy plus bevacizumab groups continued to show significant improvement in OS compared with the chemotherapy-alone groups: 16.8 months in the chemotherapy plus bevacizumab groups versus 13.3 months in the chemotherapy-alone groups (hazard ratio 0.77 [95% CI 0.62-0.95]; p=0.007).Final OS among patients not receiving previous pelvic radiotherapy was 24.5 months versus 16.8 months (0.64 [0.37-1.10]; p=0.11).Postprogression OS was not significantly different between the chemotherapy plus bevacizumab groups (8.4 months) and chemotherapy-alone groups (7.1 months; 0.83 [0.66-1.05]; p=0.06).Fistula (any grade) occurred in 32 (15%) of 220 patients in the chemotherapy plus bevacizumab groups (all previously irradiated) versus three (1%) of 220 in the chemotherapy-alone groups (all previously irradiated).Grade 3 fistula developed in 13 (6%) versus one (<1%).No fistulas resulted in surgical emergencies, sepsis, or death.INTERPRETATION: The benefit conferred by incorporation of bevacizumab is sustained with extended follow-up as evidenced by the overall survival curves remaining separated.After progression while receiving bevacizumab, we did not observe a negative rebound effect (ie, shorter survival after bevacizumab is stopped than after chemotherapy alone is stopped).These findings represent proof-of-concept of the efficacy and tolerability of antiangiogenesis therapy in advanced cervical cancer.FUNDING: National Cancer Institute.",0,0,0,0
23957945,"Initial biopsy Gleason score as a predictive marker for survival benefit in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with docetaxel: data from the TAX327 study.BACKGROUND: Since 2004, docetaxel has been the standard first-line systemic therapy for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).With abiraterone recently becoming available in the predocetaxel setting, it is warranted to identify subgroups of patients who may obtain the greatest benefit from docetaxel and particularly qualify for receiving docetaxel as first-line treatment for mCRPC.OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify factors that could characterize subgroups of patients who obtain the greatest benefit from the use of docetaxel.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: TAX327 was multinational, randomized, phase 3 study that was conducted from 2000 to 2002 in 1006 men with mCRPC.INTERVENTION: Patients were randomized to receive docetaxel every 3 wk (D3), weekly docetaxel (D1), or mitoxantrone every 3 wk (M3), each with prednisone.OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: We investigated whether patients with poorly differentiated tumors (Gleason score >/=7) at diagnosis had greater benefit from D3 compared with M3 than patients with better differentiated tumors (Gleason score </=6).Using a Cox model, we compared overall survival (OS) between the treatment groups within each subgroup of Gleason score.RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: The TAX 327 data showed that the OS benefit of D3 versus M3 was greater in patients with high-grade tumors (median OS: 18.9 vs 14.5 mo; p=0.009) than in patients with low-grade tumors (median OS: 21.6 vs 20.7 mo; p=0.674).Limitations of a retrospective analysis apply.CONCLUSIONS: The survival benefit obtained with docetaxel is most pronounced in patients with high-Gleason-score tumors (Gleason >/=7).In a time of shifting paradigms in mCRPC, with abiraterone becoming available prior to docetaxel chemotherapy, Gleason score may help in selecting patients who obtain the greatest benefit from docetaxel as first-line treatment for mCRPC.Prospective validation of these findings is warranted.",1,1,1,1

27634489,"Hughes Abdominal Repair Trial (HART) - Abdominal wall closure techniques to reduce the incidence of incisional hernias: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Incisional hernias are common complications of midline closure following abdominal surgery and cause significant morbidity, impaired quality of life and increased health care costs.The 'Hughes Repair' combines a standard mass closure with a series of horizontal and two vertical mattress sutures within a single suture.This theoretically distributes the load along the incision length as well as across it.There is evidence to suggest that this technique is as effective as mesh repair for the operative management of incisional hernias; however, no trials have compared the Hughes Repair with standard mass closure for the prevention of incisional hernia formation following a midline incision.METHODS/DESIGN: This is a 1:1 randomised controlled trial comparing two suture techniques for the closure of the midline abdominal wound following surgery for colorectal cancer.Full ethical approval has been gained (Wales REC 3, MREC 12/WA/0374).Eight hundred patients will be randomised from approximately 20 general surgical units within the United Kingdom.Patients undergoing open or laparoscopic (more than a 5-cm midline incision) surgery for colorectal cancer, elective or emergency, are eligible.Patients under the age of 18 years, those having mesh inserted or undergoing musculofascial flap closure of the perineal defect in abdominoperineal wound closure, and those unable to give informed consent will be excluded.Patients will be randomised intraoperatively to either the Hughes Repair or standard mass closure.The primary outcome measure is the incidence of incisional hernias at 1 year as assessed by standardised clinical examination.The secondary outcomes include quality of life patient-reported outcome measures, cost-utility analysis, incidence of complete abdominal wound dehiscence and C-POSSUM scores.The incidence of incisional hernia at 1 year, assessed by computerised tomography, will form a tertiary outcome.DISCUSSION: A feasibility phase has been completed.The results of the study will be used to inform current and future practice and potentially reduce the risk of incisional hernia formation following midline incisions.TRIAL REGISTRATION: TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN 25616490 .Registered on 1 January 2012.",0,0,0,0
34351555,"Three-year outcomes of a randomized phase III trial comparing adjuvant chemotherapy with S-1 plus docetaxel versus S-1 alone in stage III gastric cancer: JACCRO GC-07.PURPOSE: The second planned interim analysis (median follow-up 12.5 months) in a phase III trial of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy for stage III gastric cancer revealed significant improvement in relapse-free survival (RFS) for S-1 plus docetaxel over S-1 alone.Although enrollment was terminated on the recommendation of the independent data and safety monitoring committee, we continued follow-up and herein report on 3-year RFS, the primary endpoint.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with histologically confirmed stage III gastric cancer who underwent gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy were randomly assigned to receive adjuvant chemotherapy with either S-1 plus docetaxel or S-1 alone.In the S-1 plus docetaxel group, S-1 was given orally for 2 weeks followed by 1 week of rest for seven courses, and docetaxel was given intravenously on day 1 of the second to seventh courses.The combination therapy was followed by S-1 monotherapy for up to 1 year.RESULTS: The 3-year RFS rate of the S-1 plus docetaxel group was 67.7%.This was significantly superior to that of 57.4% in the S-1 group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.715, 95% CI 0.587-0.871, P = 0.0008).This translated into a significant benefit in the 3-year overall survival (OS) rate in the S-1 plus docetaxel group (77.7% versus 71.2%, HR 0.742, 95% CI 0.596-0.925, P = 0.0076).CONCLUSION: On 3-year follow-up data, postoperative adjuvant therapy with S-1 plus docetaxel was confirmed to improve both RFS and OS and can be recommended as a standard of care for patients with stage III gastric cancer treated by D2 dissection.",1,1,1,1
30063723,"Associations of angiogenesis-related proteins with specific prognostic factors, breast cancer subtypes and survival outcome in early-stage breast cancer patients. A Hellenic Cooperative Oncology Group (HeCOG) trial.Several studies support an important role of angiogenesis in breast cancer growth and metastasis.The main objectives of the study were to investigate the immunohistochemical expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family ligands (VEGF-A and VEGF-C) and receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3) in breast cancer and their associations with clinicopathological parameters, cancer subtypes/subgroups and patient outcome.Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue samples were collected from early-stage breast cancer patients treated with anthracycline-based chemotherapy within a randomized trial.Immunohistochemistry was performed on serial 2.5 mum thick tissue sections from tissue microarray blocks.High VEGF-A, VEGF-C, VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3 protein expression was observed in 11.8% (N = 87), 80.8% (N = 585), 28.1% (N = 202), 64.6% (N = 359) and 71.8% (N = 517) of the cases, respectively.Significant associations were observed among all proteins (all p-values <0.05), with the exception of the one between VEGF-C and VEGFR1 (chi-square test, p = 0.15).Tumors with high VEGF-A protein expression, as compared to tumors with low expression were more frequently ER/PgR-negative (33.3% vs. 20.8%, chi-square test, p = 0.009) and HER2-positive (44.8% vs. 20.6%, p<0.001).In addition, tumors with high VEGFR1 expression, were more frequently HER2-positive (32.8% vs. 19.6%, p<0.001), while tumors with high VEGFR3 expression were more frequently ER/PgR-negative (24.9% vs. 17.0%, p = 0.024) and HER2-positive (26.9% vs. 14.8%, p = 0.001).High VEGF-A and VEGF-C protein expression was associated with increased DFS in the entire cohort (HR = 0.57, 95% CI 0.36-0.92, Wald's p = 0.020 and HR = 0.71, 95% CI 0.52-0.96, p = 0.025, respectively), as well as in specific subtypes/subgroups, such as HER2-positive (VEGF-A, HR = 0.32, 95% CI 0.14-0.74, p = 0.008) and triple-negative (VEGF-C, HR = 0.44, 95% CI 0.21-0.91, p = 0.027) patients.High vs. low VEGFR1 expression was an unfavorable factor for DFS in triple-negative patients (HR = 2.74, 95% CI 1.26-5.98, p = 0.011), whereas the opposite was observed among the ER/PgR-positive patients (HR = 0.69, 95% CI 0.48-0.98, p = 0.041).Regarding OS, high VEGF-C protein expression was associated with increased OS in the entire cohort (HR = 0.64, 95% CI 0.46-0.89, Wald's p = 0.008), as well as in in specific subtypes/subgroups, such as ER/PgR-negative (HR = 0.37, 95% CI 0.20-0.71, p = 0.003) and triple-negative (HR = 0.42, 95% CI 0.19-0.90, p = 0.026) patients.In conclusion, high expression of angiogenesis-related proteins is associated with adverse clinicopathological parameters in early-stage breast cancer patients and may be surrogate markers of biologically distinct subgroups of ER/PgR-negative or triple-negative tumors with superior outcome.Further validation of our findings in independent cohorts is needed.",0,0,0,0
34863145,"A sexual rehabilitation intervention for women with gynaecological cancer receiving radiotherapy (SPARC study): design of a multicentre randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Sexual problems are frequently reported after treatment with radiotherapy (RT) for gynaecological cancer (GC), in particular after combined external beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy (EBRT+BT).Studies demonstrate that psychosexual support should include cognitive behavioural interventions and involvement of the patient's partner, if available.Therefore, we developed a nurse-led sexual rehabilitation intervention, including these key components.The intervention was previously pilot-tested and results demonstrated that this intervention improves women's sexual functioning and increases dilator compliance.The objective of the current study is to investigate the (cost-)effectiveness of the intervention compared to optimal care as usual (CAU).We expect that women who receive the intervention will report a statistically significant greater improvement in sexual functioning and - for women who receive EBRT+BT - higher compliance with dilator use, from baseline to 12 months post-RT than women who receive optimal care as usual (CAU).METHODS/DESIGN: The intervention is evaluated in the SPARC (Sexual rehabilitation Programme After Radiotherapy for gynaecological Cancer) study, a multicentre, randomized controlled trial (RCT).The primary endpoint is sexual functioning.Secondary outcomes include body image, fear of sexual activity, sexual-, treatment-related- and psychological distress, health-related quality of life and relationship satisfaction.A cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) will be conducted in which the costs of the intervention will be related to shifts in other health care costs and the impact on patient outcome.The study sample will consist of 220 women with GC treated with RT in specialized GC treatment centres (N = 10).Participants are randomized to either the intervention- or CAU control group (1:1), and within each centre stratified by type of radiotherapy (EBRT+BT vs. EBRT only) and having a partner (yes/no).All women complete questionnaires at baseline (T1) and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-RT (T2, T3, T4 and T5, respectively).DISCUSSION: There is a need to improve sexual functioning after RT for GC.This RCT will provide evidence about the (cost-)effectiveness of a nurse-led sexual rehabilitation intervention.If proven effective, the intervention will be a much needed addition to care offered to GC survivors and will result in improved quality of life.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03611517 .Registered 2 August 2018.",0,0,0,0
34108261,"Gene Expression Signature Correlates with Outcomes in Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Patients Treated with Everolimus Alone or with a Vascular Disrupting Agent.Everolimus monotherapy use for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) has diminished due to recent approvals of immune checkpoint and VEGF inhibitors.We hypothesized that gene expression associated with everolimus benefit may provide rationale to select appropriate patients.To address this hypothesis, tumors from a phase I/II trial that compared everolimus alone or with BNC105P, a vascular disrupting agent, were profiled using Nanostring as a discovery cohort.A phase III trial (CheckMate 025) was used for validation.Clinical benefit (CB) was defined as response or stable disease for >/=6 months.A propensity score covariate adjustment was used, and model discrimination performance was assessed using the area under the ROC curve (AUC).In a discovery cohort of 82 patients, 35 (43%) were treated with everolimus alone and 47 (57%) received everolimus + BNC105P.Median PFS (mPFS) was 4.9 (95% CI, 2.8-6.2) months.A four-gene signature (ASXL1, DUSP6, ERCC2, and HSPA6) correlated with CB with everolimus +/-BNC105P [AUC, 86.9% (95% CI, 79.2-94.7)].This was validated in 130 patients from CheckMate 025 treated with everolimus [AUC, 60.2% (95% CI, 49.7-70.7)].Among 43 patients (52.4%) with low expression of an 18-gene signature, everolimus + BNC105P was associated with significantly longer mPFS compared with everolimus alone (10.4 vs. 6.9 months; HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.24-1.002; P = 0.047).These signatures warrant further validation to select patients who may benefit from everolimus alone or with a vascular disrupting agent.",0,0,0,0
23463655,"Randomized clinical trial of vitamin D3 doses on prostatic vitamin D metabolite levels and ki67 labeling in prostate cancer patients.CONTEXT: Vitamin D3 might benefit prostate cancer (PCa) patients because prostate cells can locally synthesize the active hormone calcitriol.OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine the effects of oral vitamin D3 on vitamin D metabolites and PCa proliferative activity in prostate tissue.DESIGN AND SETTING: We conducted a double-blind randomized clinical trial at surgical oncology clinics in Toronto, Canada.PATIENTS: PCa patients (Gleason 6 or 7) participated in the study.Of 66 subjects who were enrolled, 63 completed the dosing protocol.INTERVENTION: Vitamin D3 (400, 10 000, or 40 000 IU/d) was orally administered before radical prostatectomy.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We evaluated vitamin D metabolite levels and Ki67 labeling in surgical prostate tissue.Safety measures, PTH, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were also assessed.RESULTS: Prostate tissue and serum levels of vitamin D metabolites, including calcitriol, increased dose dependently (P < .03) and were significantly higher in the 40 000-IU/d group than in every other dose group (P < .03).Prostate vitamin D metabolites correlated positively with serum levels (P < .0001).Ki67 measures did not differ significantly among vitamin D dose groups.However, cross-sectional analysis indicated that the calcitriol level attained in prostate was inversely associated with Ki67 intensity and Ki67 (3+) percent positive nuclei in PCa and benign tissue (P < .05).Safety measures did not change adversely with dosing.Compared with the 400-IU/d group, serum PTH and PSA were lower in the combined higher-dose groups at the end of the study (P < .02).CONCLUSIONS: Oral vitamin D3 raised prostate calcitriol levels (level 1 evidence) and modestly lowered both PSA and PTH.Although Ki67 expression did not differ among dose groups, its levels correlated inversely with prostate calcitriol.These suggestions of clinical benefit justify continued clinical research.",0,0,0,0

34021033,"Randomized phase II trial of lymphodepletion plus adoptive cell transfer of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, with or without dendritic cell vaccination, in patients with metastatic melanoma.BACKGROUND: The adoptive transfer of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) has demonstrated robust efficacy in metastatic melanoma patients.Tumor antigen-loaded dendritic cells (DCs) are believed to optimally activate antigen-specific T lymphocytes.We hypothesized that the combined transfer of TIL, containing a melanoma antigen recognized by T cells 1 (MART-1) specific population, with MART-1-pulsed DC will result in enhanced proliferation and prolonged survival of transferred MART-1 specific T cells in vivo ultimately leading to improved clinical responses.DESIGN: We tested the combination of TIL and DC in a phase II clinical trial of patients with advanced stage IV melanoma.HLA-A0201 patients whose early TIL cultures demonstrated reactivity to MART-1 peptide were randomly assigned to receive TIL alone or TIL +DC pulsed with MART-1 peptide.The primary endpoint was to evaluate the persistence of MART-1 TIL in the two arms.Secondary endpoints were to evaluate clinical response and survival.RESULTS: Ten patients were given TIL alone while eight patients received TIL+DC vaccine.Infused MART-1 reactive CD8(+) TIL were tracked in the blood over time by flow cytometry and results show good persistence in both arms, with no difference in the persistence of MART-1 between the two arms.The objective response rate was 30% (3/10) in the TIL arm and 50% (4/8) in the TIL+DC arm.All treatments were well tolerated.CONCLUSIONS: The combination of TIL +DC showed no difference in the persistence of MART-1 TIL compared with TIL therapy alone.Although more patients showed a clinical response to TIL+DC therapy, this study was not powered to resolve differences between groups.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT00338377.",1,1,1,1
32234755,"A Randomized, Open-label, Presurgical, Window-of-Opportunity Study Comparing the Pharmacodynamic Effects of the Novel Oral SERD AZD9496 with Fulvestrant in Patients with Newly Diagnosed ER(+) HER2(-) Primary Breast Cancer.PURPOSE: Fulvestrant, the first-in-class selective estrogen receptor (ER) degrader (SERD), is clinically effective in patients with ER(+) breast cancer, but it has administration and pharmacokinetic limitations.Pharmacodynamic data suggest complete ER degradation is not achieved at fulvestrant's clinically feasible dose.This presurgical study (NCT03236974) compared the pharmacodynamic effects of fulvestrant with AZD9496, a novel, orally bioavailable, nonsteroidal, potent SERD, in treatment-naive patients with ER(+) HER2(-) primary breast cancer awaiting curative intent surgery.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive AZD9496 250 mg twice daily from day 1 for 5-14 days, or fulvestrant 500 mg on day 1.On-treatment imaging-guided core tumor biopsies were taken between day 5 and 14 and compared with pretreatment diagnostic biopsies.The primary objective was to compare the effects of AZD9496 and fulvestrant on ER expression.Secondary objectives included changes in progesterone receptor (PR) and Ki-67 pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships and safety.RESULTS: Forty-six women received treatment (AZD9496 n = 22; fulvestrant n = 24); 35 paired biopsies were evaluable (AZD9496 n = 15; fulvestrant n = 20).The least square mean estimate for ER H-score reduction was 24% after AZD9496 versus 36% after fulvestrant treatment (P = 0.86).AZD9496 also reduced PR H-scores (-33.3%) and Ki-67 levels (-39.9%) from baseline, but was also not superior to fulvestrant (PR: -68.7%, P = 0.97; Ki-67: -75.4%, P = 0.98).No new safety findings were identified.CONCLUSIONS: This was the first presurgical study to demonstrate that an oral SERD affects its key biological targets.However, AZD9496 was not superior to fulvestrant at the dose tested.",1,1,1,1

25403578,"FOLFOX4 versus sequential dose-dense FOLFOX7 followed by FOLFIRI in patients with resectable metastatic colorectal cancer (MIROX): a pragmatic approach to chemotherapy timing with perioperative or postoperative chemotherapy from an open-label, randomized phase III trial.BACKGROUND: Perioperative FOLFOX4 (oxaliplatin plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin) chemotherapy is the current standard in patients with resectable metastases from colorectal cancer (CRC).We aimed to determine whether a sequential chemotherapy with dose-dense oxaliplatin (FOLFOX7) and irinotecan (FOLFIRI; irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin) is superior to FOLFOX4.The chemotherapy timing was not imposed, and was perioperative or postoperative.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this open-label, phase III trial, patients with resectable or resected metastases were randomly assigned either to 12 cycles of FOLFOX4 (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m(2)) or 6 cycles of FOLFOX7 (oxaliplatin 130 mg/m(2)) followed by 6 cycles of FOLFIRI (irinotecan 180 mg/m(2)).Randomization was done centrally, with stratification by chemotherapy timing, type of local treatment (surgery versus radiofrequency ablation with/without surgery), and Fong's prognostic score.The primary end point was 2-year disease-free survival (DFS).RESULTS: A total of 284 patients were randomized, 142 in each treatment group.Chemotherapy was perioperative in 168 (59.2%) patients and postoperative in 116 (40.8%) patients.Perioperative chemotherapy was preferentially proposed for synchronous metastases, whereas postoperative chemotherapy was more frequently used for metachronous metastases.Two-year DFS was 48.5% in the FOLFOX4 group and 50.0% in the FOLFOX7-FOLFIRI group.In the multivariable analysis, more than one metastasis [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.15] and synchronous metastases (HR = 1.63) were independent prognostic factors for shorter DFS.Five-year overall survival (OS) rate was 69.5% with FOLFOX4 versus 66.6% with FOLFOX7-FOLFIRI.CONCLUSIONS: FOLFOX7-FOLFIRI is not superior to FOLFOX4 in patients with resectable metastatic CRC.Five-year OS rates observed in both groups are the highest ever reported in this setting, possibly reflecting the pragmatic approach to chemotherapy timing.CLINICAL TRIALS NUMBER: NCT00268398.",1,1,1,1
33367545,"Impact of gemtuzumab ozogamicin on MRD and relapse risk in patients with NPM1-mutated AML: results from the AMLSG 09-09 trial.Monitoring of measurable residual disease (MRD) provides prognostic information in patients with Nucleophosmin1-mutated (NPM1mut) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and represents a powerful tool to evaluate treatment effects within clinical trials.We determined NPM1mut transcript levels (TLs) by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and evaluated the prognostic impact of NPM1mut MRD and the effect of gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) on NPM1mut TLs and the cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) in patients with NPM1mut AML enrolled in the randomized phase 3 AMLSG 09-09 trial.A total of 3733 bone marrow (BM) samples and 3793 peripheral blood (PB) samples from 469 patients were analyzed.NPM1mut TL log10 reduction >/= 3 and achievement of MRD negativity in BM and PB were significantly associated with a lower CIR rate, after 2 treatment cycles and at end of treatment (EOT).In multivariate analyses, MRD positivity was consistently revealed to be a poor prognostic factor in BM and PB.With regard to treatment effect, the median NPM1mut TLs were significantly lower in the GO-Arm across all treatment cycles, resulting in a significantly greater proportion of patients achieving MRD negativity at EOT (56% vs 41%; P = .01).The better reduction in NPM1mut TLs after 2 treatment cycles in MRD positive patients by the addition of GO led to a significantly lower CIR rate (4-year CIR, 29.3% vs 45.7%, P = .009).In conclusion, the addition of GO to intensive chemotherapy in NPM1mut AML resulted in a significantly better reduction in NPM1mut TLs across all treatment cycles, leading to a significantly lower relapse rate.",1,1,1,1

23588130,"Increasing human papillomavirus vaccine acceptability by tailoring messages to young adult women's perceived barriers.BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination is a safe and effective primary prevention strategy for cervical cancer.Despite the need for effective HPV vaccination interventions, relatively few have been tested.Moreover, existing interventions have tended to use a one-size-fits-all educational approach.We investigated whether tailoring intervention materials to young adult women's perceived barriers to HPV vaccination-a known psychosocial predictor of vaccine uptake-would increase women's intentions to receive the HPV vaccine.METHODS: Young adult women (N = 94; aged 18-26 years) who had not been vaccinated against HPV were randomly assigned to read either a nontailored message about HPV vaccination or a message that was individually tailored to participants' perceived barriers to HPV vaccine uptake (e.g., safety concerns, cost, and not sexually active).Participants' intentions to receive the HPV vaccine in the next year were assessed before and after delivery of the intervention and served as the primary outcome variable.RESULTS: The most commonly selected barrier and primary reason for not getting vaccinated was concern about vaccine adverse effects (endorsed by 55%).Knowledge about HPV vaccination increased after exposure to the intervention but did not differ by experimental condition.Although HPV vaccination intentions increased from pretest to posttest in both conditions, participants in the tailored condition reported greater increases in intentions than did participants in the nontailored condition (F1,90 = 4.02, P = 0.048, partial eta = 0.043).CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that tailoring intervention materials to women's individual barriers is a potentially promising strategy for increasing HPV vaccination among young adult women.",0,0,0,0

PgR and Ki67 expression were significantly reduced with all treatments (means were -34% to -45%, and -75% to -85%, respectively; all P = 0.0001), with no differences between groups.CONCLUSIONS: In this short-term study, all treatments reduced ER expression, although F and F + A showed greater reductions than A. No significant differences were detected between the treatment groups in terms of PgR and Ki67 expression.No additional reduction in tumor biomarkers with combination treatment was observed, suggesting that F + A is unlikely to have further clinical benefit over F alone.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00259090.",1,1,1,1
32363529,"Linked Color Imaging Can Improve Detection Rate of Early Gastric Cancer in a High-Risk Population: A Multi-Center Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial.BACKGROUND: Early diagnosis of gastric cancer is difficult in China due to the lack of a valid method for endoscopic screening.Early gastric cancer, especially flat gastric cancer, lacks specific endoscopic features.Many cases appear to be similar to ordinary gastritis cases under normal white light endoscopy, which can lead to misdiagnosis.AIMS: In order to find a new method to improve detection rate of early gastric cancer in China, we designed a trial to validate linked color imaging (LCI) for screening of early gastric cancer in a high-risk population, as compared to white light imaging (WLI).METHOD: Subjects were randomly allocated to either the LCI + WLI or WLI group and then subjected to gastroscopy and all endoscopies were made after special preparation.All endoscopists had knowledge of this experiment.The main indicator was the rate of detection of gastric neoplastic lesions.The difference in the detection rate between the two groups is reported.RESULTS: The detection rate was 4.31% in the WLI group and 8.01% in the LCI + WLI group.This is a difference of 3.70% with a P value < 0.001 and an OR (95% CI) of 1.934 (1.362, 2.746).The lower limit of the 95% CI was greater than 0, and the superiority margin was 1%.CONCLUSION: The detection rate of gastric neoplastic lesions was higher in the LCI + WLI group than in the WLI group, LCI might be an effective method for screening early gastric cancer.",0,0,0,0

27557302,"Daratumumab, Bortezomib, and Dexamethasone for Multiple Myeloma.BACKGROUND: Daratumumab, a human IgGkappa monoclonal antibody that targets CD38, induces direct and indirect antimyeloma activity and has shown substantial efficacy as monotherapy in heavily pretreated patients with multiple myeloma, as well as in combination with bortezomib in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.METHODS: In this phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 498 patients with relapsed or relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma to receive bortezomib (1.3 mg per square meter of body-surface area) and dexamethasone (20 mg) alone (control group) or in combination with daratumumab (16 mg per kilogram of body weight) (daratumumab group).The primary end point was progression-free survival.RESULTS: A prespecified interim analysis showed that the rate of progression-free survival was significantly higher in the daratumumab group than in the control group; the 12-month rate of progression-free survival was 60.7% in the daratumumab group versus 26.9% in the control group.After a median follow-up period of 7.4 months, the median progression-free survival was not reached in the daratumumab group and was 7.2 months in the control group (hazard ratio for progression or death with daratumumab vs. control, 0.39; 95% confidence interval, 0.28 to 0.53; P<0.001).The rate of overall response was higher in the daratumumab group than in the control group (82.9% vs. 63.2%, P<0.001), as were the rates of very good partial response or better (59.2% vs. 29.1%, P<0.001) and complete response or better (19.2% vs. 9.0%, P=0.001).Three of the most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events reported in the daratumumab group and the control group were thrombocytopenia (45.3% and 32.9%, respectively), anemia (14.4% and 16.0%, respectively), and neutropenia (12.8% and 4.2%, respectively).Infusion-related reactions that were associated with daratumumab treatment were reported in 45.3% of the patients in the daratumumab group; these reactions were mostly grade 1 or 2 (grade 3 in 8.6% of the patients), and in 98.2% of these patients, they occurred during the first infusion.CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with relapsed or relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, daratumumab in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone resulted in significantly longer progression-free survival than bortezomib and dexamethasone alone and was associated with infusion-related reactions and higher rates of thrombocytopenia and neutropenia than bortezomib and dexamethasone alone.(Funded by Janssen Research and Development; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02136134.).",1,1,1,1
26531235,"Randomized prospective comparison of midline and off-midline closure techniques in pilonidal sinus surgery.BACKGROUND: Pilonidal sinus is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the intergluteal sulcus.The disorder often negatively affects patients' quality of life, and there are numerous possible methods of operative treatment for pilonidal sinus.The aim of our study was to compare the results of 3 different operative procedures (tension-free primary closure, Limberg flap, and Karydakis technique) used in the treatment of pilonidal disease.METHODS: The study was conducted via a prospective randomized design.The patients were randomized into 3 groups via a closed envelope method.Patients were included in the study after admission to our clinic with pilonidal sinus disease and operative treatment already were planned.The 2 main outcomes of the study were early complications from the methods used and later recurrences of the disease.RESULTS: A total of 150 patients were included in the study, and the groups were similar in terms of age, sex, and American Society of Anesthesiologists scores.The median follow-up time of the study was 24.2 months (range, 18.5-34.27) postsurgery.The recurrence rates were 6% for both the Limberg and Karydakis groups and 4% for the tension-free primary closure group.Therefore, there was no substantial difference in the recurrence rates.CONCLUSION: The search for an ideal treatment modality for pilonidal sinus disease is still ongoing.The main conclusion of our study is that a tension-free healing side is much more important than a midline suture line.Also, tension-free primary closure is as effective as a flap procedure, and it is also easier to perform.",0,0,0,0

26438237,"The effects of short-term fasting on tolerance to (neo) adjuvant chemotherapy in HER2-negative breast cancer patients: a randomized pilot study.BACKGROUND: Preclinical evidence shows that short-term fasting (STF) protects healthy cells against side effects of chemotherapy and makes cancer cells more vulnerable to it.This pilot study examines the feasibility of STF and its effects on tolerance of chemotherapy in a homogeneous patient group with early breast cancer (BC).METHODS: Eligible patients had HER2-negative, stage II/III BC.Women receiving (neo)-adjuvant TAC (docetaxel/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide) were randomized to fast 24 h before and after commencing chemotherapy, or to eat according to the guidelines for healthy nutrition.Toxicity in the two groups was compared.Chemotherapy-induced DNA damage in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was quantified by the level of gamma-H2AX analyzed by flow cytometry.RESULTS: Thirteen patients were included of whom seven were randomized to the STF arm.STF was well tolerated.Mean erythrocyte- and thrombocyte counts 7 days post-chemotherapy were significantly higher (P = 0.007, 95 % CI 0.106-0.638 and P = 0.00007, 95 % CI 38.7-104, respectively) in the STF group compared to the non-STF group.Non-hematological toxicity did not differ between the groups.Levels of gamma-H2AX were significantly increased 30 min post-chemotherapy in CD45 + CD3- cells in non-STF, but not in STF patients.CONCLUSIONS: STF during chemotherapy was well tolerated and reduced hematological toxicity of TAC in HER2-negative BC patients.Moreover, STF may reduce a transient increase in, and/or induce a faster recovery of DNA damage in PBMCs after chemotherapy.Larger studies, investigating a longer fasting period, are required to generate more insight into the possible benefits of STF during chemotherapy.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01304251 , March 2011.",1,1,1,1

Improving Cognition After Cancer.INTRODUCTION: Difficulties with cognition are extremely common among breast cancer survivors and can significantly impact quality of life, daily functioning, and ability to return to work.One promising intervention is increasing physical activity, as it has been effective in improving cognition in non-cancer populations.Few physical activity intervention trials with cognition outcomes have included cancer survivors.This project builds upon our previous work indicating that increased physical activity can improve objectively measured processing speed and self-reported cognition among breast cancer survivors.METHODS: The I Can! study will examine whether a physical activity intervention improves cognition among 250 post-treatment breast cancer survivors (Stages I-III, <5 years post-treatment) who are reporting cognitive difficulties.This 2-arm randomized controlled trial comparing a 6-month physical activity intervention (Exercise Group) to a health & wellness attention-comparison condition (Health & Wellness Group) will examine intervention effects on cognition (at 3 and 6 months) and maintenance of effects at 12 months.The primary aim is to investigate the impact of exercise on objectively measured processing speed and self-reported cognition.Secondary aims are to investigate maintenance of cognitive changes and examine candidate biological mechanisms and psychological mediators.CONCLUSION: The I Can! study will contribute to the scientific, public health, and survivorship intervention literature by providing new information on the impact of physical activity for cognitive impairment in breast cancer survivors.Findings from this study will inform guidelines for physical activity to improve the lives of millions of breast cancer survivors.",0,0,0,0
26897518,"TOPical Imiquimod treatment of high-grade Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (TOPIC trial): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) is the premalignant condition of cervical cancer.Whereas not all high grade CIN lesions progress to cervical cancer, the natural history and risk of progression of individual lesions remain unpredictable.Therefore, high-grade CIN is currently treated by surgical excision: large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ).This procedure has potential complications, such as acute haemorrhage, prolonged bleeding, infection and preterm birth in subsequent pregnancies.These complications could be prevented by development of a non-invasive treatment modality, such as topical imiquimod treatment.The primary study objective is to investigate the efficacy of topical imiquimod 5% cream for the treatment of high-grade CIN and to develop a biomarker profile to predict clinical response to imiquimod treatment.Secondary study objectives are to assess treatment side-effects, disease recurrence and quality of life during and after different treatment modalities.METHODS/DESIGN: The study design is a randomized controlled trial.One hundred forty women with a histological diagnosis of high-grade CIN (CIN 2-3) will be randomized into two arms: imiquimod treatment during 16 weeks (experimental arm) or immediate LLETZ (standard care arm).Treatment efficacy will be evaluated by colposcopy with diagnostic biopsies at 20 weeks for the experimental arm.Successful imiquimod treatment is defined as regression to CIN 1 or less, successful LLETZ treatment is defined as PAP 1 after 6 months.Disease recurrence will be evaluated by cytology at 6, 12 and 24 months after treatment.Side-effects will be evaluated using a standardized report form.Quality of life will be evaluated using validated questionnaires at baseline, 20 weeks and 1 year after treatment.Biomarkers, reflecting both host and viral factors in the pathophysiology of CIN, will be tested at baseline with the aim of developing a predictive biomarker profile for the clinical response to imiquimod treatment.DISCUSSION: Treatment of high-grade CIN lesions with imiquimod in a selected patient population may diminish complications as a result of surgical intervention.More knowledge on treatment efficacy, side effects and long-term recurrence rates after treatment is necessary.TRIAL REGISTRATION: EU Clinical Trials Register EU-CTR2013-001260-34 .Registered 18 March 2013.Medical Ethical Committee approval number: NL44336.068.13 (Medical Ethical Committee Maastricht University Hospital, University of Maastricht).Affiliation: Maastricht University Hospital.Registration number ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02329171.",1,1,1,1

Grade 3 or worse adverse events at 30 days were similar in frequency between groups (56 [42%] of 133 patients in the cytoreductive surgery plus HIPEC group vs 42 [32%] of 132 patients in the cytoreductive surgery group; p=0.083); however, at 60 days, grade 3 or worse adverse events were more common in the cytoreductive surgery plus HIPEC group (34 [26%] of 131 vs 20 [15%] of 130; p=0.035).INTERPRETATION: Considering the absence of an overall survival benefit after adding HIPEC to cytoreductive surgery and more frequent postoperative late complications with this combination, our data suggest that cytoreductive surgery alone should be the cornerstone of therapeutic strategies with curative intent for colorectal peritoneal metastases.FUNDING: Institut National du Cancer, Programme Hospitalier de Recherche Clinique du Cancer, Ligue Contre le Cancer.",0,0,0,0

29445029,"Pantoprazole, an Inhibitor of the Organic Cation Transporter 2, Does Not Ameliorate Cisplatin-Related Ototoxicity or Nephrotoxicity in Children and Adolescents with Newly Diagnosed Osteosarcoma Treated with Methotrexate, Doxorubicin, and Cisplatin.LESSONS LEARNED: Using a randomized crossover design and continuous variables such as change in hearing threshold and biomarkers of acute renal injury as short-term endpoints, it was determined that pantoprazole, an organic cation transporter 2 inhibitor, did not ameliorate cisplatin-associated nephrotoxicity or ototoxicity.Cystatin C is a robust method to estimate glomerular filtration rate in patients with cancer.Using a patient-reported outcome survey, all patients identified tinnitus and subjective hearing loss occurring ""at least rarely"" after cycle 1, prior to objective high-frequency hearing loss measured by audiograms.New therapies that improve outcome with less acute and long-term toxicity are needed.BACKGROUND: Organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2), which is a cisplatin uptake transporter expressed on renal tubules and cochlear hair cells but not on osteosarcoma cells, mediates cisplatin uptake.Pantoprazole inhibits OCT2 and could ameliorate cisplatin ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity.Using a randomized crossover design, we evaluated audiograms, urinary acute kidney injury (AKI) biomarkers, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimated from cystatin C (GFRcysC) in patients receiving cisplatin with and without pantoprazole.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cisplatin (60 mg/m(2) x 2 days per cycle) was administered concurrently with pantoprazole (intravenous [IV], 1.6 mg/kg over 4 hours) on cycles 1 and 2 or cycles 3 and 4 in 12 patients with osteosarcoma (OS) with a median (range) age of 12.8 (5.6-19) years.Audiograms, urinary AKI biomarkers, and serum cystatin C were monitored during each cycle.RESULTS: Pantoprazole had no impact on decrements in hearing threshold at 4-8 kHz, post-treatment elevation of urinary AKI biomarkers, or GFRcysC (Fig. 1, Table 1).Histological response (percent necrosis) after two cycles was similar with or without pantoprazole.All eight patients with localized OS at diagnosis are alive and in remission; three of four patients with metastases at diagnosis have died.CONCLUSION: Pantoprazole did not ameliorate cisplatin ototoxicity or nephrotoxicity.The decrease in GFRcysC and increase in N-acetyl-ss-glucosaminidase (NAG) and creatinine demonstrate that these biomarkers can quantify cisplatin glomerular and proximal tubular toxicity.OCT2 inhibition by pantoprazole did not appear to alter antitumor response or survival.",1,1,1,1
22149921,"ABVD alone versus radiation-based therapy in limited-stage Hodgkin's lymphoma.BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy plus radiation treatment is effective in controlling stage IA or IIA nonbulky Hodgkin's lymphoma in 90% of patients but is associated with late treatment-related deaths.Chemotherapy alone may improve survival because it is associated with fewer late deaths.METHODS: We randomly assigned 405 patients with previously untreated stage IA or IIA nonbulky Hodgkin's lymphoma to treatment with doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD) alone or to treatment with subtotal nodal radiation therapy, with or without ABVD therapy.Patients in the ABVD-only group, both those with a favorable risk profile and those with an unfavorable risk profile, received four to six cycles of ABVD.Among those assigned to subtotal nodal radiation therapy, patients who had a favorable risk profile received subtotal nodal radiation therapy alone and patients with an unfavorable risk profile received two cycles of ABVD plus subtotal nodal radiation therapy.The primary end point was 12-year overall survival.RESULTS: The median length of follow-up was 11.3 years.At 12 years, the rate of overall survival was 94% among those receiving ABVD alone, as compared with 87% among those receiving subtotal nodal radiation therapy (hazard ratio for death with ABVD alone, 0.50; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.25 to 0.99; P=0.04); the rates of freedom from disease progression were 87% and 92% in the two groups, respectively (hazard ratio for disease progression, 1.91; 95% CI, 0.99 to 3.69; P=0.05); and the rates of event-free survival were 85% and 80%, respectively (hazard ratio for event, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.54 to 1.43; P=0.60).Among the patients randomly assigned to ABVD alone, 6 patients died from Hodgkin's lymphoma or an early treatment complication and 6 died from another cause; among those receiving radiation therapy, 4 deaths were related to Hodgkin's lymphoma or early toxic effects from the treatment and 20 were related to another cause.CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma, ABVD therapy alone, as compared with treatment that included subtotal nodal radiation therapy, was associated with a higher rate of overall survival owing to a lower rate of death from other causes.(Funded by the Canadian Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute; HD.6 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00002561.).",1,1,1,1
29370781,"The PANDA study: a randomized phase II study of first-line FOLFOX plus panitumumab versus 5FU plus panitumumab in RAS and BRAF wild-type elderly metastatic colorectal cancer patients.BACKGROUND: Few data are available regarding the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer elderly patients with anti-EGFR agents in combination with chemotherapy.FOLFOX plus panitumumab is a standard first-line option for RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer.Slight adjustments in chemo-dosage are commonly applied in clinical practice to elderly patients, but those modified schedules have never been prospectively tested.Clinical definition of elderly (>/=70 years old) patients that may deserve a more or less intensive combination therapy is still debated.Several geriatric screening tools have been developed to predict survival and risk of toxicity from treatment.Among those, the G8 screening tool has been tested in cancer patients showing the strongest prognostic value for overall survival, while the CRASH score can stratify patients according to an estimated risk of treatment-related toxicities.METHODS: The PANDA study is a prospective, open-label, multicenter, randomized phase II trial of first-line therapy with panitumumab in combination with dose-adjusted FOLFOX or with 5-fluorouracil monotherapy, in previously untreated elderly patients (>/=70 years) with RAS and BRAF wild-type unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer.RAS and BRAF analyses are centralized.Geriatric assessment by means of G8 and CRASH score is planned at baseline and G8 will be re-evaluated at disease progression.The primary endpoint is duration of progression-free survival in both arms.Secondary endpoints include prospective evaluation of the prognostic role of G8 score and the correlation of CRASH risk categories with toxicity.DISCUSSION: The PANDA study aims at exploring safety and efficacy of panitumumab in combination with FOLFOX or with 5FU/LV in elderly patients affected by RAS and BRAF wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer, to identify the most promising treatment strategy in this setting.Additionally, this is the first trial in which the prognostic role of the G8 score will be prospectively evaluated.Results of this study will drive further experimental developments for one or both combinations.TRIAL REGISTRATION: PANDA is registered at Clinicaltrials.gov : NCT02904031 , July 11, 2016.PANDA is registered at EudraCT-No.: 2015-003888-10, September 3, 2015.",1,1,1,1
33856430,"Efficacy and Safety of Propranolol vs Atenolol in Infants With Problematic Infantile Hemangiomas: A Randomized Clinical Trial.Importance: Propranolol has become the first-line therapy for problematic infantile hemangiomas (IHs) that require systemic therapy.However, different adverse events have been reported during propranolol treatment.The positive efficacy and safety of atenolol raise the question of whether it could be used as a promising therapy for IH.Objective: To compare the efficacy and safety of propranolol vs atenolol in infants (between age 5 and 20 weeks) with problematic IHs who required systemic therapy.Design, Setting, and Participants: This was a prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-label clinical trial conducted in collaboration among 6 separate investigation sites in China from February 1, 2015, to December 31, 2018.A total of 377 patients met the criteria for inclusion and were randomized to the propranolol (190 [50.4%]) and atenolol (187 [49.6%]) groups.Data were analyzed in June 2020.Interventions: Participants were randomized to receive either propranolol or atenolol for at least 6 months.They completed efficacy assessments at 2 years after the initial treatment.Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was any response or nonresponse at 6 months.The key secondary outcome was changes in the hemangioma activity score.Results: Of 377 participants, 287 (76.1%) were female, and the mean (SD) age was 10.2 (4.0) weeks in the propranolol group and 9.8 (4.1) weeks in the atenolol group.After 6 months of treatment, in the propranolol and atenolol groups, the overall response rates were 93.7% and 92.5%, respectively (difference, 1.2%; 95% CI, -4.1% to 6.6%).At 1 and 4 weeks after treatment, and thereafter, the hemangioma activity score in the atenolol group aligned with the propranolol group (odds ratio, 1.034; 95% CI, 0.886-1.206).No differences between the propranolol group and atenolol group were observed in successful initial responses, quality of life scores, complete ulceration healing times, or the rebound rate.Both groups presented a similar percentage of complete/nearly complete responses at 2 years (82.1% vs 79.7%; difference, 2.4%; 95% CI, -5.9% to 10.7%).Adverse events were more common in the propranolol group (70.0% vs 44.4%; difference, 25.6%; 95% CI, 15.7%-34.8%), but the frequency of severe adverse events did not differ meaningfully between the groups.Conclusions and Relevance: In this randomized clinical trial, when compared with propranolol, atenolol had similar efficacy and fewer adverse events in the treatment of infants with problematic IHs.The results suggest that oral atenolol can be used as an alternative treatment option for patients with IH who require systemic therapy.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrial.gov Identifier: NCT02342275.",1,1,1,0
34551229,"Overall Survival Benefit with Tebentafusp in Metastatic Uveal Melanoma.BACKGROUND: Uveal melanoma is a disease that is distinct from cutaneous melanoma, with a low tumor mutational burden and a 1-year overall survival of approximately 50% in patients with metastatic uveal melanoma.Data showing a proven overall survival benefit with a systemic treatment are lacking.Tebentafusp is a bispecific protein consisting of an affinity-enhanced T-cell receptor fused to an anti-CD3 effector that can redirect T cells to target glycoprotein 100-positive cells.METHODS: In this open-label, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned previously untreated HLA-A*02:01-positive patients with metastatic uveal melanoma in a 2:1 ratio to receive tebentafusp (tebentafusp group) or the investigator's choice of therapy with single-agent pembrolizumab, ipilimumab, or dacarbazine (control group), stratified according to the lactate dehydrogenase level.The primary end point was overall survival.RESULTS: A total of 378 patients were randomly assigned to either the tebentafusp group (252 patients) or the control group (126 patients).Overall survival at 1 year was 73% in the tebentafusp group and 59% in the control group (hazard ratio for death, 0.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.37 to 0.71; P<0.001) in the intention-to-treat population.Progression-free survival was also significantly higher in the tebentafusp group than in the control group (31% vs. 19% at 6 months; hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.94; P = 0.01).The most common treatment-related adverse events in the tebentafusp group were cytokine-mediated events (due to T-cell activation) and skin-related events (due to glycoprotein 100-positive melanocytes), including rash (83%), pyrexia (76%), and pruritus (69%).These adverse events decreased in incidence and severity after the first three or four doses and infrequently led to discontinuation of the trial treatment (2%).No treatment-related deaths were reported.CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with tebentafusp resulted in longer overall survival than the control therapy among previously untreated patients with metastatic uveal melanoma.(Funded by Immunocore; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03070392; EudraCT number, 2015-003153-18.).",1,1,1,1
31080129,"Diagnostic accuracy of whole-body MRI versus standard imaging pathways for metastatic disease in newly diagnosed non-small-cell lung cancer: the prospective Streamline L trial.BACKGROUND: Whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (WB-MRI) could be an alternative to multi-modality staging of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but its diagnostic accuracy, effect on staging times, number of tests needed, cost, and effect on treatment decisions are unknown.We aimed to prospectively compare the diagnostic accuracy and efficiency of WB-MRI-based staging pathways with standard pathways in NSCLC.METHODS: The Streamline L trial was a prospective, multicentre trial done in 16 hospitals in England.Eligible patients were 18 years or older, with newly diagnosed NSCLC that was potentially radically treatable on diagnostic chest CT (defined as stage IIIb or less).Exclusion criteria were severe systemic disease, pregnancy, contraindications to MRI, or histologies other than NSCLC.Patients underwent WB-MRI, the result of which was withheld until standard staging investigations were complete and the first treatment decision made.The multidisciplinary team recorded its treatment decision based on standard investigations, then on the WB-MRI staging pathway (WB-MRI plus additional tests generated), and finally on all tests.The primary outcome was difference in per-patient sensitivity for metastases between standard and WB-MRI staging pathways against a consensus reference standard at 12 months, in the per-protocol population.Secondary outcomes were difference in per-patient specificity for metastatic disease detection between standard and WB-MRI staging pathways, differences in treatment decisions, staging efficiency (time taken, test number, and costs) and per-organ sensitivity and specificity for metastases and per-patient agreement for local T and N stage.This trial is registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial registry, number ISRCTN50436483, and is complete.FINDINGS: Between Feb 26, 2013, and Sept 5, 2016, 976 patients were screened for eligibility.353 patients were recruited, 187 of whom completed the trial; 52 (28%) had metastasis at baseline.Pathway sensitivity was 50% (95% CI 37-63) for WB-MRI and 54% (41-67) for standard pathways, a difference of 4% (-7 to 15, p=0.73).No adverse events related to imaging were reported.Specificity did not differ between WB-MRI (93% [88-96]) and standard pathways (95% [91-98], p=0.45).Agreement with the multidisciplinary team's final treatment decision was 98% for WB-MRI and 99% for the standard pathway.Time to complete staging was shorter for WB-MRI (13 days [12-14]) than for the standard pathway (19 days [17-21]); a 6-day (4-8) difference.The number of tests required was similar WB-MRI (one [1-1]) and standard pathways (one [1-2]).Mean per-patient costs were pound317 (273-361) for WBI-MRI and pound620 (574-666) for standard pathways.INTERPRETATION: WB-MRI staging pathways have similar accuracy to standard pathways, and reduce the staging time and costs.FUNDING: UK National Institute for Health Research.",0,0,0,0
31237459,"Effects of the Values and Options in Cancer Care Communication Intervention on Personal Caregiver Experiences of Cancer Care and Bereavement Outcomes.Background: Care teams are increasingly expected to attend to the needs of patient's personal caregivers (e.g., family members).Improving communication among oncologists, patients with advanced cancer, and their personal caregivers might enhance caregivers' experiences of end-of-life (EoL) cancer care and bereavement outcomes.Objective: To explore the effects of the Values and Options in Cancer Care intervention on caregivers' experiences of EoL care and bereavement outcomes.Design: We developed a brief behavioral intervention to improve communication among oncologists, patients with advanced cancer, and their personal caregivers.The intervention was designed to help patients/caregivers ask questions, express concerns, and help oncologists respond effectively.We randomly assigned oncologists (and their patients/caregivers) to the intervention or usual care.Setting/Subjects: Medical oncologists in NY and CA; patients/personal caregivers with advanced cancer.Measurements: Two months after the patient's death, caregivers completed three instruments assessing their experiences of EoL care.Seven months after the patient's death, caregivers completed the Prolonged Grief Disorder-13 (PG-13; primary prespecified outcome), the Purpose-in-Life scale, and scales assessing mental health function, depression, and anxiety.Results: The intervention did not significantly improve caregivers' scores on the PG-13 (p = 0.21), mental health function, depression, or anxiety, but it did improve purpose-in-life scores (p = 0.018).Cohen's d (95% confidence interval) for all three experiences of EoL care outcomes were promising, ranging from 0.22 (-0.19 to 0.63) to 0.39 (-0.07 to 0.86) although none was statistically significant.Conclusion: Preliminary findings show promise that scalable interventions in cancer care settings may improve caregiver experiences with cancer care and some bereavement outcomes.",0,0,0,0

28972083,"Local Adjuvant Treatment with Low-Dose CpG-B Offers Durable Protection against Disease Recurrence in Clinical Stage I-II Melanoma: Data from Two Randomized Phase II Trials.Purpose: Although risk of recurrence after surgical removal of clinical stage I-II melanoma is considerable, there is no adjuvant therapy with proven efficacy.Here, we provide clinical evidence that a local conditioning regimen, aimed at immunologic arming of the tumor-draining lymph nodes, may provide durable protection against disease recurrence (median follow-up, 88.8 months).Experimental Design: In two randomized phase II trials, patients, diagnosed with stage I-II melanoma after excision of the primary tumor, received local injections at the primary tumor excision site within 7 days preceding re-excision and sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy of either a saline placebo (n = 22) or low-dose CpG type B (CpG-B) with (n = 9) or without (n = 21) low-dose GM-CSF.Results: CpG-B treatment was shown to be safe, to boost locoregional and systemic immunity, to be associated with lower rates of tumor-involved SLN (10% vs. 36% in controls, P = 0.04), and, at a median follow-up of 88.8 months, to profoundly improve recurrence-free survival (P = 0.008), even for patients with histologically confirmed (i.e., pathologic) stage I-II disease (P = 0.02).Conclusions: Potentially offering durable protection, local low-dose CpG-B administration in early-stage melanoma provides an adjuvant treatment option for a large group of patients currently going untreated despite being at considerable risk for disease recurrence.Once validated in a larger randomized phase III trial, this nontoxic immunopotentiating regimen may prove clinically transformative.Clin Cancer Res; 23(19); 5679-86.(c)2017 AACR.",0,0,0,0

30580268,"A randomised controlled trial to assess whether prehabilitation improves fitness in patients undergoing neoadjuvant treatment prior to oesophagogastric cancer surgery: study protocol.INTRODUCTION: Neoadjuvant therapy prior to oesophagogastric resection is the gold standard of care for patients with T2 and/or nodal disease.Despite this, studies have taught us that chemotherapy decreases patients' functional capacity as assessed by cardiopulmonary exercise (CPX) testing.We aim to show that a multimodal prehabilitation programme, comprising supervised exercise, psychological coaching and nutritional support, will physically, psychologically and metabolically optimise these patients prior to oesophagogastric cancer surgery so they may better withstand the immense physical and metabolic stress placed on them by radical curative major surgery.METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This will be a prospective, randomised, controlled, parallel, single-centre superiority trial comparing a multimodal 'prehabilitation' intervention with 'standard care' in patients with oesophagogastric malignancy who are treated with neoadjuvant therapy prior to surgical resection.The primary aim is to demonstrate an improvement in baseline cardiopulmonary function as assessed by anaerobic threshold during CPX testing in an interventional (prehab) group following a 15-week preoperative exercise programme, throughout and following neoadjuvant treatment, when compared with those that undergo standard care (control group).Secondary objectives include changes in peak oxygen uptake and work rate (total watts achieved) at CPX testing, insulin resistance, quality of life, chemotherapy-related toxicity and completion, nutritional assessment, postoperative complication rate, length of stay and overall mortality.ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has been approved by the London-Bromley Research Ethics Committee and registered on ClinicalTrials.gov.The results will be disseminated in a peer-reviewed journal.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT02950324; Pre-results.",0,0,0,0
27118453,"Minimal residual disease monitoring and immune profiling in multiple myeloma in elderly patients.The value of minimal residual disease (MRD) in multiple myeloma (MM) has been more frequently investigated in transplant-eligible patients than in elderly patients.Because an optimal balance between treatment efficacy and toxicity is of utmost importance in patients with elderly MM, sensitive MRD monitoring might be particularly valuable in this patient population.Here, we used second-generation 8-color multiparameter-flow cytometry (MFC) to monitor MRD in 162 transplant-ineligible MM patients enrolled in the PETHEMA/GEM2010MAS65 study.The transition from first- to second-generation MFC resulted in increased sensitivity and allowed us to identify 3 patient groups according to MRD levels: MRD negative (<10(-5); n = 54, 34%), MRD positive (between <10(-4) and >/=10(-5); n = 20, 12%), and MRD positive (>/=10(-4); n = 88, 54%).MRD status was an independent prognostic factor for time to progression (TTP) (hazard ratio [HR], 2.7; P = .007) and overall survival (OS) (HR, 3.1; P = .04), with significant benefit for MRD-negative patients (median TTP not reached, 70% OS at 3 years), and similar poorer outcomes for cases with MRD levels between <10(-4) and >/=10(-5) vs >/=10(-4) (both with a median TTP of 15 months; 63% and 55% OS at 3 years, respectively).Furthermore, MRD negativity significantly improved TTP of patients >75 years (HR, 4.8; P < .001), as well as those with high-risk cytogenetics (HR, 12.6; P = .01).Using second-generation MFC, immune profiling concomitant to MRD monitoring also contributed to identify patients with poor, intermediate, and favorable outcomes (25%, 61%, and 100% OS at 3 years, respectively; P = .01), the later patients being characterized by an increased compartment of mature B cells.Our results show that similarly to transplant candidates, MRD monitoring is one of the most relevant prognostic factors in elderly MM patients, irrespectively of age or cytogenetic risk.This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT01237249.",0,0,0,0
24573743,"A phase II open-label randomized multicenter trial of TSU-68 in combination with S-1 and oxaliplatin versus S-1 in combination with oxaliplatin in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide.The combination of oxaliplatin-based treatments (oxaliplatin plus infusional 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin [FOLFOX] or oxaliplatin plus capecitabine [CapeOX]) and bevacizumab is a standard chemotherapy regimen for metastatic CRC (mCRC).However, several clinical studies that tested S-1 plus oxaliplatin (SOX) indicate that SOX is also a treatment option for mCRC.TSU-68 is an oral compound that inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptor and platelet-derived growth factor receptor.The recommended dose of TSU-68 + SOX was previously determined in a phase I study of mCRC patients.The goal of this trial was to evaluate the efficacy of TSU-68 in combination with SOX.METHODS: This open-label multicenter randomized phase II trial was performed in Korea.Treatment-naive mCRC patients with a performance status of 0 or 1 were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either TSU-68 + SOX or SOX alone.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS).RESULTS: A total of 105 patients (TSU-68 + SOX, 52 patients; SOX alone, 53 patients) were randomized.The median PFS was 7.0 months in the TSU-68 + SOX group (hazard ratio [HR], 1.057) and 7.2 months in the SOX group (p = 0.8401).The most frequent grade 3 and 4 adverse events were thrombocytopenia (9.6 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 26.4 % [SOX]), neutropenia (13.5 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 15.1 % [SOX]), and anemia (3.8 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 13.2 % [SOX]).We observed a difference between the 2 groups for all grades of anemia (15.4 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 32.1 % [SOX]), diarrhea (30.8 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 47.2 % [SOX]), vomiting (50.0 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 26.4 % [SOX]), and chromaturia (23.1 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 0.0 % [SOX]).Analysis using a Cox proportional hazard model showed that baseline interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels were associated with a survival benefit of TSU-68 (p = 0.012).CONCLUSION: TSU-68 + SOX had a favorable safety profile.However, TSU-68 did not have a synergistic effect on the efficacy of SOX.The baseline serum IL-6 level could be a prognostic factor for TSU-68 efficacy.",1,1,1,1

29319209,"Effectiveness of antibacterial prophylaxis during induction chemotherapy in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.BACKGROUND: Pediatric patients receiving induction chemotherapy for newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are at high risk of developing life-threatening infections.We investigated whether uniform antibacterial guidelines, including mandatory antibacterial prophylaxis in afebrile patients during induction, decreases the incidence of microbiologically documented bacteremia.METHODS: Between 2012 and 2015, 230 patients with newly diagnosed ALL (aged 1-21) were enrolled on Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ALL Consortium Protocol 11-001 (DFCI 11-001).Induction therapy, regardless of risk group, included vincristine, prednisone, doxorubicin, methotrexate, and PEG-asparaginase.Afebrile patients received fluoroquinolone prophylaxis at the initiation of induction and those presenting with fever received broad-spectrum antibiotics; antibiotics were continued until blood count recovery.Rates of documented bacteremias and fungal infections on DFCI 11-001 were compared to those on the predecessor protocol (DFCI 05-001), which included the same induction phase without antibiotic prophylaxis guidelines.RESULTS: Sixty-six (28.7%) patients received fluoroquinolone prophylaxis, the remaining patients received broad-spectrum antibiotics.Twenty-four (36.4%) patients on prophylaxis developed fever and seven (10.6%) developed bacteremia.The overall rate of infection during induction on DFCI 11-001 was lower than on DFCl 05-001 (14.3% vs. 26.3%, P < 0.0001) due to a decreased rate of bacteremia (10.9% vs. 24.4%, P < 0.0001).The rate of fungal infections (4.8% vs. 3.6%) and induction death (0.9% vs. 2%) was not significantly different.CONCLUSION: For children with newly diagnosed ALL, uniform antibiotic administration until blood count recovery, including fluoroquinolone prophylaxis for afebrile patients, reduced the incidence of bacteremia during the induction phase.Larger, randomized studies should be performed to confirm these findings.",0,0,0,0
24330570,"Effects of recreational soccer in men with prostate cancer undergoing androgen deprivation therapy: study protocol for the 'FC Prostate' randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is a cornerstone in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer.Adverse musculoskeletal and cardiovascular effects of ADT are widely reported and investigations into the potential of exercise to ameliorate the effects of treatment are warranted.The 'Football Club (FC) Prostate' study is a randomized trial comparing the effects of soccer training with standard treatment approaches on body composition, cardiovascular function, physical function parameters, glucose tolerance, bone health, and patient-reported outcomes in men undergoing ADT for prostate cancer.METHODS/DESIGN: Using a single-center randomized controlled design, 80 men with histologically confirmed locally advanced or disseminated prostate cancer undergoing ADT for 6 months or more at The Copenhagen University Hospital will be enrolled on this trial.After baseline assessments eligible participants will be randomly assigned to a soccer training group or a control group receiving usual care.The soccer intervention will consist of 12 weeks of training 2-3 times/week for 45-60 min after which the assessment protocol will be repeated.Soccer training will then continue bi-weekly for an additional 20 weeks at the end of which all measures will be repeated to allow for additional analyses of long-term effects.The primary endpoint is changes in lean body mass from baseline to 12 weeks assessed by dual X-ray absorptiometry scan.Secondary endpoints include changes of cardiovascular, metabolic, and physical function parameters, as well as markers of bone metabolism and patient-reported outcomes.DISCUSSION: The FC Prostate trial will assess the safety and efficacy of a novel soccer-training approach to cancer rehabilitation on a number of clinically important health outcomes in men with advanced prostate cancer during ADT.The results may pave the way for innovative, community-based interventions in the approach to treating prostate cancer.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01711892.",0,0,0,0

25688512,"Rationale and protocol of the MetNET-1 trial, a prospective, single center, phase II study to evaluate the activity and safety of everolimus in combination with octreotide LAR and metformin in patients with advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.Abnormal PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway signalling and autocrine activation of the mTOR pathway, mediated through insulin-like growth factor-1, have been implicated in the proliferation of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (pNET) cells.Everolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, has shown antitumor benefit in pNETs alone and in combination with octreotide LAR in RADIANT-1 and RADIANT-3 studies.Although everolimus-based phase II/III trials have improved progression-free survival for pNET, its use has not impacted on prolonging overall survival.Metformin has recently shown some anti-cancer activity in both in vitro and in vivo studies by its indirect properties to decrease insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels and by its antitumour effect to promote AMPK activation and consequently inhibition to TSC1-2/mTOR complex.In light of even more retrospective evidence of metformin's anticancer activity, a prospective evaluation is required to either confirm or discard these preliminary findings.With the aim to evaluate the antiproliferative effect of metformin in combination with everolimus and octreotide LAR in pancreatic well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor patients, a single arm, prospective, single center phase II study was designed (MetNET-1 trial, NCT 02294006).Forty-three patients are expected to be evaluated.The study is ongoing, and recruitment is estimated to be completed in August 2016.The results will be anticipated in 2017.",0,0,0,0
30705033,"Randomized study of imatinib for chronic myeloid leukemia: comparing standard dose escalation with aggressive escalation.In 2007, we conducted a prospective randomized study to compare an aggressive dose escalation (group B, n = 123) with the standard dose escalation proposed by European LeukemiaNet (group A, n = 122).In group B, if patients did not achieve a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) at 3 months or did not achieve a major molecular response (MR3) at 6 months, imatinib was increased to 600 mg.At 6 months CCyR was achieved in 69.4% and 78.7% of patients in groups A and B, respectively.The rate of MR3 at 12 months and 24 months were similar in group A (52.1% and 70.0%) and group B (58.7% and 68.3%).The cumulative incidence of withdrawal by failure without accelerated/blast phase was higher in group A than in group B (9.2% vs 2.5% at 24 months).At 3 and 6 months, the protocol called for the imatinib dose to increase to 600 mg in 90 patients (74.4%) in group B. Among the 42 patients who received increased dose according to the protocol, 25 (60.0%) achieved MR3 at 12 months, whereas only 14 (35.0%) of 40 patients who did not receive an increased dose achieved MR3 (P < .05).The number of patients who withdrew from this study was similar (group A, 20%; group B, 21%).The early aggressive dose escalation failed to produce a better molecular response at 12 months.However, for patients who tolerate imatinib well, but show inadequate response at an early time point, aggressive dose escalation may contribute to achieving a better outcome.This study was registered at http://www.umin.ac.jp/ctr/ as #R000000965.",1,1,1,1

Sixteen patients (12%) had high serum levels of Hsp27 at baseline.In this small group, patients who received apatorsen had median PFS of 10.8 months, and those who received placebo had median PFS 4.8 months.CONCLUSION: The addition of apatorsen to carboplatin and pemetrexed was well tolerated but did not improve outcomes in patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC cancer in the first-line setting.IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This randomized, double-blinded, phase II trial evaluated the efficacy of carboplatin and pemetrexed plus either apatorsen, an antisense oligonucleotide targeting heat shock protein 27 mRNA, or placebo in patients with previously untreated metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).The addition of apatorsen to carboplatin and pemetrexed was well tolerated but did not improve outcomes in patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC cancer in the first-line setting.",1,1,1,1
26946057,"BRCA1-like profile predicts benefit of tandem high dose epirubicin-cyclophospamide-thiotepa in high risk breast cancer patients randomized in the WSG-AM01 trial.BRCA1 is an important protein in the repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), which are induced by alkylating chemotherapy.A BRCA1-like DNA copy number signature derived from tumors with a BRCA1 mutation is indicative for impaired BRCA1 function and associated with good outcome after high dose (HD) and tandem HD DSB inducing chemotherapy.We investigated whether BRCA1-like status was a predictive biomarker in the WSG AM 01 trial.WSG AM 01 randomized high-risk breast cancer patients to induction (2x epirubicin-cyclophosphamide) followed by tandem HD chemotherapy with epirubicin, cyclophosphamide and thiotepa versus dose dense chemotherapy (4x epirubicin-cyclophospamide followed by 3x cyclophosphamide-methotrexate-5-fluorouracil).We generated copy number profiles for 143 tumors and classified them as being BRCA1-like or non-BRCA1-like.Twenty-six out of 143 patients were BRCA1-like.BRCA1-like status was associated with high grade and triple negative tumors.With regard to event-free-survival, the primary endpoint of the trial, patients with a BRCA1-like tumor had a hazard rate of 0.2, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.07-0.63, p = 0.006.In the interaction analysis, the combination of BRCA1-like status and HD chemotherapy had a hazard rate of 0.19, 95% CI: 0.067-0.54, p = 0.003.Similar results were observed for overall survival.These findings suggest that BRCA1-like status is a predictor for benefit of tandem HD chemotherapy with epirubicin-thiotepa-cyclophosphamide.",1,1,1,1
32179448,"Outcomes of metastatic non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas (NRSTS) treated within the BERNIE study: a randomised, phase II study evaluating the addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy.PURPOSE: We analysed the cohort of paediatric patients with metastatic non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas (NRSTS) treated in the BERNIE protocol, i.e. open-label, multicentre, randomised phase II study evaluating the role of bevacizumab (BO20924/ITCC-006; ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00643565).METHODS: Eligible patients were randomised 1:1 to add or not add bevacizumab to nine courses of intensive multi-drug chemotherapy, followed by 12-month maintenance chemotherapy (plus surgery and radiotherapy).The primary end-point was event-free survival (EFS); secondary objectives were objective response rate (ORR) and overall survival (OS).RESULTS: From 2008 and 2013, 49 NRSTS patients (out of 154 cases) were treated, 26 in the standard arm and 23 in the bevacizumab arm.ORR was seen in 10 out of 36 evaluable cases (27.7%), i.e. 4/18 standard arm cases and 6/18 bevacizumab arm cases.Two-year EFS was 27.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 13.9-42.5) for all NRSTS patients, i.e. 34.9% (95% CI 14.6-56.2) for bevacizumab arm and 22.9% (95% CI 7.1-43.9) for standard arm (p-value = 0.19).Three-year OS (median follow-up 48.6 months) was 35.2%, with no differences in the two arms.Time to event and time to death were 16.3 and 17.2 months for bevacizumab arm and 2.1 and 7.6 months for standard arm, respectively.Patients not receiving any local treatment on primary disease had a worse outcome as compared to others.Treatment results were better for patients receiving surgical resection and worse for those who did not receive any specific treatment.CONCLUSION: The addition of the anti-angiogenic agent to the standard chemotherapy did not show statistically significant improvement in survival in metastatic NRSTS.",1,1,1,1
24960402,"A phase IIa dose-finding and safety study of first-line pertuzumab in combination with trastuzumab, capecitabine and cisplatin in patients with HER2-positive advanced gastric cancer.BACKGROUND: Pertuzumab plus trastuzumab provides a more comprehensive blockade of HER2 signalling than trastuzumab alone.Therefore, we conducted a phase IIa study of the pharmacokinetics and safety of pertuzumab plus trastuzumab and chemotherapy in advanced gastric cancer (aGC).METHODS: Patients received pertuzumab 840 mg for cycle 1 and 420 mg q3w for cycles 2-6 (Arm A) or pertuzumab 840 mg q3w for six cycles (Arm B).Trastuzumab, cisplatin and capecitabine were also given for six cycles, then trastuzumab q3w until disease progression or unmanageable toxicity.The co-primary endpoints were day 43 pertuzumab serum trough concentration (Cmin) and safety.RESULTS: Thirty patients were randomised.Mean pertuzumab Cmin at day 43 was 40.0 mug ml(-1) (s.d.: 17.3) in Arm A and 62.7 mug ml(-1) (29.1) in Arm B. Mean day 43 Cmin in Arm A was ~37% lower than that seen in metastatic breast cancer.The safety profiles were similar between arms and treatment was well tolerated.Partial responses were achieved by 86% and 55% of patients in Arms A and B, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the pharmacokinetic and safety data, the 840 mg q3w pertuzumab dose has been selected for a phase III study of pertuzumab, trastuzumab and chemotherapy in HER2-positive aGC.",1,1,1,1
25403578,"FOLFOX4 versus sequential dose-dense FOLFOX7 followed by FOLFIRI in patients with resectable metastatic colorectal cancer (MIROX): a pragmatic approach to chemotherapy timing with perioperative or postoperative chemotherapy from an open-label, randomized phase III trial.BACKGROUND: Perioperative FOLFOX4 (oxaliplatin plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin) chemotherapy is the current standard in patients with resectable metastases from colorectal cancer (CRC).We aimed to determine whether a sequential chemotherapy with dose-dense oxaliplatin (FOLFOX7) and irinotecan (FOLFIRI; irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin) is superior to FOLFOX4.The chemotherapy timing was not imposed, and was perioperative or postoperative.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this open-label, phase III trial, patients with resectable or resected metastases were randomly assigned either to 12 cycles of FOLFOX4 (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m(2)) or 6 cycles of FOLFOX7 (oxaliplatin 130 mg/m(2)) followed by 6 cycles of FOLFIRI (irinotecan 180 mg/m(2)).Randomization was done centrally, with stratification by chemotherapy timing, type of local treatment (surgery versus radiofrequency ablation with/without surgery), and Fong's prognostic score.The primary end point was 2-year disease-free survival (DFS).RESULTS: A total of 284 patients were randomized, 142 in each treatment group.Chemotherapy was perioperative in 168 (59.2%) patients and postoperative in 116 (40.8%) patients.Perioperative chemotherapy was preferentially proposed for synchronous metastases, whereas postoperative chemotherapy was more frequently used for metachronous metastases.Two-year DFS was 48.5% in the FOLFOX4 group and 50.0% in the FOLFOX7-FOLFIRI group.In the multivariable analysis, more than one metastasis [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.15] and synchronous metastases (HR = 1.63) were independent prognostic factors for shorter DFS.Five-year overall survival (OS) rate was 69.5% with FOLFOX4 versus 66.6% with FOLFOX7-FOLFIRI.CONCLUSIONS: FOLFOX7-FOLFIRI is not superior to FOLFOX4 in patients with resectable metastatic CRC.Five-year OS rates observed in both groups are the highest ever reported in this setting, possibly reflecting the pragmatic approach to chemotherapy timing.CLINICAL TRIALS NUMBER: NCT00268398.",1,1,1,1
23532629,"Erythropoietin treatment in chemotherapy-induced anemia in previously untreated advanced esophagogastric cancer patients.BACKGROUND: The impact of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents in chemotherapy-induced anemia has been a constant topic of debate over recent years.We prospectively assessed the efficacy of epoetin beta (Epo-b) in improving hemoglobin (Hb) levels and outcome in patients within an open label, randomized clinical phase II trial with advanced or metastatic gastric/esophagogastric cancer.METHODS: Previously untreated patients were randomized to receive 3-weekly cycles of capecitabine (1000 mg/m(2) bid) for 14 days plus on day 1 either irinotecan 250 mg/m(2) or cisplatin 80 mg/m(2).Epo-b (30000 IU once weekly) was initiated in patients with Hb <11 g/dl and continued until Hb >/=12 g/dl was reached.If after 4 weeks the Hb increase was <0.5 g/dl, Epo-b was increased to 30000 IU, twice weekly.RESULTS: Of 118 patients enrolled, 32 received Epo-b treatment; of these, 65 % achieved an increase in Hb levels of at least 2 g/dl, with 74 % achieving the target Hb of >/=12 g/dl.Within the study population, patients receiving Epo-b showed better overall survival (median 14.5 vs. 8.0 months, P = 0.056) as well as a significantly improved disease control rate (78 vs. 55 %, P = 0.025).Patients in the irinotecan group profited significantly (P < 0.05) in terms of progression-free survival and overall survival under Epo-b treatment (median 6.5 vs 4.1 months and median 15.4 vs 8.4 months, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: Epo-b was effective in raising Hb levels in patients with advanced esophagogastric cancer.Patients receiving Epo-b had a significantly increased response to chemotherapy and a clear trend to improved survival.",1,1,1,1
29696328,"Does Intermittent Pringle Maneuver Increase Postoperative Complications After Hepatectomy for Hepatocellular Carcinoma? A Randomized Controlled Trial.BACKGROUND: In a previous study, we have shown that intermittent Pringle maneuver (IPM) might increase postoperative complications after hepatectomy for various indications.Complications which thought to be related to IPM were ascites, pleural effusion, wound infection and intra-abdominal collection.The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that applying IPM during hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) could increase postoperative complications.METHODS: Between January 2013 and October 2016, eligible patients who received elective open hepatectomy for HCC were randomized to have IPM or no Pringle maneuver (NPM).Occurrence of various types of postoperative complications was specifically looked for.A routine postoperative day 5 abdominal ultrasound examination and chest X-ray were done to detect and grade any radiological ascites, pleural effusion and intra-abdominal collection.RESULTS: Fifty IPM and 50 NPM patients with histological proven HCC were recruited for final analysis.Demographics and operative parameters were comparable between the two groups.The postoperative complication rates were similar (IPM 36.0 vs. NPM 28.0%, P = 0.391).However, in the IPM group, more patients developed radiological posthepatectomy ascites (42.0 vs. 22.0%, P = 0.032) and pleural effusion (66.0 vs. 38.0%, P = 0.005).In patients with histologically proven cirrhosis, there were 28 IPM and 25 NPM patients.Again, there was no difference in postoperative complication rate but more radiological posthepatectomy ascites and pleural effusion in the IPM group.CONCLUSION: This trial was not able to detect a difference in postoperative complications whether IPM was applied or not, but use of IPM was associated with more subclinical ascites and pleural effusion.(ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01759901).TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01759901.",0,0,0,0
29534639,"Cytokeratin-18 fragments predict treatment response and overall survival in gastric cancer in a randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer is common malignancy and exhibits a poor prognosis.At the time of diagnosis, the majority of patients present with metastatic disease which precludes curative treatment.Non-invasive biomarkers which discriminate early from advanced stages or predict the response to treatment are urgently required.This study explored the cytokeratin-18 fragment M30 and full-length cytokeratin-18 M65 in predicting treatment response and survival in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of advanced gastric cancer.METHODS: Patients enrolled in the SUN-CASE study received sunitinib or placebo as an adjunct to standard therapy with leucovorin (Ca-folinate), 5-fluorouracil, and irinotecan in second or third line.Treatment response rates, progression-free survival and overall survival were assessed during a follow-up period of 12 months.Cytokeratin-18 fragments were analyzed in 52 patients at baseline and day 14 of therapy.RESULTS: Levels of M30 correlated with the presence of metastasis and lymph node involvement and decreased significantly during chemotherapy.Importantly, baseline levels of M30 were significantly higher in patients who failed therapy.In addition, patients who did not respond to treatment were also identifiable at day 14 based on elevated M30 levels.By stepwise regression analysis, M30 at day 14 was identified as independent predictor of treatment response.Likewise, serum levels of full-length cytokeratin-18 M65 at baseline also correlated with treatment failure and progression-free survival.The addition of sunitinib did not exert any effects on serum levels of M30 or M65.CONCLUSION: The cytokeratin-18 fragment M30 at day 14 identifies patients that fail to second- or third-line therapy for advanced gastric cancer.Validation of this non-invasive biomarker in gastric cancer is warranted.",1,1,1,1
27339115,"Conventional versus hypofractionated high-dose intensity-modulated radiotherapy for prostate cancer: 5-year outcomes of the randomised, non-inferiority, phase 3 CHHiP trial.BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer might have high radiation-fraction sensitivity that would give a therapeutic advantage to hypofractionated treatment.We present a pre-planned analysis of the efficacy and side-effects of a randomised trial comparing conventional and hypofractionated radiotherapy after 5 years follow-up.METHODS: CHHiP is a randomised, phase 3, non-inferiority trial that recruited men with localised prostate cancer (pT1b-T3aN0M0).Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to conventional (74 Gy delivered in 37 fractions over 7.4 weeks) or one of two hypofractionated schedules (60 Gy in 20 fractions over 4 weeks or 57 Gy in 19 fractions over 3.8 weeks)all delivered with intensity-modulated techniques.Most patients were given radiotherapy with 3-6 months of neoadjuvant and concurrent androgen suppression.Randomisation was by computer-generated random permuted blocks, stratified by National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk group and radiotherapy treatment centre, and treatment allocation was not masked.The primary endpoint was time to biochemical or clinical failure; the critical hazard ratio (HR) for non-inferiority was 1.208.Analysis was by intention to treat.Long-term follow-up continues.The CHHiP trial is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN97182923.FINDINGS: Between Oct 18, 2002, and June 17, 2011, 3216 men were enrolled from 71 centres and randomly assigned (74 Gy group, 1065 patients; 60 Gy group, 1074 patients; 57 Gy group, 1077 patients).Median follow-up was 62.4 months (IQR 53.9-77.0).The proportion of patients who were biochemical or clinical failure free at 5 years was 88.3% (95% CI 86.0-90.2) in the 74 Gy group, 90.6% (88.5-92.3) in the 60 Gy group, and 85.9% (83.4-88.0) in the 57 Gy group.60 Gy was non-inferior to 74 Gy (HR 0.84 [90% CI 0.68-1.03], pNI=0.0018) but non-inferiority could not be claimed for 57 Gy compared with 74 Gy (HR 1.20 [0.99-1.46], pNI=0.48).Long-term side-effects were similar in the hypofractionated groups compared with the conventional group.There were no significant differences in either the proportion or cumulative incidence of side-effects 5 years after treatment using three clinician-reported as well as patient-reported outcome measures.The estimated cumulative 5 year incidence of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) grade 2 or worse bowel and bladder adverse events was 13.7% (111 events) and 9.1% (66 events) in the 74 Gy group, 11.9% (105 events) and 11.7% (88 events) in the 60 Gy group, 11.3% (95 events) and 6.6% (57 events) in the 57 Gy group, respectively.No treatment-related deaths were reported.INTERPRETATION: Hypofractionated radiotherapy using 60 Gy in 20 fractions is non-inferior to conventional fractionation using 74 Gy in 37 fractions and is recommended as a new standard of care for external-beam radiotherapy of localised prostate cancer.FUNDING: Cancer Research UK, Department of Health, and the National Institute for Health Research Cancer Research Network.",1,1,1,1

32064794,"Effect of anlotinib as a third- or further-line therapy in advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients with different histologic types: Subgroup analysis in the ALTER0303 trial.BACKGROUND: Anlotinib showed significant survival benefits in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients as a third- or further-line treatment in the ALTER0303 trial.We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of anlotinib in patients with different histologies.METHODS: The ALTER0303 trial was a randomized, open-label, phase 3 study of anlotinib in NSCLC patients previously treated with at least two lines of chemotherapy or a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) in 31 centers in China.Patients were randomly assigned at a 2:1 ratio to receive anlotinib (12 mg QD from days 1 to 14 of a 21-day cycle) or placebo until progression or intolerable toxicity.The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS).We assessed the efficacy of anlotinib in histological subgroups in the full analysis set.RESULTS: In the ALTER0303 trial, 336 patients had the histological subtype of adenocarcinoma (ACC), 86 patients had the histological subtype of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and 15 patients had another subtype.In the ACC subgroup, the median OS time was significantly improved with anlotinib compared with placebo (9.6 months vs 6.9 months, P = .0051), as was the median progression-free survival (PFS) time (5.5 months vs 1.4 months, P < .0001).In the SCC subgroup, the median OS time was 10.7 months in the anlotinib group and 6.5 months in the placebo group (P = .2570), and the median PFS time was 4.8 months and 2.7 months (P = .0004), respectively.The common adverse events observed in the SCC and ACC subgroups were similar.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that anlotinib significantly improves PFS and OS in ACC patients and has a tendency to prolong survival in SCC patients.",1,1,1,1
23850170,"Which patients benefit most from primary surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy in stage IIIC or IV ovarian cancer? An exploratory analysis of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer 55971 randomised trial.BACKGROUND: To investigate whether biomarkers consisting of baseline characteristics of advanced stage ovarian cancer patients can help in identifying subgroups of patients who would benefit more from primary surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy.METHODS: We used data of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 55971 trial in which 670 patients were randomly assigned to primary surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy.The primary outcome was overall survival.Ten baseline clinical and pathological characteristics were selected as potential biomarkers.Using Subpopulation Treatment Effect Pattern Plots (STEPP), biomarkers with a statistically significant qualitative additive interaction with treatment were considered as potentially informative for treatment selection.We also combined selected biomarkers to form a multimarker treatment selection rule.FINDINGS: The size of the largest metastatic tumour and clinical stage were significantly associated with the magnitude of the benefit from treatment, in terms of five-year survival (p for interaction: 0.008 and 0.016, respectively).Stage IIIC patients with metastatic tumours 45 mm benefited more from primary surgery while stage IV patients with metastatic tumours >45 mm benefited more from neoadjuvant chemotherapy.In stage IIIC patients with larger metastatic tumours and in stage IV patients with less extensive metastatic tumours both treatments were equally effective.We estimated that by selecting treatments for patients based on largest metastatic tumour and clinical stage, the potential five-year survival rate in the population of treated patients would be 27.3% (95% confidence interval (CI) 21.9-33.0), 7.8% higher than if all were treated with primary surgery, and 5.6% higher if all were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.INTERPRETATION: Although survival was comparable after primary surgery and neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the overall group of patients with ovarian cancer in the EORTC 55971 trial, we found in this exploratory analysis that patients with stage IIIC and less extensive metastatic tumours had higher survival with primary surgery, while patients with stage IV disease and large metastatic tumours had higher survival with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.For patients who did not meet these criteria, both treatment options led to comparable survival rates.",1,1,1,1

22383680,"Influence of zoledronic acid on disseminated tumor cells in primary breast cancer patients.BACKGROUND: The presence of disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) in bone marrow of patients with early breast cancer (EBC) has been correlated with increased risk of metastatic disease or locoregional relapse.Zoledronic acid (ZOL) treatment has reduced DTCs in the bone marrow of patients with EBC in several studies.This controlled study sought to confirm these observations.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with EBC and DTC-positive bone marrow were randomized (N = 96) to treatment with ZOL plus adjuvant systemic therapy or adjuvant systemic therapy alone.The change in DTC numbers at 12 months versus baseline was measured.RESULTS: DTC-positive patients treated with ZOL were more likely to become DTC-negative after 12 months of treatment compared with the controls (67% versus 35%; P = 0.009).At 12 months, DTC counts decreased to a mean of 0.5 +/- 0.8 DTCs in the ZOL group and to 0.9 +/- 0.8 DTCs in the control group.In addition, ZOL was generally well tolerated.CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with ZOL improves elimination of DTCs.Further studies are needed to determine whether the reduction in DTCs by ZOL provides clinical benefit.",1,1,1,1
23190833,"Efficacy of leukocyte- and platelet-rich fibrin in wound healing: a randomized controlled clinical trial.BACKGROUND: Application of platelet concentrates to wounds could speed healing.Leukocyte- and platelet-rich fibrin, a relatively recent development, stands out from the other preparations.This prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial studied the rate of healing of postoperative hand wounds after a single application of leukocyte- and platelet-rich fibrin.METHODS: Eligible patients were healthy individuals older than 18 years who had been scheduled for elective McCash (open palm) surgery for Dupuytren disease at the Plastic and Hand Surgery Department of Nice's University Hospital between August of 2007 and February of 2010.The control group received the reference care of petroleum jelly mesh (Vaselitulle), and test patients had leukocyte- and platelet-rich fibrin applied.The primary endpoint was healing delay measured in postoperative days.Secondary endpoints included pain, bleeding, and wound exudate.The trial was carried out as a single-blind trial.RESULTS: Among the 68 randomized patients, 33 patients in the leukocyte- and platelet-rich fibrin group and 31 in the Vaselitulle group were analyzed.Primary endpoint analysis showed a median healing delay of 24 days (interquartile range, 18 to 28 days) for the fibrin group and 29 days (interquartile range, 26 to 35 days) for the Vaselitulle group (p = 0.014, log-rank test).Postoperative pain assessment, bleeding, and exudate were always lower for the fibrin group, but not significantly so.CONCLUSION: The authors trial demonstrates that a single leukocyte- and platelet-rich fibrin application on fresh postoperative hand wounds shows a median improvement of 5 days in comparison with the standard treatment.CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, II.",0,0,0,0
32469095,"Drug cost savings in phase III hematological oncology clinical trials in a university hospital.The rapid emergence of expensive anticancer therapies is leading to exponential growth in healthcare expenses.In clinical trials, most investigational drugs are provided free of charge by industrial and academic sponsors.This results in drug cost savings for healthcare payers, who are no longer charged with the cost of the standard-of-care treatment, which would have been administered outside the trial.This study aims to estimate drug cost savings resulting from patient enrolment in hematological oncology clinical trials, from a public payer perspective.Retrospective screening identified all patients with hematological malignancies included from 2011 to 2016 in a phase III trial and having received at least one sponsor-provided cycle.Drug cost savings were defined as the standard treatment costs not charged to the payer due to sponsor provision of treatment.For each patient, cost savings were determined by the number of cycles received in the trial and the cost of standard (control arm) treatment.Of the 345 patients included in eligible trials during study period, 272 received sponsor-provided drugs.Drug cost savings could be estimated for 177 patients (65.1%) included in 27 trials.Total cost savings were euro5218 million (US$ 6804 million) for 1720 sponsor-provided cycles.Mean cost saving per patient was euro19 182.7 +/-29 865.7 ($25 015.24 +/- 39 478.25).Most cost-saving trials were industry-sponsored (77.8%), although academic trials generated 40.15% of total cost savings.Enrolling patients in clinical trials, whether industry-sponsored or academic, leads to substantial drug cost savings for payers.Implications are significant for public payers facing increasing financial constraints, as savings can be reallocated to patient care.",0,0,0,0
31776742,"Body interventional procedures: which is the best method for CT guidance?OBJECTIVES: To compare sequential fluoroscopy guidance with spiral guidance in terms of safety, effectiveness, speed and radiation in interventional whole body procedures.METHODS: This study was a retrospective analysis of data from the prospective, randomised controlled, multicentre CTNAV2 study.The present analysis included 385 patients: 247 in the sequential group (SEQ) and 138 in the spiral group (SPI).Safety was assessed by the number of major complications.Effectiveness was measured according to the number of targets reached.Data on procedural time and radiation delivered to patients were also collected.RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the two groups (SEQ vs SPI) regarding the success rate (99.6% vs 99.3%, p = 0.680), procedural time (7 min 40 s +/- 5 min 48 s vs 7 min 13 s +/- 7 min 33 s, p = 0.507), or major complications (2.43% vs 5.8%, p = 0.101).Radiation dose to patients was 84% lower in the sequential group (54.8 +/- 51.8 mGy cm vs 352.6 +/- 404 mGy cm, p < 0.0001).CONCLUSIONS: Sequential CT fluoroscopy-guided whole-body interventional procedures seems to be as safe, effective and fast as spiral guidance, while also yielding a significant decrease in the radiation dose to patients.KEY POINTS: * Sequential CT fluoroscopy and spiral acquisition are comparable in terms of safety, effectiveness and speed.* Procedural times are comparable despite an increased number of acquisitions in sequential fluoroscopy.* Radiation dose to patients is 84% lower in sequential fluoroscopy compared with spiral CT.",0,0,0,0
31790344,"Pembrolizumab As Second-Line Therapy in Patients With Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma in KEYNOTE-240: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Phase III Trial.PURPOSE: Pembrolizumab demonstrated antitumor activity and safety in the phase II KEYNOTE-224 trial in previously treated patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).KEYNOTE-240 evaluated the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab in this population.PATIENTS AND METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, phase III study was conducted at 119 medical centers in 27 countries.Eligible patients with advanced HCC, previously treated with sorafenib, were randomly assigned at a two-to-one ratio to receive pembrolizumab plus best supportive care (BSC) or placebo plus BSC.Primary end points were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS; one-sided significance thresholds, P = .0174 [final analysis] and P = .002 [first interim analysis], respectively).Safety was assessed in all patients who received >/= 1 dose of study drug.RESULTS: Between May 31, 2016, and November 23, 2017, 413 patients were randomly assigned.As of January 2, 2019, median follow-up was 13.8 months for pembrolizumab and 10.6 months for placebo.Median OS was 13.9 months (95% CI, 11.6 to 16.0 months) for pembrolizumab versus 10.6 months (95% CI, 8.3 to 13.5 months) for placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 0.781; 95% CI, 0.611 to 0.998; P = .0238).Median PFS for pembrolizumab was 3.0 months (95% CI, 2.8 to 4.1 months) versus 2.8 months (95% CI, 2.5 to 4.1 months) for placebo at the first interim analysis (HR, 0.775; 95% CI, 0.609 to 0.987; P = .0186) and 3.0 months (95% CI, 2.8 to 4.1 months) versus 2.8 months (95% CI, 1.6 to 3.0 months) at final analysis (HR, 0.718; 95% CI, 0.570 to 0.904; P = .0022).Grade 3 or higher adverse events occurred in 147 (52.7%) and 62 patients (46.3%) for pembrolizumab versus placebo; those that were treatment related occurred in 52 (18.6%) and 10 patients (7.5%), respectively.No hepatitis C or B flares were identified.CONCLUSION: In this study, OS and PFS did not reach statistical significance per specified criteria.The results are consistent with those of KEYNOTE-224, supporting a favorable risk-to-benefit ratio for pembrolizumab in this population.",1,1,1,1
22892060,"Hormone replacement therapy after breast cancer: 10 year follow up of the Stockholm randomised trial.BACKGROUND: The management of hormonal deficiency symptoms in breast cancer survivors is an unsolved problem.While hormone replacement therapy (HRT) may increase the risk of breast cancer in healthy women, its effects on recurrence is unclear.Observational studies have suggested decreased recurrence rates from HRT.The few clinical trials in this field have all been closed preterm.METHODS: The Stockholm trial was started in 1997 and designed to minimise the dose of progestogen in the HRT arm.Disease-free women with a history of breast cancer were randomised to HRT (n=188) or no HRT (n=190).The trial was stopped in 2003 when another Swedish study (HABITS, the Hormonal Replacement After Breast Cancer - Is it Safe?) reported increased recurrence.However the Stockholm material showed no excess risk after 4 years of follow-up.A long term follow-up has now been performed.FINDINGS: After 10.8 years of follow-up, there was no difference in new breast cancer events: 60 in the HRT group versus 48 among controls (hazard ratio (HR)=1.3; 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.9-1.9).Among women on HRT, 11 had local recurrence and 12 distant metastases versus 15 and 12 for the controls.There were 14 contra-lateral breast cancers in the HRT group and four in the control group (HR=3.6; 95% CI=1.2-10.9; p=0.013).No differences in mortality or new primary malignancies were found.INTERPRETATION: The number of new events did not differ significantly between groups, in contrast to previous reports.The increased recurrence in HABITS has been attributed to higher progestogen exposure.As both trials were prematurely closed, data do not allow firm conclusions.Both studies found no increased mortality from breast cancer or other causes from HRT.Current guidelines typically consider HRT contraindicated in breast cancer survivors.Findings suggest that, in some women symptom relief may outweigh the potential risks of HRT.",0,0,0,0

24323034,"Targeted androgen pathway suppression in localized prostate cancer: a pilot study.PURPOSE: Ligand-mediated activation of the androgen receptor (AR) is critical for prostate cancer (PCa) survival and proliferation.The failure to completely ablate tissue androgens may limit suppression of PCa growth.We evaluated combinations of CYP17A and 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors for reducing prostate androgen levels, AR signaling, and PCa volumes.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-five men with intermediate/high-risk clinically localized PCa were randomly assigned to goserelin combined with dutasteride (ZD), bicalutamide and dutasteride (ZBD), or bicalutamide, dutasteride, and ketoconazole (ZBDK) for 3 months before prostatectomy.Controls included patients receiving combined androgen blockade with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist and bicalutamide.The primary outcome measure was tissue dihydrotestosterone (DHT) concentration.RESULTS: Prostate DHT levels were substantially lower in all experimental arms (0.02 to 0.04 ng/g v 0.92 ng/g in controls; P < .001).The ZBDK group demonstrated the greatest percentage decline in serum testosterone, androsterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (P < .05 for all).Staining for AR and the androgen-regulated genes prostate-specific antigen and TMPRSS2 was strongly suppressed in benign glands and moderately in malignant glands (P < .05 for all).Two patients had pathologic complete response, and nine had </= 0.2 cm(3) of residual tumor (defined as a near-complete response), with the largest numbers of complete and near-complete responses in the ZBDK group.CONCLUSION: Addition of androgen synthesis inhibitors lowers prostate androgens below that achieved with standard therapy, but significant AR signaling remains.Tissue-based analysis of steroids and AR signaling is critical to informing the search for optimal local and systemic control of high-risk prostate cancer.",1,1,1,1
29698447,"Celecoxib use and circulating oxylipins in a colon polyp prevention trial.Drugs that inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and the metabolism of arachidonic acid (ARA) to prostaglandin E2 are potent anti-inflammatory agents used widely in the treatment of joint and muscle pain.Despite their benefits, daily use of these drugs has been associated with hypertension, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal toxicities.It is now recognized that ARA is metabolized to a number of bioactive oxygenated lipids (oxylipins) by cyclooxygenase (COX), lipoxygenase (LOX), and cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes.Currently, the contribution of individual variability in ARA metabolism in response to the COX-2 inhibitors and potential adverse effects remains poorly understood.Using patient samples from the randomized, placebo-controlled phase III selenium/celecoxib (Sel/Cel) trial for the prevention of colorectal adenomatous polyps, we analyzed plasma concentrations of 74 oxylipins in a subset of participants who received celecoxib (n = 90) or placebo (n = 95).We assessed the effect of celecoxib (with and without low dose aspirin) on circulating oxylipins and systolic blood pressure (SBP).Individual CYP450- and LOX- but not COX-derived metabolites were higher with celecoxib than placebo (P<0.05) and differences were greater among non-aspirin users.LOX derived 5- and 8-HETE were elevated with celecoxib and positively associated with systolic blood pressure (P = 0.011 and P = 0.019 respectively).20-HETE, a prohypertensive androgen-sensitive CYP450 metabolite was higher with celecoxib absent aspirin and was positively associated with SBP in men (P = 0.040) but not women.Independent of celecoxib or aspirin, LOX derived metabolites from ARA were strongly associated with SBP including 5- and 8-HETE.These findings support oxylipins, particularly the ARA LOX-derived, in blood pressure control and indicate that pharmacologic inhibition of COX-2 has effects on LOX and CYP450 ARA metabolism that contribute to hypertension in some patients.",0,0,0,0

34891224,"Axicabtagene Ciloleucel as Second-Line Therapy for Large B-Cell Lymphoma.BACKGROUND: The prognosis of patients with early relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma after the receipt of first-line chemoimmunotherapy is poor.METHODS: In this international, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, patients with large B-cell lymphoma that was refractory to or had relapsed no more than 12 months after first-line chemoimmunotherapy to receive axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel, an autologous anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy) or standard care (two or three cycles of investigator-selected, protocol-defined chemoimmunotherapy, followed by high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem-cell transplantation in patients with a response to the chemoimmunotherapy).The primary end point was event-free survival according to blinded central review.Key secondary end points were response and overall survival.Safety was also assessed.RESULTS: A total of 180 patients were randomly assigned to receive axi-cel and 179 to receive standard care.The primary end-point analysis of event-free survival showed that axi-cel therapy was superior to standard care.At a median follow-up of 24.9 months, the median event-free survival was 8.3 months in the axi-cel group and 2.0 months in the standard-care group, and the 24-month event-free survival was 41% and 16%, respectively (hazard ratio for event or death, 0.40; 95% confidence interval, 0.31 to 0.51; P<0.001).A response occurred in 83% of the patients in the axi-cel group and in 50% of those in the standard-care group (with a complete response in 65% and 32%, respectively).In an interim analysis, the estimated overall survival at 2 years was 61% in the axi-cel group and 52% in the standard-care group.Adverse events of grade 3 or higher occurred in 91% of the patients who received axi-cel and in 83% of those who received standard care.Among patients who received axi-cel, grade 3 or higher cytokine release syndrome occurred in 6% and grade 3 or higher neurologic events in 21%.No deaths related to cytokine release syndrome or neurologic events occurred.CONCLUSIONS: Axi-cel therapy led to significant improvements, as compared with standard care, in event-free survival and response, with the expected level of high-grade toxic effects.(Funded by Kite; ZUMA-7 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03391466.).",1,1,1,1
28692586,"Bioactivity and prostate tissue distribution of metformin in a preprostatectomy prostate cancer cohort.Metformin has recently been shown to have potential to reduce prostate cancer risk.We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine the modulating effects of metformin on tissue and systemic biomarkers of drug activity and its distribution into the prostate tissue.Twenty patients with prostate cancer scheduled to undergo prostatectomy were randomly assigned to receive either extended-release metformin or placebo for a median of 34 days before surgery.Prostatectomy and serum samples were analyzed for metformin concentrations, serum biomarkers of drug activity (prostate-specific antigen, insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3, sex hormone-binding globulin, and testosterone) and tissue biomarkers of proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, and mTOR inhibition.For participants in the metformin arm, the prostate tissue and serum metformin concentrations ranged from 0.88 to 51.2 mug/g tissue and from not detectable to 3.6 mug/ml, respectively.There were no differences between the two groups in either the postintervention tissue biomarker expression in the prostatectomy tissue or pre to postintervention changes in serum biomarkers.We conclude that metformin distributes to human prostate tissue, suggesting that metformin could exert its effects directly on tissue targets.However, there was no difference in tissue and systemic drug effect biomarkers between the two treatment arms.Future studies with longer intervention duration and larger sample size should be considered in order to evaluate the potential of metformin for prostate cancer prevention.",1,1,1,1
23233657,"High cereblon expression is associated with better survival in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma treated with thalidomide maintenance.Recently, cereblon (CRBN) expression was found to be essential for the activity of thalidomide and lenalidomide.In the present study, we investigated whether the clinical efficacy of thalidomide in multiple myeloma is associated with CRBN expression in myeloma cells.Patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma were included in the HOVON-65/GMMG-HD4 trial, in which postintensification treatment in 1 arm consisted of daily thalidomide (50 mg) for 2 years.Gene-expression profiling, determined at the start of the trial, was available for 96 patients who started thalidomide maintenance.In this patient set, increase of CRBN gene expression was significantly associated with longerprogression-free survival (P = .005).In contrast, no association between CRBN expression and survival was observed in the arm with bortezomib maintenance.We conclude that CRBN expression may be associated with the clinical efficacy of thalidomide.This trial has been registered at the Nederlands Trial Register (www.trialregister.nl) as NTR213; at the European Union Drug Regulating Authorities Clinical Trials (EudraCT) as 2004-000944-26; and at the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) as 64455289.",1,1,1,1
23358966,"Postinduction dexamethasone and individualized dosing of Escherichia Coli L-asparaginase each improve outcome of children and adolescents with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia: results from a randomized study--Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ALL Consortium Protocol 00-01.PURPOSE: We assessed the toxicity and efficacy of dexamethasone and a novel dosing method of Escherichia coli L-asparaginase (EC-Asnase) in children and adolescents with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients achieving complete remission (CR) on Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ALL Consortium Protocol 00-01 were eligible for random assignment to 1) dexamethasone or prednisone, administered as 5-day pulses, every 3 weeks, and 2) weekly EC-Asnase, administered as a 25,000 IU/m(2) fixed dose (FD) or individualized dose (ID) starting at 12,500-IU/m(2), adjusted every 3 weeks based on nadir serum asparaginase activity (NSAA) determinations.RESULTS: Between 2000 and 2004, 492 evaluable patients (ages 1 to 18 years) enrolled; 473 patients (96%) achieved CR.Four hundred eight patients (86%) participated in the corticosteroid randomization and 384 patients (81%) in the EC-Asnase randomization.With 4.9 years of median follow-up, dexamethasone was associated with superior 5-year event-free survival (EFS; 90% v 81% for prednisone; P = .01) but higher rates of infection (P = .03) and, in older children, higher cumulative incidence of osteonecrosis (P = .02) and fracture (P = .06).ID EC-Asnase had superior 5-year EFS (90% v 82% for FD; P = .04), but did not reduce the frequency of asparaginase-related toxicity.Multivariable analysis identified both dexamethasone and ID EC-Asnase as independent predictors of favorable EFS.CONCLUSION: There was no overall difference in skeletal toxicity by corticosteroid type; dexamethasone was associated with more infections and, in older children, increased incidence of osteonecrosis and fracture.There was no difference in asparaginase-related toxicity by EC-Asnase dosing method.Dexamethasone and ID EC-Asnase were each associated with superior EFS.Monitoring NSAA during treatment with EC-Asnase may be an effective strategy to improve outcome in pediatric ALL.",1,1,1,1
26324738,"Clinical and Translational Results of a Phase II, Randomized Trial of an Anti-IGF-1R (Cixutumumab) in Women with Breast Cancer That Progressed on Endocrine Therapy.PURPOSE: This phase II trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of cixutumumab, a human anti-insulin-like growth factor receptor 1 (IGF-1R) monoclonal IgG1 antibody, and explored potential biomarkers in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer that progressed on antiestrogen therapy received (2:1 randomization) cixutumumab 10 mg/kg and the same antiestrogen (arm A) or cixutumumab alone (arm B) every 2 weeks (q2w).Primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS); secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS) and safety.Correlative analyses of IGF-1R, total insulin receptor (IR), and IR isoforms A (IR-A) and B (IR-B) expression in tumor tissue were explored.RESULTS: Ninety-three patients were randomized (arm A, n = 62; arm B, n = 31).Median PFS was 2.0 and 3.1 months for arm A and arm B, respectively.Secondary efficacy measures were similar between the arms.Overall, cixutumumab was well tolerated.IGF-1R expression was not associated with clinical outcomes.Regardless of the treatment, lower IR-A, IR-B, and total IR mRNA expression in tumor tissue was significantly associated with longer PFS [IR-A: HR, 2.62 (P = 0.0062); IR-B: HR, 2.21 (P = 0.0202); and total IR: HR, 2.18 (P = 0.0230)] and OS [IR-A: HR, 2.94 (P = 0.0156); IR-B: HR, 2.69 (P = 0.0245); and total IR: HR, 2.72 (P = 0.0231)].CONCLUSIONS: Cixutumumab (10 mg/kg) with or without antiestrogen q2w had an acceptable safety profile, but no significant clinical efficacy.Patients with low total IR, IR-A, and IR-B mRNA expression levels had significantly longer PFS and OS, independent of the treatment.The prognostic or predictive value of IR as a biomarker for IGF-1R-targeted therapies requires further validation.",1,1,1,1
29234923,"Non-inferiority multicenter prospective randomized controlled study of rectal cancer T2-T3s (superficial) N0, M0 undergoing neoadjuvant treatment and local excision (TEM) vs total mesorectal excision (TME).PURPOSE: The standard treatment of rectal adenocarcinoma is total mesorectal excision (TME), in many cases requires a temporary or permanent stoma.TME is associated with high morbidity and genitourinary alterations.Transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) allows access to tumors up to 20 cm from the anal verge, achieves minimal postoperative morbidity and mortality rates, and does not require an ostomy.The treatment of T2, N0, and M0 cancers remains controversial.Preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in association with TEM reduces local recurrence and increases survival.The TAU-TEM study aims to demonstrate the non-inferiority of the oncological outcomes and the improvement in morbidity and quality of life achieved with TEM compared with TME.METHODS: Prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled non-inferiority trial includes patients with rectal adenocarcinoma less than 10 cm from the anal verge and up to 4 cm in size, staged as T2 or T3-superficial N0-M0.Patients will be randomized to two areas: CRT plus TEM or radical surgery (TME).Postoperative morbidity and mortality will be recorded and patients will complete the quality of life questionnaires before the start of treatment, after CRT in the CRT/TEM arm, and 6 months after surgery in both arms.The estimated sample size for the study is 173 patients.Patients will attend follow-up controls for local and systemic relapse.CONCLUSIONS: This study aims to demonstrate the preservation of the rectum after preoperative CRT and TEM in rectal cancer stages T2-3s, N0, M0 and to determine the ability of this strategy to avoid the need for radical surgery (TME).TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01308190.Numero de registro del Comite de Etica e Investigacion Clinica (CEIC) del Hospital universitario Parc Tauli: TAU-TEM-2009-01.",0,0,0,0

25018037,"Impact of baseline corticosteroids on survival and steroid androgens in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: exploratory analysis from COU-AA-301.BACKGROUND: Corticosteroids have been used to mitigate mineralocorticoid-related effects and restore sensitivity to abiraterone acetate.Corticosteroids may also mediate glucocorticoid receptor or mutated androgen receptor activation and adversely influence outcome.OBJECTIVE: This post hoc exploratory analysis investigated whether baseline corticosteroids were an independent prognostic factor and its level of contribution in the presence of other prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) in study COU-AA-301.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: COU-AA-301 was a randomised study of abiraterone plus prednisone versus prednisone in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients after docetaxel.INTERVENTION: Patients were randomised 2:1 to abiraterone 1000 mg plus prednisone 5mg by mouth twice daily versus prednisone.OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Association of OS with baseline corticosteroids was determined by univariate and multivariate Cox models.RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: At study entry, 33% of patients received corticosteroids, had worse disease characteristics (p<0.05 except liver metastases), and were more likely to have testosterone levels below the median (odds ratio:2.92; chi-square p<0.0001).Associations between prostate-specific antigen response as well as circulating tumour cell decline and higher baseline androgen levels were demonstrated.Patients taking baseline corticosteroids had inferior OS in univariate analysis (hazard ratio: 1.48; p<0.0001); however, in multivariate stepwise selection modelling, baseline corticosteroids did not add substantially to the model.This analysis is limited as a retrospective analysis and restricted to patients after docetaxel.CONCLUSIONS: In the COU-AA-301 study, baseline corticosteroids were associated with adverse prognostic features, inferior OS, and lower baseline androgen levels but did not add substantial information to the final prognostic model.Thus in these data from study COU-AA-301, concurrent baseline corticosteroids did not have an independent impact on OS.PATIENT SUMMARY: Baseline corticosteroids did not adversely affect abiraterone clinical benefit in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.Their use was associated with patients having worse disease characteristics.",1,1,1,1
23085153,"MAPPED study design: a 6 month randomised controlled study to evaluate the effect of dutasteride on prostate cancer volume using magnetic resonance imaging.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the percentage change in volume of prostate cancer, as assessed by T2-weighted MRI, following exposure to dutasteride (Avodart) 0.5mg daily for six months.PATIENTS AND METHODS: MRI in Primary Prostate cancer after Exposure to Dutasteride (MAPPED) is a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, supported by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK).Men with prostate cancer suitable for active surveillance (low-intermediate risk prostate cancer on biopsy), and a visible lesion on T2-weighted MRI of at least 0.2 cc, were eligible for consideration.Forty-two men were randomised to 6 months of daily dutasteride 0.5mg or placebo.Multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI) scans were performed at baseline, 3 and 6 months.The percentage changes in cancer volume over time will be compared between the dutasteride and placebo groups.Planned analyses will examine the association between tumour volume and characteristics (perfusion and contrast washout) as seen on mpMRI, HistoScan ultrasound and biopsy histopathology in both groups.DISCUSSION: MAPPED is the first randomised controlled trial to use mpMRI to look at the effect of dutasteride on the volume of prostate cancer.If dutasteride is shown to reduce the volume of prostate cancer, it might be considered as an adjunct for men on active surveillance.Analysis of the placebo arm will allow us to comment on the short-term natural variability of the MR appearance in men who are not receiving any treatment.CONCLUSION: MAPPED will evaluate the short-term effect of dutasteride on prostate cancer volume, as assessed by mpMRI, in men undergoing active surveillance for low or intermediate risk prostate cancer.The study completed recruitment in January 2012.",0,0,0,0
28743247,"A randomized phase II study of paclitaxel alone versus paclitaxel plus sorafenib in second- and third-line treatment of patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer (PASO).BACKGROUND: We conducted an open-label, randomized, two-arm multi-center study to assess the efficacy and safety of paclitaxel versus paclitaxel + sorafenib in patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer.METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive either paclitaxel monotherapy (80 mg/m(2)) weekly (3 weeks on, 1 week off) plus sorafenib 400 mg orally, twice a day taken continuously throughout 28 day cycles.Sorafenib dose was gradually escalated from a starting dose of 200 mg twice a day.The primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS).RESULTS: A pre-planned efficacy interim analysis was performed on the data of 60 patients, 30 patients in each treatment arm.Median PFS was estimated at 6.6 months (95% CI: 5.1 to 9.0) in patients randomized to single-agent paclitaxel (Arm A) and 5.6 months (95% CI: 3.8 to 6.5) in patients randomized to paclitaxel-sorafenib combination (Arm B) therapy.Contrary to the hypothesis, the treatment effect was statistically significant in favor of paclitaxel monotherapy (hazard ratio 1.80, 95% CI: 1.02 to 3.20; log-rank test P = 0.0409).It was decided to stop the trial early for futility.Median OS was also in favor of Arm A (20.7 months (95% CI: 16.4 to 26.7) versus 12.1 months (95% CI: 5.8 to 20.4) in Arm B. Clinical control was achieved in 28 patients (93.3%) in Arm A and in 21 patients 70.0% in Arm B. Overall response rate was met in 43.3% of patients in Arm A and in 40.0% in Arm B. Toxicities were increased in Arm B with higher rates of diarrhea, nausea, neutropenia, hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) and anorexia, Grad 3 and 4 toxicities were rare.CONCLUSIONS: In this pre-planned interim analysis, paclitaxel-sorafenib combination therapy was not found to be superior to paclitaxel monotherapy with regard to the primary end point, progression-free survival.The trial was therefore discontinued early.There was no indication of more favorable outcomes for combination therapy in secondary efficacy end points.As expected, the safety and toxicity profile of the combination therapy was less favorable compared to monotherapy.Overall, this trial did not demonstrate that adding sorafenib to second- or third-line paclitaxel provides any clinical benefit to patients with HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer.Cautious dosing using a sorafenib ramp up schedule might have contributed to negative results.TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered at EudraCT (No 2009-018025-73) and retrospectively registered at Clinical trials.gov on March 17, 2011 ( NCT01320111 ).",1,1,1,1

29733908,"The Impact of Staging by Positron-Emission Tomography on Overall Survival and Progression-Free Survival in Patients With Locally Advanced NSCLC.INTRODUCTION: We investigated the potential impact of stage migration because of positron-emission tomography (PET) scan staging on survival in the locally advanced (stage IIIA/B) NSCLC setting.METHODS: In PROCLAIM, 598 patients with stage IIIA/B nonsquamous NSCLC (intent-to-treat population) were randomized to either pemetrexed plus cisplatin and concurrent thoracic radiotherapy for 3 cycles followed by 4 cycles of pemetrexed consolidation or etoposide plus cisplatin and concurrent thoracic radiotherapy for 2 cycles followed by a consolidation platinum-based doublet regimen for up to 2 cycles.Baseline PET scan (PET Yes versus No) was one of the stratification factors.Subgroup analyses (PET Yes versus No) of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were conducted on the intent-to-treat population regardless of treatment, as the study did not show superior efficacy for either arm.RESULTS: Majority (491 of 598; 82.1%) of patients had a baseline PET scan staging performed.A longer median OS (PET Yes versus No: 27.2 versus 20.8; hazard ratio = 0.81, p = 0.130) and an improved median PFS (PET Yes versus No: 11.3 versus 9.2; hazard ratio = 0.73, p = 0.012) were observed for patients with PET scans compared to those with conventional staging in both treatment arms.CONCLUSIONS: Both a significantly improved PFS and a numerically longer OS in the PET Yes subgroup, compared to patients with conventional staging, are consistent with improved survival due to stage migration.The magnitude of differences in OS and PFS based on PET scan is a reminder of the potential for factors other than the therapeutic intervention to affect outcomes.",1,1,1,1
22978687,"In thyroidectomized patients with thyroid cancer, a serum thyrotropin of 30 muU/mL after thyroxine withdrawal is not always adequate for detecting an elevated stimulated serum thyroglobulin.BACKGROUND: The thyrotropin (TSH) level or duration of thyroid hormone withdrawal (THW) required to detect stimulated thyroglobulin (Tg) in differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) monitoring is unknown.The objective of this study was to evaluate the TSH cutoff of >30 muU/mL as a means to detect stimulated Tg >/=2 ng/mL after THW (THW-Tg>/=2), and sensitivity of the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) questionnaire for detecting hypothyroid symptoms.METHODS: This was a prospective longitudinal cohort study done at a tertiary academic medical center.Forty-seven patients with DTC undergoing their first Tg stimulation or after previously abnormal Tg stimulation had weekly measurements of TSH and Tg during the 4 weeks THW, and repeated questionnaire assessments.RESULTS: TSH did not reach a plateau in any patient, and in those whose Tg did not remain undetectable, Tg continued to rise.Seventy-five percent of patients had an undetectable Tg <0.2 ng/mL at baseline (95% were <0.5 mg/mL) with 16% remaining undetectable throughout THW.The majority of patients (72.7% and 97.8%) achieved TSH >30 muU/mL by 3 and 4 weeks THW, respectively.Of the 15 patients with maximum stimulated THW-Tg>/=2, 38% were detected before the minimal TSH >30 muU/mL cutoff.At 2 weeks THW, 3 had a TSH>30 muU/mL, and none of them had Tg >/=2 ng/mL. At 3 weeks THW, 11 had a TSH >30 muU/mL, and 64% of them had Tg >/=2 ng/mL. Only 60% were detected at 3-week THW regardless of their TSH level.Eighty-six percent were detected by TSH 60-<80 muU/mL. Conversely, all patients whose serum Tg was <0.2 ng/mL when their serum TSH was >20 muU/mL did not achieve a THW-Tg>/=2.CONCLUSION: The minimal TSH cutoff of >30 muU/mL was inadequate to detect many patients with final stimulated THW-Tg>/=2 during complete THW.TSH >80-100 muU/mL was a better cutoff, achieved in only 53% after 4-week THW.Conversely, we propose a preliminary THW-stopping rule for ending THW early in selected patients.In patients with a Tg <0.2 ng/mL when TSH >20 muU/mL, all had a final stimulated Tg </=2 ng/mL, potentially saving qualifying patients 40% of THW duration compared to 4-week THW.FACIT-F correlated with TSH, but was not sensitive to detect mild hypothyroidism.",0,0,0,0

28216065,"Preliminary evaluation of a telephone-based smoking cessation intervention in the lung cancer screening setting: A randomized clinical trial.Incorporating effective smoking cessation interventions into lung cancer screening (LCS) programs will be essential to realizing the full benefit of screening.We conducted a pilot randomized trial to determine the feasibility and efficacy of a telephone-counseling (TC) smoking cessation intervention vs. usual care (UC) in the LCS setting.In collaboration with 3 geographically diverse LCS programs, we enrolled current smokers (61.5% participation rate) who were: registered to undergo LCS, 50-77 years old, and had a 20+ pack-year smoking history.Eligibility was not based on readiness to quit.Participants completed pre-LCS (T0) and post-LCS (T1) telephone assessments, were randomized to TC (N=46) vs. UC (N=46), and completed a final 3-month telephone assessment (T2).Both study arms received a list of evidence-based cessation resources.TC participants also received up to 6 brief counseling calls with a trained cessation counselor.Counseling calls incorporated motivational interviewing and utilized the screening result as a motivator for quitting.The outcome was biochemically verified 7-day point prevalence cessation at 3-months post-randomization.Participants (56.5% female) were 60.2 (SD=5.4) years old and reported 47.1 (SD=22.2) pack years; 30% were ready to stop smoking in the next 30 days.TC participants completed an average of 4.4 (SD=2.3) sessions.Using intent-to-treat analyses, biochemically verified quit rates were 17.4% (TC) vs. 4.3% (UC), p<.05.This study provides preliminary evidence that telephone-based cessation counseling is feasible and efficacious in the LCS setting.As millions of current smokers are now eligible for lung cancer screening, this setting represents an important opportunity to exert a large public health impact on cessation among smokers who are at very high risk for multiple tobacco-related diseases.If this evidence-based, brief, and scalable intervention is replicated, TC could help to improve the overall cost-effectiveness of LCS.TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT02267096, https://clinicaltrials.gov.",0,0,0,0
28209746,"A Phase II Randomized Trial (GO27827) of First-Line FOLFOX Plus Bevacizumab with or Without the MET Inhibitor Onartuzumab in Patients with Metastatic Colorectal Cancer.BACKGROUND: Dysregulated hepatocyte growth factor/mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) signaling is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to vascular endothelial growth factor inhibition in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).We report outcomes from a double-blind, multicenter phase II trial of the MET inhibitor onartuzumab in combination with mFOLFOX-6 and bevacizumab for mCRC (GO27827; NCT01418222).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive onartuzumab (10 mg/kg intravenously [IV]) or placebo plus mFOLFOX-6 and bevacizumab (5 mg/kg IV).Oxaliplatin was given for 8-12 cycles; other agents were continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or death.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) in the intent-to-treat (ITT) and MET immunohistochemistry (IHC) expression-positive populations.RESULTS: Between September 2011 and November 2012, 194 patients were enrolled.In September 2013, an interim analysis recommended stopping onartuzumab treatment due to lack of efficacy.At the time of the final analysis in February 2014, no significant improvement in PFS was seen with onartuzumab versus placebo in either the ITT or MET IHC-positive populations.An improvement in PFS was noted in the MET IHC-negative population.Neither overall survival nor response rate was improved with onartuzumab.The incidence of fatigue, peripheral edema, and deep vein thrombosis was increased with onartuzumab relative to placebo.CONCLUSION: Onartuzumab combined with mFOLFOX-6 and bevacizumab did not significantly improve efficacy outcomes in either the ITT or MET IHC-positive populations.MET expression by IHC was not a predictive biomarker in this setting.The Oncologist 2017;22:264-271 IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The addition of onartuzumab to mFOLFOX-6 plus bevacizumab did not improve outcomes in patients with previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer in this randomized, phase II study.Although initial results with onartuzumab were promising, a number of phase II/III clinical trials have reported a lack of improvement in efficacy with onartuzumab combined with standard-of-care therapies in several tumor types.Furthermore, negative study data have been published for rilotumumab and ficlatuzumab, both of which block hepatocyte growth factor binding to the mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) receptor.MET immunohistochemistry was not a predictive biomarker.It remains to be seen if other biomarkers or small molecule inhibitors may be more appropriate for inhibiting this oncogenic pathway.",1,1,1,1

23850170,"Which patients benefit most from primary surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy in stage IIIC or IV ovarian cancer? An exploratory analysis of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer 55971 randomised trial.BACKGROUND: To investigate whether biomarkers consisting of baseline characteristics of advanced stage ovarian cancer patients can help in identifying subgroups of patients who would benefit more from primary surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy.METHODS: We used data of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 55971 trial in which 670 patients were randomly assigned to primary surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy.The primary outcome was overall survival.Ten baseline clinical and pathological characteristics were selected as potential biomarkers.Using Subpopulation Treatment Effect Pattern Plots (STEPP), biomarkers with a statistically significant qualitative additive interaction with treatment were considered as potentially informative for treatment selection.We also combined selected biomarkers to form a multimarker treatment selection rule.FINDINGS: The size of the largest metastatic tumour and clinical stage were significantly associated with the magnitude of the benefit from treatment, in terms of five-year survival (p for interaction: 0.008 and 0.016, respectively).Stage IIIC patients with metastatic tumours 45 mm benefited more from primary surgery while stage IV patients with metastatic tumours >45 mm benefited more from neoadjuvant chemotherapy.In stage IIIC patients with larger metastatic tumours and in stage IV patients with less extensive metastatic tumours both treatments were equally effective.We estimated that by selecting treatments for patients based on largest metastatic tumour and clinical stage, the potential five-year survival rate in the population of treated patients would be 27.3% (95% confidence interval (CI) 21.9-33.0), 7.8% higher than if all were treated with primary surgery, and 5.6% higher if all were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.INTERPRETATION: Although survival was comparable after primary surgery and neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the overall group of patients with ovarian cancer in the EORTC 55971 trial, we found in this exploratory analysis that patients with stage IIIC and less extensive metastatic tumours had higher survival with primary surgery, while patients with stage IV disease and large metastatic tumours had higher survival with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.For patients who did not meet these criteria, both treatment options led to comparable survival rates.",1,1,1,1
22510874,"Osteopontin is a prognostic factor for survival of acute myeloid leukemia patients.Osteopontin (OPN) is a glycoprotein that is secreted by osteoblasts and hematopoietic cells.OPN suppresses the proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells in vitro and may regulate the hematopoietic stem cell pool.Increased serum OPN concentrations occur in chronic myeloid leukemia, multiple myeloma, and acute myeloid leukemia (AML).In the present study, we analyzed the prognostic impact of OPN in AML by investigating the expression and relevance of OPN in newly diagnosed AML patients from 2 large study groups (the German AML Cooperative Group and the Dutch-Belgian Hematology Oncology Cooperative group).IHC (n = 84), ELISAs of blood/BM sera (n = 41), and microarray data for mRNA levels (n = 261) were performed.Expression of OPN protein was increased in AML patients both in BM blasts (IHC) and in BM serum (ELISA) compared with healthy controls.Patients expressing high levels of OPN within the BM (IHC) experienced shortened overall survival (OS; P = .025).Multivariate analysis identified karyotype, blast clearance (day 16), and the level of OPN expression as independent prognostic factors for OS.This prompted us to analyze microarray data from 261 patients from a third cohort.The analysis confirmed OPN as a prognostic marker.In summary, high OPN mRNA expression indicated decreased event-free survival (P = .0002) and OS (P = .001).The prognostic role of OPN was most prominent in intermediate-risk AML.These data provide evidence that OPN expression is an independent prognostic factor in AML.",0,0,0,0

Investigator-assessed median progression-free survival was 9.2 months (95% CI, 7.4 to 15.6) and 12.9 months (95% CI, 11.1 to not reached) in arms A and B, respectively.Independent review committee-assessed intracranial ORR in patients with measurable brain metastases at baseline was 42% (11 of 26 patients) in arm A and 67% (12 of 18 patients) in arm B. Common treatment-emergent adverse events were nausea (arm A/B, 33%/40%), diarrhea (arm A/B, 19%/38%), headache (arm A/B, 28%/27%), and cough (arm A/B, 18%/34%), and were mainly grades 1 to 2.A subset of pulmonary adverse events with early onset (median onset: day 2) occurred in 14 of 219 treated patients (all grades, 6%; grade >/= 3, 3%); none occurred after escalation to 180 mg in arm B. Seven of 14 patients were successfully retreated with brigatinib.Conclusion Brigatinib yielded substantial whole-body and intracranial responses as well as robust progression-free survival; 180 mg (with lead-in) showed consistently better efficacy than 90 mg, with acceptable safety.",1,1,1,1
24646327,"Standardization of D2 lymphadenectomy and surgical quality control (KLASS-02-QC): a prospective, observational, multicenter study [NCT01283893].BACKGROUND: Extended systemic lymphadenectomy (D2) is standard procedure for surgical treatment of advanced gastric cancer (AGC) although less extensive lymphadenectomy (D1) can be applied to early gastric cancer.Complete D2 lymphadenectomy is the mandatory procedure for studies that evaluate surgical treatment results of AGC.However, the actual extent of D2 lymphadenectomy varies among surgeons because of a lacking consensus on the anatomical definition of each lymph node station.This study is aimed to develop a consensus for D2 lymphadenectomy and also to qualify surgeons that can perform both laparoscopic and open D2 gastrectomy.METHODS/DESIGN: This (KLASS-02-QC) is a prospective, observational, multicenter study to qualify the surgeons that will participate in the KLASS-02-RCT, which is a prospective, randomized, clinical trial comparing laparoscopic and open gastrectomy for AGC.Surgeons and reviewers participating in the study will be required to complete a questionnaire detailing their professional experience and specific gastrectomy surgical background/training, and the gastrectomy metrics of their primary hospitals.All surgeons must submit three laparoscopic and three open D2 gastrectomy videos, respectively.Each video will be allocated to five peer reviewers; thus each surgeon's operations will be assessed by a total of 30 reviews.Based on blinded assessment of unedited videos by experts' review, a separate review evaluation committee will decide whether or not the evaluated surgeon will participate in the KLASS-02-RCT.The primary outcome measure is each surgeon's proficiency, as assessed by the reviewers based on evaluation criteria for completeness of D2 lymphadenectomy.DISCUSSION: We believe that our study for standardization of D2 lymphadenectomy and surgical quality control (KLASS-02-QC) will guarantee successful implementation of the subsequent KLASS-02-RCT study.After making consensus on D2 lymphadenectomy, we developed evaluation criteria for completeness of D2 lymphadenectomy.We also developed a unique surgical standardization and quality control system that consists of recording unedited surgical videos, and expert review according to evaluation criteria for completeness of D2 lymphadenectomy.We hope our systematic approach will set a milestone in surgical standardization that is essential for surgical clinical trials.Additionally, our methods will serve as a novel system for educating surgeons and assessing surgical proficiency.TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT01283893.",0,0,0,0
32065769,"Effects of Exercise Therapy Dosing Schedule on Impaired Cardiorespiratory Fitness in Patients With Primary Breast Cancer: A Randomized Controlled Trial.BACKGROUND: Current exercise guidelines for clinical populations recommend an exercise therapy (ET) prescription of fixed intensity (moderate), duration (40-50 minutes per session), and volume (120-160 min/wk).A critical overarching element of exercise programming that has received minimal attention is dose scheduling.We investigated the tolerability and efficacy of 2 exercise training dose regimens on cardiorespiratory fitness and patient-reported outcomes in patients with posttreatment primary breast cancer.METHODS: Using a parallel-group randomized trial, we randomly allocated 174 postmenopausal patients (2.8 years after adjuvant therapy) with impaired peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) to 1 of 2 supervised exercise training interventions delivered with a standard linear (LET) (fixed dose intensity per session for 160 min/wk) or nonlinear (NLET) (variable dose intensity per session for approximately 120 min/wk) schedule compared with a stretching attention control group for 16 consecutive weeks.Stretching was matched to exercise dosing arms on the basis of location, frequency, duration, and treatment length.The primary end point was change in VO2peak (mL O2.kg(-1).min(-1)) from baseline to after intervention.Secondary end points were patient-reported outcomes, tolerability, and safety.RESULTS: No serious adverse events were observed.Mean attendance was 64%, 75%, and 80% for attention control, LET, and NLET, respectively.In intention-to-treat analysis, VO2peak increased 0.6+/-1.7 mL O2.kg(-1).min(-1) (P=0.05) and 0.8+/-1.8 mL O2.kg(-1).min(-1) (P=0.07) in LET and NLET, respectively, compared with attention control.Change in VO2peak ranged from -2.7 to 4.1 mL O2.kg(-1).min(-1) and from -3.6 to 5.1 mL O2.kg(-1).min(-1) in LET and NLET, respectively.Approximately 40% of patients in both exercise dosing regimens were classified as VO2peak responders (ie, Delta >/=1.32 mL O2.kg(-1).min(-1)).NLET improved all patient-reported outcomes compared with attention control.CONCLUSIONS: Short-term exercise training, independently of dosing schedule, is associated with modest improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness in patients previously treated for early-stage breast cancer.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov.Unique identifier: NCT01186367.",1,1,0,0
30318515,"Galunisertib plus gemcitabine vs. gemcitabine for first-line treatment of patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer.BACKGROUND: Galunisertib is the first-in-class, first-in-human, oral small-molecule type I transforming growth factor-beta receptor (ALK5) serine/threonine kinase inhibitor to enter clinical development.The effect of galunisertib vs. placebo in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer was determined.METHODS: This was a two-part, multinational study: phase 1b was a non-randomised, open-label, multicentre, and dose-escalation study; phase 2 was a randomised, placebo- and Bayesian-augmented controlled, double-blind study in patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma considered candidates for first-line chemotherapy with gemcitabine.Patients were randomised 2:1 to galunisertib-gemcitabine (N = 104) or placebo-gemcitabine (N = 52).Gemcitabine dose was 1000 mg/m(2) QW.Primary endpoints for phases 1b and 2, respectively, were phase 2 dose and overall survival.Secondary objectives included tolerability and biomarkers.RESULTS: Dose-escalation suggested a 300-mg/day dose.Primary objective was met: median survival times were 8.9 and 7.1 months for galunisertib and placebo, respectively (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.79 [95% credible interval: 0.59-1.09] and posterior probability HR < 1 = 0.93).Lower baseline biomarkers macrophage inflammatory protein-1-alpha and interferon-gamma-induced protein 10 were associated with galunisertib benefit.CONCLUSIONS: Galunisertib-gemcitabine combination improved overall survival vs. gemcitabine in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer, with minimal added toxicity.Future exploration of galunisertib in pancreatic cancer is ongoing in combination with durvalumab.",1,1,1,1
26540314,"Panitumumab in combination with gemcitabine and oxaliplatin does not prolong survival in wild-type KRAS advanced biliary tract cancer: A randomized phase 2 trial (Vecti-BIL study).BACKGROUND: Biliary tract cancer (BTC) is a rare and lethal disease with few therapeutic options.Preclinical data suggest that the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway could be involved in its progression.METHODS: This open-label, randomized phase 2 trial recruited chemotherapy-naive patients with advanced BTC displaying a wild-type (WT) KRAS status.Patients were randomized to gemcitabine (1000 mg/m(2) ) and oxaliplatin (100 mg/m(2) ) with (arm A) or without (arm B) panitumumab (6 mg/kg) for up to 12 cycles.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) analyzed in an intention-to-treat fashion.RESULTS: Eighty-nine patients (45 in arm A and 44 in arm B) were enrolled between June 2010 and September 2013.After a median follow-up of 10.1 months, the median PFS was 5.3 months (95% confidence interval, 3.3-7.2 months) in arm A and 4.4 months (95% confidence interval, 2.6-6.2 months) in arm B (P = .27).No survival differences were observed: the median overall survival was 9.9 months in arm A and 10.2 months in arm B (P = .42).In a subgroup analysis, no differences in PFS according to the site of the primary tumor were observed; patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma treated with panitumumab may have had a survival benefit in comparison with the control group (15.1 vs 11.8 months, P = .13).As for safety, skin toxicity was the main adverse event in arm A (80% of the patients).A higher incidence of diarrhea (55.5% vs 31.8%), mucositis (22.2% vs 13.6%), and constipation (24.4% vs 15.9%) was seen in arm A.

29564720,"Evaluation of the effect of the accordion suturing technique on wound lengths in breast cancer surgery: a randomised clinical trial.BACKGROUND: Cosmetic outcomes and scar lengths remain important considerations in breast cancer surgery.Suturing techniques should decrease scar tissue formation and provide good cosmetic results.The use of an accordion suturing technique may result in decreased surgical wound lengths and better cosmetic outcomes.We compared the outcomes of the accordion suturing technique with the standard suturing technique in breast cancer surgeries.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Female patients undergoing wide local excision of breast cancers were randomised to undergo closure of their surgical wound by either the accordion or the non-accordion (standard) suturing techniques between the months of May and October 2015.Pre-closure and post-closure wound lengths were measured intra-operatively.The primary outcome was a reduction of the surgical wound length at 6 weeks.The secondary outcome was a composite of the absence of hypertrophic scar tissue formation and optimal cosmesis.RESULTS: Thirty eligible women for wide local excision of breast tumours were randomly assigned to the accordion and non-accordion groups (15 accordion and 15 non-accordion).Seven women were excluded from the study because they underwent re-excision of margins for their breast tumours before the end of 6 weeks, and one woman was lost to follow-up.We therefore compared the outcomes of 12 women who underwent closure of their surgical wound by way of the accordion suturing technique to the outcomes of 10 women who underwent closure with the non-accordion (standard) suturing technique.The percentage reduction of wound length at 6 weeks was significantly greater in the accordion group than in the non-accordion group (M = 24.4, SD = 10.2 vs. M = 8.6, SD = 11.5, p = 0.0026).There was no significant difference in the cosmetic outcome between both groups using the James Quinn's wound evaluation score.CONCLUSION: The accordion suturing technique was associated with a significant reduction in surgical wound lengths in breast conserving surgery at 6 weeks without compromising the cosmetic result.",0,0,0,0
25683204,"Prostate cancer screening using risk stratification based on a multi-state model of genetic variants.BACKGROUND: Risk-stratified screening for prostate cancer (PCa) with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing incorporating genetic variants has received some attention but has been scarcely investigated.We developed a model to stratify the Finnish population by different risk profiles related to genetic variants to optimize the screening policy.METHODS: Data from the Finnish randomized controlled trial on screening for PCa with PSA testing were used to estimate a six-state Markov model of disease progression.Blood samples from Finnish men were used to assess the risk of PCa related to three genetic variants (rs4242382, rs138213197, and rs200331695).A risk score-based approach combined with a series of computer simulation models was applied to optimize individual screening policies.RESULTS: The 10-year risk of having progressive prostate cancer detected ranged from 43% in the top 5% risk group to approximately 11% in the bottom half of the population.Using the median group, with screening every four years beginning at 55 years-old, as the reference group, the recommended age beginning screening was approximately 47 years-old for the top 5% risk group and 55 years-old for those in the lower 60% risk group.The recommended interscreening interval has been shortened for individuals in the high risk group.The increased availability of genomic information allows the proposed multistate model to be more discriminating with respect to risk stratification and the suggested screening policy, particularly for the lowest risk groups-. -- CONCLUSIONS: A multi-state genetic variant-based model was developed for further application to population risk stratification to optimize the interscreening interval and the age at which to begin screening for PSA.A small sub-group of the population is likely to benefit from more intensive screening with early start and short interval, while half of the population is unlikely to benefit from such protocol (compared with four-year interval after age 55 years).",0,0,0,0
25018037,"Impact of baseline corticosteroids on survival and steroid androgens in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: exploratory analysis from COU-AA-301.BACKGROUND: Corticosteroids have been used to mitigate mineralocorticoid-related effects and restore sensitivity to abiraterone acetate.Corticosteroids may also mediate glucocorticoid receptor or mutated androgen receptor activation and adversely influence outcome.OBJECTIVE: This post hoc exploratory analysis investigated whether baseline corticosteroids were an independent prognostic factor and its level of contribution in the presence of other prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) in study COU-AA-301.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: COU-AA-301 was a randomised study of abiraterone plus prednisone versus prednisone in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients after docetaxel.INTERVENTION: Patients were randomised 2:1 to abiraterone 1000 mg plus prednisone 5mg by mouth twice daily versus prednisone.OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Association of OS with baseline corticosteroids was determined by univariate and multivariate Cox models.RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: At study entry, 33% of patients received corticosteroids, had worse disease characteristics (p<0.05 except liver metastases), and were more likely to have testosterone levels below the median (odds ratio:2.92; chi-square p<0.0001).Associations between prostate-specific antigen response as well as circulating tumour cell decline and higher baseline androgen levels were demonstrated.Patients taking baseline corticosteroids had inferior OS in univariate analysis (hazard ratio: 1.48; p<0.0001); however, in multivariate stepwise selection modelling, baseline corticosteroids did not add substantially to the model.This analysis is limited as a retrospective analysis and restricted to patients after docetaxel.CONCLUSIONS: In the COU-AA-301 study, baseline corticosteroids were associated with adverse prognostic features, inferior OS, and lower baseline androgen levels but did not add substantial information to the final prognostic model.Thus in these data from study COU-AA-301, concurrent baseline corticosteroids did not have an independent impact on OS.PATIENT SUMMARY: Baseline corticosteroids did not adversely affect abiraterone clinical benefit in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.Their use was associated with patients having worse disease characteristics.",1,1,1,1

26063890,"Effect of Primary Letrozole Treatment on Tumor Expression of mTOR and HIF-1alpha and Relation to Clinical Response.INTRODUCTION: Recently the combination of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor everolimus and the aromatase inhibitor exemestane has been shown to double the progression-free survival rate in advanced breast cancer.However, the effect of the interrelated pathways of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) and mTOR signaling, both of which are associated with a more aggressive breast cancer phenotype and endocrine resistance, on response in the neoadjuvant setting is unknown.We, therefore, have investigated the influence of these pathways with the aim of better defining those patients most likely to benefit from an endocrine-based therapy associated with/without mTOR inhibitors.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 107 women with T2-4 N0-1 and estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer were randomly assigned to 6 months of primary letrozole (2.5 mg/daily) (LET) or LET plus oral ""metronomic"" cyclophosphamide (50mg/daily) (LET-CYC).Phospo-mTOR and HIF-1alpha were evaluated in tumor specimens collected before and after treatment using a tissue microarray format.RESULTS: LET-based therapy induced a downregulation of phospho-mTOR and HIF-1alpha expression (P = .0001 and P < .004, respectively).The reduction of HIF-1alpha expression observed was positively correlated with phospho-mTOR reduction (P < .03); however, no treatment interaction between the two proteins was detected.HIF-1alpha expression was significantly modulated by the treatment (P < .004) with a reduction both in the LET arm (45%, n = 36/80) (P = .05) and LET-CYC arm (55%, n = 44/80) (P = .04).HIF-1alpha reduction showed a relationship with clinical response confined in LET arm only (P < .03).CONCLUSIONS: In this neoadjuvant population, LET was able to modulate the phospho-mTOR and HIF-1alpha pathways and may define a subpopulation of nonresponders who may be most likely to benefit from mTOR inhibitors.",0,0,0,0
32359057,"Examining the Impact of Alcohol Labels on Awareness and Knowledge of National Drinking Guidelines: A Real-World Study in Yukon, Canada.OBJECTIVE: Alcohol labels are one strategy for communicating health information to consumers.This study tested the extent to which consumers recalled alcohol labels with national drinking guidelines and examined the impact of labels on awareness and knowledge of the guidelines.METHOD: A quasi-experimental study was conducted in two jurisdictions in northern Canada examining the impact of labels on the following outcomes: unprompted and prompted recall of the drinking guideline label message, awareness of the drinking guidelines, and knowledge of the daily and weekly recommended drink limits.The intervention site applied labels with national drinking guidelines, a cancer warning, and standard drink information to alcohol containers in its liquor store, whereas the comparison site did not apply these labels.In total, 2,049 cohort participants in both sites were recruited to complete surveys before and at two time points after the intervention.Changes in outcomes were examined using generalized estimating equations.RESULTS: After the intervention, unprompted and prompted recall of the drinking guideline label message increased more in the intervention versus comparison site (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 10.8, 95% CI [0.9, 127.6]; AOR = 7.0, 95% CI [3.3, 14.9], respectively).Awareness of the drinking guidelines increased 2.9 times more in the intervention versus comparison site (AOR = 2.9, 95% CI [2.0, 4.3]).In addition, knowledge of the daily and weekly drink limits increased 1.5 and 1.4 times more in the intervention versus comparison site, respectively (daily: AOR = 1.5, 95% CI [1.0, 2.1]; weekly: AOR = 1.4, 95% CI [1.0, 2.0]).CONCLUSIONS: Enhanced alcohol labels get noticed and may be an effective population-level strategy for increasing awareness and knowledge of national drinking guidelines.",0,0,0,0
26324738,"Clinical and Translational Results of a Phase II, Randomized Trial of an Anti-IGF-1R (Cixutumumab) in Women with Breast Cancer That Progressed on Endocrine Therapy.PURPOSE: This phase II trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of cixutumumab, a human anti-insulin-like growth factor receptor 1 (IGF-1R) monoclonal IgG1 antibody, and explored potential biomarkers in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer that progressed on antiestrogen therapy received (2:1 randomization) cixutumumab 10 mg/kg and the same antiestrogen (arm A) or cixutumumab alone (arm B) every 2 weeks (q2w).Primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS); secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS) and safety.Correlative analyses of IGF-1R, total insulin receptor (IR), and IR isoforms A (IR-A) and B (IR-B) expression in tumor tissue were explored.RESULTS: Ninety-three patients were randomized (arm A, n = 62; arm B, n = 31).Median PFS was 2.0 and 3.1 months for arm A and arm B, respectively.Secondary efficacy measures were similar between the arms.Overall, cixutumumab was well tolerated.IGF-1R expression was not associated with clinical outcomes.Regardless of the treatment, lower IR-A, IR-B, and total IR mRNA expression in tumor tissue was significantly associated with longer PFS [IR-A: HR, 2.62 (P = 0.0062); IR-B: HR, 2.21 (P = 0.0202); and total IR: HR, 2.18 (P = 0.0230)] and OS [IR-A: HR, 2.94 (P = 0.0156); IR-B: HR, 2.69 (P = 0.0245); and total IR: HR, 2.72 (P = 0.0231)].CONCLUSIONS: Cixutumumab (10 mg/kg) with or without antiestrogen q2w had an acceptable safety profile, but no significant clinical efficacy.Patients with low total IR, IR-A, and IR-B mRNA expression levels had significantly longer PFS and OS, independent of the treatment.The prognostic or predictive value of IR as a biomarker for IGF-1R-targeted therapies requires further validation.",1,1,1,1
26803435,"Body mass index and age are additional prognostic factors in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors.PURPOSE: Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are the preferred treatment drugs for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC).The aim of this study was to analyze prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) in patients with mRCC treated with TKIs.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical data on 155 patients enrolled in 5 clinical trials conducted at our hospital from 2006 to 2014 were reviewed retrospectively.All patients received first-line TKI therapy (sunitinib, sorafenib, pazopanib, or famitinib).Survival rates were determined by the Kaplan-Meier method.RESULTS: Median OS (mOS) was 36.2 months.A total of 4 of the 5 adverse prognostic factors identified by the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) were found to be independent predictors of shorter survival, anemia, hypercalcemia, lactate dehydrogenase>1.5xupper limit of normal, and diagnosis to treatment time<1 year.In addition, we found that age</=45 years (P = 0.002), low or high body mass index ([BMI]<19 or>30kg/m(2)) (P = 0.003), and presence of>/=3 metastatic sites (P = 0.000) were also independent adverse prognostic factors.According to the MSKCC model, the mOS time in the favorable-risk, intermediate-risk, and poor-risk groups were 46.6, 30.4 and 16.7 months, respectively (P = 0.005).When we integrated age and BMI into the MSKCC model to set up a 7-factor prognostic model, we found the mOS time for these 3 groups was 71.1, 41.6 and 15.3 months, respectively (P = 0.000).CONCLUSION: Age and BMI are additional independent prognostic factors for patients with mRCC receiving vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-targeted TKI treatment, and the MSKCC prognostic model is also applicable to them.A 7-factor prognostic model might help to identify patients with the best prognosis.Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.",0,0,0,0

30303516,"NCI 8628: A randomized phase 2 study of ziv-aflibercept and high-dose interleukin 2 or high-dose interleukin 2 alone for inoperable stage III or IV melanoma.BACKGROUND: Interleukin 2 (IL-2) is a growth factor for T and natural killer cells, promotes proinflammatory cytokines, and can lead to durable responses in patients with melanoma.Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) promotes angiogenesis and modulates host innate and adaptive immunity.High VEGF levels were found to be associated with nonresponse to IL-2.Ziv-aflibercept may deplete VEGF and thereby enhance antitumor T-cell responses, thus supporting a combination immunotherapeutic strategy with IL-2.METHODS: NCI 8628 was a phase 2 trial of ziv-aflibercept and IL-2 (arm A) versus IL-2 alone (arm B) randomized at 2:1, respectively.Eligible patients had inoperable American Joint Committee on Cancer stage III or stage IV melanoma.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS).RESULTS: A total of 89 patients were enrolled and 84 patients were treated.The median follow-up was 41.4 months.Among treated patients (55 patients in arm A and 29 patients in arm B), PFS was significantly improved in favor of arm A, with a median of 6.9 months (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 4.1-8.7 months) versus 2.3 months (95% CI, 1.6-3.5 months) (P<.001).No significant difference was noted with regard to overall survival, with a median of 26.9 months (95% CI, 14.4-63.6 months) for arm A and 24.2 months (95% CI, 11.3-36.4 months) for arm B. The response rate (according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors [RECIST]) was 22% in arm A (4 complete responses [CRs] and 8 partial responses [PRs]) and 17% in arm B (1 CR and 4 PRs).Stable disease or PR or CR was noted in 65% of patients in arm A and 48% of patients in arm B. The combination was found to be superior to monotherapy in patients with high and low levels of serum VEGF and VEGF receptor 2.Adverse events were consistent with the expected profiles of monotherapy with IL-2 and ziv-aflibercept.CONCLUSIONS: Ziv-aflibercept and IL-2 were found to significantly improve PFS compared with IL-2 alone, thereby meeting the primary endpoint of the current study.These findings support further study of immunotherapeutic combination strategies involving VEGF inhibitors.",1,1,1,1
34904948,"Web-Based Return of Individual Patient-Reported Outcome Results Among Patients With Lymphoma: Randomized Controlled Trial.BACKGROUND: There has been a cultural shift toward patient engagement in health, with a growing demand from patients to access their results.OBJECTIVE: The Lymphoma Intervention (LIVE) trial is conducted to examine the impact of return of individual patient-reported outcome (PRO) results and a web-based self-management intervention on psychological distress, self-management, satisfaction with information, and health care use in a population-based setting.METHODS: Return of PRO results included comparison with age- and sex-matched peers and was built into the Patient-Reported Outcomes Following Initial Treatment and Long-Term Evaluation of Survivorship registry.The self-management intervention is an adaptation of a fully automated evidence-based intervention for breast cancer survivors.Patients with lymphoma who completed the web-based questionnaire were equally randomized to care as usual, return of PRO results, and return of PRO results plus self-management intervention.Patients completed questionnaires 9 to 18 months after diagnosis (T0; n=227), 4 months (T1; n=190), 12 months (T2; n=170), and 24 months (T3; n=98).RESULTS: Of all invited patients, 51.1% (456/892) responded and web-based participants (n=227) were randomly assigned to care as usual (n=76), return of PRO results (n=74), or return of PRO results and access to Living with lymphoma (n=77).Return of PRO results was viewed by 76.7% (115/150) of those with access.No statistically significant differences were observed for psychological distress, self-management, satisfaction with information provision, and health care use between patients who received PRO results and those who did not (P>.05).Use of the self-management intervention was low (2/76, 3%), and an effect could therefore not be determined.CONCLUSIONS: Return of individual PRO results seems to meet patients' wishes but had no beneficial effects on patient outcome.No negative effects were found when individual PRO results were disclosed, and the return of individual PRO results can therefore be safely implemented in daily clinical practice.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Netherlands Trial Register NTR5953; https://www.trialregister.nl/trial/5790.INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): RR2-10.1186/s13063-017-1943-2.",0,0,0,0
28753702,"Probe-based endomicroscopy for in vivo detection of gastric intestinal metaplasia and neoplasia: a multicenter randomized controlled trial.Background and study aims Owing to the indistinctive endoscopic appearance of gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM), gastric intraepithelial neoplasia (GIN), and early gastric cancer (EGC), a significant number of such lesions may be missed during surveillance endoscopy.The aim of this clinical trial was to assess the value of combined computed virtual chromoendoscopy (flexible spectral imaging color enhancement [FICE]) and probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE) for in vivo detection of GIM, GIN, and EGC.Patients and methods This was a multicenter, randomized controlled trial performed in 238 patients at four tertiary centers.Patients were randomized to FICE-guided pCLE with targeted biopsies (group A) or FICE with standard biopsies (group B).The diagnostic yield of GIM, GIN, or EGC was compared between the two groups.Results On a per-patient assessment, the diagnostic yield for GIM/GIN/EGC was 73.3 % (88/120) in group A and 63.6 % (75/118) in group B (P = 0.09).On a per-biopsy analysis, FICE-guided pCLE with targeted biopsies significantly increased the diagnostic yield of GIM/GIN/EGC vs. FICE with standard biopsies, from 31.5 % (252/800) to 75.1 % (313/417) (P < 0.001).In addition, pCLE-guided targeted biopsies led to a significant 48.5 % decrease in the number of biopsies per patient vs. FICE with standard biopsies (P < 0.001).Conclusions Real-time pCLE and targeted biopsies after FICE improved the diagnostic yield for the detection of GIM, GIN, and EGC, and only required about half the number of biopsies vs. FICE with standard biopsies.This may allow a better regimen for endoscopic surveillance and subsequent treatment of patients with premalignant and malignant gastric abnormalities.Trial registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02515721).",1,1,0,0

30902613,"Updated Efficacy and Safety Data and Impact of the EML4-ALK Fusion Variant on the Efficacy of Alectinib in Untreated ALK-Positive Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer in the Global Phase III ALEX Study.INTRODUCTION: At the prior data cutoff (February 9, 2017) the ALEX trial showed superior investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) for alectinib versus crizotinib in untreated, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive, advanced NSCLC (hazard ratio = 0.47, 95% confidence interval: 0.34-0.65, p < 0.001).The median PFS in the alectinib arm was not reached versus 11.1 months with crizotinib.Retrospective analyses suggest that the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 gene-ALK variant (EML4-ALK) may influence ALK-inhibitor treatment benefit.We present updated analyses, including exploratory subgroup analysis by EML4-ALK variant, after an additional 10 months' follow-up (cutoff December 1, 2017).METHODS: Patients were randomized to receive twice-daily alectinib, 600 mg, or crizotinib, 250 mg, until disease progression, toxicity, death, or withdrawal.PFS was determined by the investigators.Baseline plasma and tissue biomarker samples were analyzed by using hybrid-capture, next-generation sequencing to determine EML4-ALK variant.RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were balanced.Investigator-assessed PFS was prolonged with alectinib (stratified hazard ratio = 0.43, 95% confidence interval: 0.32-0.58).The median PFS times were 34.8 months with alectinib and 10.9 months with crizotinib.EML4-ALK fusions were detectable in 129 patient plasma samples and 124 tissue samples; variants 1, 2, and 3/ab did not affect PFS, objective response rate, or duration of response.Investigator-assessed PFS was longer for alectinib than for crizotinib across EML4-ALK variants 1, 2, and 3a/b in plasma and tissue.Despite longer treatment duration (27.0 months in the case of alectinib versus 10.8 months in the case of crizotinib), the safety of alectinib compared favorably with that of crizotinib.CONCLUSION: Alectinib continues to demonstrate superior investigator-assessed PFS versus crizotinib in untreated ALK-positive NSCLC, irrespective of EML4-ALK variant.",1,1,1,1
23559149,"FOLFOX4 plus cetuximab administered weekly or every second week in the first-line treatment of patients with KRAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer: a randomized phase II CECOG study.BACKGROUND: This randomized phase II study investigated first-line chemotherapy plus cetuximab administered every second week in KRAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients received FOLFOX4 plus either standard weekly cetuximab (arm 1) or cetuximab (500 mg/m(2)) every second week (arm 2), until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.Primary end point was the objective response rate (ORR).Progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), disease control rate (DCR) and safety were also investigated.The study was not powered to establish non-inferiority, but aimed at the estimation of treatment differences.RESULTS: Of 152 randomized eligible patients, 75 were treated in arm 1 and 77 in arm 2; ORRs [53% versus 62%, odds ratio 1.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74-2.66], PFS [median 9.5 versus 9.2 months, hazard ratio (HR) 0.92, 95% CI 0.63-1.34], OS (median 25.8 versus 23.0 months, HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.56-1.30) and DCR (87%) were comparable.HRs adjusted for baseline factors were 1.01 and 0.99 for PFS and OS, respectively.Frequencies of grade 3/4 adverse events in arms 1 versus 2 were similar: most common were neutropenia (28% versus 34%) and rash (15% versus 17%).CONCLUSIONS: Activity and safety of FOLFOX4 plus either cetuximab administered weekly or every second week were similar.",1,1,1,1

22306907,"Autologous cytokine-induced killer cell transfusion in combination with gemcitabine plus cisplatin regimen chemotherapy for metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma.In this study, we evaluate the efficacy of autologous cytokine-induced killer cells (CIK) transfusion used in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin (GC) chemotherapy to treat nasopharyngeal carcinoma in patients with distant metastasis after radiotherapy.From September 2007 to August 2008, 60 patients with distant metastasis after radiotherapy were followed up and were randomly divided into 2 groups.The 30 patients in the GC+CIK group were treated with adoptive autologous CIK cell transfusion in combination with GC chemotherapy; the 30 patients in the GC group were treated with chemotherapy alone.Short-term efficacy evaluation revealed that in the GC+CIK group, there were 3 cases of complete remission, 18 cases of partial remission, 2 cases of stabilization of disease, and 7 cases of progression of disease and the total effective rate was 70% (21/30).In the GC group, there were 0 cases of complete remission, 14 cases of partial remission, 3 case of stable disease, and 13 cases of progressive disease and the total effective rate was 46.7% (14/21).Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that the overall survival of the GC+CIK group was higher than that of the GC group, but the difference was not significant (P=0.1374, log-rank test).However, the progression-free survival of the GC+CIK group was significantly higher than that of the GC group (P=0.0234, log-rank test).Thus, our study indicated that CIK cell transfusion therapy used in combination with GC chemotherapy may be a more effective treatment for postradiotherapy distant metastasis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients.",1,1,1,1
22559906,"A nurse practitioner directed intervention improves the quality of life of patients with metastatic cancer: results of a randomized pilot study.BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of randomized studies evaluating the value of palliative interventions on a prospective basis in newly diagnosed oncology patients.We sought to prospectively evaluate quality of life (QoL) outcomes in advanced cancer patients who received discussion-based palliative care interventions from an advanced registered nurse practitioner (ARNP) integrated into the oncology team, and compare these outcomes with a control population.METHODS: Patients with metastatic cancer were randomized to standard care or an ARNP-directed intervention that included discussions of the benefits of hospice, discussions on living wills and advanced directives (Five Wishes document) along with an assessment of QoL. Relevant endpoints included change from baseline QoL and improvement in hospice knowledge.RESULTS: From November 13, 2008, through July 28, 2009, 26 patients were accrued at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida.The study closed early due to published data demonstrating the benefits of early palliative care interventions in the management of metastatic cancer patients.Statistically significant improvements from baseline were noted in emotional and mental QoL assessments in the intervention group that were not seen in the control group.Patients found it useful to have the living will and Five Wishes documents offered as part of the ARNP intervention.CONCLUSIONS: An ARNP-directed intervention that explains the benefits of hospice and addresses advanced directives early in the course of metastatic cancer patients' treatment, is well received by the patients and their relatives and leads to measurable improvement in the patient's emotional and mental QoL.",1,1,0,0
32636319,"Serum Alpha-fetoprotein Levels and Clinical Outcomes in the Phase III CELESTIAL Study of Cabozantinib versus Placebo in Patients with Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma.PURPOSE: The phase III CELESTIAL study demonstrated improved overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) with cabozantinib versus placebo in patients with previously treated, advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).We analyzed outcomes by baseline alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and on-treatment AFP changes.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Serum AFP was measured every 8 weeks by blinded, centralized testing.Outcomes were analyzed by baseline AFP bifurcated at 400 ng/mL and by on-treatment AFP response (>/=20% decrease from baseline at Week 8).The optimal cutoff for change in AFP at Week 8 was evaluated using maximally selected rank statistics.RESULTS: Median OS for cabozantinib versus placebo was 13.9 versus 10.3 months [HR, 0.81; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.62-1.04] for patients with baseline AFP <400 ng/mL, and 8.5 versus 5.2 months (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.54-0.94) for patients with baseline AFP >/=400 ng/mL. Week 8 AFP response rate was 50% for cabozantinib versus 13% for placebo.In the cabozantinib arm, median OS for patients with and without AFP response was 16.1 versus 9.1 months (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.45-0.84).AFP response was independently associated with longer OS.The optimal cutoff for association with OS in the cabozantinib arm was </=0% change in AFP at Week 8 [AFP control; HR 0.50 (95% CI, 0.35-0.71)].HRs for PFS were consistent with those for OS.CONCLUSIONS: Cabozantinib improved outcomes versus placebo across a range of baseline AFP levels.On-treatment AFP response and control rates were higher with cabozantinib than placebo, and were associated with longer OS and PFS with cabozantinib.",1,1,1,1

24081946,"Randomized multicenter phase II trial comparing two schedules of etirinotecan pegol (NKTR-102) in women with recurrent platinum-resistant/refractory epithelial ovarian cancer.PURPOSE: Etirinotecan pegol (NKTR-102) is a unique, long-acting topoisomerase-I inhibitor with prolonged systemic exposure to SN38 (7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin), the active metabolite of irinotecan.This randomized phase II trial investigated two dosing schedules of etirinotecan pegol in patients with platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian carcinoma.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 71 eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive etirinotecan pegol 145 mg/m(2) every 14 or 21 days until progression or unacceptable adverse events (AEs).The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR) by RECIST (version 1.0).Secondary end points included response by Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup criteria, duration of ORR, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).RESULTS: The overall confirmed ORR was 20% (95% CI, 10% to 30%): 20% for once every 14 days, and 19% for once every 21 days.Median response duration was 4.1 months for once every 14 days and 4.0 months for once every 21 days.Median PFS for every 14 and every 21 days was 4.1 and 5.3 months, respectively, and median OS was 10.0 and 11.7 months, respectively.Etirinotecan pegol was well tolerated, with the most common grade 3 to 4 AEs being dehydration (24%) and diarrhea (23%).Diarrhea, dehydration, nausea, and neutropenia were less frequent with the schedule of once every 21 days than with that of once every 14 days.CONCLUSION: Both schedules of etirinotecan pegol showed activity in patients with heavily pretreated ovarian cancer, with encouraging ORR and PFS rates.The schedule of once every 21 days was better tolerated and had slightly longer PFS and OS rates.The treatment schedule of etirinotecan pegol 145 mg/m(2) once every 21 days was selected for the expanded phase II study and is preferred for future phase III studies.These findings provide support to directly compare etirinotecan pegol versus one of the approved drugs (eg, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or topotecan) in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.",1,1,1,1
30482661,"Comparative Effectiveness of Bladder-preserving Tri-modality Therapy Versus Radical Cystectomy for Muscle-invasive Bladder Cancer.INTRODUCTION: There are limited randomized data comparing radical cystectomy (RC) with bladder-sparing tri-modality therapy (TMT) in the treatment of muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC).Both strategies are thought to have similar survival outcomes with different morbidity profiles.We compare the effectiveness of TMT and RC using decision-analytic modeling and the endpoint of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using a Markov model, we simulated the lifetime outcomes after TMT versus RC +/- neoadjuvant chemotherapy for 67-year-old patients with clinical stage T2-T4aN0M0 MIBC.Model probabilities and utilities were extracted from the literature.The incremental effectiveness was reported in QALYs and sensitivity analyses were performed.RESULTS: For all patients with MIBC, although the model showed identical survival, TMT was the most effective strategy with an incremental gain of 0.59 QALYs over RC (7.83 vs. 7.24 QALYs, respectively).When limiting the model to favorable, contemporary cohorts in both the TMT and RC strategies, TMT remained more effective with an incremental gain of 1.61 QALYs (9.37 vs. 7.76 QALYs, respectively).One-way sensitivity analyses demonstrated the model was sensitive to the quality of life parameters (ie, the utilities) for RC and TMT.When testing the 95% confidence interval of the RC utility parameter the model demonstrated an incremental gain with TMT from -0.54 to 4.23 QALYs.Probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that TMT was more effective than RC for 63% of model iterations.CONCLUSIONS: This modeling study found that treatment of MIBC with organ-sparing TMT in appropriately-selected patients may result in a gain of QALYs relative to RC.",0,0,0,0

23916017,"Perceptions of two therapeutic approaches for palliative care patients experiencing death anxiety.OBJECTIVE: Evidenced-based psychotherapies are not well researched for palliative care patients experiencing unrelenting anxiety about dying, even less research is focused on young adult palliative care patients with death anxiety.The aim of this study is to provide preliminary data regarding potential clients' perceptions of using evidenced based treatments with dying populations who are experiencing death anxiety.METHODS: 104 college students were used as potential clients and randomly assigned to watch either a short video of a cognitive therapy (CT) session or of an acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) session focused on treating a young adult diagnosed with an acute lymphoid leukemia expressing death anxiety.After watching the video, potential clients rated the session impact of the therapy approach using the Session Evaluation Questionnaire.RESULTS: No differences in ratings of session impact were found between potential clients who viewed the CT session and the ACT session.In regards to potential clients' views of session impact variables, their view of session smoothness was positively related to their post-session positivity, but inversely related to their view of session depth.Additionally, a positive correlation was found between potential clients' views of the therapist and session depth.SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: This preliminary study suggests that palliative care patients expressing death anxiety may benefit from either ACT or CT for death anxiety, however, future research is needed to explore the usefulness of each approach.Findings of this study support the theory that ACT and CT are viewed to have a similar session impact in the palliative care population.",0,0,0,0
29168064,"Adipose tissue inflammation in breast cancer survivors: effects of a 16-week combined aerobic and resistance exercise training intervention.PURPOSE: Obesity is a leading modifiable contributor to breast cancer mortality due to its association with increased recurrence and decreased overall survival rate.Obesity stimulates cancer progression through chronic, low-grade inflammation in white adipose tissue, leading to accumulation of adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs), in particular, the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype macrophage.Exercise has been shown to reduce M1 ATMs and increase the more anti-inflammatory M2 ATMs in obese adults.The purpose of this study was to determine whether a 16-week exercise intervention would positively alter ATM phenotype in obese postmenopausal breast cancer survivors.METHODS: Twenty obese postmenopausal breast cancer survivors were randomized to a 16-week aerobic and resistance exercise (EX) intervention or delayed intervention control (CON).The EX group participated in 16 weeks of supervised exercise sessions 3 times/week.Participants provided fasting blood, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and superficial subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue biopsies at baseline and following the 16-week study period.RESULTS: EX participants experienced significant improvements in body composition, cardiometabolic biomarkers, and systemic inflammation (all p < 0.03 vs. CON).Adipose tissue from EX participants showed a significant decrease in ATM M1 (p < 0.001), an increase in ATM M2 (p < 0.001), increased adipose tissue secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as adiponectin, and decreased secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF- alpha (all p < 0.055).CONCLUSIONS: A 16-week aerobic and resistance exercise intervention attenuates adipose tissue inflammation in obese postmenopausal breast cancer survivors.Future large randomized trials are warranted to investigate the impact of exercise-induced reductions in adipose tissue inflammation and breast cancer recurrence.",0,0,0,0
22390720,"Value of immediate second resection of the tumor bed to improve the effectiveness of transurethral resection of bladder tumor.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Current guidelines recommend routine second transurethral resection (TUR) for accurate diagnosis and to prevent understaging of muscle-invasive bladder cancer.We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of immediate second resection of the tumor bed during initial TUR and its prognostic significance.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients (n=126) undergoing TUR were prospectively randomized to undergo (n=63) or not undergo (n=63) immediate second resection of the tumor bed after complete TUR.Second resection was repeated until muscularis propria (MP) was identified in the specimen and the depth of tumor invasion was inspected.The results of second resection were compared with final pathology results for diagnostic accuracy.Recurrence and progression rates were compared in the two groups, and factors affecting recurrence were evaluated.RESULTS: Patient age, sex distribution, number of tumors, pathologic T stage and grade were similar in the groups.MP was included in all TUR specimens in the immediate second resection group, compared with 41 of 63 (65.1%) in the nonsecond resection group.The concordance rate of second resection with final pathology was r=0.810 (P<0.01).The sensitivity and specificity of second resection for T(2) disease were 90.9% and 98.0%, respectively, and the positive and negative predictive values of second resection for T(2) disease were 90.0% and 96.2%, respectively.Among the 94 patients followed up, those in the second resection group had significantly higher 2-year recurrence-free survival rate (77.0% vs 45.8%, P=0.025), but there was no difference in progression-free survival rate.CONCLUSIONS: Immediate second resection of the tumor bed after complete TUR improves the effectiveness of resection by immediately confirming the presence of MP in the specimen and accurately differentiating muscle-invasive disease.The advantages of immediate second resection were precise prediction of final pathology results and reduced early recurrence.",0,0,0,0

24612081,"Effects of raw red onion consumption on metabolic features in overweight or obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome: a randomized controlled clinical trial.AIM: We aimed to evaluate the effects of raw red onion consumption on metabolic features in overweight and obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome.MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this randomized controlled clinical trial, the patients (n=54) were randomly allocated to the intervention group as 'high-onion' (raw red onions: 2 x 40-50 g/day if overweight and 2 x 50-60 g/day if obese) or to the control group as 'low-onion' (raw red onions: 2 x 10-15 g/day) along with limited liliaceous vegetables for 8 weeks.Body mass index, dietary record, and metabolic parameters (fasting blood sugar, triglycerides, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and lipoprotein (a)) were evaluated in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle at baseline and after 8 weeks.Hormonal variables (progesterone, prolactin, and 17-OH progesterone) were also measured at baseline.RESULTS: Onion significantly decreased the levels of total cholesterol within each group; however, these changes were stronger in the high-onion group (weighted mean differences [WMD]: -5.60 [95% confidence interval [CI]: -9.16, -2.03]; P=0.003) than in the low-onion group (WMD: -6.42 [95%CI: -11.97, -0.87]; P=0.025).Similarly, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased significantly (WMD: -5.13 [95%CI: -9.46, -0.81); P=0.022) in the high-onion group, and (WMD: -2.90 [95%CI -5.57, -0.21]; P=0.035) in the low-onion group after treatment.The levels of fasting blood sugar, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and lipoprotein (a) did not differ significantly after 8-week onion treatment.Adjustment for confounders did not make any significant changes in any of the parameters in post-treatment levels.CONCLUSION: Raw red onion consumption appears to be effective as a cholesterol-lowering food agent in women with polycystic ovary syndrome.However, further investigation is warranted.",0,0,0,0
30705033,"Randomized study of imatinib for chronic myeloid leukemia: comparing standard dose escalation with aggressive escalation.In 2007, we conducted a prospective randomized study to compare an aggressive dose escalation (group B, n = 123) with the standard dose escalation proposed by European LeukemiaNet (group A, n = 122).In group B, if patients did not achieve a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) at 3 months or did not achieve a major molecular response (MR3) at 6 months, imatinib was increased to 600 mg.At 6 months CCyR was achieved in 69.4% and 78.7% of patients in groups A and B, respectively.The rate of MR3 at 12 months and 24 months were similar in group A (52.1% and 70.0%) and group B (58.7% and 68.3%).The cumulative incidence of withdrawal by failure without accelerated/blast phase was higher in group A than in group B (9.2% vs 2.5% at 24 months).At 3 and 6 months, the protocol called for the imatinib dose to increase to 600 mg in 90 patients (74.4%) in group B. Among the 42 patients who received increased dose according to the protocol, 25 (60.0%) achieved MR3 at 12 months, whereas only 14 (35.0%) of 40 patients who did not receive an increased dose achieved MR3 (P < .05).The number of patients who withdrew from this study was similar (group A, 20%; group B, 21%).The early aggressive dose escalation failed to produce a better molecular response at 12 months.However, for patients who tolerate imatinib well, but show inadequate response at an early time point, aggressive dose escalation may contribute to achieving a better outcome.This study was registered at http://www.umin.ac.jp/ctr/ as #R000000965.",1,1,1,1

23310947,"Body mass index at diagnosis and survival among colon cancer patients enrolled in clinical trials of adjuvant chemotherapy.BACKGROUND: Although obesity is an established risk factor for developing colon cancer, its prognostic impact and relation to patient sex in colon cancer survivors remains unclear.METHODS: The authors examined the prognostic and predictive impact of the body mass index (BMI) in patients with stage II and III colon carcinoma (N = 25,291) within the Adjuvant Colon Cancer Endpoints (ACCENT) database.BMI was measured at enrollment in randomized trials of 5-fluorouracil-based adjuvant chemotherapy.Association of BMI with the time to recurrence (TTR), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) were determined using Cox regression models.Statistical tests were 2-sided.RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 7.8 years, obese and underweight patients had significantly poorer survival compared with overweight and normal-weight patients.In a multivariable analysis, the adverse prognostic impact of BMI was observed among men but not among women (Pinteraction = .0129).Men with class 2 and 3 obesity (BMI >/= 35.0 kg/m(2) ) had a statistically significant reduction in DFS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.16; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.33; P = .0297) compared with normal-weight patients.Underweight patients had a significantly shorter TTR and reduced DFS (HR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.09-1.28; P < .0001) that was more significant among men (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.15-1.50; P < .0001) than among women (HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.01-1.23; P = .0362; Pinteraction = .0340).BMI was not predictive of a benefit from adjuvant treatment.CONCLUSIONS: Obesity and underweight status were associated independently with inferior outcomes in patients with colon cancer who received treatment in adjuvant chemotherapy trials.",0,0,0,0
29034009,"A multicenter, randomized study of decitabine as epigenetic priming with induction chemotherapy in children with AML.BACKGROUND: Decitabine is a deoxycytidine nucleoside derivative inhibitor of DNA-methyltransferases, which has been studied extensively and is approved for myelodysplastic syndrome in adults but with less focus in children.Accordingly, we conducted a phase 1 multicenter, randomized, open-label study to evaluate decitabine pre-treatment before standard induction therapy in children with newly diagnosed AML to assess safety and tolerability and explore a number of biologic endpoints.RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were fully assessable for all study objectives per protocol (10 in Arm A = epigenetic priming induction, 14 in Arm B = standard induction).All patients experienced neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.The most common grade 3 and 4 non-hematologic adverse events observed were gastrointestinal toxicities and hypophosphatemia.Plasma decitabine PK were similar to previously reported adult data.Overall CR/CRi was similar for the two arms.MRD negativity at end-induction was 85% in Arm A versus 67% in Arm B patients.DNA methylation measured in peripheral blood over the course of treatment tracked with blast clearance and matched marrow aspirates at day 0 and day 21.Unlike end-induction marrow analyses, promoter methylation in blood identified an apparent reversal of response in the lone treatment failure, 1 week prior to the patient's marrow aspirate confirming non-response.Decitabine-induced effects on end-induction (day 35-43 following initiation of treatment) marrows in Arm A were reflected by changes in DNA methylation in matched paired marrow diagnostic aspirates.CONCLUSIONS: This first-in-pediatrics trial demonstrates that decitabine prior to standard combination chemotherapy is feasible and well tolerated in children with newly diagnosed AML.Pre-treatment with decitabine may represent a newer therapeutic option for pediatric AML, especially as it appears to induce important epigenetic alterations.The novel biological correlates studied in this trial offer a clinically relevant window into disease progression and remission.Additional studies are needed to definitively assess whether decitabine can enhance durability responses in children with AML.TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT01177540.",1,1,1,1
29589991,"Comparison of patient flow and provider efficiency of two delivery strategies for HPV-based cervical cancer screening in Western Kenya: a time and motion study.BACKGROUND: Improving patient flow and reducing over-crowding can improve quality, promptness of care, and patient satisfaction.Given low utilization of preventive care in low-resource countries, improved patient flows are especially important in these settings.OBJECTIVE: Compare patient flow and provider efficiency between two cervical cancer screening strategies via self-collected human papillomavirus (HPV).METHODS: We collected time and motion data for patients screened for cervical cancer in 12 communities in rural Migori County, Kenya as part of a larger cluster randomized trial.Six communities were randomized to screening in community health campaigns (CHCs) and six to screening at government clinics.We quantified patient flow: duration spent on each active stage of screening and wait times, and the number of patients arriving at CHCs and clinics each hour of the day.In addition, for four CHCs, we collected time and motion data for providers, and measured provider efficiency as a ratio of active (service delivery) time to total time spent at the clinic.RESULTS: Total duration of screening visits, at CHCs and clinics was 42 and 87 minutes, respectively (p < 0.001 for difference).Total active time lasted longer at CHCs, with a mean of 28 minutes per patient versus 15 minutes at clinics, largely due to differences in duration for group education (p < 0.001).Wait time for registration at clinics was 36 minutes, explaining most of the difference between settings, but sometimes incorporated other health services.CONCLUSIONS: There is a substantial difference in patient flow at clinics compared to CHCs.Shorter duration at CHCs suggests that the model is favorable for patients in limiting time spent on screening.Future cervical cancer screening programs designed for scale-up should consider how this advantage may enhance satisfaction and uptake.For clinic-based screening programs, efforts could be made towards reducing registration wait times.",0,0,0,0
32975708,"Randomized phase II clinical trial and biomarker analysis of paclitaxel plus epirubicin versus vinorelbine plus epirubicin as neoadjuvant chemotherapy in locally advanced HER2-negative breast cancer with TEKT4 variations.PURPOSE: Resistance to paclitaxel remains a major challenge in treating breast cancer.Our preclinical study suggested that TEKT4 germline variations in breast cancer are associated with paclitaxel resistance and increase vinorelbine sensitivity.This clinical trial compared the efficacy of paclitaxel and vinorelbine in breast cancer neoadjuvant chemotherapy.METHODS: In this open-label, single-center, phase II trial, female patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, stage IIB-IIIC breast cancer harboring TEKT4 germline variations were randomly assigned to the paclitaxel plus epirubicin (PE) or vinorelbine plus epirubicin (NE).The primary endpoint was the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate, and the secondary endpoints were the objective response rate (ORR) and safety.Targeted sequencing of a panel comprising 484 breast-related genes was performed to identify pCR-associated somatic mutations in each group.RESULTS: 91 Patients were assigned to PE (46 patients) or NE (45 patients).NE numerically increased the pCR rate (22.2% versus 8.7%, P = 0.074).The ORRs for NE and PE were 82.2% and 76.1%, respectively.Interestingly, NE (15.4%) showed a significantly higher pCR rate than PE (0%) in the hormone receptor (HR)-positive subgroup (P = 0.044).Both regimens were well tolerated, with grade 3 and 4 toxicities reported at the expected levels.The biomarker analysis showed that UNC13D mutation predicted the pCR rate in NE (P = 0.011).CONCLUSIONS: Although the primary endpoint was not met, NE might bring clinical benefit to HR-positive patients or patients simultaneously carrying UNC13D mutations.",1,1,1,1

28352657,"Randomized, placebo-controlled window trial of EGFR, Src, or combined blockade in head and neck cancer.BACKGROUND.EGFR and Src family kinases are upregulated in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).EGFR interacts with Src to activate STAT3 signaling, and dual EGFR-Src targeting is synergistic in HNSCC preclinical models.pSrc overexpression predicted resistance to the EGFR inhibitor, erlotinib, in a prior window trial.We conducted a 4-arm window trial to identify biomarkers associated with response to EGFR and/or Src inhibition.METHODS.Patients with operable stage II-IVa HNSCC were randomized to 7-21 days of neoadjuvant erlotinib, the Src inhibitor dasatinib, the combination of both, or placebo.Paired tumor specimens were collected before and after treatment.Pharmacodynamic expression of EGFR and Src pathway components was evaluated by IHC of tissue microarrays and reverse-phase protein array of tissue lysates.Candidate biomarkers were assessed for correlation with change in tumor size.RESULTS.From April 2009 to December 2012, 58 patients were randomized and 55 were treated.There was a significant decrease in tumor size in both erlotinib arms (P = 0.0014); however, no effect was seen with dasatinib alone (P = 0.24).High baseline pMAPK expression was associated with response to erlotinib (P = 0.03).High baseline pSTAT3 was associated with resistance to dasatinib (P = 0.099).CONCLUSIONS.Brief exposure to erlotinib significantly decreased tumor size in operable HNSCC, with no additive effect from dasatinib.Baseline pMAPK expression warrants further study as a response biomarker for anti-EGFR therapy.Basal expression of pSTAT3 may be independent of Src, explain therapeutic resistance, and preclude development of dasatinib in biomarker-unselected cohorts.TRIAL REGISTRATION.NCT00779389.FUNDING.National Cancer Institute, American Cancer Society, Pennsylvania Department of Health, V Foundation for Cancer Research, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Astellas Pharma.",1,1,1,1

34021033,"Randomized phase II trial of lymphodepletion plus adoptive cell transfer of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, with or without dendritic cell vaccination, in patients with metastatic melanoma.BACKGROUND: The adoptive transfer of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) has demonstrated robust efficacy in metastatic melanoma patients.Tumor antigen-loaded dendritic cells (DCs) are believed to optimally activate antigen-specific T lymphocytes.We hypothesized that the combined transfer of TIL, containing a melanoma antigen recognized by T cells 1 (MART-1) specific population, with MART-1-pulsed DC will result in enhanced proliferation and prolonged survival of transferred MART-1 specific T cells in vivo ultimately leading to improved clinical responses.DESIGN: We tested the combination of TIL and DC in a phase II clinical trial of patients with advanced stage IV melanoma.HLA-A0201 patients whose early TIL cultures demonstrated reactivity to MART-1 peptide were randomly assigned to receive TIL alone or TIL +DC pulsed with MART-1 peptide.The primary endpoint was to evaluate the persistence of MART-1 TIL in the two arms.Secondary endpoints were to evaluate clinical response and survival.RESULTS: Ten patients were given TIL alone while eight patients received TIL+DC vaccine.Infused MART-1 reactive CD8(+) TIL were tracked in the blood over time by flow cytometry and results show good persistence in both arms, with no difference in the persistence of MART-1 between the two arms.The objective response rate was 30% (3/10) in the TIL arm and 50% (4/8) in the TIL+DC arm.All treatments were well tolerated.CONCLUSIONS: The combination of TIL +DC showed no difference in the persistence of MART-1 TIL compared with TIL therapy alone.Although more patients showed a clinical response to TIL+DC therapy, this study was not powered to resolve differences between groups.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT00338377.",1,1,1,1

24950280,"Chemotherapy or liver transplantation for nonresectable liver metastases from colorectal cancer?OBJECTIVE: The primary objective was to compare overall survival (OS) in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) with nonresectable liver-only metastases treated by liver transplantation or chemotherapy.BACKGROUND: CRC is the third most common cancer worldwide.About 50% of patients will develop metastatic disease primarily to the liver and the lung.The majority of patients with liver metastases receive palliative chemotherapy, with a median OS of trial patients of about 2 years, and less than 10% are alive at 5 years.METHODS: Patients with nonresectable liver-only CRC metastases underwent liver transplantation in the SECA study (n = 21).Disease-free survival (DFS) and OS of patients included in the SECA study were compared with progression-free survival (PFS) and OS in a similar cohort of CRC patients with liver-only disease included in a first-line chemotherapy study, the NORDIC VII study (n = 47).PFS/DFS and OS were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method.RESULTS: DFS/PFS in both groups were 8 to 10 months.However, a dramatic difference in OS was observed.The 5-year OS rate was 56% in patients undergoing liver transplantation compared with 9% in patients starting first-line chemotherapy.The reason for the large difference in OS despite similar DFS/PFS is likely different metastatic patterns at relapse/progression.Relapse in the liver transplantation group was often detected as small, slowly growing lung metastases, whereas progression of nonresectable liver metastases was observed in the chemotherapy group.CONCLUSIONS: Compared with chemotherapy, liver transplantation resulted in a marked increased OS in CRC patients with nonresectable liver-only metastases.",1,1,1,0
29771337,"Randomized Trial of the Impact of Empowering Childhood Cancer Survivors With Survivorship Care Plans.Background: A survivorship care plan (SCP), that is, individualized treatment summary and schedule of off-therapy surveillance, will be mandated by January 2019.It is unclear whether SCPs improve adherence to recommended follow-up care in the community.In this trial, we evaluated the impact of randomly assigning childhood cancer survivors to 1) SCPs to be taken to their primary care physician (PCP) to implement or 2) survivorship clinic (SC) on health care quality measures.Methods: Eligibility included cancer diagnosis younger than age 18 years (2000-2012), cancer free, one or more years off therapy, and no prior survivorship clinic attendance.At 12 months, the random assignment groups were compared (SCP+PCP vs SC) by intent-to-treat analysis with two-sided statistical tests in terms of patient adherence to guideline-recommended surveillance tests (eg, echocardiogram) and number of newly identified late complications of therapy.Results: From 2011 to 2013, 96 participants (46.9% female, mean age = 15.9 +/- 6.1 years) were randomly assigned.Adherence to 14 evaluated guideline-recommended surveillance tests ranged from 0% to 46.9% in the SCP+PCP group (n = 47) and from 50.0% to 86.4% in the SC group (n = 47).Adherence to 10 tests was statistically significantly different between the groups (all P < .05).One mild new late complication was identified in the SCP+PCP group compared with 21 late complications, ranging from mild to severe, identified in 11 patients in the SC group (2.1% vs 23.4% of patients, respectively, P = .003).Conclusions: Our randomized trial suggests that empowering childhood cancer survivors with SCPs to be implemented by their PCPs is not sufficient to meet consensus follow-up recommendations.",1,1,0,0
34487222,"Short-term fasting in glioma patients: analysis of diet diaries and metabolic parameters of the ERGO2 trial.PURPOSE: The prospective, randomized ERGO2 trial investigated the effect of calorie-restricted ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting (KD-IF) on re-irradiation for recurrent brain tumors.The study did not meet its primary endpoint of improved progression-free survival in comparison to standard diet (SD).We here report the results of the quality of life/neurocognition and a detailed analysis of the diet diaries.METHODS: 50 patients were randomized 1:1 to re-irradiation combined with either SD or KD-IF.The KD-IF schedule included 3 days of ketogenic diet (KD: 21-23 kcal/kg/d, carbohydrate intake limited to 50 g/d), followed by 3 days of fasting and again 3 days of KD.Follow-up included examination of cognition, quality of life and serum samples.RESULTS: The 20 patients who completed KD-IF met the prespecified goals for calorie and carbohydrate restriction.Substantial decreases in leptin and insulin and an increase in uric acid were observed.The SD group, of note, had a lower calorie intake than expected (21 kcal/kg/d instead of 30 kcal/kg/d).Neither quality of life nor cognition were affected by the diet.Low glucose emerged as a significant prognostic parameter in a best responder analysis.CONCLUSION: The strict caloric goals of the ERGO2 trial were tolerated well by patients with recurrent brain cancer.The short diet schedule led to significant metabolic changes with low glucose emerging as a candidate marker of better prognosis.The unexpected lower calorie intake of the control group complicates the interpretation of the results.Clinicaltrials.gov number: NCT01754350; Registration: 21.12.2012.",1,1,1,1
32591464,"A Phase II Study of Allogeneic GM-CSF-Transfected Pancreatic Tumor Vaccine (GVAX) with Ipilimumab as Maintenance Treatment for Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer.PURPOSE: This phase II study tested granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-allogeneic pancreatic tumor cells (GVAX) and ipilimumab in metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) in the maintenance setting.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with PDA who were treated with front-line chemotherapy consisting of 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) in the metastatic setting and had ongoing response or stable disease after 8-12 doses were eligible.Patients were randomized 1:1 to treatment with GVAX and ipilimumab given every 3 weeks for four doses then every 8 weeks (Arm A) or to FOLFIRINOX continuation (Arm B).The primary objective was to compare overall survival (OS) between the two arms.RESULTS: Eighty-two patients were included in the final analysis (Arm A: 40; Arm B: 42).The study was stopped for futility after interim analysis.Median OS was 9.38 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 5.0-12.2] for Arm A and 14.7 months (95% CI, 11.6-20.0) for Arm B (HR, 1.75; P = 0.019).Using immune-related response criteria, two partial responses (5.7%) were observed in Arm A and four (13.8%) in Arm B. GVAX + ipilimumab promoted T-cell differentiation into effector memory phenotypes both in the periphery and in the tumor microenvironment and increased M1 macrophages in the tumor.CONCLUSIONS: GVAX and ipilimumab maintenance therapy did not improve OS over continuation of chemotherapy and resulted in a numerically inferior survival in metastatic PDA.However, clinical responses and biological effects on immune cells were observed.Further study of novel combinations in the maintenance treatment of metastatic PDA is feasible.",0,0,0,0
22086774,"[Stem cell-induced liver regeneration].BACKGROUND: The liver has an excellent regenerative capacity after resection.However, below a critical level of future liver remnant volume (FLRV), partial hepatectomy is accompanied by a significant increase of postoperative liver failure.There is accumulating evidence for the contribution of bone marrow stem cells (BMSC) to participate in liver regeneration.Here we report our experience with portal vein embolisation (PVE) and CD133+ BMSC administration to the liver, compared with PVE alone, to augment hepatic regeneration in patients with critically low FLRV or impaired liver function.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eleven patients underwent PVE of liver segments I and IV-VIII to stimulate hepatic regeneration prior to extended right hepatectomy.In these 11 patients with a FLRV below 25% and/or limited quality of hepatic parenchyma, PVE alone did not promise adequate proliferation.These patients underwent additional BMSC administration to segments II and III.Two radiologists blinded to patients' identity and each other's results measured liver and tumour volumes with helical computed tomography.Absolute, relative and daily FLRV gains were compared with a group of patients that underwent PVE alone.RESULTS: The increase of the mean absolute FLRV after PVE with BMSC application from 239.3 mL+/-103.5 (standard deviation) to 417.1 mL+/-150.4 was significantly higher than that from 286.3 mL+/-77.1 to 395.9 mL+/-94.1 after PVE alone (p<0.05).Also the relative gain of FLRV in this group (77.3%+/-38.2%) was significantly higher than that after PVE alone (39.1%+/-20.4%) (P=0.039).In addition, the daily hepatic growth rate after PVE and BMSC application (9.5+/-4.3 mL/d) was significantly superior to that after PVE alone (4.1+/-1.9 mL/d) (p=0.03).Time to surgery was 27 days+/-11 in this group and 45 days+/-21 after PVE alone (p=0.02).Short- and long-term survival were not negatively influenced by the shorter waiting period.CONCLUSION: In patients with malignant liver lesions, the combination of PVE with CD133+ BMSC administration substantially increased hepatic regeneration compared with PVE alone.This procedure bears the potential to allow the safe resection of patients with a curative intention that would otherwise carry the risk post-operative liver failure.",0,0,0,0
22130166,"Ipilimumab increases activated T cells and enhances humoral immunity in patients with advanced melanoma.Ipilimumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody, which blocks cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4, has demonstrated an improvement in overall survival in 2 phase III trials of patients with advanced melanoma.To gain an understanding of its mechanism of action, the effects of ipilimumab on T-cell populations and on humoral immune responses were studied in patients with advanced melanoma from 2 phase II trials.Antibody levels against 5 tumor antigens were assessed at baseline and up to 12 weeks after ipilimumab treatment.Serologic reactivity to the cancer-testis antigen NY-ESO-1 increased by at least 5-fold at week 12 of treatment in 10% to 13% of patients.Increased antibody levels were also observed to the tumor antigens Melan-A, MAGE-A4, SSX2, and p53.Immunocompetence was evaluated with tetanus boosters administered before ipilimumab and pneumococcal and influenza vaccines given 5 days after ipilimumab treatment.At week 7, most patients who received ipilimumab and vaccine showed greater humoral responses relative to baseline titers.For peripheral T-cell populations, statistically significant increases in the percent of activated (HLA-DR) CD4 and CD8 T cells with concomitant decreases in naive CD4 and CD8 T cells were observed after ipilimumab treatment.These changes were evident by week 4 of treatment.Increases were also observed in central memory, effector memory, and activated ICOS CD4 T cells, but not in ICOS CD8 T cells or in FoxP3 CD4 regulatory T cells.These results suggest that ipilimumab can enhance immune responses mediated by different T-cell populations, and humoral immunity, in melanoma patients.",0,0,0,0
22758921,"The effect of a translating research into practice (TRIP)--cancer intervention on cancer pain management in older adults in hospice.BACKGROUND: Pain is a major concern for individuals with cancer, particularly older adults who make up the largest segment of individuals with cancer and who have some of the most unique pain challenges.One of the priorities of hospice is to provide a pain-free death, and while outcomes are better in hospice, patients still die with poorly controlled pain.OBJECTIVE: This article reports on the results of a Translating Research into Practice intervention designed to promote the adoption of evidence-based pain practices for older adults with cancer in community-based hospices.SETTING: This Institutional Human Subjects Review Board-approved study was a cluster randomized controlled trial implemented in 16 Midwestern hospices.METHODS: Retrospective medical records from newly admitted patients were used to determine the intervention effect.Additionally, survey and focus group data gathered from hospice staff at the completion of the intervention phase were analyzed.RESULTS: Improvement on the Cancer Pain Practice Index, an overall composite outcome measure of evidence-based practices for the experimental sites, was not significantly greater than control sites.Decrease in patient pain severity from baseline to post-intervention in the experimental group was greater; however, the result was not statistically significant (P = 0.1032).CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate a number of factors that may impact implementation of multicomponent interventions, including unique characteristics and culture of the setting, the level of involvement with the change processes, competing priorities and confounding factors, and complexity of the innovation (practice change).Our results suggest that future study is needed on specific factors to target when implementing a community-based hospice intervention, including determining and measuring intervention fidelity prospectively.",0,0,0,0

33549682,"Computer-tailored intervention increases colorectal cancer screening among low-income African Americans in primary care: Results of a randomized trial.INTRODUCTION: Although African Americans have the highest colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality rates of any racial group, their screening rates remain low.STUDY DESIGN/PURPOSE: This randomized controlled trial compared efficacy of two clinic-based interventions for increasing CRC screening among African American primary care patients.METHODS: African American patients from 11 clinics who were not current with CRC screening were randomized to receive a computer-tailored intervention (n = 335) or a non-tailored brochure (n = 358) designed to promote adherence to CRC screening.Interventions were delivered in clinic immediately prior to a provider visit.Univariate and multivariable logistic regression models analyzed predictors of screening test completion.Moderators and mediators were determined using multivariable linear and logistic regression analyses.RESULTS: Significant effects of the computer-tailored intervention were observed for completion of a stool blood test (SBT) and completion of any CRC screening test (SBT or colonoscopy).The colonoscopy screening rate was higher among those receiving the computer-tailored intervention group compared to the nontailored brochure but the difference was not significant.Predictors of SBT completion were: receipt of the computer-tailored intervention; being seen at a Veterans Affairs Medical Center clinic; baseline stage of adoption; and reason for visit.Mediators of intervention effects were changes in perceived SBT barriers, changes in perceived colonoscopy benefits, changes in CRC knowledge, and patient-provider discussion.Moderators of intervention effects were age, employment, and family/friend recommendation of screening.CONCLUSION: This one-time computer-tailored intervention significantly improved CRC screening rates among low-income African American patients.This finding was largely driven by increasing SBT but the impact of the intervention on colonoscopy screening was strong.Implementation of a CRC screening quality improvement program in the VA site that included provision of stool blood test kits and follow-up likely contributed to the strong intervention effect observed at that site.The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT00672828.",1,0,0,0

29439278,"Delineation of the extent of early gastric cancer by magnifying narrow-band imaging and chromoendoscopy: a multicenter randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Accurate delineation of tumor margins is necessary for curative resection of early gastric cancer (EGC).The objective of this multicenter, randomized, controlled study was to compare the accuracy with which magnifying narrow-band imaging (M-NBI) and indigo carmine chromoendoscopy delineate EGC margins.METHODS: Patients with EGC >/= 10 mm undergoing endoscopic or surgical resection were enrolled.The oral-side margins of the lesions were first evaluated with conventional white-light endoscopy in both groups and then delineated by either chromoendoscopy or M-NBI.Biopsies were taken from noncancerous and cancerous mucosa, each at 5 mm from the margin.Accurate delineation was judged to have been achieved when the histological findings in all biopsy samples were consistent with endoscopic diagnoses.The primary end point was the difference in rate of accurate delineation between the two techniques.RESULTS: Data on 343 patients were analyzed.The accurate delineation rate (95 % confidence interval) was 85.7 % (80.4 - 91.0) in the chromoendoscopy group (n = 168), and 88.0 % (83.2 - 92.8) in the M-NBI group (n = 175; P = 0.63).Lower third tumor location (odds ratio [OR] 2.9; P = 0.01), nonflat macroscopic type (OR 4.4; P < 0.01), and high diagnostic confidence (OR 3.6; P < 0.001) were associated with accurate delineation, whereas use of M-NBI was not (OR 1.2; P = 0.39).Even after adjustment for identified confounders, the difference in accurate delineation between the groups was not significant (OR 1.0; P = 0.82).CONCLUSIONS: M-NBI does not offer superior delineation of EGC margins compared with chromoendoscopy; the two methods appear to be clinically equivalent.",0,0,0,0
25605841,"Anxiety and health-related quality of life among patients with low-tumor burden non-Hodgkin lymphoma randomly assigned to two different rituximab dosing regimens: results from ECOG trial E4402 (RESORT).PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare illness-related anxiety among participants in the Rituximab Extended Schedule or Retreatment Trial (RESORT) randomly assigned to maintenance rituximab (MR) versus rituximab re-treatment (RR).A secondary objective was to examine whether the superiority of MR versus RR on anxiety depended on illness-related coping style.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients (N = 253) completed patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures at random assignment to MR or RR (baseline); at 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 months after random assignment; and at rituximab failure.PRO measures assessed illness-related anxiety and coping style, and secondary end points including general anxiety, worry and interference with emotional well-being, depression, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL).Patients were classified as using an active or avoidant illness-related coping style.Independent sample t tests and linear mixed-effects models were used to identify treatment arm differences on PRO end points and differences based on coping style.RESULTS: Illness-related anxiety was comparable between treatment arms at all time points (P > .05), regardless of coping style (active or avoidant).Illness-related anxiety and general anxiety significantly decreased over time on both arms.HRQoL scores were relatively stable and did not change significantly from baseline for both arms.An avoidant coping style was associated with significantly higher anxiety (18% and 13% exceeded clinical cutoff points at baseline and 6 months, respectively) and poorer HRQoL compared with an active coping style (P < .001), regardless of treatment arm assignment.CONCLUSION: Surveillance until RR at progression was not associated with increased anxiety compared with MR, regardless of coping style.Avoidant coping was associated with higher anxiety and poorer HRQoL.",0,0,0,0
27432930,"Effect of Interval (7 or 11 weeks) Between Neoadjuvant Radiochemotherapy and Surgery on Complete Pathologic Response in Rectal Cancer: A Multicenter, Randomized, Controlled Trial (GRECCAR-6).Purpose A pathologic complete response (pCR; ypT0N0) of a rectal tumor after neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy (RCT) is associated with an excellent prognosis.Several retrospective studies have investigated the effect of increasing the delay after RCT.The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of increasing the interval between the end of RCT and surgery on the pCR rate.Methods GRECCAR6 was a phase III, multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-group controlled trial.Patients with cT3/T4 or Tx N+ tumors of the mid or lower rectum who had received RCT (45 to 50 Gy with fluorouracil or capecitabine) were included.Patients were randomly included in the 7-week or the 11-week (11w) group.Primary end point was the pCR rate defined as a ypT0N0 specimen (NCT01648894).Results A total of 265 patients from 24 centers were enrolled between October 2012 and February 2015.The majority of the tumors were cT3 (82%).After RCT, surgery was not performed in nine patients (3.4%) because of the occurrence of distant metastasis (n = 5) or other reasons.Two patients underwent local resection of the tumor scar.A total of 47 (18.6%) specimens were classified as ypT0 (four had invaded lymph nodes [8.5%]).The primary end point (ypT0N0) was not different (7 weeks: 20 of 133, 15.0% v 11w: 23 of 132, 17.4%; P = .5983).Morbidity was significantly increased in the 11w group (44.5% v 32%; P = .0404) as a result of increased medical complications (32.8% v 19.2%; P = .0137).The 11w group had a worse quality of mesorectal resection (complete mesorectum [I] 78.7% v 90%; P = .0156).Conclusion Waiting 11 weeks after RCT did not increase the rate of pCR after surgical resection.A longer waiting period may be associated with higher morbidity and more difficult surgical resection.",0,0,0,0

30216191,"Randomised trial of HPV self-sampling among non-attenders in the Slovenian cervical screening programme ZORA: comparing three different screening approaches.Background To overcome obstacles within the Slovenian organised cervical cancer screening programme, a randomised pilot study of human papillomavirus (HPV) self-sampling among non-attenders was performed, aiming to assess three different screening approaches.Participants and methods Non-attenders aged 30-64 years from two Slovenian regions were randomised to two HPV self-sampling groups-the opt-in (I1, n = 14.400) and the opt-out (I2, n = 9.556), with a control group (P, n = 2.600).Self-collected samples were analysed using the Hybrid Capture 2 assay.HPV-positive women were invited to a colposcopy.The overall and type-specific intention-to-screen response rates and histological outcomes with a positive predictive value (PPV) according to the women's age, the screening approach, the level of protection resulting from previous screening history, and the region of residence were assessed.Results Of the 26.556 women enrolled, 8.972 (33.8%) responded with self-sample for HPV testing and/or traditional cytology within one year of enrolment.Response rates were 37.7%, 34.0% and 18.4% (p < 0.050) for opt-out, opt-in and control groups.Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)2+ was diagnosed in 3.9/1.000, 3.4/1.000, and 3.1/1.000 women (p > 0.050), respectively.PPV of the HPV self-sampling was 12.0% and 9.6% for CIN2+ and CIN3+.The highest PPV was obtained in non-attenders in screening programme for more than 10-years and concordant results of HPV testing with 40.8% for CIN2+ and 38.8% for CIN3+.Conclusions The results of our study show that a high response to HPV self-sampling can be achieved also in an opt-in approach, if women are encouraged to choose between self-sampling at home and screening with gynaecologist.In addition, clinically important risk difference for a high-grade cervical lesion exists in the case of a positive result of HPV testing on self-collected samples, depending on the length of the interval since last screening.Stratified management of these women should be strongly considered.Women who were not screened with cytology for at least 10 years should be referred to immediate colposcopy for histology verification instead to delayed re-testing.",0,0,0,0
24852569,"In Barrett's esophagus patients and Barrett's cell lines, ursodeoxycholic acid increases antioxidant expression and prevents DNA damage by bile acids.Hydrophobic bile acids like deoxycholic acid (DCA), which cause oxidative DNA damage and activate NF-kappaB in Barrett's metaplasia, might contribute to carcinogenesis in Barrett's esophagus.We have explored mechanisms whereby ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA, a hydrophilic bile acid) protects against DCA-induced injury in vivo in patients and in vitro using nonneoplastic, telomerase-immortalized Barrett's cell lines.We took biopsies of Barrett's esophagus from 21 patients before and after esophageal perfusion with DCA (250 muM) at baseline and after 8 wk of oral UDCA treatment.DNA damage was assessed by phospho-H2AX expression, neutral CometAssay, and phospho-H2AX nuclear foci formation.Quantitative PCR was performed for antioxidants including catalase and GPX1.Nrf2, catalase, and GPX1 were knocked down with siRNAs.Reporter assays were performed using a plasmid construct containing antioxidant responsive element.In patients, baseline esophageal perfusion with DCA significantly increased phospho-H2AX and phospho-p65 in Barrett's metaplasia.Oral UDCA increased GPX1 and catalase levels in Barrett's metaplasia and prevented DCA perfusion from inducing DNA damage and NF-kappaB activation.In cells, DCA-induced DNA damage and NF-kappaB activation was prevented by 24-h pretreatment with UDCA, but not by mixing UDCA with DCA.UDCA activated Nrf2 signaling to increase GPX1 and catalase expression, and protective effects of UDCA pretreatment were blocked by siRNA knockdown of these antioxidants.UDCA increases expression of antioxidants that prevent toxic bile acids from causing DNA damage and NF-kappaB activation in Barrett's metaplasia.Elucidation of this molecular pathway for UDCA protection provides rationale for clinical trials on UDCA for chemoprevention in Barrett's esophagus.",0,0,0,0

32070401,"TBCRC 002: a phase II, randomized, open-label trial of preoperative letrozole with or without bevacizumab in postmenopausal women with newly diagnosed stage 2/3 hormone receptor-positive and HER2-negative breast cancer.BACKGROUND: In preclinical studies, the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer is associated with estrogen-independent tumor growth and resistance to endocrine therapies.This study investigated whether the addition of bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody against VEGF, to letrozole enhanced the antitumor activity of the letrozole in the preoperative setting.METHODS: Postmenopausal women with newly diagnosed stage 2 or 3 estrogen and/or progesterone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer were randomly assigned (2:1) between letrozole 2.5 mg PO daily plus bevacizumab 15 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks (Let/Bev) and letrozole 2.5 mg PO daily (Let) for 24 weeks prior to definitive surgery.Primary objective was within-arm pathologic complete remission (pCR) rate.Secondary objectives were safety, objective response, and downstaging rate.RESULTS: Seventy-five patients were randomized (Let/Bev n = 50, Let n = 25).Of the 45 patients evaluable for pathological response in the Let/Bev arm, 5 (11%; 95% CI, 3.7-24.1%) achieved pCR and 4 (9%; 95% CI, 2.5-21.2%) had microscopic residual disease; no pCRs or microscopic residual disease was seen in the Let arm (0%; 95% CI, 0-14.2%).The rates of downstaging were 44.4% (95% CI, 29.6-60.0%) and 37.5% (95% CI, 18.8-59.4%) in the Let/Bev and Let arms, respectively.Adverse events typically associated with letrozole (hot flashes, arthralgias, fatigue, myalgias) occurred in similar frequencies in the two arms.Hypertension, headache, and proteinuria were seen exclusively in the Let/Bev arm.The rates of grade 3 and 4 adverse events and discontinuation due to adverse events were 18% vs 8% and 16% vs none in the Let/Bev and Let arms, respectively.A small RNA-based classifier predictive of response to preoperative Let/Bev was developed and confirmed on an independent cohort.CONCLUSION: In the preoperative setting, the addition of bevacizumab to letrozole was associated with a pCR rate of 11%; no pCR was seen with letrozole alone.There was additive toxicity with the incorporation of bevacizumab.Responses to Let/Bev can be predicted from the levels of 5 small RNAs in a pretreatment biopsy.TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT00161291), first posted on September 12, 2005, and is completed.",1,1,1,1
31477558,"Aspirin as an adjuvant treatment for cancer: feasibility results from the Add-Aspirin randomised trial.BACKGROUND: Preclinical, epidemiological, and randomised data indicate that aspirin might prevent tumour development and metastasis, leading to reduced cancer mortality, particularly for gastro-oesophageal and colorectal cancer.Randomised trials evaluating aspirin use after primary radical therapy are ongoing.We present the pre-planned feasibility analysis of the run-in phase of the Add-Aspirin trial to address concerns about toxicity, particularly bleeding after radical treatment for gastro-oesophageal cancer.METHODS: The Add-Aspirin protocol includes four phase 3 randomised controlled trials evaluating the effect of daily aspirin on recurrence and survival after radical cancer therapy in four tumour cohorts: gastro-oesophageal, colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer.An open-label run-in phase (aspirin 100 mg daily for 8 weeks) precedes double-blind randomisation (for participants aged under 75 years, aspirin 300 mg, aspirin 100 mg, or matched placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio; for patients aged 75 years or older, aspirin 100 mg or matched placebo in a 2:1 ratio).A preplanned analysis of feasibility, including recruitment rate, adherence, and toxicity was performed.The trial is registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trials Number registry (ISRCTN74358648) and remains open to recruitment.FINDINGS: After 2 years of recruitment (October, 2015, to October, 2017), 3494 participants were registered (115 in the gastro-oesophageal cancer cohort, 950 in the colorectal cancer cohort, 1675 in the breast cancer cohort, and 754 in the prostate cancer cohort); 2719 (85%) of 3194 participants who had finished the run-in period proceeded to randomisation, with rates consistent across tumour cohorts.End of run-in data were available for 2253 patients; 2148 (95%) of the participants took six or seven tablets per week.11 (0.5%) of the 2253 participants reported grade 3 toxicity during the run-in period, with no upper gastrointestinal bleeding (any grade) in the gastro-oesophageal cancer cohort.The most frequent grade 1-2 toxicity overall was dyspepsia (246 [11%] of 2253 participants).INTERPRETATION: Aspirin is well-tolerated after radical cancer therapy.Toxicity has been low and there is no evidence of a difference in adherence, acceptance of randomisation, or toxicity between the different cancer cohorts.Trial recruitment continues to determine whether aspirin could offer a potential low cost and well tolerated therapy to improve cancer outcomes.FUNDING: Cancer Research UK, The National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment Programme, The MRC Clinical Trials Unit at UCL.",1,1,1,1

31924316,"Veterans Affairs Cooperative Studies Program Study #553: Chemotherapy After Prostatectomy for High-risk Prostate Carcinoma: A Phase III Randomized Study.BACKGROUND: The Veterans Affairs Cooperative Studies Program study #553 was designed to evaluate the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy added to the standard of care (SOC) for patients who are at high risk for relapse after prostatectomy.OBJECTIVE: To test whether addition of chemotherapy to surgery for high-risk prostate cancer improves progression-free survival (PFS).DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Eligible patients after prostatectomy were randomized to the SOC group with observation or to the chemotherapy group with docetaxel and prednisone administered every 3 wk for six cycles.Randomization was stratified for prostate-specific antigen, Gleason, tumor stage, and surgical margin status.OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The primary endpoint was PFS.Secondary endpoints included overall, prostate cancer-specific, and metastasis-free survival, and time to androgen deprivation therapy.RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: A total of 298 of the planned 636 patients were randomized.The median follow-up was 59.1 mo (0.2-103.7 mo).For the primary endpoint, the two groups did not statistically differ in PFS (median 55.5 mo in the chemotherapy group and 42.2 mo in the SOC group; test adjusted for site via gamma frailty p=0.21; adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.58-1.11; p=0.18).Prespecified subgroup analyses showed benefit in PFS for patients with tumor stage >/=T3b (HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.32-0.92; p=0.022) and patients with Gleason score </=7 (HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.43-0.99; p=0.046).Secondary endpoint analyses are hampered by low event rates.The most common adverse events (>/=grade 3 related or possibly related to chemotherapy) included neutropenia (43%), hyperglycemia (20%), and fatigue (5%), with febrile neutropenia in 2%.CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant chemotherapy in high-risk prostate cancer using docetaxel and prednisone did not lead to statistically significant improvement in PFS for the intention-to-treat population as a whole.The analysis was challenged by lower power due to accrual limitation.Subgroup analyses suggest potential benefit for patients with Gleason grade </=7 and stage>/=pT3b (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT00132301).PATIENT SUMMARY: In this randomized trial, we tested whether addition of chemotherapy to surgery for high-risk prostate cancer decreased the risk of prostate-specific antigen rise after surgery.We found no benefit from docetaxel given after radical prostatectomy, although some subgroups of patients may benefit.",1,1,1,0
31537697,"Sequential screening for lung cancer in a high-risk group: randomised controlled trial: LungSEARCH: a randomised controlled trial of Surveillance using sputum and imaging for the EARly detection of lung Cancer in a High-risk group.BACKGROUND: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening detects early-stage lung cancer and reduces mortality.We proposed a sequential approach targeted to a high-risk group as a potentially efficient screening strategy.METHODS: LungSEARCH was a national multicentre randomised trial.Current/ex-smokers with mild/moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were allocated (1:1) to have 5 years surveillance or not.Screened participants provided annual sputum samples for cytology and cytometry, and if abnormal were offered annual LDCT and autofluorescence bronchoscopy (AFB).Those with normal sputum provided annual samples.The primary end-point was the percentage of lung cancers diagnosed at stage I/II (nonsmall cell) or limited disease (small cell).RESULTS: 1568 participants were randomised during 2007-2011 from 10 UK centres.85.2% of those screened provided an adequate baseline sputum sample.There were 42 lung cancers among 785 screened individuals and 36 lung cancers among 783 controls.54.8% (23 out of 42) of screened individuals versus 45.2% (14 out of 31) of controls with known staging were diagnosed with early-stage disease (one-sided p=0.24).Relative risk was 1.21 (95% CI 0.75-1.95) or 0.82 (95% CI 0.52-1.31) for early-stage or advanced cancers, respectively.Overall sensitivity for sputum (in those randomised to surveillance) was low (40.5%) with a cumulative false-positive rate (FPR) of 32.8%.55% of cancers had normal sputum results throughout.Among sputum-positive individuals who had AFB, sensitivity was 45.5% and cumulative FPR was 39.5%; the corresponding measures for those who had LDCT were 100% and 16.1%, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Our sequential strategy, using sputum cytology/cytometry to select high-risk individuals for AFB and LDCT, did not lead to a clear stage shift and did not improve the efficiency of lung cancer screening.",0,0,0,0
28463161,"Feasibility of Patient Reporting of Symptomatic Adverse Events via the Patient-Reported Outcomes Version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE) in a Chemoradiotherapy Cooperative Group Multicenter Clinical Trial.PURPOSE: To assess the feasibility of measuring symptomatic adverse events (AEs) in a multicenter clinical trial using the National Cancer Institute's Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE).METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients enrolled in NRG Oncology's RTOG 1012 (Prophylactic Manuka Honey for Reduction of Chemoradiation Induced Esophagitis-Related Pain during Treatment of Lung Cancer) were asked to self-report 53 PRO-CTCAE items representing 30 symptomatic AEs at 6 time points (baseline; weekly x4 during treatment; 12 weeks after treatment).Reporting was conducted via wireless tablet computers in clinic waiting areas.Compliance was defined as the proportion of visits when an expected PRO-CTCAE assessment was completed.RESULTS: Among 226 study sites participating in RTOG 1012, 100% completed 35-minute PRO-CTCAE training for clinical research associates (CRAs); 80 sites enrolled patients, of which 34 (43%) required tablet computers to be provided.All 152 patients in RTOG 1012 agreed to self-report using the PRO-CTCAE (median age 66 years; 47% female; 84% white).Median time for CRAs to learn the system was 60 minutes (range, 30-240 minutes), and median time for CRAs to teach a patient to self-report was 10 minutes (range, 2-60 minutes).Compliance was high, particularly during active treatment, when patients self-reported at 86% of expected time points, although compliance was lower after treatment (72%).Common reasons for noncompliance were institutional errors, such as forgetting to provide computers to participants; patients missing clinic visits; Internet connectivity; and patients feeling ""too sick."" CONCLUSIONS: Most patients enrolled in a multicenter chemoradiotherapy trial were willing and able to self-report symptomatic AEs at visits using tablet computers.Minimal effort was required by local site staff to support this system.The observed causes of missing data may be obviated by allowing patients to self-report electronically between visits, and by using central compliance monitoring.These approaches are being incorporated into ongoing studies.",0,0,0,0
27020655,"Alterations of Cyclooxygenase-2 Methylation Levels Before and After Intervention Trial to Prevent Gastric Cancer in a Chinese Population.To explore the epigenetic mechanisms underlying the effects of anti-Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) alone and combined with COX-2 inhibitor (celecoxib), we dynamically evaluated the associations between COX-2 methylation alterations and gastric lesion evolution during the process of interventions.In a total of 809 trial participants COX-2 methylation levels were quantitatively detected before and after treatment.The self-comparison at the same stomach site for each subject showed significant methylation alteration differences among intervention groups (P < 0.001).With placebo group as reference, COX-2 methylation levels were decreased in anti-H. pylori [OR, 3.30; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.16-5.02], celecoxib (OR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.36-3.07), and anti-H. pylori followed by celecoxib (OR, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.38-3.17) groups.When stratified by baseline histology, the three active arms significantly decreased COX-2 methylation levels in indefinite dysplasia/dysplasia subjects, and ORs were 3.65 (95% CI, 1.96-6.80) for anti-H. pylori, 2.43 (95% CI 1.34-4.39) for celecoxib, and 2.80 (95% CI, 1.52-5.15) for anti-H. pylori followed by celecoxib, respectively.No additive effect on COX-2 methylation was found for anti-H. pylori followed by celecoxib than two treatments alone.Compared with subjects without methylation reduction, higher opportunity for gastric lesion regression was found in subjects with decreased COX-2 methylation levels, especially for indefinite dysplasia/dysplasia subjects (OR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.03-3.60).These findings suggest that anti-H. pylori or celecoxib treatment alone could decrease COX-2 methylation levels in gastric mucosa.COX-2 methylation alteration was associated with the regression of indefinite dysplasia/dysplasia, which might serve as a potential biomarker for chemoprevention efficacy.Cancer Prev Res; 9(6); 484-90.(c)2016 AACR.",0,0,0,0
25361981,"Molecular subtype and tumor characteristics of breast cancer metastases as assessed by gene expression significantly influence patient post-relapse survival.BACKGROUND: We and others have recently shown that tumor characteristics are altered throughout tumor progression.These findings emphasize the need for re-examination of tumor characteristics at relapse and have led to recommendations from ESMO and the Swedish Breast Cancer group.Here, we aim to determine whether tumor characteristics and molecular subtypes in breast cancer metastases confer clinically relevant prognostic information for patients.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The translational aspect of the Swedish multicenter randomized trial called TEX included 111 patients with at least one biopsy from a morphologically confirmed locoregional or distant breast cancer metastasis diagnosed from December 2002 until June 2007.All patients had detailed clinical information, complete follow-up, and metastasis gene expression information (Affymetrix array GPL10379).We assessed the previously published gene expression modules describing biological processes [proliferation, apoptosis, human epidermal receptor 2 (HER2) and estrogen (ER) signaling, tumor invasion, immune response, and angiogenesis] and pathways (Ras, MAPK, PTEN, AKT-MTOR, PI3KCA, IGF1, Src, Myc, E2F3, and beta-catenin) and the intrinsic subtypes (PAM50).Furthermore, by contrasting genes expressed in the metastases in relation to survival, we derived a poor metastasis survival signature.RESULTS: A significant reduction in post-relapse breast cancer-specific survival was associated with low-ER receptor signaling and apoptosis gene module scores, and high AKT-MTOR, Ras, and beta-catenin module scores.Similarly, intrinsic subtyping of the metastases provided statistically significant post-relapse survival information with the worst survival outcome in the basal-like [hazard ratio (HR) 3.7; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3-10.9] and HER2-enriched (HR 4.4; 95% CI 1.5-12.8) subtypes compared with the luminal A subtype.Overall, 25% of the metastases were basal-like, 32% HER2-enriched, 10% luminal A, 28% luminal B, and 5% normal-like.CONCLUSIONS: We show that tumor characteristics and molecular subtypes of breast cancer metastases significantly influence post-relapse patient survival, emphasizing that molecular investigations at relapse provide prognostic and clinically relevant information.CLINICALTRIALS.GOV: This is the translational part of the Swedish multicenter and randomized trial TEX, clinicaltrials.gov identifier nct01433614 (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct01433614).",0,0,0,0
22798186,"A dual-institution randomized controlled trial of remnant closure after distal pancreatectomy: does the addition of a falciform patch and fibrin glue improve outcomes?OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to assess the efficacy of two pancreatic remnant closure techniques following distal pancreatectomy: (1) stapled or sutured closure versus (2) stapled or sutured closure plus falciform patch and fibrin glue reinforcement in the setting of a prospective randomized trial, with the primary endpoint being pancreatic fistula.Pancreatic stump leak following left-sided pancreatic resection (distal pancreatectomy) remains common.Despite multiple and varied techniques for closure, the reported leak rate varies up to 30 %.A retrospective analysis by Iannitti et al. (J Am Coll Surg 203(6):857-864, 2006) detected a decreased leak rate in patients receiving a traditional closure buttressed with an autologous falciform ligament patch and fibrin glue.METHODS: Between April 2008 and October 2011, all willing patients scheduled to undergo distal pancreatectomy at the authors' institutions were consented and enrolled at the preoperative office visit.Patients were intraoperatively stratified as having hard or soft glands and randomized to one of two groups: (1) closure utilizing stapling or suturing (SS) versus (2) stapled or sutured plus falciform ligament patch and fibrin glue (FF).The trial design and power analysis (alpha = 0.05, beta = 0.2, power 80 %, chi-square test) hypothesized that the FF intervention would reduce the primary endpoint (pancreatic fistula) from 30 % to 15 % and targeted an accrual goal of 190 patients.Secondary endpoints included length of postoperative hospital stay, 30-day mortality, hospital readmission, and ISGPF fistula grade (A, B, and C).RESULTS: The trial accrued 109 patients, 55 in the SS group and 54 in the FF group.Enrollment was closed prior to the target accrual, following an interim analysis and futility calculation.Due to insufficient enrollment, patients stratified as having a hard gland were excluded (n = 8) from analysis, leaving 101 patients in the soft stratum.The overall pancreatic leak rate was 19.8 % (20 patients) for patients with soft glands.Patients randomized to the FF group had a leak rate of 20 %, as compared with 19.6 % in the SS group (p = 1.000).Fistula grades in both groups were identical: 1A, 8B, and 1C in the FF group as compared to 1A, 8B, and 1C in the SS group.Complication rates were comparable between the two groups.The median length of postoperative hospital stay was 5 days in both groups.There was a trend towards a higher 30-day readmission rate in the FF group (28 % vs. 17.6 %, p = 0.243).CONCLUSION: The addition of a falciform ligament patch and fibrin glue to standard stapled or sutured remnant closure did not reduce the rate or severity of pancreatic fistula in patients undergoing distal pancreatectomy (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00889213).",0,0,0,0
29034009,"A multicenter, randomized study of decitabine as epigenetic priming with induction chemotherapy in children with AML.BACKGROUND: Decitabine is a deoxycytidine nucleoside derivative inhibitor of DNA-methyltransferases, which has been studied extensively and is approved for myelodysplastic syndrome in adults but with less focus in children.Accordingly, we conducted a phase 1 multicenter, randomized, open-label study to evaluate decitabine pre-treatment before standard induction therapy in children with newly diagnosed AML to assess safety and tolerability and explore a number of biologic endpoints.RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were fully assessable for all study objectives per protocol (10 in Arm A = epigenetic priming induction, 14 in Arm B = standard induction).All patients experienced neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.The most common grade 3 and 4 non-hematologic adverse events observed were gastrointestinal toxicities and hypophosphatemia.Plasma decitabine PK were similar to previously reported adult data.Overall CR/CRi was similar for the two arms.MRD negativity at end-induction was 85% in Arm A versus 67% in Arm B patients.DNA methylation measured in peripheral blood over the course of treatment tracked with blast clearance and matched marrow aspirates at day 0 and day 21.Unlike end-induction marrow analyses, promoter methylation in blood identified an apparent reversal of response in the lone treatment failure, 1 week prior to the patient's marrow aspirate confirming non-response.Decitabine-induced effects on end-induction (day 35-43 following initiation of treatment) marrows in Arm A were reflected by changes in DNA methylation in matched paired marrow diagnostic aspirates.CONCLUSIONS: This first-in-pediatrics trial demonstrates that decitabine prior to standard combination chemotherapy is feasible and well tolerated in children with newly diagnosed AML.Pre-treatment with decitabine may represent a newer therapeutic option for pediatric AML, especially as it appears to induce important epigenetic alterations.The novel biological correlates studied in this trial offer a clinically relevant window into disease progression and remission.Additional studies are needed to definitively assess whether decitabine can enhance durability responses in children with AML.TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT01177540.",1,1,1,1
33772364,"Lessons learned from the delivery of virtual integrative oncology interventions in clinical practice and research during the COVID-19 pandemic.The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and subsequent need for disease transmission mitigation efforts have significantly altered the delivery of cancer care (e.g., rise of telemedicine), including within the field of integrative oncology.However, little has been described about how National Cancer Institute-Designated Cancer Centers have transformed integrative oncology care delivery in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.The purpose of this commentary is to describe the delivery of integrative oncology clinical services and conduct of research at The Leonard P. Zakim Center for Integrative Therapies and Healthy Living at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute during the COVID-19 pandemic.Clinical services transitioned from an array of in-person appointment-based services, such as acupuncture and massage, and group programs, such as yoga and nutrition seminars to a combination of live-streamed and on-demand virtual group programs and one-on-one virtual appointments for services such as acupressure and self-care massage.Group program volume grew from 2189 in-person program patient visits in the 6 months prior to onset of the COVID pandemic to 16,366 virtual (e.g., live-streamed or on-demand) patient visits in the first 6 months of the pandemic.From a research perspective, two integrative oncology studies, focused on yoga and music therapy, respectively, were transitioned from in-person delivery to a virtual format.Participant accrual to these studies increased after the transition to virtual consent and intervention delivery.Overall, our clinical and research observations at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute suggest that the delivery of virtual integrative oncology treatments is feasible and appealing to patients.Trial Registration: NCT03824860 (Yoga); NCT03709225 (Music Therapy).",0,0,0,0

27589688,"Primary analysis of a prospective, randomized, single-blinded phase II trial evaluating the HER2 peptide GP2 vaccine in breast cancer patients to prevent recurrence.GP2 is a HER2-derived, HLA-A2+ restricted peptide.Phase I studies showed GP2 administered with GM-CSF to be safe and immunogenic.Here we report the primary analysis of a prospective, randomized, multicenter phase II adjuvant trial conducted to determine the vaccine's efficacy.The trial enrolled HLA-A2+, clinically disease-free, node-positive and high-risk node-negative breast cancer patients with tumors expressing HER2 (immunohistochemistry[IHC] 1+-3+).Patients were randomized to GP2+GM-CSF versus GM-CSF alone.Disease-free survival (DFS) was analyzed in intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-treatment cohorts; pre-specified subgroup analyses were performed for patients with IHC 3+ or FISH+ disease.The trial enrolled 180 patients; 89 received GP2+GM-CSF and 91 received GM-CSF alone.The groups were well-matched for clinicopathologic characteristics.Toxicities have been minimal.The Kaplan-Meier estimated 5-year DFS rate in the ITT analyses was 88% (95% CI:78-94%) in vaccinated vs. 81% (95% CI:69-89%) (P = 0.43) in control patients after a 34 month median follow-up.In the per-treatment analysis, the estimated 5-year DFS rates were 94% (95% CI:83-98%) and 85% (73-92%) (P = 0.17).In IHC 3+/FISH+ patients, the estimated 5-year DFS rate was 94% (82-98%) in vaccinated patients (n = 51) vs. 89% (71-96%) in control patients (n = 50), (P = 0.86) in the ITT analyses and 100% vs. 89% (71-96%) in vaccinated vs. control patients in the per-treatment analyses (P = 0.08).While the overall ITT analysis did not demonstrate benefit to vaccination, this trial confirmed that the GP2 vaccine is safe and suggests that vaccination may have clinical activity, particularly in patients with HER2 overexpression who received the full vaccine series (ie per-treatment group).",1,1,1,1
25749524,"A direct plasma assay of circulating microRNA-210 of hypoxia can identify early systemic metastasis recurrence in melanoma patients.Circulating cell-free(cf) microRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to exist in plasma.MicroRNA-210(miR-210) is known to play important roles in the tumor hypoxic state.We hypothesized that the expression levels of cf-miR-210 in plasma would predict early clinical recurrence in melanoma patients.A direct miRNA assay on plasma (RT-qPCR-DP) was developed to improve cf-miRNA assay logistics, eliminate RNA extraction, and reduce specimen amount required.RNA was extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) melanoma tissues (n = 108) and assessed by RT-qPCR.Plasma (10 mul; n = 264) was procured from AJCC Stage III/IV patients in phase III clinical trials.A RT-qPCR-DP was performed to detect cf-miR-210.MiR-210 was significantly higher in metastatic tumors compared to primary tumors.Cf-miR-210 was significantly higher in melanoma patients versus healthy donor controls.In serial bloods within individual patients, cf-miR-210 < 3 months prior to disease recurrence significantly increased compared to baseline levels (p = 0.012).ROC curve analysis demonstrated that patients with elevated cf-miR-210 were more likely to have disease recurrence.Moreover, cf-miR-210 increase significantly correlated with poorer prognosis (p < 0.001).Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level was also assessed within patients, and the AIC values for proportional hazards regression models of cf-miR-210(120.01) and LDH (122.91) demonstrated that cf-miR-210 is a better recurrence indicator.We concluded enhanced cf-miR-210 provides identification of early systemic melanoma recurrence.",0,0,0,0

32179448,"Outcomes of metastatic non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas (NRSTS) treated within the BERNIE study: a randomised, phase II study evaluating the addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy.PURPOSE: We analysed the cohort of paediatric patients with metastatic non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas (NRSTS) treated in the BERNIE protocol, i.e. open-label, multicentre, randomised phase II study evaluating the role of bevacizumab (BO20924/ITCC-006; ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00643565).METHODS: Eligible patients were randomised 1:1 to add or not add bevacizumab to nine courses of intensive multi-drug chemotherapy, followed by 12-month maintenance chemotherapy (plus surgery and radiotherapy).The primary end-point was event-free survival (EFS); secondary objectives were objective response rate (ORR) and overall survival (OS).RESULTS: From 2008 and 2013, 49 NRSTS patients (out of 154 cases) were treated, 26 in the standard arm and 23 in the bevacizumab arm.ORR was seen in 10 out of 36 evaluable cases (27.7%), i.e. 4/18 standard arm cases and 6/18 bevacizumab arm cases.Two-year EFS was 27.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 13.9-42.5) for all NRSTS patients, i.e. 34.9% (95% CI 14.6-56.2) for bevacizumab arm and 22.9% (95% CI 7.1-43.9) for standard arm (p-value = 0.19).Three-year OS (median follow-up 48.6 months) was 35.2%, with no differences in the two arms.Time to event and time to death were 16.3 and 17.2 months for bevacizumab arm and 2.1 and 7.6 months for standard arm, respectively.Patients not receiving any local treatment on primary disease had a worse outcome as compared to others.Treatment results were better for patients receiving surgical resection and worse for those who did not receive any specific treatment.CONCLUSION: The addition of the anti-angiogenic agent to the standard chemotherapy did not show statistically significant improvement in survival in metastatic NRSTS.",1,1,1,1
25843292,"Cytokine induced killer cell-based immunotherapies in patients with different stages of renal cell carcinoma.Cytokine induced killer (CIK) cell-based treatments have shown antitumor activity against renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in vitro and in vivo. But the therapeutic options and benefits of various CIK cells were unknown for different stages of RCC.In this random clinical trial, the 3-year disease free survival (DFS) of operable RCC patients treated with autologous tumor lysate-pulsed dendritic cells co-cultured with cytokine induced killer (Ag-DC-CIK) was 96.7% compared with 57.7% in the control group.Ag-DC-CIK immunotherapy decreased the risk of post-operative disease progression and relapse (P = 0.0418).In inoperable RCC patients treated with CIK, the 3-year overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were significantly longer than the control group (P = 0.0116 and P = 0.0212).The CD4(+)/CD8(+) T cell ratio in peripheral blood increased after the last cell infusion in the CIK treatment group, and especially further increased in the Ag-DC-CIK treatment group (P = 0.002).No severe toxicity was observed after infusion of CIK cells.Therefore, tumor antigen-sensitized Ag-DC-CIK cells might be more efficient and personalized for the patients with tumor resection, and CIK cells could improve the prognosis for those inoperable patients.According to the stages of RCC patients, different CIK cell-based immunotherapies would help to achieve more beneficial effects.",1,1,1,1
23053638,"A randomized phase II trial of platinum salts in basal-like breast cancer patients in the neoadjuvant setting. Results from the GEICAM/2006-03, multicenter study.Chemotherapy remains as the only systemic treatment option available for basal-like breast cancer (BC) patients.Preclinical models and several phase II studies suggested that platinum salts are active drugs in this BC subtype though there is no randomized study supporting this hypothesis.This study investigates if the addition of carboplatin to a combination of an alkylating agent together with anthracyclines and taxanes is able to increase the efficacy in the neoadjuvant treatment context.Patients with operable breast cancer and immunophenotypically defined basal-like disease (ER-/PR-/HER2- and cytokeratin 5/6+ or EGFR+) were recruited.Patients were randomized to receive EC (epirubicin 90 mg/m(2) plus cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2) for 4 cycles) followed either by D (docetaxel 100 mg/m(2) x 4 cycles; EC-D) or DCb (docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) plus carboplatin AUC 6 x 4 cycles; EC-DCb).The primary end point was pathological complete response (pCR) in the breast following the Miller and Payne criteria.Ninety-four patients were randomized (46 EC-D, 48 EC-DCb).pCR rate in the breast was seen in 16 patients (35 %) with EC-D and 14 patients (30 %) with EC-DCb (P value = 0.61).pCR in the breast and axilla was seen in 30 % of patients in both arms.The overall clinical response rate was 70 % (95 % CI 56-83) in the EC-D arm and 77 % (95 % CI 65-87) in the EC-DCb arm.Grade 3/4 toxicity was similar in both arms.The addition of carboplatin to conventional chemotherapy with EC-D in basal-like breast cancer patients did not improve the efficacy probably because they had already received an alkylating agent.These findings should be taken into consideration when developing new agents for this disease.",1,1,1,1

85 mg/m(2) intravenous oxaliplatin concurrently with 200 mg/m(2) of leucovorin over 120 min; 3200 mg/m(2) continuous infusion of fluorouracil for 48 h) plus bevacizumab followed by the reintroduction of the same regimen after disease progression.Combination treatments were repeated every 14 days for up to eight cycles followed by fluorouracil and leucovorin (at the same dose administered at the last induction cycle) plus bevacizumab maintenance until disease progression, unacceptable adverse events, or consent withdrawal.Patients and investigators were not masked.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival 2, defined as the time from randomisation to disease progression on any treatment given after first disease progression, or death, analysed by intention to treat.Safety was assessed in patients who received at least one dose of their assigned treatment.Study recruitment is complete and follow-up is ongoing.This trial is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT02339116.FINDINGS: Between Feb 26, 2015, and May 15, 2017, 679 patients were randomly assigned and received treatment (340 in the control group and 339 in the experimental group).At data cut-off (July 30, 2019) median follow-up was 35.9 months (IQR 30.1-41.4).Median progression-free survival 2 was 19.2 months (95% CI 17.3-21.4) in the experimental group and 16.4 months (15.1-17.5) in the control group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.74, 95% CI 0.63-0.88; p=0.0005).During the first-line treatment, the most frequent of all-cause grade 3-4 events were diarrhoea (57 [17%] vs 18 [5%]), neutropenia (168 [50%] vs 71 [21%]), and arterial hypertension (25 [7%] vs 35 [10%]) in the experimental group compared with the control group.Serious adverse events occurred in 84 (25%) patients in the experimental group and in 56 (17%) patients in the control group.Eight treatment-related deaths were reported in the experimental group (two intestinal occlusions, two intestinal perforations, two sepsis, one myocardial infarction, and one bleeding) and four in the control group (two occlusions, one perforation, and one pulmonary embolism).After first disease progression, no substantial differences in the incidence of grade 3 or 4 adverse events were reported between the control and experimental groups, with the exception of neurotoxicity, which was only reported in the experimental group (six [5%] of 132 patients).Serious adverse events after disease progression occurred in 20 (15%) patients in the experimental group and 25 (12%) in the control group.Three treatment-related deaths after first disease progression were reported in the experimental group (two intestinal occlusions and one sepsis) and four in the control group (one intestinal occlusion, one intestinal perforation, one cerebrovascular event, and one sepsis).INTERPRETATION: Upfront FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab followed by the reintroduction of the same regimen after disease progression seems to be a preferable therapeutic strategy to sequential administration of chemotherapy doublets, in combination with bevacizumab, for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer selected according to the study criteria.FUNDING: The GONO Cooperative Group, the ARCO Foundation, and F Hoffmann-La Roche.",0,0,0,0
21827579,"Comparison of success rates of 'transvaginal aspiration and tetracycline sclerotherapy' versus 'only aspiration' in the management of non-neoplastic ovarian cysts.AIM: To investigate the value of tetracycline sclerotherapy for management of recurrent or persisting non-neoplastic ovarian cysts in comparison to the aspiration without sclerotherapy.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ninety-six patients with proven non-neoplastic ovarian cysts were randomized into two groups.Group 1 patients underwent cyst aspiration together with tetracycline sclerotherapy (n=48).Group 2 patients underwent only cyst aspiration without tetracycline sclerotherapy (n=48).Then, all patients were followed up monthly with ultrasonography for 12months.The procedure was considered to have failed if the recurring cyst, detected by ultrasound, was 4cm in size or greater.RESULTS: There were no differences between the two groups regarding demographic data, initial cyst volume and tumor markers.Recurrence rates within 12months were 14.6% in group 1 and 50% in group 2 (P<0.001).CONCLUSION: Based on the recurrence rates, we suggest transvaginal aspiration together with tetracycline sclerotherapy rather than only simple transvaginal aspiration in the management of non-neoplastic ovarian cysts.",0,0,0,0

Race, Gleason score, tumor stage, node stage, pretreatment PSA level, and duration of neoAS were associated with the groups of patients with PSA levels </=0.1 and >0.1 ng/mL. In univariate analyses, post-neoAS, pre-RT PSA level >0.1 ng/mL was associated with increased risks of biochemical failure (hazard ratio [HR], 2.04; P < .0001); local failure (HR, 2.51; P < .0001); distant metastases (HR, 1.73; P = .0006); cause-specific mortality (HR, 2.36; P < .0001); and all-cause mortality (HR, 1.24; P = .005).In multivariable models that also included baseline and treatment variables, post-neoAS, pre-RT PSA level >0.1 ng/mL was independently associated with increased risk of biochemical failure (HR, 2.00; P < .0001); local failure (HR, 2.33; P < .0001); and cause-specific mortality (HR, 1.75; P = .03).CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a PSA level >0.1 ng/mL after neoAS and before the start of RT had less favorable clinical outcomes than patients whose PSA level was </=0.1 ng/mL. The role of post-neoAS, pre-RT PSA level relative to PSA levels obtained along the continuum of medical care is not presently defined but could be tested in future clinical trials.",0,0,0,0

31730474,"The feasibility of web surveys for obtaining patient-reported outcomes from cancer survivors: a randomized experiment comparing survey modes and brochure enclosures.BACKGROUND: Central cancer registries are often used to survey population-based samples of cancer survivors.These surveys are typically administered via paper or telephone.In most populations, web surveys obtain much lower response rates than paper surveys.This study assessed the feasibility of web surveys for collecting patient-reported outcomes via a central cancer registry.METHODS: Potential participants were sampled from Utah Cancer Registry records.Sample members were randomly assigned to receive a web or paper survey, and then randomized to either receive or not receive an informative brochure describing the cancer registry.We calculated adjusted risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals to compare response likelihood and the demographic profile of respondents across study arms.RESULTS: The web survey response rate (43.2%) was lower than the paper survey (50.4%), but this difference was not statistically significant (adjusted risk ratio = 0.88, 95% confidence interval = 0.72, 1.07).The brochure also did not significantly influence the proportion responding (adjusted risk ratio = 1.03, 95% confidence interval = 0.85, 1.25).There were few differences in the demographic profiles of respondents across the survey modes.Older age increased likelihood of response to a paper questionnaire but not a web questionnaire.CONCLUSIONS: Web surveys of cancer survivors are feasible without significantly influencing response rates, but providing a paper response option may be advisable particularly when surveying older individuals.Further examination of the varying effects of brochure enclosures across different survey modes is warranted.",0,0,0,0

25057173,"EGFR biomarkers predict benefit from vandetanib in combination with docetaxel in a randomized phase III study of second-line treatment of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.BACKGROUND: ZODIAC was a randomized phase III study of second-line treatment in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that evaluated the addition of vandetanib to docetaxel.The study showed a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival and objective response rate, but not in overall survival for unselected patients.This study evaluated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutation, copy number gain, and protein expression, and KRAS gene mutation, in pretreatment tumor samples as potential biomarkers predicting benefit from vandetanib as second-line treatment of NSCLC.PATIENTS AND METHODS: After progression following first-line chemotherapy, 1391 patients with locally advanced or metastatic (stage IIIB/IV) NSCLC were randomized 1 : 1 to receive vandetanib (100 mg/day) plus docetaxel (75 mg/m(2) every 21 days) or placebo plus docetaxel in the ZODIAC study.Archival tumor samples (n = 570) were collected from consenting patients (n = 958) for predefined, prospective biomarker analyses.RESULTS: Of evaluable samples, 14% were EGFR mutation positive, 35% were EGFR FISH positive, 88% were EGFR protein expression positive, and 13% were KRAS mutation positive.Compared with the overall study population, in which progression-free survival (PFS) [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.79] but not OS (HR = 0.91) were significantly improved with vandetanib, there was greater relative clinical benefit for patients with EGFR mutation-positive tumors [PFS HR 0.51, confidence interval (CI) 0.25-1.06 and OS HR 0.46, CI 0.14-1.57] and EGFR FISH-positive tumors (PFS HR 0.61, CI 0.39-0.94 and OS HR 0.48, CI 0.28-0.84).Similarly, patients with EGFR mutation or FISH-positive tumor samples who received vandetanib had an increased chance of objective tumor response (odds ratios 3.34, CI 0.8-13.89, and 3.90, CI 1.02-14.82, respectively).There did not appear to be benefit for vandetanib in patients with KRAS mutation-positive tumors.CONCLUSIONS: High EGFR gene copy number or activating EGFR mutations may identify patient subgroups who receive increased clinical benefit from vandetanib in combination with docetaxel in second-line NSCLC.CLINICALTRIALSGOV: NCT00312377.",1,1,1,1
30096441,"An Automated Intervention Did Not Improve Adherence to Oral Oncolytic Agents While Managing Symptoms: Results From a Two-Arm Randomized Controlled Trial.CONTEXT: An increasing number of oral cancer treatments require patient adherence and symptom self-management.OBJECTIVES: The report presents the effects of a medication reminder and symptom management intervention directed at patients initiating new oral oncolytic agents.METHODS: Patients (N = 272) were recruited at six comprehensive cancer centers, interviewed over the telephone after oral agent initiation, and randomized to either standard care or a medication reminder and symptom management intervention.In the intervention arm, the automated system called patients daily to remind them about taking their medications and weekly to assess 18 symptoms and refer patients to a printed Medication Management and Symptom Management Toolkit.Severity of 18 symptoms was also assessed during telephone interviews at Week 4 (midintervention), Week 8 (postintervention), and Week 12 (follow-up).Adherence was measured using the relative dose intensity, the ratio of dose taken by patient out of dose prescribed by the oncologist, and assessed using pill counts at Weeks 4, 8, and 12 and prescribing information from medical records.RESULTS: The relative dose intensity was high and did not differ by trial arm.Symptom severity was significantly lower (P < 0.01) in the experimental arm at Week 8 but not at Weeks 4 or 12.CONCLUSION: Adherence may be less of a problem than originally anticipated, and intervention was not efficacious possibly because of already high rates of patient adherence to oral oncolytic medication during first 12 weeks.Longer follow-up in future research may identify subgroups of patients who need interventions to sustain adherence.",0,0,0,0

27387325,"A phase II trial comparing pazopanib with doxorubicin as first-line treatment in elderly patients with metastatic or advanced soft tissue sarcoma (EPAZ): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Anthracycline-based treatment remains the backbone of chemotherapy for nonresectable soft tissue sarcomas (STS).More than 30 % of patients with STS are aged 60 years or older, limiting the choice of treatment to single-agent approaches for this elderly population.Hematological toxicity is frequent during doxorubicin monotherapy, grade 4 neutropenia is reported in 34 %, with a febrile neutropenia rate of 9 % in STS.We assume that comorbidities in the elderly population may limit tolerability of doxorubicin, and novel agents may improve tolerability and health-related quality of life while maintaining efficacy.We therefore investigated whether the tyrosine kinase inhibitor pazopanib exerts such a clinical benefit in elderly patients with STS (pazopanib for elderly [the EPAZ study]).METHODS/DESIGN: This study is a randomized, controlled, open-label, multicenter, phase II noninferiority trial in which pazopanib 800 mg once daily is being compared six cycles of intravenous doxorubicin 75 mg/m(2) as first-line treatment in elderly patients (>/=60 years) with metastatic or advanced STS.A total of 120 patients will be randomized 1:2 to receive doxorubicin or pazopanib, stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (0-1 vs. 2) and liposarcoma histology (yes vs. no).The primary endpoint is progression-free survival based on local tumor assessment according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria.Secondary endpoints include grade 4 neutropenia and febrile neutropenia in hierarchical order, as well as overall survival, objective response rate, health-related quality of life, and geriatric assessments.DISCUSSION: Pazopanib is associated with promising tolerability according to previous studies and may offer a significant clinical advantage in first-line treatment of STS compared with doxorubicin.The elderly population seems especially appealing for such an approach, since these patients are not suitable for aggressive combination therapy.The EPAZ study will confirm whether pazopanib may be an alternative to toxic chemotherapy for elderly patients with STS.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01861951 ; registered on 11 April 2013.EudraCT 2011-004168-30; registered on 4 June 2012.",0,0,0,0

32246224,"A randomized, phase 2 study of deoxyuridine triphosphatase inhibitor, TAS-114, in combination with S-1 versus S-1 alone in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.Introduction TAS-114 is a potent inhibitor of deoxyuridine triphosphatase, which is a gatekeeper protein preventing uracil and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) misincorporation into DNA.TAS-114 has been suggested to enhance the antitumor activity of 5-FU.This randomized, phase 2 study investigated TAS-114 plus S-1 (TAS-114/S-1) vs. S-1 in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.Methods Patients with advanced NSCLC, previously treated with >/= 2 regimens, were randomized 1:1 to receive TAS-114 (400 mg)/S-1 (30 mg/m(2)) or S-1 (30 mg/m(2)).Progression-free survival (PFS, independent central review) was the primary endpoint.Secondary endpoints included disease control rate (DCR), overall survival (OS), overall response rate (ORR), and safety.Results In total, 127 patients received treatment.Median PFS was 3.65 and 4.17 months in the TAS-114/S-1 and S-1 groups, respectively (hazard ratio [HR] 1.16, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.71-1.88; P = 0.2744).DCR was similar between groups (TAS-114/S-1 80.3%, S-1 75.9%) and median OS was 7.92 and 9.82 months for the TAS-114/S-1 and S-1 groups, respectively (HR 1.31, 95% CI 0.80-2.14; P = 0.1431).The ORR was higher in the TAS-114/S-1 group than the S-1 group (19.7% vs. 10.3%), and more patients with tumor shrinkage were observed in the TAS-114/S-1 group.Incidence rates of anemia, skin toxicities, and Grade >/= 3 treatment-related adverse events were higher in the TAS-114/S-1 group compared with the monotherapy group.Conclusions Although the TAS-114/S-1 combination improved the response rate, this did not translate into improvements in PFS.Clinical Trial Registration No. NCT02855125 (ClinicalTrials.gov) registered on 4 August 2016.",1,1,1,1
27573561,"Subgroup analysis in RAISE: a randomized, double-blind phase III study of irinotecan, folinic acid, and 5-fluorouracil (FOLFIRI) plus ramucirumab or placebo in patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma progression.BACKGROUND: The RAISE phase III clinical trial demonstrated that ramucirumab + FOLFIRI improved overall survival (OS) [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.844, P = 0.0219] and progression-free survival (PFS) (HR = 0.793, P < 0.0005) compared with placebo + FOLFIRI for second-line metastatic colorectal carcinoma (mCRC) patients previously treated with first-line bevacizumab, oxaliplatin, and a fluoropyrimidine.Since some patient or disease characteristics could be associated with differential efficacy or safety, prespecified subgroup analyses were undertaken.This report focuses on three of the most relevant ones: KRAS status (wild-type versus mutant), age (<65 versus >/=65 years), and time to progression (TTP) on first-line therapy (<6 versus >/=6 months).PATIENTS AND METHODS: OS and PFS were evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier analysis, with HR determined by the Cox proportional hazards model.Treatment-by-subgroup interaction was tested to determine whether treatment effect was consistent between subgroup pairs.RESULTS: Patients with both wild-type and mutant KRAS benefited from ramucirumab + FOLFIRI treatment over placebo + FOLFIRI (interaction P = 0.526); although numerically, wild-type KRAS patients benefited more (wild-type KRAS: median OS = 14.4 versus 11.9 months, HR = 0.82, P = 0.049; mutant KRAS: median OS = 12.7 versus 11.3 months, HR = 0.89, P = 0.263).Patients with both longer and shorter first-line TTP benefited from ramucirumab (interaction P = 0.9434), although TTP <6 months was associated with poorer OS (TTP >/=6 months: median OS = 14.3 versus 12.5 months, HR = 0.86, P = 0.061; TTP <6 months: median OS = 10.4 versus 8.0 months, HR = 0.86, P = 0.276).The subgroups of patients >/=65 versus <65 years also derived a similar ramucirumab survival benefit (interaction P = 0.9521) (>/=65 years: median OS = 13.8 versus 11.7 months, HR = 0.85, P = 0.156; <65 years: median OS = 13.1 versus 11.9 months, HR = 0.86, P = 0.098).The safety profile of ramucirumab + FOLFIRI was similar across subgroups.CONCLUSIONS: These analyses revealed similar efficacy and safety among patient subgroups with differing KRAS mutation status, longer or shorter first-line TTP, and age.Ramucirumab is a beneficial addition to second-line FOLFIRI treatment for a wide range of patients with mCRC.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01183780.",1,1,1,1
32492302,"Rituximab for High-Risk, Mature B-Cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma in Children.BACKGROUND: Rituximab added to chemotherapy prolongs survival among adults with B-cell cancer.Data on its efficacy and safety in children with high-grade, mature B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma are limited.METHODS: We conducted an open-label, international, randomized, phase 3 trial involving patients younger than 18 years of age with high-risk, mature B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (stage III with an elevated lactate dehydrogenase level or stage IV) or acute leukemia to compare the addition of six doses of rituximab to standard lymphomes malins B (LMB) chemotherapy with standard LMB chemotherapy alone.The primary end point was event-free survival.Overall survival and toxic effects were also assessed.RESULTS: Analyses were based on 328 patients who underwent randomization (164 patients per group); 85.7% of the patients had Burkitt's lymphoma.The median follow-up was 39.9 months.Events were observed in 10 patients in the rituximab-chemotherapy group and in 28 in the chemotherapy group.Event-free survival at 3 years was 93.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 89.1 to 96.7) in the rituximab-chemotherapy group and 82.3% (95% CI, 75.7 to 87.5) in the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio for primary refractory disease or first occurrence of progression, relapse after response, death from any cause, or second cancer, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.15 to 0.66; one-sided P = 0.00096, which reached the significance level required for this analysis).Eight patients in the rituximab-chemotherapy group died (4 deaths were disease-related, 3 were treatment-related, and 1 was from a second cancer), as did 20 in the chemotherapy group (17 deaths were disease-related, and 3 were treatment-related) (hazard ratio, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.16 to 0.82).The incidence of acute adverse events of grade 4 or higher after prephase treatment was 33.3% in the rituximab-chemotherapy group and 24.2% in the chemotherapy group (P = 0.07); events were related mainly to febrile neutropenia and infection.Approximately twice as many patients in the rituximab-chemotherapy group as in the chemotherapy group had a low IgG level 1 year after trial inclusion.CONCLUSIONS: Rituximab added to standard LMB chemotherapy markedly prolonged event-free survival and overall survival among children and adolescents with high-grade, high-risk, mature B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and was associated with a higher incidence of hypogammaglobulinemia and, potentially, more episodes of infection.(Funded by the Clinical Research Hospital Program of the French Ministry of Health and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01516580.).",1,1,1,1
28692586,"Bioactivity and prostate tissue distribution of metformin in a preprostatectomy prostate cancer cohort.Metformin has recently been shown to have potential to reduce prostate cancer risk.We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine the modulating effects of metformin on tissue and systemic biomarkers of drug activity and its distribution into the prostate tissue.Twenty patients with prostate cancer scheduled to undergo prostatectomy were randomly assigned to receive either extended-release metformin or placebo for a median of 34 days before surgery.Prostatectomy and serum samples were analyzed for metformin concentrations, serum biomarkers of drug activity (prostate-specific antigen, insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3, sex hormone-binding globulin, and testosterone) and tissue biomarkers of proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, and mTOR inhibition.For participants in the metformin arm, the prostate tissue and serum metformin concentrations ranged from 0.88 to 51.2 mug/g tissue and from not detectable to 3.6 mug/ml, respectively.There were no differences between the two groups in either the postintervention tissue biomarker expression in the prostatectomy tissue or pre to postintervention changes in serum biomarkers.We conclude that metformin distributes to human prostate tissue, suggesting that metformin could exert its effects directly on tissue targets.However, there was no difference in tissue and systemic drug effect biomarkers between the two treatment arms.Future studies with longer intervention duration and larger sample size should be considered in order to evaluate the potential of metformin for prostate cancer prevention.",1,1,1,1

28691132,"Randomized phase II placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy of topical pure emu oil for joint pain related to adjuvant aromatase inhibitor use in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer: JUST (Joints Under Study).PURPOSE: Aromatase inhibitors are standard of care in women with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer.Published evidence demonstrates that adverse effects may have an impact on drug compliance, with arthralgias being one of the most commonly reported adverse effects.METHODS: Eligible patients were postmenopausal women who had experienced arthralgia following initiation of an aromatase inhibitor.Patients who experienced arthralgias following a minimum of a 3-month treatment on the aromatase inhibitor were randomized to emu oil or placebo oil.The primary endpoint was to assess for a reduction in pain as measured by a visual analogue score after 8 weeks of treatment.RESULTS: Seventy-three patients comprised the intent-to-treat population, and there was no statistically significant benefit with use of EO.However, there was a statistically significant improvement in pain (visual analogue score was -1.28; p < 0.001) and Brief Pain Inventory severity score -0.88 (p < 0.001), as well as functional interference (Brief Pain Inventory interference -1.10 (p < 0.001) for the entire population following an 8-week administration of EO or placebo oil.CONCLUSIONS: Arthralgias, as a result of aromatase inhibitor use, may be ameliorated by the use of topical oil massaged onto the joint.Further research into interventions for this common side effect is needed.",0,0,0,0
24881631,"Ibrutinib versus ofatumumab in previously treated chronic lymphoid leukemia.BACKGROUND: In patients with chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), a short duration of response to therapy or adverse cytogenetic abnormalities are associated with a poor outcome.We evaluated the efficacy of ibrutinib, a covalent inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase, in patients at risk for a poor outcome.METHODS: In this multicenter, open-label, phase 3 study, we randomly assigned 391 patients with relapsed or refractory CLL or SLL to receive daily ibrutinib or the anti-CD20 antibody ofatumumab.The primary end point was the duration of progression-free survival, with the duration of overall survival and the overall response rate as secondary end points.RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 9.4 months, ibrutinib significantly improved progression-free survival; the median duration was not reached in the ibrutinib group (with a rate of progression-free survival of 88% at 6 months), as compared with a median of 8.1 months in the ofatumumab group (hazard ratio for progression or death in the ibrutinib group, 0.22; P<0.001).Ibrutinib also significantly improved overall survival (hazard ratio for death, 0.43; P=0.005).At 12 months, the overall survival rate was 90% in the ibrutinib group and 81% in the ofatumumab group.The overall response rate was significantly higher in the ibrutinib group than in the ofatumumab group (42.6% vs. 4.1%, P<0.001).An additional 20% of ibrutinib-treated patients had a partial response with lymphocytosis.Similar effects were observed regardless of whether patients had a chromosome 17p13.1 deletion or resistance to purine analogues.The most frequent nonhematologic adverse events were diarrhea, fatigue, pyrexia, and nausea in the ibrutinib group and fatigue, infusion-related reactions, and cough in the ofatumumab group.CONCLUSIONS: Ibrutinib, as compared with ofatumumab, significantly improved progression-free survival, overall survival, and response rate among patients with previously treated CLL or SLL.(Funded by Pharmacyclics and Janssen; RESONATE ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01578707.).",1,1,1,1
24332238,"Docetaxel versus active symptom control for refractory oesophagogastric adenocarcinoma (COUGAR-02): an open-label, phase 3 randomised controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Second-line chemotherapy for patients with oesophagogastric adenocarcinoma refractory to platinum and fluoropyrimidines has not shown benefits in health-related quality of life (HRQoL).We assessed whether the addition of docetaxel to active symptom control alone can improve survival and HRQoL for patients.METHODS: For this open-labelled, multicentre trial, we recruited patients aged 18 years or older from 30 UK centres.Patients were eligible if they had an advanced, histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus, oesophagogastric junction, or stomach that had progressed on or within 6 months of treatment with a platinum-fluoropyrimidine combination.Patients could have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2.We randomly assigned patients using a central, computerised minimisation procedure to receive docetaxel plus active symptom control, or active symptom control alone (1:1; stratified by disease status, disease site, duration of response to previous chemotherapy, and performance status).Docetaxel was given at a dose of 75 mg/m(2) by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks for up to six cycles.The primary endpoint was overall survival, analysed by intention to treat.This is the report of the planned final analysis.This study is an International Standardised Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN13366390.FINDINGS: Between April 21, 2008, and April 26, 2012, we recruited 168 patients, allocating 84 to each treatment group.After a median follow-up of 12 months [IQR 10-21]) and 161 (96%) deaths (80 in the docetaxel group, 81 in the active symptom control group), median overall survival in the docetaxel group was 5.2 months (95% CI 4.1-5.9) versus 3.6 months (3.3-4.4) in the active symptom control group (hazard ratio 0.67, 95% CI 0.49-0.92; p=0.01).Docetaxel was associated with higher incidence of grade 3-4 neutropenia (12 [15%] patients vs no patients), infection (15 [19%] patients vs two [3%] patients), and febrile neutropenia (six [7%] patients vs no patients).Patients receiving docetaxel reported less pain (p=0.0008) and less nausea and vomiting (p=0.02) and constipation (p=0.02).Global HRQoL was similar between the groups (p=0.53).Disease specific HRQoL measures also showed benefits for docetaxel in reducing dysphagia (p=0.02) and abdominal pain (p=0.01).INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that docetaxel can be recommended as an appropriate second-line treatment for patients with oesophagogastric adenocarcinoma that is refractory to treatment with platinum and fluoropyrimidine.FUNDING: Cancer Research UK.",0,0,0,0
26418718,"Phospho-kinase profile of colorectal tumors guides in the selection of multi-kinase inhibitors.Protein kinases play a central role in the oncogenesis of colorectal tumors and are attractive druggable targets.Detection of activated kinases within a tumor could open avenues for drug selection and optimization of new kinase inhibitors.By using a phosphokinase arrays with human colorectal tumors we identified activated kinases, including the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), components of the PI3K/mTOR pathway (AKT and S6), and STAT, among others.A pharmacological screening with kinase inhibitors against these proteins helped us to identify a new kinase inhibitor, termed EC-70124 that showed the highest anti-proliferative activity in cell lines.EC-70124 also inhibited cell migration and biochemical experiments demonstrated its effect targeting the PI3K/mTOR pathway.This drug also arrested cells at G2/M and induced apoptosis.Experiments in combination with standard chemotherapy used in the clinical setting indicated a synergistic effect.EC-70124 also reduced tumor growth in vivo and inhibited pS6 in the implanted tumors.In conclusion, by studying the kinase profile of colorectal tumors, we identified relevant activated pathways, and a new multi-kinase compound with significant antitumor properties.",0,0,0,0
32064640,"Outcomes of Two Treatments for Uncomplicated Pilonidal Sinus Disease: Karydakis Flap Procedure and Sinus Tract Ablation Procedure Using a 1,470 nm Diode Laser Combined With Pit Excision.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: An ideal treatment for pilonidal disease should feature a low recurrence rate, minimal incision, and rapid return to daily activities.We compared the outcomes of the well-defined Karydakis technique (KT) and a combination of pit excision (PE) and sinus tract ablation using 1,470-nm diode laser.STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, from January 2016 to January 2018, patients diagnosed with uncomplicated early-stage pilonidal sinus disease were enrolled and were treated randomly, using KT (n = 28) or a PE/laser ablation technique (PE + LAT; n = 30).RESULTS: The mean operative times were 36.4 (25-45) minutes in the KT group and 15.1 (12-20) minutes in the PE + LAT group.Postoperative Visual Analog Scale pain scores were 4.4 in the KT group and 2.1 in the PE + LAT group.The time periods to return to normal daily activities were 2.6 (1-5) days in the PE + LAT group and 12.8 (10-20) days in the KT group.The mean Likert satisfaction scores were 3.8 in the KT group and 4.8 in the PE + LAT group.The groups did not differ in terms of recurrence.CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the KT, the PE + LAT was associated with a shorter operative time, a more rapid return to normal activities, less pain, and a higher level of subjective satisfaction.We found that the PE + LAT was better than the KT for patients with early-stage disease.Lasers Surg.

33422006,"Impact of time-varying cumulative bevacizumab exposures on survival: re-analysis of data from randomized clinical trial in patients with metastatic colo-rectal cancer.BACKGROUND: As cancer treatment, biotherapies can be as effective as chemotherapy while reducing the risk of secondary effects, so that they can be taken over longer periods than conventional chemotherapy.Thus, some trials aimed at assessing the benefit of maintaining biotherapies during chemotherapy-free intervals (CFI).For example, the recent PRODIGE9 trial assessed the effect of maintaining bevacizumab during CFI in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients.However, its analysis was hindered by a small difference of exposure to the treatment between the randomized groups and by a large proportion of early drop outs, leading to a potentially unbalanced distribution of confounding factors among the trial completers.To address these limitations, we re-analyzed the PRODIGE9 data to assess the effects of different exposure metrics on all-cause mortality of patients with mCRC using methods originally developed for observational studies.METHODS: To account for the actual patterns of drug use by individual patients and for possible cumulative effects, we used five alternative time-varying exposure metrics: (i) cumulative dose, (ii) quantiles of the cumulative dose, (iii) standardized cumulative dose, (iv) Theoretical Blood Concentration (TBC), and (v) Weighted Cumulative Exposure (WCE).The last two metrics account for the timing of drug use.Treatment effects were estimated using adjusted Hazard Ratio from multivariable Cox proportional hazards models.RESULTS: After excluding 112 patients who died during the induction period, we analyzed data on 382 patients, among whom 320 (83.8%) died.All time-varying exposures improved substantially the model's fit to data, relative to using only the time-invariant randomization group.All exposures indicated a protective effect for higher cumulative bevacizumab doses.The best-fitting WCE and TBC models accounted for both the cumulative effects and the different impact of doses taken at different times.CONCLUSIONS: All time-varying analyses, regardless of the exposure metric used, consistently suggested protective effects of higher cumulative bevacizumab doses.However, the results may partly reflect the presence of a confusion bias.Complementing the main ITT analysis of maintenance trials with an analysis of potential cumulative effects of treatment actually taken can provide new insights, but the results must be interpreted with caution because they do not benefit from the randomization.TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov, NCT00952029 .Registered 8 August 2009.",0,0,0,0

When Gleason score >7 was excluded, 177 men were left for case matching.At Massachusetts General Hospital, 203 similar patients were treated by a single brachytherapist from 1997 to 2002.Minimum follow-up was 3 years.Case matching, based on T stage, Gleason score, prostate-specific antigen, and age resulted in 141 matches (282 patients).Median follow-up was 8.6 and 7.4 years for EBRT and brachytherapy, respectively.The primary endpoint was biochemical failure (BF).RESULTS: Using the Phoenix definition, the 8-year BF rates were 7.7% and 16.1% for EBRT and brachytherapy, respectively (p = 0.42).A stratified analysis was performed by risk group.In the EBRT group, 113 and 28 patients were low and intermediate risk, respectively.In the brachytherapy group, 118 and 23 were.When stratified by risk group, the BF rates were similar by either technique.CONCLUSIONS: High-dose EBRT and brachytherapy result in similar BF rates for men with localized prostate cancer.Comparative quality-of-life and cost-effectiveness studies are warranted.",0,0,0,0
33947608,"Time to Resolution of Axitinib-Related Adverse Events After Treatment Interruption in Patients With Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma.INTRODUCTION: Combined axitinib and immuno-oncology (IO) therapy is approved for first-line advanced renal cell carcinoma.Overlapping toxicities represent a clinical challenge.Calculating the time to resolution (TTR) of common axitinib-related adverse events (AEs) after treatment interruption may help to identify AE etiology and determine appropriate management strategies.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from 5 randomized or single-arm axitinib monotherapy or combination studies were analyzed.Patients with histologically confirmed clear cell advanced renal cell carcinoma were pooled into 3 cohorts based on treatment received: axitinib monotherapy, axitinib + IO, and other tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).Any grade and grade >/=3 treatment-emergent diarrhea, fatigue, hypertension, nausea, and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome were assessed.TTR was defined as the time from treatment interruption/discontinuation to resolution.RESULTS: The axitinib monotherapy cohort comprised 532 patients, the axitinib + IO cohort 541 patients, and the other TKI cohort 882 patients.Median TTR for all AEs (any grade) in the axitinib monotherapy cohort ranged from 1 to 3 days, except for fatigue (8 days).For diarrhea, hypertension, nausea, and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome, median TTRs were longer in the axitinib + IO (4-11 days) and other TKI (7-8 days) cohorts versus the monotherapy cohort.Results were similar when only AEs of grade >/=3 were considered.CONCLUSIONS: The TTR of monotherapeutic axitinib-related AEs is </=3 days, except for fatigue, and generally shorter than for other single-agent TKIs and axitinib + IO.This has important implications for identifying AE etiology with combined axitinib-IO therapy and implementation of appropriate management strategies.ClinicalTrials.org identifiers: NCT00678392, NCT00920816, NCT02493751, NCT02684006, NCT02853331.",0,0,0,0
26822397,"Gastrectomy plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone for advanced gastric cancer with a single non-curable factor (REGATTA): a phase 3, randomised controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy is the standard of care for incurable advanced gastric cancer.Whether the addition of gastrectomy to chemotherapy improves survival for patients with advanced gastric cancer with a single non-curable factor remains controversial.We aimed to investigate the superiority of gastrectomy followed by chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone with respect to overall survival in these patients.METHODS: We did an open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial at 44 centres or hospitals in Japan, South Korea, and Singapore.Patients aged 20-75 years with advanced gastric cancer with a single non-curable factor confined to either the liver (H1), peritoneum (P1), or para-aortic lymph nodes (16a1/b2) were randomly assigned (1:1) in each country to chemotherapy alone or gastrectomy followed by chemotherapy by a minimisation method with biased-coin assignment to balance the groups according to institution, clinical nodal status, and non-curable factor.Patients, treating physicians, and individuals who assessed outcomes and analysed data were not masked to treatment assignment.Chemotherapy consisted of oral S-1 80 mg/m(2) per day on days 1-21 and cisplatin 60 mg/m(2) on day 8 of every 5-week cycle.Gastrectomy was restricted to D1 lymphadenectomy without any resection of metastatic lesions.The primary endpoint was overall survival, analysed by intention to treat.This study is registered with UMIN-CTR, number UMIN000001012.FINDINGS: Between Feb 4, 2008, and Sept 17, 2013, 175 patients were randomly assigned to chemotherapy alone (86 patients) or gastrectomy followed by chemotherapy (89 patients).After the first interim analysis on Sept 14, 2013, the predictive probability of overall survival being significantly higher in the gastrectomy plus chemotherapy group than in the chemotherapy alone group at the final analysis was only 13.2%, so the study was closed on the basis of futility.Overall survival at 2 years for all randomly assigned patients was 31.7% (95% CI 21.7-42.2) for patients assigned to chemotherapy alone compared with 25.1% (16.2-34.9) for those assigned to gastrectomy plus chemotherapy.Median overall survival was 16.6 months (95% CI 13.7-19.8) for patients assigned to chemotherapy alone and 14.3 months (11.8-16.3) for those assigned to gastrectomy plus chemotherapy (hazard ratio 1.09, 95% CI 0.78-1.52; one-sided p=0.70).The incidence of the following grade 3 or 4 chemotherapy-associated adverse events was higher in patients assigned to gastrectomy plus chemotherapy than in those assigned to chemotherapy alone: leucopenia (14 patients [18%] vs two [3%]), anorexia (22 [29%] vs nine [12%]), nausea (11 [15%] vs four [5%]), and hyponatraemia (seven [9%] vs four [5%]).One treatment-related death occurred in a patient assigned to chemotherapy alone (sudden cardiopulmonary arrest of unknown cause during the second cycle of chemotherapy) and one occurred in a patient assigned to chemotherapy plus gastrectomy (rapid growth of peritoneal metastasis after discharge 12 days after surgery).INTERPRETATION: Since gastrectomy followed by chemotherapy did not show any survival benefit compared with chemotherapy alone in advanced gastric cancer with a single non-curable factor, gastrectomy cannot be justified for treatment of patients with these tumours.FUNDING: The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan and the Korean Gastric Cancer Association.",0,0,0,0

PgR and Ki67 expression were significantly reduced with all treatments (means were -34% to -45%, and -75% to -85%, respectively; all P = 0.0001), with no differences between groups.CONCLUSIONS: In this short-term study, all treatments reduced ER expression, although F and F + A showed greater reductions than A. No significant differences were detected between the treatment groups in terms of PgR and Ki67 expression.No additional reduction in tumor biomarkers with combination treatment was observed, suggesting that F + A is unlikely to have further clinical benefit over F alone.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00259090.",1,1,1,1

23146280,"The prognostic and predictive value of mRNA expression of vascular endothelial growth factor family members in breast cancer: a study in primary tumors of high-risk early breast cancer patients participating in a randomized Hellenic Cooperative Oncology Group trial.INTRODUCTION: The main prognostic variables in early breast cancer are tumor size, histological grade, estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor (ER/PgR) status, number of positive nodes and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status.The present study evaluated the prognostic and/or predictive value of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family members in high-risk early breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant chemo-hormonotherapy.METHODS: RNA was isolated from 308 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded primary tumor samples from breast cancer patients enrolled in the HE10/97 trial, evaluating adjuvant dose-dense sequential chemotherapy with epirubicin followed by cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil (CMF) with or without paclitaxel (E-T-CMF versus E-CMF).A fully automated method based on magnetic beads was applied for RNA extraction, followed by one-step quantitative RT-PCR for mRNA analysis of VEGF-A, -B, -C and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) 1, 2, 3.RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 8 years, 109 patients (35%) developed a relapse and 80 patients (26%) died.In high VEGF-C and VEGFR1 mRNA expressing tumors, ER/PgR-negative tumors (Fisher's exact test, P = 0.001 and P = 0.021, respectively) and HER2-positive tumors (P <0.001 and P = 0.028, respectively) were more frequent than in low VEGF-C and VEGFR1 expressing tumors, respectively.From the VEGF family members evaluated, high VEGFR1 mRNA expression (above the 75th percentile) emerged as a significant negative prognostic factor for overall survival (OS; hazard ratio (HR) = 1.60, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01 to 2.55, Wald's P = 0.047) and disease-free survival (DFS; HR = 1.67, 95% CI: 1.13 to 2.48, P = 0.010), when adjusting for treatment group.High VEGF-C mRNA expression was predictive for benefit from adjuvant treatment with paclitaxel (E-T-CMF arm) for OS (test for interaction, Wald's P = 0.038), while in multivariate analysis the interaction of VEGF-C with taxane treatment was significant for both OS (Wald's P = 0.019) and DFS (P = 0.041) and continuous VEGF-B mRNA expression values for OS (P = 0.019).CONCLUSIONS: The present study reports, for the first time, that VEGF-C mRNA overexpression, as assessed by qRT-PCR, has a strong predictive value in high-risk early breast cancer patients undergoing adjuvant paclitaxel-containing treatment.Further studies are warranted to validate the prognostic and/or predictive value of VEGF-B, VEGF-C and VEGFR1 in patients treated with adjuvant therapies and to reveal which members of the VEGF family could possibly be useful markers in identifying patients who will benefit most from anti-VEGF strategies.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR) ACTRN12611000506998.",0,0,0,0

29648580,"Bevacizumab plus hypofractionated radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone in elderly patients with glioblastoma: the randomized, open-label, phase II ARTE trial.Background: The addition of bevacizumab to temozolomide-based chemoradiotherapy (TMZ/RT --> TMZ) did not prolong overall survival (OS) in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma in phase III trials.Elderly and frail patients are underrepresented in clinical trials, but early reports suggested preferential benefit in this population.Patients and methods: ARTE was a 2 : 1 randomized, multi-center, open-label, non-comparative phase II trial of hypofractionated RT (40 Gy in 15 fractions) with bevacizumab (10 mg/kgx14 days) (arm A, N = 50) or without bevacizumab (arm B, N = 25) in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma aged >/=65 years.The primary objective was to obtain evidence for prolongation of median OS by the addition of bevacizumab to RT.Response was assessed by RANO criteria.Quality of life (QoL) was monitored by the EORTC QLQ-C30/BN20 modules.Exploratory studies included molecular subtyping by 450k whole methylome and gene expression analyses.Results: Median PFS was longer in arm A than in arm B (7.6 and 4.8 months, P = 0.003), but OS was similar (12.1 and 12.2 months, P = 0.77).Clinical deterioration was delayed and more patients came off steroids in arm A. Prolonged PFS in arm A was confined to tumors with the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) I methylation subtype (HR 0.25, P = 0.014) and proneural gene expression (HR 0.29, P = 0.025).In a Cox model of OS controlling for established prognostic factors, associations with more favorable outcome were identified for age <70 years (HR 0.52, P = 0.018) and Karnofsky performance score 90%-100% (HR 0.51, P = 0.026).Including molecular subtypes into that model identified an association of the RTK II gene methylation subtype with inferior OS (HR 1.73, P = 0.076).Conclusion: Efficacy outcomes and exploratory analyses of ARTE do not support the hypothesis that the addition of bevacizumab to RT generally prolongs survival in elderly glioblastoma patients.Molecular biomarkers may identify patients with preferential benefit from bevacizumab.Clinical trial registration number: NCT01443676.",1,1,1,1
28244415,"A Randomized Phase 2 Trial of Prophylactic Manuka Honey for the Reduction of Chemoradiation Therapy-Induced Esophagitis During the Treatment of Lung Cancer: Results of NRG Oncology RTOG 1012.PURPOSE: Randomized trials have shown that honey is effective for the prevention of radiation-induced mucositis in head and neck cancer patients.Because there is no efficacious preventative for radiation esophagitis in lung cancer patients, this trial compared liquid honey, honey lozenges, and standard supportive care for radiation esophagitis.METHODS: The patients were stratified by percentage of esophagus receiving specific radiation dose (V60 Gy esophagus <30% or >/=30%) and were then randomized between supportive care, 10 mL of liquid manuka honey 4 times a day, and 2 lozenges (10 mL of dehydrated manuka honey) 4 times a day during concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy.The primary endpoint was patient-reported pain on swallowing, with the use of an 11-point (0-10) scale at 4 weeks (Numerical Rating Pain Scale, NRPS).The study was designed to detect a 15% relative reduction of change in NRPS score.The secondary endpoints were trend of pain over time, opioid use, clinically graded and patient-reported adverse events, weight loss, dysphagia, nutritional status, and quality of life.RESULTS: 53 patients were randomized to supportive care, 54 were randomized to liquid honey, and 56 were randomized to lozenge honey.There was no significant difference in the primary endpoint of change in the NRPS at 4 weeks between arms.There were no differences in any of the secondary endpoints except for opioid use at 4 weeks during treatment between the supportive care and liquid honey arms, which was found to be significant (P=.03), with more patients on the supportive care arm taking opioids.CONCLUSION: Honey as prescribed within this protocol was not superior to best supportive care in preventing radiation esophagitis.Further testing of other types of honey and research into the mechanisms of action are needed.",0,0,0,0
23442174,"Monitoring laparoscopic radiofrequency renal lesions in real time using contrast-enhanced ultrasonography: an open-label, randomized, comparative pilot trial.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has been considered as an important therapy for small renal lesions.The main limitation of RFA, however, is the lack of pathologic confirmation of complete tumor eradication.A single center, open label, randomized pilot study was designed to evaluate whether contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) with Sonovue, performed in real time could allow us to determine the end point during laparoscopic radiofrequency ablation (LRFA) and the clinical outcome of this method.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ninety-six patients undergoing LRFA were randomly assigned to CEUS or a control group; finally, 38 and 40 patients with a pathologic diagnosis of renal-cell carcinoma completed a 3-month follow-up.CEUS was conducted in real time during the procedure to determine the end point in the CEUS group.The primary outcome was the incomplete ablation rate according to a radiographic image at 3 months after the procedure.The secondary outcome included the local tumor control rate and disease-free survival rate.RESULTS: There were no differences in the incomplete ablation rate and disease-free survival rate between the two groups.Within a median 16-month follow-up period, three incomplete ablations and two local recurrences according to a radiographic image were found in the control group.Meanwhile, there was no incomplete ablation or recurrence but one lung metastasis in the CEUS group.The local tumor control rate was 87.5% (35/40) in the control group vs 100% (38/38) (P=0.073) in the CEUS group.CONCLUSION: In patients undergoing LRFA, there were no differences in the incomplete ablation rate and local tumor control rate between the CEUS group and the control group in our study despite a nonsignificant trend in favor of CEUS.CEUS may have the potential to provide more effective renal tumor ablation.These novel data support the need for a larger study of CEUS during LRFA surgery.",0,0,0,0

30194031,"ODM-204, a Novel Dual Inhibitor of CYP17A1 and Androgen Receptor: Early Results from Phase I Dose Escalation in Men with Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.BACKGROUND: Most prostate cancer patients develop castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) after androgen deprivation therapy treatment.CRPC growth is mediated mostly by androgen receptor signalling driven by primary androgens synthesised largely by the CYP17A1 enzyme.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety profile and dose-limiting toxicities of ODM-204.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this open, uncontrolled, nonrandomised, multicentre, tolerability and pharmacokinetic first-in-man phase I dose escalation study, patients with metastatic CRPC were randomised to receive ODM-204 in sequential cohorts of five dose levels (ie, 50, 100, 200, 300, and 500mg twice daily) concomitantly with prednisone.INTERVENTION: ODM-204, a novel, orally administered, investigational, nonsteroidal dual inhibitor of CYP17A1 and androgen receptor.OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: ODM-204 plasma concentrations, serum testosterone, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels were evaluated and imaging of lesions was performed.RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Of the 23 patients enrolled into the study, 60.9% experienced mild adverse effects considered to be related to the study treatment, which were fatigue, increased/decreased appetite, nausea, asthenia, diarrhoea, and weight decrease.ODM-204 area under the curve (AUC0-12) values increased dose dependently until the 300mg dose.The AUC was lower on day 8 after repeated dosing compared with day 1 from the 200mg dose upwards.Decreases in testosterone levels were seen with ODM-204 treatment confirming androgen deprivation.Of the patients, 13% also demonstrated a >50% decrease in PSA at week 12 and continued ODM-204 treatment for over a year.CONCLUSIONS: ODM-204 was well tolerated up to the highest evaluated dose.There were decreases in both testosterone and PSA levels, suggesting preliminary antitumour activity in the treatment of CRPC.The pharmacokinetic properties of the molecule, however, prevent further development.PATIENT SUMMARY: This study looked at the safety of ODM-204, a novel dual inhibitor of CYP17A1 and the androgen receptor, in castration-resistant prostate cancer patients.ODM-204 treatment was found to be well tolerated, and it also reduced both serum testosterone and prostate-specific antigen levels, but the properties of the molecule prevent further development.",0,0,0,0
27435280,"ESOPEC: prospective randomized controlled multicenter phase III trial comparing perioperative chemotherapy (FLOT protocol) to neoadjuvant chemoradiation (CROSS protocol) in patients with adenocarcinoma of the esophagus (NCT02509286).BACKGROUND: Recent randomized controlled trials comparing neoadjuvant chemoradiation plus surgery or perioperative chemotherapy plus surgery with surgery alone showed significant survival benefits for combined modality treatment of patients with localized esophageal adenocarcinoma.However, head-to-head comparisons of neoadjuvant chemoradiation and perioperative chemotherapy applying contemporary treatment protocols are lacking.The present trial was initiated to obtain valid information whether neoadjuvant chemoradiation or perioperative chemotherapy yields better survival in the treatment of localized esophageal adenocarcinoma.METHODS/DESIGN: The ESOPEC trial is an investigator-initiated multicenter prospective randomized controlled two-arm trial, comparing the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemoradiation (CROSS protocol: 41.4Gy plus carboplatin/paclitaxel) followed by surgery versus perioperative chemotherapy and surgery (FLOT protocol: 5-FU/leucovorin/oxaliplatin/docetaxel) for the curative treatment of localized esophageal adenocarcinoma.Patients with cT1cN + cM0 and cT2-4acNxcM0 esophageal and junctional adenocarcinoma are eligible.The trial aims to include 438 participants who are centrally randomized to one of the two treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio stratified by N-stage and study site.The primary endpoint of the trial is overall survival assessed with a minimum follow-up of 36 months.Secondary objectives are progression-free survival, recurrence-free survival, site of failure, postoperative morbidity and mortality, duration of hospitalization as well as quality of life.DISCUSSION: The ESOPEC trial compares perioperative chemotherapy according to the FLOT protocol to neoadjuvant chemoradiation according to the CROSS protocol in multimodal treatment of non-metastasized recectable adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and the gastroesophageal junction.The goal of the trial is identify the superior protocol with regard to patient survival, treatment morbidity and quality of life.TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT02509286 (July 22, 2015).",0,0,0,0
29768118,"Final Overall Survival Analysis From a Study Comparing First-Line Crizotinib Versus Chemotherapy in ALK-Mutation-Positive Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.Purpose The phase III PROFILE 1014 trial compared crizotinib with chemotherapy as first-line treatment in patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) -positive advanced nonsquamous non-small-cell lung cancer.Here, we report the final overall survival (OS) results.Patients and Methods Patients were randomly assigned to receive oral crizotinib 250 mg twice daily (n = 172) or intravenous pemetrexed 500 mg/m(2) plus cisplatin 75 mg/m(2) or carboplatin (area under the concentration-time curve of 5 to 6 mg.mL/min) every 3 weeks for a maximum of six cycles (n = 171).Crossover to crizotinib was permitted after disease progression.OS was analyzed using a stratified log-rank test and a prespecified rank-preserving structural failure time model to account for crossover.Results Median follow-up duration for OS was approximately 46 months for both arms.In the chemotherapy arm, 144 patients (84.2%) received crizotinib in subsequent lines.Hazard ratio for OS was 0.760 (95% CI, 0.548 to 1.053; two-sided P = .0978).Median OS was not reached (NR) with crizotinib (95% CI, 45.8 months to NR) and 47.5 months with chemotherapy (95% CI, 32.2 months to NR).Survival probability at 4 years was 56.6% (95% CI, 48.3% to 64.1%) with crizotinib and 49.1% (95% CI, 40.5% to 57.1%) with chemotherapy.After crossover adjustment, there was an improvement in OS that favored crizotinib (hazard ratio, 0.346; 95% bootstrap CI, 0.081 to 0.718).The longest OS was observed in crizotinib-treated patients who received a subsequent ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor.No new safety signals were identified.Conclusion The final analysis of the PROFILE 1014 study provides a new benchmark for OS in patients with ALK-rearranged non-small-cell lung cancer and highlights the benefit of crizotinib for prolonging survival in this patient population.",1,1,1,1
32220893,"Disease Monitoring Using Post-induction Circulating Tumor DNA Analysis Following First-Line Therapy in Patients with Metastatic Colorectal Cancer.PURPOSE: We assessed plasma circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) level as a prognostic marker for progression-free survival (PFS) following first-line metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) therapy.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The Sequencing Triplet With Avastin and Maintenance (STEAM) was a randomized, phase II trial investigating efficacy of bevacizumab (BEV) plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin/oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin/irinotecan (FOLFIRI), administered concurrently or sequentially, versus FOLFOX-BEV in first-line mCRC.Evaluation of biomarkers associated with treatment outcomes was an exploratory endpoint.Patients in the biomarker-evaluable population (BEP) had 1 tissue sample, 1 pre-induction plasma sample, and 1 post-induction plasma sample collected </=60 days of induction from last drug date.RESULTS: Among the 280 patients enrolled in STEAM, 183 had sequenced and evaluable tumor tissue, 118 had matched pre-induction plasma, and 54 (BEP) had ctDNA-evaluable sequencing data for pre- and post-induction plasma.The most common somatic variants in tumor tissue and pre-induction plasma were TP53, APC, and KRAS.Patients with lower-than-median versus higher-than-median post-induction mean allele fraction (mAF) levels had longer median PFS (17.7 vs. 7.5 months, HR, 0.33; 95% confidence interval, 0.17-0.63).Higher levels of post-induction mAF and post-induction mean mutant molecules per milliliter (mMMPM), and changes in ctDNA (stratified by a 10-fold or 100-fold reduction in mAF between pre- and post-induction plasma), were associated with shorter PFS.Post-induction mAF and mMMPM generally correlated with each other (rho = 0.987, P < 0.0001).CONCLUSIONS: ctDNA quantification in post-induction plasma may serve as a prognostic biomarker for mCRC post-treatment outcomes.",1,1,1,1
32070401,"TBCRC 002: a phase II, randomized, open-label trial of preoperative letrozole with or without bevacizumab in postmenopausal women with newly diagnosed stage 2/3 hormone receptor-positive and HER2-negative breast cancer.BACKGROUND: In preclinical studies, the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer is associated with estrogen-independent tumor growth and resistance to endocrine therapies.This study investigated whether the addition of bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody against VEGF, to letrozole enhanced the antitumor activity of the letrozole in the preoperative setting.METHODS: Postmenopausal women with newly diagnosed stage 2 or 3 estrogen and/or progesterone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer were randomly assigned (2:1) between letrozole 2.5 mg PO daily plus bevacizumab 15 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks (Let/Bev) and letrozole 2.5 mg PO daily (Let) for 24 weeks prior to definitive surgery.Primary objective was within-arm pathologic complete remission (pCR) rate.Secondary objectives were safety, objective response, and downstaging rate.RESULTS: Seventy-five patients were randomized (Let/Bev n = 50, Let n = 25).Of the 45 patients evaluable for pathological response in the Let/Bev arm, 5 (11%; 95% CI, 3.7-24.1%) achieved pCR and 4 (9%; 95% CI, 2.5-21.2%) had microscopic residual disease; no pCRs or microscopic residual disease was seen in the Let arm (0%; 95% CI, 0-14.2%).The rates of downstaging were 44.4% (95% CI, 29.6-60.0%) and 37.5% (95% CI, 18.8-59.4%) in the Let/Bev and Let arms, respectively.Adverse events typically associated with letrozole (hot flashes, arthralgias, fatigue, myalgias) occurred in similar frequencies in the two arms.Hypertension, headache, and proteinuria were seen exclusively in the Let/Bev arm.The rates of grade 3 and 4 adverse events and discontinuation due to adverse events were 18% vs 8% and 16% vs none in the Let/Bev and Let arms, respectively.A small RNA-based classifier predictive of response to preoperative Let/Bev was developed and confirmed on an independent cohort.CONCLUSION: In the preoperative setting, the addition of bevacizumab to letrozole was associated with a pCR rate of 11%; no pCR was seen with letrozole alone.There was additive toxicity with the incorporation of bevacizumab.Responses to Let/Bev can be predicted from the levels of 5 small RNAs in a pretreatment biopsy.TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT00161291), first posted on September 12, 2005, and is completed.",1,1,1,1
28623628,"Does Patient Preference Measurement in Decision Aids Improve Decisional Conflict? A Randomized Trial in Men with Prostate Cancer.BACKGROUND: Shared decision making (SDM) has been advocated as an approach to medical decision making that can improve decisional quality.Decision aids are tools that facilitate SDM in the context of limited physician time; however, many decision aids do not incorporate preference measurement.OBJECTIVES: We aim to understand whether adding preference measurement to a standard patient educational intervention improves decisional quality and is feasible in a busy clinical setting.METHODS: Men with incident localized prostate cancer (n = 122) were recruited from the Greater Los Angeles Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center urology clinic, Olive View UCLA Medical Center, and Harbor UCLA Medical Center from January 2011 to May 2015 and randomized to education with a brochure about prostate cancer treatment or software-based preference assessment in addition to the brochure.Men undergoing preference assessment received a report detailing the relative strength of their preferences for treatment outcomes used in review with their doctor.Participants completed instruments measuring decisional conflict, knowledge, SDM, and patient satisfaction with care before and/or after their cancer consultation.RESULTS: Baseline knowledge scores were low (mean 62%).The baseline mean total score on the Decisional Conflict Scale was 2.3 (+/-0.9), signifying moderate decisional conflict.Men undergoing preference assessment had a significantly larger decrease in decisional conflict total score (p = 0.023) and the Perceived Effective Decision Making subscale (p = 0.003) post consult compared with those receiving education only.Improvements in satisfaction with care, SDM, and knowledge were similar between groups.CONCLUSIONS: Individual-level preference assessment is feasible in the clinic setting.Patients with prostate cancer who undergo preference assessment are more certain about their treatment decisions and report decreased levels of decisional conflict when making these decisions.",0,0,0,0

Results from the GEICAM/2006-03, multicenter study.Chemotherapy remains as the only systemic treatment option available for basal-like breast cancer (BC) patients.Preclinical models and several phase II studies suggested that platinum salts are active drugs in this BC subtype though there is no randomized study supporting this hypothesis.This study investigates if the addition of carboplatin to a combination of an alkylating agent together with anthracyclines and taxanes is able to increase the efficacy in the neoadjuvant treatment context.Patients with operable breast cancer and immunophenotypically defined basal-like disease (ER-/PR-/HER2- and cytokeratin 5/6+ or EGFR+) were recruited.Patients were randomized to receive EC (epirubicin 90 mg/m(2) plus cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2) for 4 cycles) followed either by D (docetaxel 100 mg/m(2) x 4 cycles; EC-D) or DCb (docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) plus carboplatin AUC 6 x 4 cycles; EC-DCb).The primary end point was pathological complete response (pCR) in the breast following the Miller and Payne criteria.Ninety-four patients were randomized (46 EC-D, 48 EC-DCb).pCR rate in the breast was seen in 16 patients (35 %) with EC-D and 14 patients (30 %) with EC-DCb (P value = 0.61).pCR in the breast and axilla was seen in 30 % of patients in both arms.The overall clinical response rate was 70 % (95 % CI 56-83) in the EC-D arm and 77 % (95 % CI 65-87) in the EC-DCb arm.Grade 3/4 toxicity was similar in both arms.The addition of carboplatin to conventional chemotherapy with EC-D in basal-like breast cancer patients did not improve the efficacy probably because they had already received an alkylating agent.These findings should be taken into consideration when developing new agents for this disease.",1,1,1,1
23038965,"[The first results of treatment for adult acute myeloid leukemia according to the AML-01.10 protocol of the Research Group of the Hematology Centers of Russia].AIM: To give the preliminary results of the AML-01.10 Russian multicenter randomized trial to treat adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the basic principle of which is to use high-dose anthracycline antibiotics in induction/consolidation.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: By December 2011, 145 patients with AML had been randomized from 18 hematology centers of 15 cities and towns of the Russian Federation; the median age of all the patients was 44 years.Seventy-one patients were analyzed in August 2011 (a 1.5-year follow-up).RESULTS: The efficiency of 2 courses 7+3 using high-dose daunorubicin (60 mg/m2 per administration) and continuous infusion of cytarabine during the second course was high and comparable with that in the use of a high-dose HAM protocol as a second induction course and can achieve a complete remission in 74.6%.The protocol toxicity evaluated from its early mortality (11.3%) and its death in complete remission (16.6%) was permissible, particularly by taking into consideration the multicenter pattern of the trial.At the completion of analysis, 53 (68.8%) out of the 77 patients on whom the data on their vital status were available were alive.In this follow-up period, the frequency of recurrences was 19.2% (10/52).Only 3 (4.2%) patients out of the 71 patients in whom the efficiency of the protocol had been completely evaluated underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.CONCLUSION: The total high dose (720 mg/m2) of anthracycline antibiotics, which is used in the period of induction and consolidation, determines the long periods of myelosuppression and intercourse intervals.Protocol deviations (no course of consolidation therapy, lower-dose idarubicin during consolidation therapy, a course of low-dose cytarabine, between the courses of induction and consolidation chemotherapy, and very long intercourse intervals) were recorded in a total of 20 (28%) patients.",0,0,0,0

22146893,"An immune-active tumor microenvironment favors clinical response to ipilimumab.PURPOSE: Ipilimumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody specific to CTLA-4, has been shown to improve overall survival in metastatic melanoma patients.As a consequence of CTLA-4 blockade, ipilimumab treatment is associated with proliferation and activation of peripheral T cells.To better understand various tumor-associated components that may influence the clinical outcome of ipilimumab treatment, gene expression profiles of tumors from patients treated with ipilimumab were characterized.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Gene expression profiling was performed on tumor biopsies collected from 45 melanoma patients before and 3 weeks after the start of treatment in a phase II clinical trial.RESULTS: Analysis of pre-treatment tumors indicated that patients with high baseline expression levels of immune-related genes were more likely to respond favorably to ipilimumab.Furthermore, ipilimumab appeared to induce two major changes in tumors from patients who exhibited clinical activity: genes involved in immune response showed increased expression, whereas expression of genes for melanoma-specific antigens and genes involved in cell proliferation decreased.These changes were associated with the total lymphocyte infiltrate in tumors, and there was a suggestion of association with prolonged overall survival in these patients.Many IFN-gamma-inducible genes and Th1-associated markers showed increased expression after ipilimumab treatment, suggesting an accumulation of this particular type of T cell at the tumor sites, which might play an important role in mediating the antitumor activity of ipilimumab.CONCLUSIONS: These results support the proposed mechanism of action of ipilimumab, suggesting that cell-mediated immune responses play an important role in the antitumor activity of ipilimumab.",0,0,0,0

29768118,"Final Overall Survival Analysis From a Study Comparing First-Line Crizotinib Versus Chemotherapy in ALK-Mutation-Positive Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.Purpose The phase III PROFILE 1014 trial compared crizotinib with chemotherapy as first-line treatment in patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) -positive advanced nonsquamous non-small-cell lung cancer.Here, we report the final overall survival (OS) results.Patients and Methods Patients were randomly assigned to receive oral crizotinib 250 mg twice daily (n = 172) or intravenous pemetrexed 500 mg/m(2) plus cisplatin 75 mg/m(2) or carboplatin (area under the concentration-time curve of 5 to 6 mg.mL/min) every 3 weeks for a maximum of six cycles (n = 171).Crossover to crizotinib was permitted after disease progression.OS was analyzed using a stratified log-rank test and a prespecified rank-preserving structural failure time model to account for crossover.Results Median follow-up duration for OS was approximately 46 months for both arms.In the chemotherapy arm, 144 patients (84.2%) received crizotinib in subsequent lines.Hazard ratio for OS was 0.760 (95% CI, 0.548 to 1.053; two-sided P = .0978).Median OS was not reached (NR) with crizotinib (95% CI, 45.8 months to NR) and 47.5 months with chemotherapy (95% CI, 32.2 months to NR).Survival probability at 4 years was 56.6% (95% CI, 48.3% to 64.1%) with crizotinib and 49.1% (95% CI, 40.5% to 57.1%) with chemotherapy.After crossover adjustment, there was an improvement in OS that favored crizotinib (hazard ratio, 0.346; 95% bootstrap CI, 0.081 to 0.718).The longest OS was observed in crizotinib-treated patients who received a subsequent ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor.No new safety signals were identified.Conclusion The final analysis of the PROFILE 1014 study provides a new benchmark for OS in patients with ALK-rearranged non-small-cell lung cancer and highlights the benefit of crizotinib for prolonging survival in this patient population.",1,1,1,1
30247967,"Effectiveness of a Self-Care Toolkit for Surgical Breast Cancer Patients in a Military Treatment Facility.OBJECTIVE: To assess whether a self-care toolkit (SCT) provided to breast cancer patients undergoing surgery could mitigate distress and lessen symptoms associated with surgery.DESIGN: One hundred women with breast cancer, planning to undergo initial surgery, were randomly assigned to either one of two groups: treatment as usual (TAU; n = 49) or TAU with the addition of an SCT (n = 51).The SCT contained an MP3 player with audio-files of guided mind-body techniques (breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, meditation, guided imagery, and self-hypnosis) and acupressure antinausea wristbands.Anxiety, pain, nausea, sleep, fatigue, global health, and quality of life (QOL) were assessed using validated outcome measures.Two inflammatory blood markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR] and C-reactive protein [CRP]) were measured serially.Data were collected at baseline (T1), immediately before surgery (T2), within 10 h postoperatively (T3), and approximately 2 weeks postsurgery (T4).SETTINGS: Numerous studies have shown that psychological distress associated with a cancer diagnosis can affect pain perception and QOL.RESULTS: Between T1 and T4, there were significant between-group differences in Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-57 scores of Pain Interference, Fatigue, and Satisfaction with Social Roles, favoring the SCT group compared with TAU (p = 0.005, p = 0.023, and p = 0.021, respectively).There was a significant mean change in Defense and Veterans Pain Rating Scale (DVPRS) scores from T2 to T3, with the SCT group having significantly smaller increases in postoperative pain (p = 0.008) and in postoperative ESR (p = 0.0197) compared with the TAU group.Clinically significant reductions in anxiety occurred in the SCT group during the main intervention period.CONCLUSION: These results suggest that using the SCT in the perioperative period decreased pain perceptions, fatigue, and inflammatory cytokine secretion.",0,0,0,0
31255586,"Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for Symptom Interference in Advanced Lung Cancer and Caregiver Distress: A Pilot Randomized Trial.CONTEXT: Advanced lung cancer patients typically have a poor prognosis and many symptoms that interfere with functioning, contributing to high rates of emotional distress in both patients and family caregivers.There remains a need for evidence-based interventions to improve functional outcomes and distress in this population.OBJECTIVES: This pilot trial examined the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of telephone-based Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) for symptomatic, advanced lung cancer patients and their distressed family caregivers.Primary outcomes were patient symptom interference with functioning and patient and caregiver distress.METHODS: Symptomatic, advanced lung cancer patients and distressed caregivers (n = 50 dyads) were randomly assigned to six sessions of ACT or an education/support condition.Patients completed measures of symptom interference and measures assessing the severity of fatigue, pain, sleep disturbance, and breathlessness.Patients and caregivers completed measures of distress and illness acceptance and struggle.RESULTS: The eligibility screening rate (51%) and retention rate (76% at six weeks postintervention) demonstrated feasibility.No group differences were found with respect to patient and caregiver outcomes.Both groups showed a small, significant decrease in struggle with the illness over the study period, but did not show meaningful change in other outcomes.CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that telephone-based ACT is feasible for many advanced lung cancer patients and caregivers, but may not substantially reduce symptom interference and distress.Low baseline levels of certain symptoms may have contributed to null findings.Next steps include applying ACT to specific, clinically meaningful symptom interference and varying intervention dose and modality.",0,0,0,0
31473189,"Accrual of older adults to cancer clinical trials led by the Canadian cancer trials group - Is trial design a barrier?BACKGROUND: Older adults (OA), aged 65years and over, are under-represented in studies.Strict exclusion criteria have been identified as a potential barrier to accrual of OA.This study aims to determine: 1) whether accrual of OA to trials led by the Canadian Cancer Trials Group (CCTG) has increased since 2003; 2) whether exclusion criteria have broadened over time; 3) whether exclusion criteria are associated with lower accrual of OA.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Phase III and randomized phase II CCTG-led trials initiated from 1990 onwards were included.Trial protocols were reviewed for exclusion criteria.Associations between trial characteristics and percentage of OA accrued were compared using multivariate linear regression modelling.The frequency of exclusion criteria in trials initiated pre- and post-2003 was compared using the Chi-Square test or Fisher exact test.RESULTS: Sixty-nine trials involving 34,957 patients were included.Accrual of OA to trials remained low compared to OA diagnosed with cancer in Canada (40.8% vs. 56.1%, p<.001).There was a small increase in the accrual of OA since 2003 (42.8% vs. 39.3%, p=.04).There was no relaxation of exclusion criteria over time.Studies initiated prior to 2003, breast cancer studies and studies with exclusion criteria based on renal dysfunction were associated with lower accrual of OA (p<.05).Central nervous system studies were associated with higher accrual of OA (p=.03).CONCLUSION: OA remain under-represented in trials.While there has been minimal change in exclusion criteria over time, renal dysfunction was the only exclusion criteria associated with lower accrual of OA.",0,0,0,0

24081946,"Randomized multicenter phase II trial comparing two schedules of etirinotecan pegol (NKTR-102) in women with recurrent platinum-resistant/refractory epithelial ovarian cancer.PURPOSE: Etirinotecan pegol (NKTR-102) is a unique, long-acting topoisomerase-I inhibitor with prolonged systemic exposure to SN38 (7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin), the active metabolite of irinotecan.This randomized phase II trial investigated two dosing schedules of etirinotecan pegol in patients with platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian carcinoma.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 71 eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive etirinotecan pegol 145 mg/m(2) every 14 or 21 days until progression or unacceptable adverse events (AEs).The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR) by RECIST (version 1.0).Secondary end points included response by Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup criteria, duration of ORR, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).RESULTS: The overall confirmed ORR was 20% (95% CI, 10% to 30%): 20% for once every 14 days, and 19% for once every 21 days.Median response duration was 4.1 months for once every 14 days and 4.0 months for once every 21 days.Median PFS for every 14 and every 21 days was 4.1 and 5.3 months, respectively, and median OS was 10.0 and 11.7 months, respectively.Etirinotecan pegol was well tolerated, with the most common grade 3 to 4 AEs being dehydration (24%) and diarrhea (23%).Diarrhea, dehydration, nausea, and neutropenia were less frequent with the schedule of once every 21 days than with that of once every 14 days.CONCLUSION: Both schedules of etirinotecan pegol showed activity in patients with heavily pretreated ovarian cancer, with encouraging ORR and PFS rates.The schedule of once every 21 days was better tolerated and had slightly longer PFS and OS rates.The treatment schedule of etirinotecan pegol 145 mg/m(2) once every 21 days was selected for the expanded phase II study and is preferred for future phase III studies.These findings provide support to directly compare etirinotecan pegol versus one of the approved drugs (eg, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or topotecan) in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.",1,1,1,1
28352657,"Randomized, placebo-controlled window trial of EGFR, Src, or combined blockade in head and neck cancer.BACKGROUND.EGFR and Src family kinases are upregulated in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).EGFR interacts with Src to activate STAT3 signaling, and dual EGFR-Src targeting is synergistic in HNSCC preclinical models.pSrc overexpression predicted resistance to the EGFR inhibitor, erlotinib, in a prior window trial.We conducted a 4-arm window trial to identify biomarkers associated with response to EGFR and/or Src inhibition.METHODS.Patients with operable stage II-IVa HNSCC were randomized to 7-21 days of neoadjuvant erlotinib, the Src inhibitor dasatinib, the combination of both, or placebo.Paired tumor specimens were collected before and after treatment.Pharmacodynamic expression of EGFR and Src pathway components was evaluated by IHC of tissue microarrays and reverse-phase protein array of tissue lysates.Candidate biomarkers were assessed for correlation with change in tumor size.RESULTS.From April 2009 to December 2012, 58 patients were randomized and 55 were treated.There was a significant decrease in tumor size in both erlotinib arms (P = 0.0014); however, no effect was seen with dasatinib alone (P = 0.24).High baseline pMAPK expression was associated with response to erlotinib (P = 0.03).High baseline pSTAT3 was associated with resistance to dasatinib (P = 0.099).CONCLUSIONS.Brief exposure to erlotinib significantly decreased tumor size in operable HNSCC, with no additive effect from dasatinib.Baseline pMAPK expression warrants further study as a response biomarker for anti-EGFR therapy.Basal expression of pSTAT3 may be independent of Src, explain therapeutic resistance, and preclude development of dasatinib in biomarker-unselected cohorts.TRIAL REGISTRATION.NCT00779389.FUNDING.National Cancer Institute, American Cancer Society, Pennsylvania Department of Health, V Foundation for Cancer Research, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Astellas Pharma.",1,1,1,1

23957945,"Initial biopsy Gleason score as a predictive marker for survival benefit in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with docetaxel: data from the TAX327 study.BACKGROUND: Since 2004, docetaxel has been the standard first-line systemic therapy for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).With abiraterone recently becoming available in the predocetaxel setting, it is warranted to identify subgroups of patients who may obtain the greatest benefit from docetaxel and particularly qualify for receiving docetaxel as first-line treatment for mCRPC.OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify factors that could characterize subgroups of patients who obtain the greatest benefit from the use of docetaxel.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: TAX327 was multinational, randomized, phase 3 study that was conducted from 2000 to 2002 in 1006 men with mCRPC.INTERVENTION: Patients were randomized to receive docetaxel every 3 wk (D3), weekly docetaxel (D1), or mitoxantrone every 3 wk (M3), each with prednisone.OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: We investigated whether patients with poorly differentiated tumors (Gleason score >/=7) at diagnosis had greater benefit from D3 compared with M3 than patients with better differentiated tumors (Gleason score </=6).Using a Cox model, we compared overall survival (OS) between the treatment groups within each subgroup of Gleason score.RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: The TAX 327 data showed that the OS benefit of D3 versus M3 was greater in patients with high-grade tumors (median OS: 18.9 vs 14.5 mo; p=0.009) than in patients with low-grade tumors (median OS: 21.6 vs 20.7 mo; p=0.674).Limitations of a retrospective analysis apply.CONCLUSIONS: The survival benefit obtained with docetaxel is most pronounced in patients with high-Gleason-score tumors (Gleason >/=7).In a time of shifting paradigms in mCRPC, with abiraterone becoming available prior to docetaxel chemotherapy, Gleason score may help in selecting patients who obtain the greatest benefit from docetaxel as first-line treatment for mCRPC.Prospective validation of these findings is warranted.",1,1,1,1

Prospective randomized comparison with ciprofloxacin.OBJECTIVE: Prostate biopsy is the standardized diagnostic method for prostate cancer.However, although there is not a standardized protocol, there are recommendations in order to reduce the incidence of complications.The objective of the present work is to assess the efficacy and safety of antibiotic prophylaxis in the prostate biopsy by comparing two antibiotic regimes: two doses of fosfomycin-trometamol 3g (FMT) every 48 hours with 10 doses of oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg every 12 hours during 5 days.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Randomized prospective study was performed with 671 patients who had undergone to walking transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy.Patients of group A (n=312) were treated with ciprofloxacin, and patients of group B (n=359) with FMT.Efficacy and tolerability of two prophylactic regimes were compared.Urine culture was carried out at 2 weeks after biopsy.Initially, patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria were not treated with antibiotics; urine culture was repeated after 1 month, persistent bacteriuria was treated according to antibiogram.RESULTS: No differences between groups were found in age (P=.78), cancer presence (P=.9) or number of biopsy cylinders (P=.93).The mean number of cores obtained was 11.3 +/- 3.25 (range 6-20).Digestive intolerance was observed for 9 patients (2.9%) of group A and 10 patients (2.8%) in group B. One patient (.3%) of group A showed severe allergic reaction.In total, 167 patients (24.6%) had complications: 16 (2.4%) fever, 47 (6.9%) hemospermia, 81 (11.9%) hematuria, 7 (1%) rectal bleeding and 16 (2.4%) urinary retention.No statistically differences between groups were observed (27.6% vs. 22.6%; P=.17).However, hemospermia was more frequent in group A (9.9% vs. 4.5%; P=.006).Bacteriuria after biopsy was detected in 44 patients (6.6%), being more frequent in group B patients (4.2% vs. 8.6%; P=.02) although a higher number of second treatment cycles were not needed (53.9% vs. 29%; P=.17).The likelihood of resistance to ciprofloxacin in patients with bacteriuria in A was greater than that of FMT in B (69.2% vs. 41.9%; P=.0004).CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic prophylaxis with FMT (2 doses of 3g) in prostate biopsy is an alternative as effective and safe as ciprofloxacin (10 doses of 500 mg), which carries lower rate of resistance.According to our experience, this drug is a safe, well-tolerated, and easily manageable prophylactic option, facilitating patient compliance.More prospective multicenter studies are necessary to confirm these findings.",0,0,0,0

23765449,"Testing the measurement equivalence of paper and interactive voice response system versions of the EORTC QLQ-C30.PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the measurement equivalence of an interactive voice response system (IVRS) version and the original paper-based version of the EORTC QLQ-C30.METHODS: The QLQ-C30 is a cancer-specific, health-related quality of life questionnaire consisting of nine multi-item scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive and social functioning, fatigue, nausea/vomiting, pain, and quality of life) and six single item measures (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial problems).This study utilized a crossover design with subjects randomly assigned to one of two assessment orders: (1) paper then IVRS or (2) IVRS then paper.Equivalence between the two administration modes was established by comparing the 95% lower confidence interval (CI) of the intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for each scale, with a critical value of 0.70.RESULTS: The ICCs for the nine multi-item scales were all above 0.79, ranging from 0.791 to 0.899 (ICC 95% lower CI range 0.726-0.865) and significantly different from our threshold reliability of 0.70.The ICCs for the six single items ranged from 0.689 to 0.896 (ICC 95% lower CI range 0.611-0.888).Two of the items, insomnia and appetite loss, were not statistically different from 0.70.When considered together, the per-protocol analysis results support the equivalence of the paper and IVRS versions of the QLQ-C30 for 13 of the 15 scores.CONCLUSION: This analysis provides evidence that the scores obtained from the IVRS version of the QLQ-C30 are equivalent to those obtained with the original paper version except for the insomnia and appetite loss items.",0,0,0,0
33295007,"Apalutamide for metastatic, castration-sensitive prostate cancer in the Japanese population: A subgroup analysis of the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 TITAN study.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of apalutamide + androgen deprivation therapy versus androgen deprivation therapy alone in Japanese patients with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer from the phase 3, randomized, global TITAN study.METHODS: Men with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer randomly (1:1) received 240 mg apalutamide + androgen deprivation therapy or matching placebo + androgen deprivation therapy.The primary efficacy endpoints were radiographic progression-free survival and overall survival.Secondary efficacy endpoints were time to cytotoxic chemotherapy, pain progression, chronic opioid use, and skeletal-related events.Safety was also assessed.RESULTS: Of the 1052 patients included in the TITAN study, 51 (4.85%) were Japanese (apalutamide group, n = 28; placebo group, n = 23).In all, 81.8% of patients in the apalutamide and 71.8% in the placebo group did not experience radiographic progression or death, and the hazard ratio for radiographic progression-free survival favored treatment with apalutamide (hazard ratio 0.712, 95% confidence interval 0.205-2.466; P = 0.59).At 24 months, 85.7% of patients in the apalutamide group and 81.5% in the placebo group were alive, and the hazard ratio for overall survival favored apalutamide (hazard ratio 0.840, 95% confidence interval 0.210-3.361; P = 0.805).In the interim analysis, the median radiographic progression-free survival and overall survival were not reached in the apalutamide group and time to cytotoxic chemotherapy was delayed following apalutamide treatment.The safety profile of apalutamide in the Japanese subpopulation was comparable with that of the global population, except for skin rash.CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present analyses suggest that apalutamide + androgen deprivation therapy in Japanese patients had favorable efficacy compared with androgen deprivation therapy alone, and these findings are comparable to those in the overall population.Apalutamide + androgen deprivation therapy can be considered as one of the therapeutic options for a broad spectrum of metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer regardless of prior treatment and disease extent in Japanese patients.",1,1,1,1
30033035,"Comparison of heart dose in early-stage left-sided breast cancers treated with intraoperative radiation therapy or whole-breast irradiation with deep inspiratory breath hold.PURPOSE: To compare heart dose between patients treated with lumpectomy and either intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) with CT-guided high-dose-rate brachytherapy (precision breast IORT [PB-IORT]) or whole-breast irradiation with deep inspiratory breath hold (WBI-DIBH) for early-stage left-sided breast cancers.METHODS AND MATERIALS: We retrospectively identified the 17 patients with left-sided breast cancers treated with PB-IORT on a phase I clinical trial and 17 patients with left-sided tumors who had undergone lumpectomy and adjuvant WBI-DIBH.Dosimetric data were obtained.T-testing was performed and biologically effective doses (BEDs) were calculated using an alpha/beta ratio of 2 Gy.RESULTS: Mean heart dose was significantly lower with WBI-DIBH compared with PB-IORT (0.61 vs. 0.87 Gy, p = 0.006).Mean heart BED was lower with WBI-DIBH (0.62 vs. 1.3 Gy2, p = 0.0001).Nominal maximum heart dose was higher with WBI-DIBH (11.37 vs. 4.81 Gy, p = 0.004).Maximum heart dose BED was similar between WBI-DIBH and IORT, 16.63 vs. 19.36 Gy (p = 0.64), respectively.No difference was found in mean left anterior descending artery dose: 2.18 Gy with WBI-DIBH and 1.89 Gy with IORT (p = 0.446).The maximum left anterior descending doses were 9.63 Gy and 3.62 Gy with WBI-DIBH and IORT, respectively (p = 0.016).Distance from the heart to the lumpectomy cavity was inversely associated with heart dose for PB-IORT, but not for WBI-IORT.CONCLUSIONS: Heart doses were low in both groups.Expected increase in cardiac risk at these doses is minimal.It is unlikely that there will be a clinically significant difference in cardiac toxicity in patients treated with WBI-DIBH or PB-IORT.Further research is needed to evaluate the actual clinical impact of the observed cardiac doses delivered with these modalities.",0,0,0,0
33825892,"MEVITEM-a phase I/II trial of vismodegib + temozolomide vs temozolomide in patients with recurrent/refractory medulloblastoma with Sonic Hedgehog pathway activation.BACKGROUND: Vismodegib specifically inhibits Sonic Hedgehog (SHH).We report results of a phase I/II evaluating vismodegib + temozolomide (TMZ) in immunohistochemically defined SHH recurrent/refractory adult medulloblastoma.METHODS: TMZ-naive patients were randomized 2:1 to receive vismodegib + TMZ (arm A) or TMZ (arm B).Patients previously treated with TMZ were enrolled in an exploratory cohort of vismodegib (arm C).If the safety run showed no excessive toxicity, a Simon's 2-stage phase II design was planned to explore the 6-month progression-free survival (PFS-6).Stage II was to proceed if arm A PFS-6 was >/=3/9 at the end of stage I. RESULTS: A total of 24 patients were included: arm A (10), arm B (5), and arm C (9).Safety analysis showed no excessive toxicity.At the end of stage I, the PFS-6 of arm A was 20% (2/10 patients, 95% unilateral lower confidence limit: 3.7%) and the study was prematurely terminated.The overall response rates (ORR) were 40% (95% CI, 12.2-73.8) and 20% (95% CI, 0.5-71.6) in arm A and B, respectively.In arm C, PFS-6 was 37.5% (95% CI, 8.8-75.5) and ORR was 22.2% (95% CI, 2.8-60.0).Among 11 patients with an expected sensitivity according to new generation sequencing (NGS), 3 had partial response (PR), 4 remained stable disease (SD) while out of 7 potentially resistant patients, 1 had PR and 1 SD.CONCLUSION: The addition of vismodegib to TMZ did not add toxicity but failed to improve PFS-6 in SHH recurrent/refractory medulloblastoma.Prediction of sensitivity to vismodegib needs further refinements.",1,1,1,1

30160789,"Multicenter randomized trial of arsenic trioxide and Realgar-Indigo naturalis formula in pediatric patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia: Interim results of the SCCLG-APL clinical study.Intravenous arsenic trioxide (ATO) has been adopted as the first-line treatment for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL).Another arsenic compound named the Realgar-Indigo naturalis formula (RIF), an oral traditional Chinese medicine containing As4 S4 , has been shown to be highly effective in treating adult APL.In the treatment of pediatric APL, the safety and efficacy of RIF remains to be confirmed.This randomized, multicenter, and noninferiority trial was conducted to determine whether intravenous ATO can be substituted by oral RIF in the treatment of pediatric APL.From September 2011 to January 2017, among 92 patients who were 16 years old or younger with newly diagnosed PML-RARa positive APL, 82 met eligible criteria and were randomly assigned to ATO (n = 42) or RIF (n = 40) group.The remaining 10 patients did not fulfilled eligible criteria because five did not accept randomization, four died and one had hemiplegia prior to arsenic randomization due to intracranial hemorrhage or cerebral thrombosis.Induction and consolidation treatment contained ATO or RIF, all-trans-retinoic acid and low intensity chemotherapy.End points included event-free survival (EFS), adverse events and hospital days.After a median 3-year follow-up, the estimated 5-year EFS was 100% in both groups, and adverse events were mild.However, patients in the RIF group had significantly less hospital stay than those in the ATO group.This interim analysis shows that oral RIF is as effective and safe as intravenous ATO for the treatment of pediatric APL, with the advantage of reducing hospital stay.Final trial analysis will reveal mature outcome data.",1,1,1,1
28409743,"PET-NECK: a multicentre randomised Phase III non-inferiority trial comparing a positron emission tomography-computerised tomography-guided watch-and-wait policy with planned neck dissection in the management of locally advanced (N2/N3) nodal metastases in patients with squamous cell head and neck cancer.BACKGROUND: Planned neck dissection (ND) after radical chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for locally advanced nodal metastases in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) remains controversial.Thirty per cent of ND specimens show histological evidence of tumour.Consequently, a significant proportion of clinicians still practise planned ND.Fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET)-computerised tomography (CT) scanning demonstrated high negative predictive values for persistent nodal disease, providing a possible alternative paradigm to ND.Evidence is sparse and drawn mainly from retrospective single-institution studies, illustrating the need for a prospective randomised controlled trial.OBJECTIVES: To determine the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of PET-CT-guided surveillance, compared with planned ND, in a multicentre, prospective, randomised setting.DESIGN: A pragmatic randomised non-inferiority trial comparing PET-CT-guided watch-and-wait policy with the current planned ND policy in HNSCC patients with locally advanced nodal metastases and treated with radical CRT.Patients were randomised in a 1 : 1 ratio.Primary outcomes were overall survival (OS) and cost-effectiveness [incremental cost per incremental quality-adjusted life-year (QALY)].Cost-effectiveness was assessed over the trial period using individual patient data, and over a lifetime horizon using a decision-analytic model.Secondary outcomes were recurrence in the neck, complication rates and quality of life.The recruitment of 560 patients was planned to detect non-inferior OS in the intervention arm with a 90% power and a type I error of 5%, with non-inferiority defined as having a hazard ratio (HR) of no higher than 1.50.An intention-to-treat analysis was performed by Cox's proportional hazards model.SETTINGS: Thirty-seven head and neck cancer-treating centres (43 NHS hospitals) throughout the UK.PARTICIPANTS: Patients with locally advanced nodal metastases of oropharynx, hypopharynx, larynx, oral or occult HNSCC receiving CRT and fit for ND were recruited.INTERVENTION: Patients randomised to planned ND before or after CRT (control), or CRT followed by fludeoxyglucose PET-CT 10-12 weeks post CRT with ND only if PET-CT showed incomplete or equivocal response of nodal disease (intervention).Balanced by centre, planned ND timing, CRT schedule, disease site and the tumour, node, metastasis stage.RESULTS: In total, 564 patients were recruited (ND arm, n = 282; and surveillance arm, n = 282; 17% N2a, 61% N2b, 18% N2c and 3% N3).Eighty-four per cent had oropharyngeal cancer.Seventy-five per cent of tested cases were p16 positive.The median time to follow-up was 36 months.The HR for OS was 0.92 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65 to 1.32], indicating non-inferiority.The upper limit of the non-inferiority HR margin of 1.50, which was informed by patient advisors to the project, lies at the 99.6 percentile of this estimate (p = 0.004).There were no differences in this result by p16 status.There were 54 NDs performed in the surveillance arm, with 22 surgical complications, and 221 NDs in the ND arm, with 85 complications.Quality-of-life scores were slightly better in the surveillance arm.Compared with planned ND, PET-CT surveillance produced an incremental net health benefit of 0.16 QALYs (95% CI 0.03 to 0.28 QALYs) over the trial period and 0.21 QALYs (95% CI -0.41 to 0.85 QALYs) over the modelled lifetime horizon.LIMITATIONS: Pragmatic randomised controlled trial with a 36-month median follow-up.CONCLUSIONS: PET-CT-guided active surveillance showed similar survival outcomes to ND but resulted in considerably fewer NDs, fewer complications and lower costs, supporting its use in routine practice.FUTURE WORK: PET-CT surveillance is cost-effective in the short term, and long-term cost-effectiveness could be addressed in future work.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN13735240.FUNDING: This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme and will be published in full in Health Technology Assessment; Vol. 21, No. 17.See the NIHR Journals Library website for further project information.",0,0,0,0
32915972,"Ibrutinib added to 10-day decitabine for older patients with AML and higher risk MDS.The treatment of older, unfit patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is challenging.Based on preclinical data of Bruton tyrosine kinase expression/phosphorylation and ibrutinib cytotoxicity in AML blasts, we conducted a randomized phase 2 multicenter study to assess the tolerability and efficacy of the addition of ibrutinib to 10-day decitabine in unfit (ie, Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Comorbidity Index >/=3) AML patients and higher risk myelodysplasia patients (HOVON135/SAKK30/15 trial).In total, 144 eligible patients were randomly (1:1) assigned to either 10-day decitabine combined with ibrutinib (560 mg; sequentially given, starting the day after the last dose of decitabine) (n = 72) or to 10-day decitabine (n = 72).The addition of ibrutinib was well tolerated, and the number of adverse events was comparable for both arms.In the decitabine plus ibrutinib arm, 41% reached complete remission/complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery (CR/CRi), the median overall survival (OS) was 11 months, and 2-year OS was 27%; these findings compared with 50% CR/CRi, median OS of 11.5 months, and 2-year OS of 21% for the decitabine group (not significant).Extensive molecular profiling at diagnosis revealed that patients with STAG2, IDH2, and ASXL1 mutations had significantly lower CR/CRi rates, whereas patients with mutations in TP53 had significantly higher CR/CRi rates.Furthermore, multicolor flow cytometry revealed that after 3 cycles of treatment, 28 (49%) of 57 patients with available bone marrow samples had no measurable residual disease.In this limited number of cases, measurable residual disease revealed no apparent impact on event-free survival and OS.In conclusion, the addition of ibrutinib does not improve the therapeutic efficacy of decitabine.This trial was registered at the Netherlands Trial Register (NL5751 [NTR6017]) and has EudraCT number 2015-002855-85.",1,1,1,1

33865797,"Limited versus Extended Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection for Prostate Cancer: A Randomized Clinical Trial.BACKGROUND: Pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) is the most reliable procedure for lymph node staging.However, the therapeutic benefit remains unproven; although most radical prostatectomies at academic centers are accompanied by PLND, there is no consensus regarding the optimal anatomical extent of PLND.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether extended PLND results in a lower biochemical recurrence rate.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a single-center randomized trial.Patients, enrolled between October 2011 and March 2017, were scheduled to undergo radical prostatectomy and PLND.Patients were assigned to limited or extended PLND by cluster randomization.Specifically, surgeons were randomized to perform limited or extended PLND for 3-mo periods.INTERVENTION: Randomization to limited (external iliac nodes) or extended (external iliac, obturator fossa and hypogastric nodes) PLND.OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The primary endpoint was the rate of biochemical recurrence.RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Of 1440 patients included in the final analysis, 700 were randomized to limited PLND and 740 to extended PLND.The median number of nodes retrieved was 12 (interquartile range [IQR] 8-17) for limited PLND and 14 (IQR 10-20) extended PLND; the corresponding rate of positive nodes was 12% and 14% (difference -1.9%, 95% confidence interval [CI] -5.4% to 1.5%; p = 0.3).With median follow-up of 3.1 yr, there was no significant difference in the rate of biochemical recurrence between the groups (hazard ratio 1.04, 95% CI 0.93-1.15; p = 0.5).Rates for grade 2 and 3 complications were similar at 7.3% for limited versus 6.4% for extended PLND; there were no grade 4 or 5 complications.CONCLUSIONS: Extended PLND did not improve freedom from biochemical recurrence over limited PLND for men with clinically localized prostate cancer.However, there were smaller than expected differences in nodal count and the rate of positive nodes between the two templates.A randomized trial comparing PLND to no node dissection is warranted.PATIENT SUMMARY: In this clinical trial we did not find a difference in the rate of biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer between limited and extended dissection of lymph nodes in the pelvis.This study is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT01407263.",1,1,1,0
32780356,"A Randomized Controlled Trial on Evaluation of Plasma Epstein-Barr Virus Biomarker for Early Diagnosis in Patients With Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma.INTRODUCTION: Early diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) remains a major problem in Southern China.Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) biomarkers have been widely used in NPC screening.This study aims to evaluate the early diagnostic performances of individual EBV biomarkers in NPC.METHODS: The levels of EBV biomarkers-IgA antibodies against EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1-IgA), EBV capsid antigen (VCA-IgA), EBV early antigen (EA-IgA), EBV BZLF1 transcription activator protein (Zta-IgA) and IgG antibodies against EBV BRLF1 transcription activator protein (Rta-IgG)-from 106 NPC patients (stage I and II) and 150 normal subjects were measured.VCA-IgA and EA-IgA were detected by immunofluorescence assay (IFA), EBNA1-IgA, Rta-IgG and Zta-IgA were measure by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and EBV DNA was detected by qPCR.Statistical analyses of a single index were conducted to evaluate the significance of NPC early diagnosis and TNM classification.RESULTS: The level of EBNA1-IgA, EBV DNA, VCA-IgA, EA-IgA, Rta-IgG and Zta-IgA in early-stage NPC was significantly higher than in healthy controls (all P < 0.001).EBNA1-IgA yielded the biggest area under the curve (AUC) of 0.962 in distinguishing early-stage NPC patients from the normal subjects, with a sensitivity of 91.5% and a specificity of 98.7%.However, EBV biomarker levels were not associated with tumor size (all P > 0.050), whereas four biomarker levels (EBNA1-IgA, EBV DNA, VCA-IgA, EA-IgA) were related to lymph node metastasis (N0 and N1-2), among which EBNA1-IgA and EBV DNA showed good performance.Finally, high correlation was found between VCA-IgA and EA-IgA (r > 0.800).CONCLUSION: A single EBNA1-IgA exhibits excellent discrimination performance in early diagnosis of NPC and could become a promising marker for NPC screening.",1,1,0,0

And the secondary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR) and overall survival (OS).RESULTS: They were randomized into gefitinib arm (n = 25) and paclitaxel/carboplatin arm (n = 26).The median PFS was 4.2 months in gefitinib arm and 8.3 months in paclitaxel/carboplatin arm (P = 0.422); ORR 36.0% in gefitinib arm and 42.3% in paclitaxel/carboplatin arm (P = 0.645); Median OS 14.4 months in gefitinib arm and 15.0 months in paclitaxel/carboplatin arm (P = 0.290).Multifactorial Cox regression analysis showed that age (P = 0.004), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutation status (P = 0.012) and subsequent treatments (platinum-based chemotherapy, P = 0.001; EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), P = 0.005) were the significant predictors of OS.CONCLUSIONS: No significant differences exist in terms of efficacy and survival between first-line gefitinib and paclitaxel/carboplatin for Chinese patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma who are non-smokers or former light smokers.And age, EGFR gene mutation status and subsequent treatments are significant predictor of OS.However, first-line gefitinib should not be recommended for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients only based on clinical factors, due to a very small sample-size in our study.",1,1,1,1
26188849,"Prevention of central venous catheter-associated bloodstream infections in paediatric oncology patients using 70% ethanol locks: A randomised controlled multi-centre trial.BACKGROUND: The prevention of central venous catheter (CVC) associated bloodstream infections (CABSIs) in paediatric oncology patients is essential.Ethanol locks can eliminate pathogens colonising CVCs and microbial resistance is rare.Aim of this study was to determine whether two hour 70% ethanol locks can reduce CABSI in paediatric oncology patients.METHODS: We conducted a randomised, double blind, multi-centre trial in paediatric oncology patients (1-18 years) with newly inserted CVCs.Patients were randomly assigned to receive two hour ethanol locks (1.5 or 3 ml 70%) or heparin locks (1.5 or 3 ml 100 IU/ml), whenever it was needed to use the CVC, maximum frequency once weekly.Primary outcomes were time to CABSI or death due to CABSI.RESULTS: We recruited 307 patients (ethanol, n=153; heparin, n=154).In the ethanol group, 16/153 (10%) patients developed a CABSI versus 29/154 (19%) in the heparin group.The incidence of CABSI was 0.77/1000 and 1.46/1000 catheter days respectively (p=0.039).The number-needed-to-treat was 13.No patients died of CABSI.In particular, Gram-positive CABSIs were reduced (ethanol, n=8; heparin, n=21; p=0.012).Fewer CVCs were removed because of CABSI in the ethanol group (p=0.077).The ethanol lock patients experienced significantly more transient symptoms compared to the heparin lock patients (maximum grade 2) (nausea, p=0.030; taste alteration, p<0.001; dizziness, p=0.001; blushing, p<0.001), no suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSAR) occurred.CONCLUSIONS: This is the first randomised controlled trial to show that ethanol locks can prevent CABSI in paediatric oncology patients, in particular CABSI caused by Gram-positive bacteria.Implementation of ethanol locks in clinical practice should be considered.",0,0,0,0
23812551,"Randomized clinical trial of arginine-supplemented enteral nutrition versus standard enteral nutrition in patients undergoing gastric cancer surgery.PURPOSE: Significant malnutrition exists in a high percentage of patients with gastric cancer.It is, therefore, crucial to establish an effective means to provide nutrition for these patients.This prospective, randomized, double-blinded clinical trial aims to assess the long-term survival of arginine-supplementation enteral nutrition versus standard enteral nutrition in malnourished patients with gastric cancer.METHODS: The control group (36 cases) received postoperative standard enteral nutrition.Meanwhile, the arginine-supplementation group (37 cases) adopted the same nutrition product but enriched with arginine (9.0 g/L).The primary study objective was overall survival (OS).Secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS); serum parameters including total protein, albumin, proalbumin, and transferrin obtained on preoperative day 1, postoperative day 2, and day 12; CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, immunoglobulin M (IgM), and immunoglobulin G (IgG) obtained on preoperative day 1 and postoperative day 7.RESULTS: No significant differences in baseline characteristics were observed between groups.The group receiving arginine-enriched nutrition had a significantly better OS (P = 0.03, 41 vs. 30.5 months) and better PFS (P = 0.02, 18 vs. 11.5 months).On postoperative day 7, CD4(+) T cells, NK cells, IgM and IgG levels of the arginine-supplemented group increased prominently and were significantly higher than those of the control group and those on preoperative day 1.There is no significant difference in the serum total protein, albumin, proalbumin, and transferrin levels between the two arms.CONCLUSIONS: Arginine-supplemented enteral nutrition significantly improves long-term survival and restores immunity in malnourished gastric cancer.",0,0,0,0
27265347,"Adjuvant chemotherapy of S-1 versus gemcitabine for resected pancreatic cancer: a phase 3, open-label, randomised, non-inferiority trial (JASPAC 01).BACKGROUND: Although adjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine is standard care for resected pancreatic cancer, S-1 has shown non-inferiority to gemcitabine for advanced disease.We aimed to investigate the non-inferiority of S-1 to gemcitabine as adjuvant chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer in terms of overall survival.METHODS: We did a randomised, open-label, multicentre, non-inferiority phase 3 trial undertaken at 33 hospitals in Japan.Patients who had histologically proven invasive ductal carcinoma of the pancreas, pathologically documented stage I-III, and no local residual or microscopic residual tumour, and were aged 20 years or older were eligible.Patients with resected pancreatic cancer were randomly assigned (in a 1:1 ratio) to receive gemcitabine (1000 mg/m(2), intravenously administered on days 1, 8, and 15, every 4 weeks [one cycle], for up to six cycles) or S-1 (40 mg, 50 mg, or 60 mg according to body-surface area, orally administered twice a day for 28 days followed by a 14 day rest, every 6 weeks [one cycle], for up to four cycles) at the data centre by a modified minimisation method, balancing residual tumour status, nodal status, and institutions.The primary outcome was overall survival in the two treatment groups, assessed in the per-protocol population, excluding ineligible patients and those not receiving the allocated treatment.The protocol prespecified that the superiority of S-1 with respect to overall survival was also to be assessed in the per-protocol population by a log-rank test, if the non-inferiority of S-1 was verified.We estimated overall and relapse-free survival using the Kaplan-Meier methods, and assessed non-inferiority of S-1 to gemcitabine using the Cox proportional hazard model.The expected hazard ratio (HR) for mortality was 0.87 with a non-inferiority margin of 1.25 (power 80%; one-sided type I error 2.5%).This trial is registered at UMIN CTR (UMIN000000655).FINDINGS: 385 patients were randomly assigned to treatment between April 11, 2007, and June 29, 2010 (193 to the gemcitabine group and 192 to the S-1 group).Of these, three were exlcuded because of ineligibility and five did not receive chemotherapy.The per-protocol population therefore consisted of 190 patients in the gemcitabine group and 187 patients in the S-1 group.On Sept 15, 2012, following the recommendation from the independent data and safety monitoring committee, this study was discontinued because the prespecified criteria for early discontinuation were met at the interim analysis for efficacy, when all the protocol treatments had been finished.Analysis with the follow-up data on Jan 15, 2016, showed HR of mortality was 0.57 (95% CI 0.44-0.72, pnon-inferiority<0.0001, p<0.0001 for superiority), associated with 5-year overall survival of 24.4% (18.6-30.8) in the gemcitabine group and 44.1% (36.9-51.1) in the S-1 group.Grade 3 or 4 leucopenia, neutropenia, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase were observed more frequently in the gemcitabine group, whereas stomatitis and diarrhoea were more frequently experienced in the S-1 group.INTERPRETATION: Adjuvant chemotherapy with S-1 can be a new standard care for resected pancreatic cancer in Japanese patients.These results should be assessed in non-Asian patients.FUNDING: Pharma Valley Center, Shizuoka Industrial Foundation, Taiho Pharmaceutical.",1,1,1,0
25800242,"Development and validation of a clinical score for predicting risk of adenoma at screening colonoscopy.BACKGROUND: Currently, no clinical tools use demographic and risk factor information to predict the risk of finding an adenoma in individuals undergoing colon cancer screening.Such a tool would be valuable for identifying those who would most benefit from screening colonoscopy.METHODS: We used baseline data from men and women who underwent screening colonoscopy from the randomized, multicenter National Colonoscopy Study (NCS) to develop and validate an adenoma risk model.The study, conducted at three sites in the United States (Minneapolis, MN; Seattle, WA; and Shreveport, LA) asked all participants to complete baseline questionnaires on clinical risk factors and family history.Model parameters estimated from logistic regression yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROCC) used to assess prediction.RESULTS: Five hundred forty-one subjects were included in the development model, and 1,334 in the validation of the risk score.Variables in the prediction of adenoma risk for colonoscopy screening were age (likelihood ratio test for overall contribution to model, P < 0.001), male sex (P < 0.001), body mass index (P < 0.001), family history of at least one first-degree relative with colorectal cancer (P = 0.036), and smoking history (P < 0.001).The adjusted AUROCC of 0.67 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.61-0.74] for the derivation cohort was not statistically significantly different from that in the validation cohort.The adjusted AUROCC for the entire cohort was 0.64 (95% CI, 0.60-0.67).CONCLUSION: We developed and validated a simple well-calibrated risk score.IMPACT: This tool may be useful for estimating risk of adenomas in screening eligible men and women.",0,0,0,0
28049139,"A randomized phase 2 study of MK-2206 versus everolimus in refractory renal cell carcinoma.Background: Activation of the phosphoinisitide-3 kinase (PI3K) pathway through mutation and constitutive upregulation has been described in renal cell carcinoma (RCC), making it an attractive target for therapeutic intervention.We performed a randomized phase II study in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy refractory patients to determine whether MK-2206, an allosteric inhibitor of AKT, was more efficacious than the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor everolimus.Patients and methods: A total of 43 patients were randomized in a 2:1 distribution, with 29 patients assigned to the MK-2206 arm and 14 to the everolimus arm.Progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary endpoint.Results: The trial was closed at the first futility analysis with an observed PFS of 3.68 months in the MK-2206 arm and 5.98 months in the everolimus arm.Dichotomous response rate profiles were seen in the MK-2206 arm with one complete response and three partial responses in the MK-2206 arm versus none in the everolimus arm.On the other hand, progressive disease was best response in 44.8% of MK2206 versus 14.3% of everolimus-treated patients.MK-2206 induced significantly more rash and pruritis than everolimus, and dose reduction occurred in 37.9% of MK-2206 versus 21.4% of everolimus-treated patients.Genomic analysis revealed that 57.1% of the patients in the PD group had either deleterious TP53 mutations or ATM mutations or deletions.In contrast, none of the patients in the non-PD group had TP53 or ATM defects.No predictive marker for response was observed in this small dataset.Conclusions: Dichotomous outcomes are observed when VEGF therapy refractory patients are treated with MK-2206, and MK-2206 does not demonstrate superiority to everolimus.Additionally, mutations in DNA repair genes are associated with early disease progression, indicating that dysregulation of DNA repair is associated with a more aggressive tumor phenotype in RCC.",1,1,1,1
29070044,"Neoadjuvant everolimus plus letrozole versus fluorouracil, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide for ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer: study protocol for a randomized pilot trial.BACKGROUND: The response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) varies by estrogen receptor (ER) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) statuses, with responses being lower in ER-positive, HER2-negative tumors as compared with ER-negative, HER2-positive or triple-negative tumors.Neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (NET) is an attractive alternative to NAC for ER-positive, HER2-negative cancer.However, a prior trial comparing NET with standard NAC in ER-positive tumor showed that the difference of response was not significant.Studies demonstrated that the mTOR inhibitor everolimus could sensitize breast tumors to endocrine therapy.A pilot open-label, randomized trial has been designed to evaluate the feasibility, efficacy and tolerability of neoadjuvant everolimus plus letrozole versus NAC in treating postmenopausal women with ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer.METHODS: Forty postmenopausal women with non-metastatic ER-positive, HER2-negative invasive breast cancer with a primary tumor > 2 cm or positive axillary lymph node(s) proved by biopsy will be randomly (1:1) enrolled from Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital to receive neoadjuvant everolimus plus letrozole for 18 weeks or fluorouracil, epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide (FEC) for six cycles before surgery.Primary outcome is the feasibility of the trial.Secondary outcome measures include ultrasound response rate, pathological complete response rate, breast-conserving surgery rate, toxicities, and changes in the percentages of peripheral blood CD4(+) T cells, CD8(+) T cells, T helper cells, regulatory T cells, and NK cells.DISCUSSION: This is the first study to determine the feasibility, efficacy and tolerability of head-to-head neoadjuvant everolimus plus letrozole versus neoadjuvant FEC in treating postmenopausal women with ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer.The trial will provide evidence to assess the feasibility of a future multicenter, randomized controlled trial, and will provide valuable clinical data of the immunoregulatory effect of everolimus in breast cancer.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov registry, ID: NCT02742051 .Registered on 7 April 2016.",1,1,1,1
26946057,"BRCA1-like profile predicts benefit of tandem high dose epirubicin-cyclophospamide-thiotepa in high risk breast cancer patients randomized in the WSG-AM01 trial.BRCA1 is an important protein in the repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), which are induced by alkylating chemotherapy.A BRCA1-like DNA copy number signature derived from tumors with a BRCA1 mutation is indicative for impaired BRCA1 function and associated with good outcome after high dose (HD) and tandem HD DSB inducing chemotherapy.We investigated whether BRCA1-like status was a predictive biomarker in the WSG AM 01 trial.WSG AM 01 randomized high-risk breast cancer patients to induction (2x epirubicin-cyclophosphamide) followed by tandem HD chemotherapy with epirubicin, cyclophosphamide and thiotepa versus dose dense chemotherapy (4x epirubicin-cyclophospamide followed by 3x cyclophosphamide-methotrexate-5-fluorouracil).We generated copy number profiles for 143 tumors and classified them as being BRCA1-like or non-BRCA1-like.Twenty-six out of 143 patients were BRCA1-like.BRCA1-like status was associated with high grade and triple negative tumors.With regard to event-free-survival, the primary endpoint of the trial, patients with a BRCA1-like tumor had a hazard rate of 0.2, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.07-0.63, p = 0.006.In the interaction analysis, the combination of BRCA1-like status and HD chemotherapy had a hazard rate of 0.19, 95% CI: 0.067-0.54, p = 0.003.Similar results were observed for overall survival.These findings suggest that BRCA1-like status is a predictor for benefit of tandem HD chemotherapy with epirubicin-thiotepa-cyclophosphamide.",1,1,1,1

32005202,"Integrated cervical cancer screening in Mayuge District Uganda (ASPIRE Mayuge): a pragmatic sequential cluster randomized trial protocol.BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is almost entirely preventable through vaccination and screening, yet remains one of the 'gravest threats to women's lives' according to the World Health Organization.Specific high-risk subtypes of human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) are well-established as the primary cause of cervical cancer.Uganda has one of the highest cervical cancer incidence rates in the world (54.8 per 100,000) as a result of limited screening access and infrastructure.The integration of a self-collected cervical cancer screening program using HPV testing within existing community-based primary health care services could increase access to screening and reduce cervical cancer rates among Ugandan women.METHODS: Using a pragmatic, sequential, cluster randomized trial design; we will compare the effectiveness of two cervical cancer screening models for self-collected HPV testing: 1) community health worker recruitment (door-to-door); and 2) community health meetings.In Mayuge district, Uganda, 31 villages are randomized to one of two treatment arms.Due to the nature of this trial, blinding is not possible.Women are eligible to participate if they have no previous history of hysterectomy or treatment for cervical cancer or pre-cancer and are aged 25-49 years old.All participants receive an integrated package of cervical cancer screening and education.Samples are tested for HPV using GeneXpert point of care testing.All women who test positive for HR-HPV types are referred to a designated health centre for follow-up inspection by Visual Inspection with Acetic acid (VIA) and treatment with thermal ablation.The primary outcome for the trial is the number of women who attend follow-up for VIA screening at a designated Health Centre after a positive HR-HPV test out of all women screened per arm.Secondary outcomes include: cervical cancer screening knowledge; patient-reported experience measures for self-collected cervical cancer screening; and HPV incidence.DISCUSSION: Results from this study will inform the national scale-up of cervical cancer screening in Uganda, aligning with the World Health Organization's target of achieving cervical cancer elimination through the pillar of increased HPV screening coverage.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN, ISRCTN12767014.Registered 14 May 2019, https://doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN12767014; clinicaltrials.gov, NCT04000503; Registered 27 June 2019, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04000503 PROTOCOL VERSION: January 8, 2020, version 1.",0,0,0,0
23650416,"Randomized phase II, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of exemestane with or without entinostat in postmenopausal women with locally recurrent or metastatic estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer progressing on treatment with a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor.PURPOSE: Entinostat is an oral isoform selective histone deacetylase inhibitor that targets resistance to hormonal therapies in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer.This randomized, placebo-controlled, phase II study evaluated entinostat combined with the aromatase inhibitor exemestane versus exemestane alone.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Postmenopausal women with ER+ advanced breast cancer progressing on a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor were randomly assigned to exemestane 25 mg daily plus entinostat 5 mg once per week (EE) or exemestane plus placebo (EP).The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS).Blood was collected in a subset of patients for evaluation of protein lysine acetylation as a biomarker of entinostat activity.RESULTS: One hundred thirty patients were randomly assigned (EE group, n = 64; EP group, n = 66).Based on intent-to-treat analysis, treatment with EE improved median PFS to 4.3 months versus 2.3 months with EP (hazard ratio [HR], 0.73; 95% CI, 0.50 to 1.07; one-sided P = .055; two-sided P = .11 [predefined significance level of .10, one-sided]).Median overall survival was an exploratory end point and improved to 28.1 months with EE versus 19.8 months with EP (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.97; P = .036).Fatigue and neutropenia were the most frequent grade 3/4 toxicities.Treatment discontinuation because of adverse events was higher in the EE group versus the EP group (11% v 2%).Protein lysine hyperacetylation in the EE biomarker subset was associated with prolonged PFS.CONCLUSION: Entinostat added to exemestane is generally well tolerated and demonstrated activity in patients with ER+ advanced breast cancer in this signal-finding phase II study.Acetylation changes may provide an opportunity to maximize clinical benefit with entinostat.Plans for a confirmatory study are underway.",1,1,1,1
23233657,"High cereblon expression is associated with better survival in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma treated with thalidomide maintenance.Recently, cereblon (CRBN) expression was found to be essential for the activity of thalidomide and lenalidomide.In the present study, we investigated whether the clinical efficacy of thalidomide in multiple myeloma is associated with CRBN expression in myeloma cells.Patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma were included in the HOVON-65/GMMG-HD4 trial, in which postintensification treatment in 1 arm consisted of daily thalidomide (50 mg) for 2 years.Gene-expression profiling, determined at the start of the trial, was available for 96 patients who started thalidomide maintenance.In this patient set, increase of CRBN gene expression was significantly associated with longerprogression-free survival (P = .005).In contrast, no association between CRBN expression and survival was observed in the arm with bortezomib maintenance.We conclude that CRBN expression may be associated with the clinical efficacy of thalidomide.This trial has been registered at the Nederlands Trial Register (www.trialregister.nl) as NTR213; at the European Union Drug Regulating Authorities Clinical Trials (EudraCT) as 2004-000944-26; and at the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) as 64455289.",1,1,1,1

31063024,"Symptom Assessment in Patients with Advanced Cancer: Are the Most Severe Symptoms the Most Bothersome?Objective: We investigated correspondence between symptom severity and symptom bothersomeness in patients with advanced cancer.Background: Symptom severity is commonly assessed in clinical cancer settings, but bothersomeness of these symptoms is less often measured.Methods: Participants with advanced cancer enrolled in a cluster-randomized trial of early palliative care completed the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS) and the quality of life at the end of life (QUAL-E) measure as part of their baseline assessment.For each symptom, we examined the correspondence between the symptom being indicated as most severe on the ESAS and rated as most bothersome on the QUAL-E. Results: For the 386 patients who completed relevant sections of the ESAS and QUAL-E, tiredness (32.8%), sleep (23.8%), and appetite (20.2%) were most frequently rated as most severe, whereas pain (28.9%) and tiredness (24.3%) were most frequently indicated as most bothersome.The most bothersome and most severe symptom corresponded in 42%.Pain and/or tiredness were consistently among the top three most bothersome symptoms, whereas appetite was frequently rated the most severe symptom but was rarely perceived as the most bothersome.The probability that patients rating a symptom as most severe would also rate it as most bothersome was highest for pain (66%), nausea (58%), and tiredness (40%).Discussion: ESAS symptom severity does not necessarily indicate patients' most bothersome symptom; regardless of severity, pain and tiredness are most frequently perceived as most bothersome.Further research should investigate the clinical benefits of patients also indicating their three most bothersome ESAS symptoms.",0,0,0,0

29332135,"Sequential versus simultaneous use of chemotherapy and gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) among estrogen receptor (ER)-positive premenopausal breast cancer patients: effects on ovarian function, disease-free survival, and overall survival.OBJECTIVE: To investigate ovarian function and therapeutic efficacy among estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, premenopausal breast cancer patients treated with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) and chemotherapy simultaneously or sequentially.METHOD: This study was a phase 3, open-label, parallel, randomized controlled trial (NCT01712893).Two hundred sixteen premenopausal patients (under 45 years) diagnosed with invasive ER-positive breast cancer were enrolled from July 2009 to May 2013 and randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy combined with sequential or simultaneous GnRHa treatment.All patients were advised to receive GnRHa for at least 2 years.The primary outcome was the incidence of early menopause, defined as amenorrhea lasting longer than 12 months after the last chemotherapy or GnRHa dose, with postmenopausal or unknown follicle-stimulating hormone and estradiol levels.The menstrual resumption period and survivals were the secondary endpoints.RESULT: The median follow-up time was 56.9 months (IQR 49.5-72.4 months).One hundred and eight patients were enrolled in each group.Among them, 92 and 78 patients had complete primary endpoint data in the sequential and simultaneous groups, respectively.The rates of early menopause were 22.8% (21/92) in the sequential group and 23.1% (18/78) in the simultaneous group [simultaneous vs. sequential: OR 1.01 (95% CI 0.50-2.08); p = 0.969; age-adjusted OR 1.13; (95% CI 0.54-2.37); p = 0.737].The median menstruation resumption period was 12.0 (95% CI 9.3-14.7) months and 10.3 (95% CI 8.2-12.4) months for the sequential and simultaneous groups, respectively [HR 0.83 (95% CI 0.59-1.16); p = 0.274; age-adjusted HR 0.90 (95%CI 0.64-1.27); p = 0.567].No significant differences were evident for disease-free survival (p = 0.290) or overall survival (p = 0.514) between the two groups.CONCLUSION: For ER-positive premenopausal patients, the sequential use of GnRHa and chemotherapy showed ovarian preservation and survival outcomes that were no worse than simultaneous use.The application of GnRHa can probably be delayed until menstruation resumption after chemotherapy.",1,1,1,1
28958502,"Dacomitinib versus gefitinib as first-line treatment for patients with EGFR-mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (ARCHER 1050): a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Dacomitinib is a second-generation, irreversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor.We compared its efficacy and safety with that of the reversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib in the first-line treatment of patients with advanced EGFR-mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).METHODS: In this international, multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3 study (ARCHER 1050), we enrolled adults (aged >/=18 years or >/=20 years in Japan and South Korea) with newly diagnosed advanced NSCLC and one EGFR mutation (exon 19 deletion or Leu858Arg) at 71 academic medical centres and university hospitals in seven countries or special administrative regions.We randomly assigned participants (1:1) to receive oral dacomitinib 45 mg/day (in 28-day cycles) or oral gefitinib 250 mg/day (in 28-day cycles) until disease progression or another discontinuation criterion was met.Randomisation, stratified by race and EGFR mutation type, was done with a computer-generated random code assigned by a central interactive web response system.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival assessed by masked independent review in the intention-to-treat population.Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01774721, and is ongoing but no longer recruiting patients.FINDINGS: Between May 9, 2013, and March 20, 2015, 452 eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive dacomitinib (n=227) or gefitinib (n=225).Median duration of follow-up for progression-free survival was 22.1 months (95% CI 20.3-23.9).Median progression-free survival according to masked independent review was 14.7 months (95% CI 11.1-16.6) in the dacomitinib group and 9.2 months (9.1-11.0) in the gefitinib group (hazard ratio 0.59, 95% CI 0.47-0.74; p<0.0001).The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were dermatitis acneiform (31 [14%] of 227 patients given dacomitinib vs none of 224 patients given gefitinib), diarrhoea (19 [8%] vs two [1%]), and raised alanine aminotransferase levels (two [1%] vs 19 [8%]).Treatment-related serious adverse events were reported in 21 (9%) patients given dacomitinib and in ten (4%) patients given gefitinib.Two treatment-related deaths occurred in the dacomitinib group (one related to untreated diarrhoea and one to untreated cholelithases/liver disease) and one in the gefitinib group (related to sigmoid colon diverticulitis/rupture complicated by pneumonia).INTERPRETATION: Dacomitinib significantly improved progression-free survival over gefitinib in first-line treatment of patients with EGFR-mutation-positive NSCLC and should be considered as a new treatment option for this population.FUNDING: SFJ Pharmaceuticals Group and Pfizer.",1,1,1,1
29915914,"Regular aspirin use and gene expression profiles in prostate cancer patients.PURPOSE: Pharmacoepidemiology studies suggest prognostic benefits of aspirin in prostate cancer.We hypothesized that aspirin induces transcriptional changes in tumors or normal prostate tissue.METHODS: We analyzed the prostatic transcriptome from men diagnosed with prostate cancer during follow-up of the Physicians' Health Study 1 (PHS, n = 149), initially a randomized controlled trial of aspirin.Aspirin target genes were identified through systematic literature review and a drug target database.We compared target gene expression according to regular aspirin use at cancer diagnosis and used whole-transcriptome gene set enrichment analysis to identify gene sets associated with aspirin use.Results were validated in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS, n = 254) and in Connectivity Map.RESULTS: Of 12 target genes identified from prior studies and 540 genes from the drug target database, none were associated with aspirin use.Twenty-one gene sets were enriched in tumor tissue of aspirin users, 18 of which were clustered around ribosome function and translation.These gene sets were associated with exposure to cyclooxygenase inhibitors in Connectivity Map.Their association with cancer prognosis was U-shaped in both cohorts.No gene sets were enriched in normal tissue.In HPFS, neither the target genes nor the gene sets were associated with aspirin use.CONCLUSIONS: Regular aspirin use may affect ribosome function in prostate tumors.Other putative target genes had similar expression in tumors from aspirin users and non-users.If results are corroborated by experimental studies, a potential benefit of aspirin may be limited to a subset of prostate cancer patients.",0,0,0,0
32975708,"Randomized phase II clinical trial and biomarker analysis of paclitaxel plus epirubicin versus vinorelbine plus epirubicin as neoadjuvant chemotherapy in locally advanced HER2-negative breast cancer with TEKT4 variations.PURPOSE: Resistance to paclitaxel remains a major challenge in treating breast cancer.Our preclinical study suggested that TEKT4 germline variations in breast cancer are associated with paclitaxel resistance and increase vinorelbine sensitivity.This clinical trial compared the efficacy of paclitaxel and vinorelbine in breast cancer neoadjuvant chemotherapy.METHODS: In this open-label, single-center, phase II trial, female patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, stage IIB-IIIC breast cancer harboring TEKT4 germline variations were randomly assigned to the paclitaxel plus epirubicin (PE) or vinorelbine plus epirubicin (NE).The primary endpoint was the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate, and the secondary endpoints were the objective response rate (ORR) and safety.Targeted sequencing of a panel comprising 484 breast-related genes was performed to identify pCR-associated somatic mutations in each group.RESULTS: 91 Patients were assigned to PE (46 patients) or NE (45 patients).NE numerically increased the pCR rate (22.2% versus 8.7%, P = 0.074).The ORRs for NE and PE were 82.2% and 76.1%, respectively.Interestingly, NE (15.4%) showed a significantly higher pCR rate than PE (0%) in the hormone receptor (HR)-positive subgroup (P = 0.044).Both regimens were well tolerated, with grade 3 and 4 toxicities reported at the expected levels.The biomarker analysis showed that UNC13D mutation predicted the pCR rate in NE (P = 0.011).CONCLUSIONS: Although the primary endpoint was not met, NE might bring clinical benefit to HR-positive patients or patients simultaneously carrying UNC13D mutations.",1,1,1,1
24013569,"Prescription and adherence to lymphedema self-care modalities among women with breast cancer-related lymphedema.PURPOSE: To profile the prescription for and adherence to breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) self-care modalities among breast cancer (BrCa) survivors with BCRL in a 12-month randomized weightlifting trial.METHODS: We developed a questionnaire that assessed prescription for and adherence to 10 BCRL self-care modalities that included physical therapy exercise, pneumatic compression pump, medication, lymphedema bandaging, arm elevation, self-administered lymphatic drainage, therapist-administered lymphatic drainage, compression garments, skin care, and taping.We measured prescription for and adherence to BCRL self-care modalities at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months.Longitudinal logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) associated with prescription for and adherence to BCRL modalities over time.RESULTS: This study included 141 BrCa survivors with BCRL.Women were prescribed an average of 3.6 +/- 2.1 BCRL self-care modalities during the study.The prescription for therapist-administered lymphatic drainage (OR = 0.92, 95 % CI 0.88-0.96), pneumatic compression pump use (OR = 0.94, 95 % CI 0.89-0.98), and bandaging (OR = 0.96, 95 % CI 0.93-0.99) decreased over 12 months of follow-up.No other prescribed BCRL self-care modalities changed during the study.Over 12 months, the average adherence to all BCRL self-care modalities varied with 13, 24, 32, and 31 % of women reporting <25, 25-49, 50-74, and >/=75 % adherence, respectively.Over 12 months, there was a noticeable change from high to low adherence in self-administered lymphatic drainage, such that there was a 15 % increased likelihood of adherence <25 % compared to >/=75 % (OR = 1.15 (95 % CI 1.05-1.26); p = 0.002).The adherence patterns of all other modalities did not change over follow-up.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest the prescription for BCRL self-care modalities is variable.The average adherence to BCRL self-care was non-optimal.Future research is necessary to prepare BrCa survivors with the knowledge, skills, abilities, and resources necessary to care for this lifelong condition.",0,0,0,0
34487222,"Short-term fasting in glioma patients: analysis of diet diaries and metabolic parameters of the ERGO2 trial.PURPOSE: The prospective, randomized ERGO2 trial investigated the effect of calorie-restricted ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting (KD-IF) on re-irradiation for recurrent brain tumors.The study did not meet its primary endpoint of improved progression-free survival in comparison to standard diet (SD).We here report the results of the quality of life/neurocognition and a detailed analysis of the diet diaries.METHODS: 50 patients were randomized 1:1 to re-irradiation combined with either SD or KD-IF.The KD-IF schedule included 3 days of ketogenic diet (KD: 21-23 kcal/kg/d, carbohydrate intake limited to 50 g/d), followed by 3 days of fasting and again 3 days of KD.Follow-up included examination of cognition, quality of life and serum samples.RESULTS: The 20 patients who completed KD-IF met the prespecified goals for calorie and carbohydrate restriction.Substantial decreases in leptin and insulin and an increase in uric acid were observed.The SD group, of note, had a lower calorie intake than expected (21 kcal/kg/d instead of 30 kcal/kg/d).Neither quality of life nor cognition were affected by the diet.Low glucose emerged as a significant prognostic parameter in a best responder analysis.CONCLUSION: The strict caloric goals of the ERGO2 trial were tolerated well by patients with recurrent brain cancer.The short diet schedule led to significant metabolic changes with low glucose emerging as a candidate marker of better prognosis.The unexpected lower calorie intake of the control group complicates the interpretation of the results.Clinicaltrials.gov number: NCT01754350; Registration: 21.12.2012.",1,1,1,1

31501084,"Regression Discontinuity Analysis of Salvage Radiotherapy in Prostate Cancer.There is a lack of randomized evidence comparing early (eSRT) to late (lSRT) salvage radiotherapy (SRT) after radical prostatectomy (RP) for prostate cancer (PCa).Moreover, the existing evidence is often affected by lead-time bias.We sought to address this gap in a cohort of 1458 PCa patients undergoing SRT for biochemical recurrence (BCR) after RP in two tertiary care centers between 1992 and 2013.Using a quasi-randomized study design known as regression discontinuity (RD) and adjusting for lead-time bias, we compared metastasis-free survival (MFS) at 5 and 10years after surgery between eSRT (prostate-specific antigen [PSA] <0.5ng/ml) and lSRT (PSA>/=0.5ng/ml).Overall, 1049 patients (71.9%) underwent eSRT and 409 (28.1%) lSRT at a mean follow-up of 84 mo (interquartile range (IQR) 52-120.4).The MFS rate decreased nonsignificantly at the proposed cutoff by 0.04 (95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.06 to 0.19) at 5years and by 0.07 (95% CI:-0.12 to 0.32) at 10years.Cox regression analysis revealed a hazard ratio for the cutoff examined of 1.3 (95% CI: 0.8-2.4; p=0.2).In conclusion, in a quasirandomized study design accounting for lead-time bias, eSRT (PSA<0.5ng/ml) did not improve MFS.Our results underline the need for level-one evidence to compare eSRT and lSRT.PATIENT SUMMARY: We compared early versus late salvage radiotherapy (SRT) for biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy by simulating a randomized trial.We found that early SRT (initiated at prostate-specific antigen <0.5ng/ml) compared to late SRT did not improve metastasis-free survival.",0,0,0,0
30479292,"Assessing the Psychological Impact of Daily Bowel Preparation on Prostate Patients Who Receive Radiation Therapy.PURPOSE: Evidence has shown that the prostate moves depending on filling of the rectum and, to a lesser extent, the bladder; many radiation therapy departments have adopted standardized bladder filling/rectal emptying protocols for radiotherapy treatment.Daily treatments may be delayed until appropriate volumes are attained; the resultant psychological impact of these delays on patients is unknown.The purpose of this study was to determine levels of anxiety, depression, distress, and bother related to bowel preparation for prostate cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy treatment.METHODS: A prospective cohort analysis of prostate cancer patients undergoing external beam radiation therapy was completed.Patients were assigned to one of three groups; Group A was standard of care, Group B was standard of care plus increased educational information regarding bowel preparation, Group C was standard of care plus increased educational information regarding bowel preparation plus an anti-flatulent medication.Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Distress Thermometer, and a Bowel Status Bother survey were completed by participants at the start of theircourse of radiation treatment, mid-way through, and at the end.Analysis of variance testing was completed to determine differences in mean scores between the three groups.RESULTS: Mean age of patients (N = 30) was 66 years; 50% of the participants had a university education; 80% were married.Anxiety levels decreased over time in all groups (P = .039) with no difference between groups (P = 0.447).Depression levels across time for each group remained low (P = .577).Overall distress levels associated with bowel preparation were low among each group, and no significant differences were reported (P = .978).All groups reported high rates of quality of life.CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study indicate that collectively across three groups and over time, there were low levels of anxiety, depression, and distress from bowel preparation.Amount, timing, quality, and approach to educational information are important factors to ensure patients feel prepared for their radiation therapy treatments.",0,0,0,0
23924790,"Evaluation of ipilimumab in combination with allogeneic pancreatic tumor cells transfected with a GM-CSF gene in previously treated pancreatic cancer.Preclinical reports support the concept of synergy between cancer vaccines and immune checkpoint blockade in nonimmunogenic tumors.In particular, cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) antibodies have been successfully combined with GM-CSF cell-based vaccines (GVAX).Ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4) has been tested as a single agent in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) resulting in a delayed response at a dose of 3 mg/kg.Our study evaluated ipilimumab 10 mg/kg (arm 1) and ipilimumab 10 mg/kg + GVAX (arm 2).A total of 30 patients with previously treated advanced PDA were randomized (1:1).Induction doses were administered every 3 weeks for a total of 4 doses followed by maintenance dosing every 12 weeks.Two patients in arm 1 showed evidence of stable disease (7 and 22 wk) but none demonstrated CA19-9 biochemical responses.In contrast, 3 patients in arm 2 had evidence of prolonged disease stabilization (31, 71, and 81 wk) and 7 patients experienced CA19-9 declines.In 2 of these patients, disease stabilization occurred after an initial period of progression.The median overall survival (OS) (3.6 vs. 5.7 mo, hazards ratio: 0.51, P = 0.072) and 1 year OS (7 vs. 27%) favored arm 2.Similar to prior ipilimumab studies, 20% of patients in each arm had grade 3/4 immune-related adverse events.Among patients with OS > 4.3 months, there was an increase in the peak mesothelin-specific T cells (P = 0.014) and enhancement of the T-cell repertoire (P = 0.031).In conclusion, checkpoint blockade in combination with GVAX has the potential for clinical benefit and should be evaluated in a larger study.",0,0,0,0
28209746,"A Phase II Randomized Trial (GO27827) of First-Line FOLFOX Plus Bevacizumab with or Without the MET Inhibitor Onartuzumab in Patients with Metastatic Colorectal Cancer.BACKGROUND: Dysregulated hepatocyte growth factor/mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) signaling is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to vascular endothelial growth factor inhibition in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).We report outcomes from a double-blind, multicenter phase II trial of the MET inhibitor onartuzumab in combination with mFOLFOX-6 and bevacizumab for mCRC (GO27827; NCT01418222).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive onartuzumab (10 mg/kg intravenously [IV]) or placebo plus mFOLFOX-6 and bevacizumab (5 mg/kg IV).Oxaliplatin was given for 8-12 cycles; other agents were continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or death.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) in the intent-to-treat (ITT) and MET immunohistochemistry (IHC) expression-positive populations.RESULTS: Between September 2011 and November 2012, 194 patients were enrolled.In September 2013, an interim analysis recommended stopping onartuzumab treatment due to lack of efficacy.At the time of the final analysis in February 2014, no significant improvement in PFS was seen with onartuzumab versus placebo in either the ITT or MET IHC-positive populations.An improvement in PFS was noted in the MET IHC-negative population.Neither overall survival nor response rate was improved with onartuzumab.The incidence of fatigue, peripheral edema, and deep vein thrombosis was increased with onartuzumab relative to placebo.CONCLUSION: Onartuzumab combined with mFOLFOX-6 and bevacizumab did not significantly improve efficacy outcomes in either the ITT or MET IHC-positive populations.MET expression by IHC was not a predictive biomarker in this setting.The Oncologist 2017;22:264-271 IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The addition of onartuzumab to mFOLFOX-6 plus bevacizumab did not improve outcomes in patients with previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer in this randomized, phase II study.Although initial results with onartuzumab were promising, a number of phase II/III clinical trials have reported a lack of improvement in efficacy with onartuzumab combined with standard-of-care therapies in several tumor types.Furthermore, negative study data have been published for rilotumumab and ficlatuzumab, both of which block hepatocyte growth factor binding to the mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) receptor.MET immunohistochemistry was not a predictive biomarker.It remains to be seen if other biomarkers or small molecule inhibitors may be more appropriate for inhibiting this oncogenic pathway.",1,1,1,1
31714584,"The economic research of arsenic trioxide for the treatment of newly diagnosed acute promyelocytic leukemia in China.BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to conduct the first systematic evaluation of the long-term economic impact of arsenic trioxide (ATO) plus all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) from the perspective of the Chinese health care system.METHODS: On the basis of clinical data from a randomized phase 3 trial, a time-dependent Markov model with 4 health states (complete remission, relapse or treatment failure, post-treatment failure, and death) was used to evaluate the incremental costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained from the ATO plus ATRA regimen compared with the ATRA plus chemotherapy (CT) regimen over a 30-year period.All costs were adjusted to 2018 levels based on the Chinese Consumer Price Index.Both costs and health outcomes were discounted by 3% annually.One-way sensitivity analysis and probability sensitivity analysis were performed.RESULTS: Compared with the ATRA plus CT strategy, the ATO plus ATRA strategy was associated with 1.38 additional QALYs gained and $392.05 (estimated in 2018 US dollars) in incremental costs per patient over 30 years.Consequently, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $284.02 per QALY gained, which was far below the Chinese willingness-to-pay threshold of $29,306 per QALY gained.Sensitivity analyses demonstrated the robustness of these results.CONCLUSIONS: From the perspective of the Chinese health care system, the ATO plus ATRA strategy is cost-effective for patients with newly diagnosed APL compared with the ATRA plus CT strategy.Therefore, the authors strongly suggest that China's health authorities choose the former strategy for these patients, whether for the elderly or for young people.",0,0,0,0
32868525,"Optimal Criteria for G3 (Poorly Differentiated) Stage II Colon Cancer: Prospective Validation in a Randomized Controlled Study (SACURA Trial).Grade 3 (G3, poorly differentiated) is an important treatment-decision factor in stage II colon cancer, but no unified diagnostic criteria are established.According to previous studies, an intratumoural poorly differentiated area with no glandular formation (POR) that fills the microscopic field of a x40 objective lens was an essential factor that defined G3.We aimed to prospectively validate this in a randomized controlled study of adjuvant chemotherapy (SACURA trial).We enrolled 991 patients with stage II colon cancer.POR was graded according to the x40 objective lens rule and the intensity of poorly differentiated clusters (Grade), and its prognostic power was compared with that of the conventional tumor grade on the basis of predominant histology rule (Grade).According to Grade, 313, 526, and 152 tumors were classified as G1, G2, and G3, respectively, and the 5-year relapse-free survival (RFS) rates were 91.1%, 82.9%, and 74.7%, respectively (P<0.0001).When G3 and G3 were alternatively added to the prognostic model consisting of 8 conventional factors, only G3 was a significant factor for RFS (P=0.040, Wald test).The adverse impact of G3 on RFS was greater in the microsatellite stable/microsatellite instability-low subset than that in the full analysis set.In the microsatellite stable/microsatellite instability-low subset, the 5-year RFS rate of patients with G3 tumors in the chemotherapy group achieved greater improvement (9.1%) than the surgery-alone group.The least differentiation policy with the x40 objective lens rule may be highlighted as the diagnostic criterion for G3 because of its validated prognostic value.",0,0,0,0
23234763,"Adjuvant lapatinib for women with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer: a randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Worldwide, many patients with HER2-positive early stage breast cancer do not receive trastuzumab-the standard adjuvant treatment.We investigated the efficacy and safety of adjuvant lapatinib for patients with trastuzumab-naive HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer, started at any time after diagnosis.METHODS: This study was a placebo-controlled, multicentre, randomised phase 3 trial.Women outpatients from 405 [corrected] centres in 33 countries [corrected] with HER2-positive early-breast cancer who had previously received adjuvant chemotherapy but not trastuzumab were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive daily lapatinib (1500 mg) or daily placebo for 12 months.Randomisation was done with a computer-generated sequence, stratified by time since diagnosis, lymph node involvement at diagnosis, and tumour hormone-receptor status.Investigators, site staff, and patients were masked to treatment assignment.The primary endpoint was disease-free survival in the intention-to-treat population.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00374322.FINDINGS: Between August, 2006, and May, 2008, 3161 women were enrolled and 3147 were assigned to lapatinib (n=1571) or placebo (n=1576).After a median follow-up of 47.4 months (range 0.4-60.0) in the lapatinib group and 48.3 (0.7-61.3) in the placebo group, 210 (13%) disease-free survival events had occurred in the lapatinib group versus 264 (17%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.83, 95% CI 0.70-1.00; p=0.053).Central review of HER2 status showed that only 2490 (79%) of the randomised women were HER2-positive.157 (13%) of 1230 confirmed HER2-positive patients in the lapatinib group and in 208 (17%) of 1260 in the placebo group had a disease-free survival event (HR 0.82, 95% 0.67-1.00; p=0.04).Serious adverse events occurred in 99 (6%) of 1573 patients taking lapatinib and 77 (5%) of 1574 patients taking placebo, with higher incidences of grade 3-4 diarrhoea (97 [6%] vs nine [<1%]), rash (72 [5%] vs three [<1%]), and hepatobiliary disorders (36 [2%] vs one [<1%]).INTERPRETATION: Our data show that there was no significant difference in disease-free survival between groups when analysed in the intention-to-treat population.However, exploratory analyses restricted to patients who had HER2-positive disease confirmed by central fluorescence in-situ hybridisation review suggested marginal benefit with lapatinib in terms of disease-free survival.Thus lapatinib might be an option for women with HER2-positive breast cancer who do not or cannot receive adjuvant trastuzumab.FUNDING: GlaxoSmithKline.",1,1,1,1
31848678,"Comparison of Common Surgical Procedures in Non-complicated Pilonidal Sinus Disease, a 7-Year Follow-Up Trial.BACKGROUND: Pilonidal disease is a common problem in primary health care which may require immediate surgical referral.Although various management options have been proposed, so far there is no gold standard treatment.The aim of the present study was to determine which of the following techniques was superior as regards postoperative complications and recurrence, midline unshifted adipofascial turn-over flap, midline shifted adipofascial turn-over flap or Karydakis flap.METHODS: A randomized clinical trial was conducted in the Department of General Surgery.Patients with non-complicated pilonidal sinus were enrolled in the study from April 2009 to January 2012.All patients were randomized the day of surgery at the coordinating center by means of a computer program.Patients were randomized to receive midline unshifted adipofascial turn-over flap, midline shifted adipofascial turn-over flap or Karydakis flap.All procedures were performed under local anesthesia and patients were discharged 6 h after surgery.Demographic characteristics, skin color, body hair type, family history, preoperative complaints and duration of symptoms, cyst size, intraoperative iatrogenic cyst rupture, the presence of a tuft of hairs in the cyst, surgical techniques, duration of drainage, length of hospital stay, postoperative complications and recurrence were evaluated.RESULTS: One hundred and ninety-two patients with non-complicated pilonidal sinus were enrolled.Seventy-two patients were randomized to midline unshifted adipofascial turn-over flap, 67 patients to midline shifted adipofascial turn-over flap and 53 patients to Karydakis flap.The mean age was 25.66 +/- 7.67 years.At 76-month follow-up, the overall complications and recurrence rates were not significantly different between groups (p > 0.05).CONCLUSION: In cases of non-complicated pilonidal sinus, we recommend surgical management using local anesthesia, outpatient surgery and the surgical approach with which the surgeon is most familiar.",0,0,0,0
33621350,"Three-dimensional multipath DenseNet for improving automatic segmentation of glioblastoma on pre-operative multimodal MR images.PURPOSE: Convolutional neural networks have achieved excellent results in automatic medical image segmentation.In this study, we proposed a novel three-dimensional (3D) multipath DenseNet for generating the accurate glioblastoma (GBM) tumor contour from four multimodal pre-operative MR images.We hypothesized that the multipath architecture could achieve more accurate segmentation than a singlepath architecture.METHODS: Two hundred and fifty-eight GBM patients were included in this study.Each patient had four MR images (T1-weighted, contrast-enhanced T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and FLAIR) and the manually segmented tumor contour.We built a 3D multipath DenseNet that could be trained to achieve an end-to-end mapping from four MR images to the corresponding GBM tumor contour.A 3D singlepath DenseNet was also built for comparison.Both DenseNets were based on the encoder-decoder architecture.All four images were concatenated and fed into a single encoder path in the singlepath DenseNet, while each input image had its own encoder path in the multipath DenseNet.The patient cohort was randomly split into a training set of 180 patients, a validation set of 39 patients, and a testing set of 39 patients.Model performance was evaluated using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), average surface distance (ASD), and 95% Hausdorff distance (HD95% ).Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were conducted to assess statistical significances.RESULTS: The singlepath DenseNet achieved the DSC of 0.911 +/- 0.060, ASD of 1.3 +/- 0.7 mm, and HD95% of 5.2 +/- 7.1 mm, while the multipath DenseNet achieved the DSC of 0.922 +/- 0.041, ASD of 1.1 +/- 0.5 mm, and HD95% of 3.9 +/- 3.3 mm.The P-values of all Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were less than 0.05.CONCLUSIONS: Both DenseNets generated GBM tumor contours in good agreement with the manually segmented contours from multimodal MR images.The multipath DenseNet achieved more accurate tumor segmentation than the singlepath DenseNet.Here presented the 3D multipath DenseNet that demonstrated an improved accuracy over comparable algorithms in the clinical task of GBM tumor segmentation.",0,0,0,0

The response rate (according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors [RECIST]) was 22% in arm A (4 complete responses [CRs] and 8 partial responses [PRs]) and 17% in arm B (1 CR and 4 PRs).Stable disease or PR or CR was noted in 65% of patients in arm A and 48% of patients in arm B. The combination was found to be superior to monotherapy in patients with high and low levels of serum VEGF and VEGF receptor 2.Adverse events were consistent with the expected profiles of monotherapy with IL-2 and ziv-aflibercept.CONCLUSIONS: Ziv-aflibercept and IL-2 were found to significantly improve PFS compared with IL-2 alone, thereby meeting the primary endpoint of the current study.These findings support further study of immunotherapeutic combination strategies involving VEGF inhibitors.",1,1,1,1

24245838,"CHESS improves cancer caregivers' burden and mood: results of an eHealth RCT.OBJECTIVE: Informal caregivers (family and friends) of people with cancer are often unprepared for their caregiving role, leading to increased burden or distress.Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System (CHESS) is a Web-based lung cancer information, communication, and coaching system for caregivers.This randomized trial reports the impact on caregiver burden, disruptiveness, and mood of providing caregivers access to CHESS versus the Internet with a list of recommended lung cancer websites.METHODS: A total of 285 informal caregivers of patients with advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer were randomly assigned to a comparison group that received Internet or a treatment group that received Internet and CHESS.Caregivers were provided a computer and Internet service if needed.Written surveys were completed at pretest and during the intervention period bimonthly for up to 24 months.Analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) compared the intervention's effect on caregivers' disruptiveness and burden (CQOLI-C), and negative mood (combined Anxiety, Depression, and Anger scales of the POMS) at 6 months, controlling for blocking variables (site, caregiver's race, and relationship to patient) and the given outcome at pretest.RESULTS: Caregivers randomized to CHESS reported lower burden, t(84) = 2.36, p = .021, d = .39, and negative mood, t(86) = 2.82, p = .006, d = .44, than those in the Internet group.The effect on disruptiveness was not significant.CONCLUSIONS: Although caring for someone with a terminal illness will always exact a toll on caregivers, eHealth interventions like CHESS may improve caregivers' understanding and coping skills and, as a result, ease their burden and mood.",0,0,0,0
24220254,"Bone marrow edema pattern identification in patients with lytic bone lesions using digital subtraction angiography-like bone subtraction on large-area detector computed tomography.OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of digital subtraction angiography (DSA)-like bone subtraction with 2 different registration methods for the identification of bone marrow edema pattern (BMEP) in patients with lytic bone lesions, using magnetic resonance imaging as the criterion standard.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-five patients with a lytic bone lesion were included in this prospective study with approval from the ethics committee.All patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging and low-dose computed tomographic (CT) perfusion after signing an informed consent.Two CT volumes were used for bone subtraction, which was performed with 2 different algorithms (rigid and nonrigid).Enhancement at the nonlytic bone marrow was considered as a sign of BMEP.Two readers evaluated the images blindly.The presence of BMEP on bone-subtracted CT images was evaluated subjectively and quantitatively.Image quality was assessed.Magnetic resonance imaging was used as the criterion standard.RESULTS: Using a rigid registration method, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of CT with DSA-like bone subtraction BMEP was 77%, 100%, 100%, 68%, and 85%, respectively.The interobserver agreement was good (kappa, 0.782).Image quality was better using a nonrigid registration.With this algorithm, artifacts interfered with image interpretation in only 5% of cases.However, there was a noticeable drop in sensitivity and negative predictive value when a nonrigid algorithm was used: 56% and 52%, respectively.The interobserver agreement was average with a nonrigid subtraction algorithm.CONCLUSIONS: Computed tomography with DSA-like bone subtraction is sensitive and highly specific for the identification of BMEP associated with lytic bone lesions.Rigid registering should be preferred, but nonrigid algorithms can be used as a second option when artifacts interfere with image interpretation.",0,0,0,0
23647761,"Palliative brachytherapy with or without primary stent placement in patients with oesophageal cancer, a randomised phase III trial.PURPOSE: To investigate whether a combination of self-expanding metal stent (SEMS) and brachytherapy provided more rapid and prolonged effect on dysphagia without increased pain compared to brachytherapy alone in patients with incurable oesophageal cancer.METHODS: 41 Patients were randomised to SEMS followed by brachytherapy, 8 Gyx3 (n=21) or brachytherapy alone, 8 Gyx3 (n=20).Change in dysphagia and pain three and seven weeks after randomisation (FU1 and FU2) was assessed by patient-reported outcome.Dysphagia, other symptoms and health-related quality of life were assessed every four weeks thereafter.The study was closed before the estimated patient-number was reached due to slow recruitment.RESULTS: Patients receiving SEMS followed by brachytherapy had significantly improved dysphagia at FU1 compared to patients receiving brachytherapy alone (n=35).Difference in pain was not observed.At FU2, patients in both arms (n=21) had less dysphagia.Four patients in the combined treatment arm experienced manageable complications, no complications occurred after brachytherapy alone.CONCLUSION: For the relief of dysphagia, SEMS followed by brachytherapy is preferable and safe for patients in need of immediate alleviation, while brachytherapy with or without preceding SEMS provides relief within a few weeks after treatment.",0,0,0,0
25403578,"FOLFOX4 versus sequential dose-dense FOLFOX7 followed by FOLFIRI in patients with resectable metastatic colorectal cancer (MIROX): a pragmatic approach to chemotherapy timing with perioperative or postoperative chemotherapy from an open-label, randomized phase III trial.BACKGROUND: Perioperative FOLFOX4 (oxaliplatin plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin) chemotherapy is the current standard in patients with resectable metastases from colorectal cancer (CRC).We aimed to determine whether a sequential chemotherapy with dose-dense oxaliplatin (FOLFOX7) and irinotecan (FOLFIRI; irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin) is superior to FOLFOX4.The chemotherapy timing was not imposed, and was perioperative or postoperative.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this open-label, phase III trial, patients with resectable or resected metastases were randomly assigned either to 12 cycles of FOLFOX4 (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m(2)) or 6 cycles of FOLFOX7 (oxaliplatin 130 mg/m(2)) followed by 6 cycles of FOLFIRI (irinotecan 180 mg/m(2)).Randomization was done centrally, with stratification by chemotherapy timing, type of local treatment (surgery versus radiofrequency ablation with/without surgery), and Fong's prognostic score.The primary end point was 2-year disease-free survival (DFS).RESULTS: A total of 284 patients were randomized, 142 in each treatment group.Chemotherapy was perioperative in 168 (59.2%) patients and postoperative in 116 (40.8%) patients.Perioperative chemotherapy was preferentially proposed for synchronous metastases, whereas postoperative chemotherapy was more frequently used for metachronous metastases.Two-year DFS was 48.5% in the FOLFOX4 group and 50.0% in the FOLFOX7-FOLFIRI group.In the multivariable analysis, more than one metastasis [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.15] and synchronous metastases (HR = 1.63) were independent prognostic factors for shorter DFS.Five-year overall survival (OS) rate was 69.5% with FOLFOX4 versus 66.6% with FOLFOX7-FOLFIRI.CONCLUSIONS: FOLFOX7-FOLFIRI is not superior to FOLFOX4 in patients with resectable metastatic CRC.Five-year OS rates observed in both groups are the highest ever reported in this setting, possibly reflecting the pragmatic approach to chemotherapy timing.CLINICAL TRIALS NUMBER: NCT00268398.",1,1,1,1
26335704,"Managing Cancer And Living Meaningfully: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: We have developed a novel and brief semi-structured psychotherapeutic intervention for patients with advanced or metastatic cancer, called Managing Cancer And Living Meaningfully.We describe here the methodology of a randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of this treatment to alleviate distress and promote well-being in this population.METHODS/DESIGN: The study is an unblinded randomized controlled trial with 2 conditions (intervention plus usual care versus usual care alone) and assessments at baseline, 3 and 6 months.The site is the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, part of the University Health Network, in Toronto, Canada.Eligibility criteria include: >/= 18 years of age; English fluency; no cognitive impairment; and diagnosis of advanced cancer.The 3-6 session intervention is manualized and allows for flexibility to meet individual patients' needs.It is delivered over a 3-6 month period and provides reflective space for patients (and their primary caregivers) to address 4 main domains: symptom management and communication with health care providers; changes in self and relations with close others; sense of meaning and purpose; and the future and mortality.Usual care at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre includes distress screening and referral as required to in-hospital psychosocial and palliative care services.The primary outcome is frequency of depressive symptoms and the primary endpoint is at 3 months.Secondary outcomes include diagnosis of major or minor depression, generalized anxiety, death anxiety, spiritual well-being, quality of life, demoralization, attachment security, posttraumatic growth, communication with partners, and satisfaction with clinical interactions.DISCUSSION: Managing Cancer And Living Meaningfully has the potential to relieve distress and promote psychological well-being in patients with advanced cancer and their primary caregivers.This trial is being conducted to determine its benefit and inform its dissemination.The intervention has cross-national relevance and training workshops have been held thus far with clinicians from North and South America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia and Africa.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01506492 4 January 2012.",0,0,0,0
26209642,"Value of KRAS as prognostic or predictive marker in NSCLC: results from the TAILOR trial.BACKGROUND: The prognostic and predictive role of KRAS mutations in advanced nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is still unclear.TAILOR prospectively assessed the prognostic and predictive value of KRAS mutations in NSCLC patients treated with erlotinib or docetaxel in second line.PATIENTS AND METHODS: NSCLC patients from 52 Italian hospitals were genotyped for KRAS and EGFR mutational status in two independent laboratories.Wild-type EGFR patients (N = 218) received first-line platinum-based chemotherapy and were randomly allocated at progression to erlotinib or docetaxel.Overall survival (OS) according to KRAS mutational status was the primary end point.RESULTS: KRAS mutations were present in 23% of TAILOR randomized cases.The presence of a KRAS mutation did not adversely affect progression-free (PFS) or overall (OS) survival [hazard ratio (HR) PFS = 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71-1.41, P = 0.977; OS = 1.24, 95% CI 0.87-1.77, P = 0.233], nor influenced treatment outcome (test for interaction: OS P = 0.965; PFS P = 0.417).Patients randomized to docetaxel treatment experienced longer survival independently from the KRAS mutational status of their tumors (HR: mutated KRAS 0.81, 95% CI 0.45-1.47; wild-type KRAS 0.79, 95% CI 0.57-1.10).CONCLUSION: In TAILOR, KRAS was neither prognostic nor predictive of benefit for either docetaxel or erlotinib.Docetaxel remains superior independently from KRAS status for second-line treatment in EGFR wild-type advanced NSCLC patients.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT00637910.",0,0,0,0

34274136,"Efficacy and Safety of Cabazitaxel Versus Abiraterone or Enzalutamide in Older Patients with Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer in the CARD Study.BACKGROUND: In the CARD study (NCT02485691), cabazitaxel significantly improved median radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) and overall survival (OS) versus abiraterone/enzalutamide in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who had previously received docetaxel and progressed </=12 mo on the alternative agent (abiraterone/enzalutamide).OBJECTIVE: To assess cabazitaxel versus abiraterone/enzalutamide in older (>/=70 yr) and younger (<70 yr) patients in CARD.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Patients with mCRPC were randomized 1:1 to cabazitaxel (25 mg/m(2) plus prednisone and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) versus abiraterone (1000 mg plus prednisone) or enzalutamide (160 mg).OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Analyses of rPFS (primary endpoint) and safety by age were prespecified; others were post hoc.Treatment groups were compared using stratified log-rank or Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests.RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Of the 255 patients randomized, 135 were aged >/=70yr (median 76 yr).Cabazitaxel, compared with abiraterone/enzalutamide, significantly improved median rPFS in older (8.2 vs 4.5 mo; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.38-0.89; p = 0.012) and younger (7.4 vs 3.2 mo; HR = 0.47; 95% CI = 0.30-0.74; p < 0.001) patients.The median OS of cabazitaxel versus abiraterone/enzalutamide was 13.9 versus 9.4 mo in older patients (HR = 0.66; 95% CI = 0.41-1.06; p = 0.084), and it was 13.6 versus 11.8 mo in younger patients (HR = 0.66; 95% CI = 0.41-1.08; p = 0.093).Progression-free survival, prostate-specific antigen, and tumor and pain responses favored cabazitaxel, regardless of age.Grade >/=3 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurred in 58% versus 49% of older patients receiving cabazitaxel versus abiraterone/enzalutamide and 48% versus 42% of younger patients.In older patients, cardiac adverse events were more frequent with abiraterone/enzalutamide; asthenia and diarrhea were more frequent with cabazitaxel.CONCLUSIONS: Cabazitaxel improved efficacy outcomes versus abiraterone/enzalutamide in patients with mCRPC after prior docetaxel and abiraterone/enzalutamide, regardless of age.TEAEs were more frequent among older patients.The cabazitaxel safety profile was manageable across age groups.PATIENT SUMMARY: Clinical trial data showed that cabazitaxel improved survival versus abiraterone/enzalutamide with manageable side effects in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who had previously received docetaxel and the alternative agent (abiraterone/enzalutamide), irrespective of age.",1,1,1,0
24960402,"A phase IIa dose-finding and safety study of first-line pertuzumab in combination with trastuzumab, capecitabine and cisplatin in patients with HER2-positive advanced gastric cancer.BACKGROUND: Pertuzumab plus trastuzumab provides a more comprehensive blockade of HER2 signalling than trastuzumab alone.Therefore, we conducted a phase IIa study of the pharmacokinetics and safety of pertuzumab plus trastuzumab and chemotherapy in advanced gastric cancer (aGC).METHODS: Patients received pertuzumab 840 mg for cycle 1 and 420 mg q3w for cycles 2-6 (Arm A) or pertuzumab 840 mg q3w for six cycles (Arm B).Trastuzumab, cisplatin and capecitabine were also given for six cycles, then trastuzumab q3w until disease progression or unmanageable toxicity.The co-primary endpoints were day 43 pertuzumab serum trough concentration (Cmin) and safety.RESULTS: Thirty patients were randomised.Mean pertuzumab Cmin at day 43 was 40.0 mug ml(-1) (s.d.: 17.3) in Arm A and 62.7 mug ml(-1) (29.1) in Arm B. Mean day 43 Cmin in Arm A was ~37% lower than that seen in metastatic breast cancer.The safety profiles were similar between arms and treatment was well tolerated.Partial responses were achieved by 86% and 55% of patients in Arms A and B, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the pharmacokinetic and safety data, the 840 mg q3w pertuzumab dose has been selected for a phase III study of pertuzumab, trastuzumab and chemotherapy in HER2-positive aGC.",1,1,1,1
32064794,"Effect of anlotinib as a third- or further-line therapy in advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients with different histologic types: Subgroup analysis in the ALTER0303 trial.BACKGROUND: Anlotinib showed significant survival benefits in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients as a third- or further-line treatment in the ALTER0303 trial.We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of anlotinib in patients with different histologies.METHODS: The ALTER0303 trial was a randomized, open-label, phase 3 study of anlotinib in NSCLC patients previously treated with at least two lines of chemotherapy or a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) in 31 centers in China.Patients were randomly assigned at a 2:1 ratio to receive anlotinib (12 mg QD from days 1 to 14 of a 21-day cycle) or placebo until progression or intolerable toxicity.The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS).We assessed the efficacy of anlotinib in histological subgroups in the full analysis set.RESULTS: In the ALTER0303 trial, 336 patients had the histological subtype of adenocarcinoma (ACC), 86 patients had the histological subtype of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and 15 patients had another subtype.In the ACC subgroup, the median OS time was significantly improved with anlotinib compared with placebo (9.6 months vs 6.9 months, P = .0051), as was the median progression-free survival (PFS) time (5.5 months vs 1.4 months, P < .0001).In the SCC subgroup, the median OS time was 10.7 months in the anlotinib group and 6.5 months in the placebo group (P = .2570), and the median PFS time was 4.8 months and 2.7 months (P = .0004), respectively.The common adverse events observed in the SCC and ACC subgroups were similar.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that anlotinib significantly improves PFS and OS in ACC patients and has a tendency to prolong survival in SCC patients.",1,1,1,1
34436521,"Effect of Cisplatin and Gemcitabine With or Without Berzosertib in Patients With Advanced Urothelial Carcinoma: A Phase 2 Randomized Clinical Trial.Importance: Preclinical studies suggest that inhibition of single-stranded DNA repair by ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 (ATR) may enhance the cytotoxicity of cisplatin, gemcitabine, and other chemotherapeutic agents.Cisplatin with gemcitabine remains the standard up-front therapy for treatment in patients with metastatic urothelial cancer.Objective: To determine whether the use of the selective ATR inhibitor, berzosertib, could augment the activity of cisplatin with gemcitabine.Design, Setting, and Participants: In a phase 2 randomized clinical trial, 87 patients across 23 centers in the National Cancer Institute Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network were randomized to receive either cisplatin with gemcitabine alone (control arm) or cisplatin with gemcitabine plus berzosertib (experimental arm).Key eligibility criteria included confirmed metastatic urothelial cancer, no prior cytotoxic therapy for metastatic disease, 12 months or more since perioperative therapy, and eligibility for cisplatin receipt based on standard criteria.The study was conducted from January 27, 2017, to December 15, 2020.Interventions: In the control arm, cisplatin, 70 mg/m2, was given on day 1 and gemcitabine, 1000 mg/m2, was given on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle.In the experimental arm, cisplatin, 60 mg/m2, was given on day 1; gemcitabine, 875 mg/m2, on days 1 and 8; and berzosertib, 90 mg/m2, on days 2 and 9 of a 21-day cycle.Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point of the study was progression-free survival.The analysis was on all patients who started therapy.Results: Of the total of 87 patients randomized, 41 patients received cisplatin with gemcitabine alone and 46 received cisplatin with gemcitabine plus berzosertib.Median age was 67 (range, 32-84) years, and 68 patients (78%) were men.Median progression-free survival was 8.0 months for both arms (Bajorin risk-adjusted hazard ratio, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.72-2.08).Median overall survival was shorter with cisplatin with gemcitabine plus berzosertib compared with cisplatin with gemcitabine alone (14.4 vs 19.8 months; Bajorin risk-adjusted hazard ratio, 1.42; 95% CI, 0.76-2.68).Higher rates of grade 3 vs grade 4 thrombocytopenia (59% vs 39%) and neutropenia (37% vs 27%) were observed with cisplatin with gemcitabine and berzosertib compared with cisplatin with gemcitabine alone; consequently, more dose reductions were needed in the experimental arm.Patients in the experimental arm received a median cisplatin dose of 250 mg/m2, which was significantly lower than the median dose of 370 mg/m2 in the control arm (P < .001).Conclusions and Relevance: The addition of berzosertib to cisplatin with gemcitabine did not prolong progression-free survival relative to cisplatin with gemcitabine alone in patients with metastatic urothelial cancer, and a trend toward inferior survival was observed with this combination.Berzosertib plus cisplatin with gemcitabine was associated with significantly higher hematologic toxicities despite attenuated dosing of cisplatin with gemcitabine.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02567409.",1,1,1,0

Results from the GEICAM/2006-03, multicenter study.Chemotherapy remains as the only systemic treatment option available for basal-like breast cancer (BC) patients.Preclinical models and several phase II studies suggested that platinum salts are active drugs in this BC subtype though there is no randomized study supporting this hypothesis.This study investigates if the addition of carboplatin to a combination of an alkylating agent together with anthracyclines and taxanes is able to increase the efficacy in the neoadjuvant treatment context.Patients with operable breast cancer and immunophenotypically defined basal-like disease (ER-/PR-/HER2- and cytokeratin 5/6+ or EGFR+) were recruited.Patients were randomized to receive EC (epirubicin 90 mg/m(2) plus cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2) for 4 cycles) followed either by D (docetaxel 100 mg/m(2) x 4 cycles; EC-D) or DCb (docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) plus carboplatin AUC 6 x 4 cycles; EC-DCb).The primary end point was pathological complete response (pCR) in the breast following the Miller and Payne criteria.Ninety-four patients were randomized (46 EC-D, 48 EC-DCb).pCR rate in the breast was seen in 16 patients (35 %) with EC-D and 14 patients (30 %) with EC-DCb (P value = 0.61).pCR in the breast and axilla was seen in 30 % of patients in both arms.The overall clinical response rate was 70 % (95 % CI 56-83) in the EC-D arm and 77 % (95 % CI 65-87) in the EC-DCb arm.Grade 3/4 toxicity was similar in both arms.The addition of carboplatin to conventional chemotherapy with EC-D in basal-like breast cancer patients did not improve the efficacy probably because they had already received an alkylating agent.These findings should be taken into consideration when developing new agents for this disease.",1,1,1,1
32285282,"Opioid Consumption Following Breast Surgery Decreases with a Brief Educational Intervention: A Randomized, Controlled Trial.BACKGROUND: Current rates of opioid prescribing and consumption in the United States have resulted in deleterious consequences for both patients and society.There has been a focus on opioid consumption and overprescribing, but the utility of patient education in reducing opioid consumption has only recently been explored.This randomized trial aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a brief patient educational intervention in reducing pain and opioid consumption in patients undergoing mastectomy and breast reconstruction.METHODS: A parallel, randomized, single-center trial of women undergoing mastectomy with immediate, implant-based breast reconstruction was completed to evaluate the utility of a patient educational instrument with information on multi-modal pain control.A questionnaire was administered postoperatively to collect data on pain control and opioid consumption.RESULTS: Fifty participants were randomized to each group preoperatively; 46 control (92%) and 39 intervention (78%) participants completed the postoperative questionnaire.Active tobacco use was more common in the control group (p = 0.04).There was a trend towards lower pain scores in the intervention group (3.0/10, SD 1.8 vs 3.6/10, SD 1.6, p = 0.06).Both groups were prescribed a median of 32.0 5-mg oxycodone tablets postoperatively.Participants in the intervention group consumed 33% fewer opioids than the control group (16.2 tablets, SD 16.4 vs 24.3 tablets, SD 21.8, p = 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: The use of a brief educational intervention provided at a preoperative appointment can reduce opioid consumption.We recommend the use of an educational intervention to decrease opioid consumption among breast surgery patients.",0,0,0,0

RESULTS: A total of 24 patients were included: arm A (10), arm B (5), and arm C (9).Safety analysis showed no excessive toxicity.At the end of stage I, the PFS-6 of arm A was 20% (2/10 patients, 95% unilateral lower confidence limit: 3.7%) and the study was prematurely terminated.The overall response rates (ORR) were 40% (95% CI, 12.2-73.8) and 20% (95% CI, 0.5-71.6) in arm A and B, respectively.In arm C, PFS-6 was 37.5% (95% CI, 8.8-75.5) and ORR was 22.2% (95% CI, 2.8-60.0).Among 11 patients with an expected sensitivity according to new generation sequencing (NGS), 3 had partial response (PR), 4 remained stable disease (SD) while out of 7 potentially resistant patients, 1 had PR and 1 SD.CONCLUSION: The addition of vismodegib to TMZ did not add toxicity but failed to improve PFS-6 in SHH recurrent/refractory medulloblastoma.Prediction of sensitivity to vismodegib needs further refinements.",1,1,1,1
25626066,"Identification of the sentinel lymph node in the SNAC-1 trial.BACKGROUND: A combination of scintigraphy and a lymphotropic dye (patent blue dye (BD)) is the recommended technique to detect the sentinel lymph node (SLN) in early breast cancer.This study determined the effect of clinical factors on SLN identification in the sentinel node biopsy versus axillary clearance (SNAC) trial.METHODS: A total of 1088 women were registered.Lymphatic mapping was performed using preoperative lymphoscintigraphy (LSG) and gamma probe (GP) combined with peritumoural injection of patent BD (971 patients) or BD alone (106 patients).RESULTS: SLNs were identified in 1024 women (94%), localized with LSG in 779 (81.4%), and were identified by GP in 879 (91.8%).The BD identified SLNs in 890 of 1073 (82%) women.Three patients had allergic reactions.BD detected the SLNs in 141 of 178 women with negative LSG mapping and in 44 of 79 women with no hot SLNs detected intraoperatively.Age, body mass index (BMI) and tumour presentation (screen detected versus symptomatic) were significantly related to the identification of the SLN.For BD, the primary tumour location was significantly related to identification rate.The detection of blue SLN was significantly lower in women with inner quadrant tumours.CONCLUSION: The combined technique resulted in a high identification rate.BD contributed to the identification of the SLNs in patients where LSG and GP failed to identify the sentinel node.Special attention to these techniques is needed in particular groups of patients such as those with high BMI, screen-detected primary tumours and tumour located in the inner quadrants.",0,0,0,0
29533000,"Ibrutinib versus rituximab in relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma: a randomized, open-label phase 3 study.In the Asia-Pacific region, treatment options are limited for patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL).Rituximab is widely used in this setting when purine analog-based therapies are not appropriate.We evaluated the efficacy and safety of ibrutinib compared with rituximab in a randomized, open-label phase 3 study in predominantly Asian patients with relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL.Patients (N = 160) were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive 420 mg ibrutinib (n = 106) until disease progression (PD) or unacceptable toxicity or up to six cycles of rituximab (n = 54).The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS); key secondary endpoints were overall response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), and safety.Rituximab-treated patients could crossover to receive ibrutinib after confirmed PD.At data cutoff, median treatment duration was 16.4 months for ibrutinib and 4.6 months for rituximab.Ibrutinib significantly improved PFS (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.180, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.105-0.308).ORR was significantly higher (P < 0.0001) with ibrutinib (53.8%) than with rituximab (7.4%).At a median follow-up of 17.8 months, ibrutinib improved OS compared with rituximab (HR = 0.446; 95% CI: 0.221-0.900; P = 0.0206).Overall incidence of adverse events (AEs) was similar between treatments and was not exposure-adjusted.With ibrutinib, most common AEs were diarrhea and platelet count decreased; with rituximab, most common AEs were neutrophil count decreased and platelet count decreased.Grade >/=3 AEs were reported in 82.7% of ibrutinib-treated patients and 59.6% of rituximab-treated patients.Ibrutinib improved PFS, ORR, and OS compared with rituximab and displayed a manageable safety profile in Asian patients with relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL.",0,0,0,0
29864379,"Improvement in Overall Survival in a Randomized Study That Compared Dacomitinib With Gefitinib in Patients With Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer and EGFR-Activating Mutations.Purpose ARCHER 1050, a randomized, open-label, phase III study of dacomitinib versus gefitinib in treatment-naive patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and activating mutations in EGFR, reported significant improvement in progression-free survival with dacomitinib.The mature overall survival (OS) analysis for the intention-to-treat population is presented here.Patients and Methods In this multinational, multicenter study, patients age 18 years or older (>/= 20 years in Japan and Korea) who had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 and newly diagnosed NSCLC with activating mutations in EGFR (exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R) were enrolled and randomly assigned in a 1:1 manner to dacomitinib (n = 227) or gefitinib (n = 225).Random assignment was stratified by race (Japanese, Chinese, other East Asian, or non-Asian) and EGFR mutation type.The final OS analysis was conducted with a data cutoff date of February 17, 2017; at that time 220 deaths (48.7%) were observed.Results During a median follow-up time of 31.3 months, 103 (45.4%) and 117 (52.0%) deaths occurred in the dacomitinib and gefitinib arms, respectively.The estimated hazard ratio for OS was 0.760 (95% CI, 0.582 to 0.993; two-sided P = .044).The median OS was 34.1 months with dacomitinib versus 26.8 months with gefitinib.The OS probabilities at 30 months were 56.2% and 46.3% with dacomitinib and gefitinib, respectively.Preliminary subgroup analyses for OS that are based on baseline characteristics were consistent with the primary OS analysis.Conclusion In patients with advanced NSCLC and EGFR activating mutations, dacomitinib is the first second-generation epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) to show significant improvement in OS in a phase III randomized study compared with a standard-of-care TKI.Dacomitinib should be considered one of the standard treatment options for these patients.",1,1,1,1
24332581,"Comparison of mammographic findings after intraoperative radiotherapy or external beam whole breast radiotherapy.BACKGROUND: The TARGIT (TARGeted Intraoperative Radiotherapy) trial was designed to compare local recurrence and complication rates in breast cancer patients, prospectively randomised to either EBRT (external beam whole breast radiotherapy) or a single dose of IORT (intraoperative radiotherapy).The aim of our study was to compare follow-up mammographic findings, ultrasound and biopsy rates in each group.METHODS: Follow-up imaging and breast biopsies of women from one centre participating in the TARGIT-A trial were independently reviewed by two radiologists blinded to the radiotherapy treatment received.RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 141 patients (EBRT n = 80/IORT n = 61).There was no significant difference in the patient or disease characteristics of the two groups.The number of follow-up mammograms and length of follow-up was similar (EBRT/IORT n = 2.0/2.4; 4.3yr/5.1yr; p = 0.386 chi(2) test).There were no significant differences in mammographic scar or calcification appearances of the post-operative site.Generalised increase in breast density and skin thickening were more common in the EBRT compared to the IORT group (p = 0.002; p = 0.030, chi(2) test respectively).A trend towards additional ultrasound at follow-up was observed in the IORT group (15 of 61 [24.6%] versus 11 of 80 [13.8%]), however this was not statistically significant (p = 0.100 chi(2) test).No disease recurrence was demonstrated on any of the breast biopsies taken.Only one biopsy was reported as fat necrosis in the IORT group.CONCLUSIONS: Mammographic changes were more common following EBRT, although more additional follow-up ultrasounds were performed in the IORT group.IORT is not detrimental to subsequent radiological follow up.",0,0,0,0
25887253,"3D vs 2D laparoscopic radical prostatectomy in organ-confined prostate cancer: comparison of operative data and pentafecta rates: a single cohort study.BACKGROUND: Currently, men are younger at the time of diagnosis of prostate cancer and more interested in less invasive surgical approaches (traditional laparoscopy, 3D-laparoscopy, robotics).Outcomes of continence, erectile function, cancer cure, positive surgical margins and complication are well collected in the pentafecta rate.However, no comparative studies between 4th generation 3D-HD vision system laparoscopy and standard bi-dimensional laparoscopy have been reported.This study aimed to compare the operative, perioperative data and pentafecta rates between 2D and 3D laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP) and to identify the actual role of 3D LRP in urology.METHODS: From October 2012 to July 2013, 86 patients with clinically localized prostate cancer [PCa: age </= 70 years, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) </= 10 ng/ml, biopsy Gleason score </= 7] underwent laparoscopic extraperitoneal radical prostatectomy (LERP) and were followed for approximately 14 months (range 12-25).Patients were selected for inclusion via hospital record data, and divided into two groups.Their patient records were then analyzed.Patients were randomized into two groups: the former 2D-LERP (43 pts) operated with the use of 2D-HD camera; the latter 3D-LERP (43 pts) operated with the use of a 3D-HD 4th generation view system.The operative and perioperative data and the pentafecta rates between 2D-LERP and 3D-LERP were compared.RESULTS: The overall pentafecta rates at 3 months were 47.4% and 49.6% in the 2D- and 3D-LERP group respectively.The pentafecta rate at 12 months was 62.7% and 67% for each group respectively.4th generation 3D-HD vision system provides advantages over standard bi-dimensional view with regard to intraoperative steps.Our data suggest a trend of improvement in intraoperative blood loss and postoperative recovery of continence with the respect of the oncological safety.CONCLUSIONS: Use of the 3D technology by a single surgeon significantly enhances the possibility of achieving better intraoperative results and pentafecta in all patients undergoing LERP.Potency was the most difficult outcome to reach after surgery, and it was the main factor leading to pentafecta failure.Nevertheless, further studies are necessary to better comprehend the role of 3D-LERP in modern urology.",0,0,0,0
30303516,"NCI 8628: A randomized phase 2 study of ziv-aflibercept and high-dose interleukin 2 or high-dose interleukin 2 alone for inoperable stage III or IV melanoma.BACKGROUND: Interleukin 2 (IL-2) is a growth factor for T and natural killer cells, promotes proinflammatory cytokines, and can lead to durable responses in patients with melanoma.Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) promotes angiogenesis and modulates host innate and adaptive immunity.High VEGF levels were found to be associated with nonresponse to IL-2.Ziv-aflibercept may deplete VEGF and thereby enhance antitumor T-cell responses, thus supporting a combination immunotherapeutic strategy with IL-2.METHODS: NCI 8628 was a phase 2 trial of ziv-aflibercept and IL-2 (arm A) versus IL-2 alone (arm B) randomized at 2:1, respectively.Eligible patients had inoperable American Joint Committee on Cancer stage III or stage IV melanoma.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS).RESULTS: A total of 89 patients were enrolled and 84 patients were treated.The median follow-up was 41.4 months.Among treated patients (55 patients in arm A and 29 patients in arm B), PFS was significantly improved in favor of arm A, with a median of 6.9 months (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 4.1-8.7 months) versus 2.3 months (95% CI, 1.6-3.5 months) (P<.001).No significant difference was noted with regard to overall survival, with a median of 26.9 months (95% CI, 14.4-63.6 months) for arm A and 24.2 months (95% CI, 11.3-36.4 months) for arm B. The response rate (according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors [RECIST]) was 22% in arm A (4 complete responses [CRs] and 8 partial responses [PRs]) and 17% in arm B (1 CR and 4 PRs).Stable disease or PR or CR was noted in 65% of patients in arm A and 48% of patients in arm B. The combination was found to be superior to monotherapy in patients with high and low levels of serum VEGF and VEGF receptor 2.Adverse events were consistent with the expected profiles of monotherapy with IL-2 and ziv-aflibercept.CONCLUSIONS: Ziv-aflibercept and IL-2 were found to significantly improve PFS compared with IL-2 alone, thereby meeting the primary endpoint of the current study.These findings support further study of immunotherapeutic combination strategies involving VEGF inhibitors.",1,1,1,1

31591063,"Ramucirumab plus erlotinib in patients with untreated, EGFR-mutated, advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (RELAY): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Dual blockade of the EGFR and VEGF pathways in EGFR-mutated metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is supported by preclinical and clinical data, yet the approach is not widely implemented.RELAY assessed erlotinib, an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) standard of care, plus ramucirumab, a human IgG1 VEGFR2 antagonist, or placebo in patients with untreated EGFR-mutated metastatic NSCLC.METHODS: This is a worldwide, double-blind, phase 3 trial done in 100 hospitals, clinics, and medical centres in 13 countries.Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older (20 years or older in Japan and Taiwan) at the time of study entry, had stage IV NSCLC, with an EGFR exon 19 deletion (ex19del) or exon 21 substitution (Leu858Arg) mutation, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, and no CNS metastases.We randomly assigned eligible patients in a 1:1 ratio to receive oral erlotinib (150 mg/day) plus either intravenous ramucirumab (10 mg/kg) or matching placebo once every 2 weeks.Randomisation was done by an interactive web response system with a computer-generated sequence and stratified by sex, geographical region, EGFR mutation type, and EGFR testing method.The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population.Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment.This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02411448, and is ongoing for long-term survival follow-up.FINDINGS: Between Jan 28, 2016, and Feb 1, 2018, 449 eligible patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to treatment with ramucirumab plus erlotinib (n=224) or placebo plus erlotinib (n=225).Median duration of follow-up was 20.7 months (IQR 15.8-27.2).At the time of primary analysis, progression-free survival was significantly longer in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib group (19.4 months [95% CI 15.4-21.6]) than in the placebo plus erlotinib group (12.4 months [11.0-13.5]), with a stratified hazard ratio of 0.59 (95% CI 0.46-0.76; p<0.0001).Grade 3-4 treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 159 (72%) of 221 patients in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib group versus 121 (54%) of 225 in the placebo plus erlotinib group.The most common grade 3-4 treatment-emergent adverse events in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib group were hypertension (52 [24%]; grade 3 only) and dermatitis acneiform (33 [15%]), and in the placebo plus erlotinib group were dermatitis acneiform (20 [9%]) and increased alanine aminotransferase (17 [8%]).Treatment-emergent serious adverse events were reported in 65 (29%) of 221 patients in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib group and 47 (21%) of 225 in the placebo plus erlotinib group.The most common serious adverse events of any grade in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib group were pneumonia (seven [3%]) and cellulitis and pneumothorax (four [2%], each); the most common in the placebo plus erlotinib group were pyrexia (four [2%]) and pneumothorax (three [1%]).One on-study treatment-related death due to an adverse event occurred (haemothorax after a thoracic drainage procedure for a pleural empyema) in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib group.INTERPRETATION: Ramucirumab plus erlotinib demonstrated superior progression-free survival compared with placebo plus erlotinib in patients with untreated EGFR-mutated metastatic NSCLC.Safety was consistent with the safety profiles of the individual compounds in advanced lung cancer.The RELAY regimen is a viable new treatment option for the initial treatment of EGFR-mutated metastatic NSCLC.FUNDING: Eli Lilly.",1,1,1,1
31338575,"Effects of an antiadhesive agent on functional recovery of the greater auricular nerve after parotidectomy: a double-blind randomized controlled trial.PURPOSE: Periauricular sensory deficit occurs frequently after parotidectomy even in cases with preservation of the greater auricular nerve (GAN).This study was performed to evaluate the effects of antiadhesive agent in functional recovery of the GAN after parotidectomy.METHODS: Ninety-eight patients undergoing partial parotidectomy for benign parotid tumors were prospectively enrolled in this multicenter, double-blind randomized controlled study and randomly assigned to either the study or control group.Antiadhesive agent was applied in the study group.The results of sensory tests (tactile, heat, and cold sensitivity) and a questionnaire on quality of life (QoL) were acquired at postoperative 1, 8, and 24 weeks after surgery.Clinical parameters, and the results of the sensory tests and the questionnaire, were compared between the two groups.RESULTS: A total of 80 patients were finally enrolled.On sensory evaluation, tactile sensation and warm sensation in the ear lobule, and warm sensation in the mastoid area, showed significant improvement at 24 weeks postoperatively in the study group.There were no significant differences between the two groups on any questions in the QoL questionnaire, at any follow-up time point.CONCLUSIONS: Antiadhesive agents have some positive effects on functional recovery of the GAN after parotidectomy.Therefore, applying antiadhesive agents after parotidectomy can reduce discomfort in patients.",0,0,0,0
25795410,"Nivolumab versus chemotherapy in patients with advanced melanoma who progressed after anti-CTLA-4 treatment (CheckMate 037): a randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Nivolumab, a fully human IgG4 PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor antibody, can result in durable responses in patients with melanoma who have progressed after ipilimumab and BRAF inhibitors.We assessed the efficacy and safety of nivolumab compared with investigator's choice of chemotherapy (ICC) as a second-line or later-line treatment in patients with advanced melanoma.METHODS: In this randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 3 trial, we recruited patients at 90 sites in 14 countries.Eligible patients were 18 years or older, had unresectable or metastatic melanoma, and progressed after ipilimumab, or ipilimumab and a BRAF inhibitor if they were BRAF(V 600) mutation-positive.Participating investigators randomly assigned (with an interactive voice response system) patients 2:1 to receive an intravenous infusion of nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks or ICC (dacarbazine 1000 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks or paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2) combined with carboplatin area under the curve 6 every 3 weeks) until progression or unacceptable toxic effects.We stratified randomisation by BRAF mutation status, tumour expression of PD-L1, and previous best overall response to ipilimumab.We used permuted blocks (block size of six) within each stratum.Primary endpoints were the proportion of patients who had an objective response and overall survival.Treatment was given open-label, but those doing tumour assessments were masked to treatment assignment.We assessed objective responses per-protocol after 120 patients had been treated with nivolumab and had a minimum follow-up of 24 weeks, and safety in all patients who had had at least one dose of treatment.The trial is closed and this is the first interim analysis, reporting the objective response primary endpoint.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01721746.FINDINGS: Between Dec 21, 2012, and Jan 10, 2014, we screened 631 patients, randomly allocating 272 patients to nivolumab and 133 to ICC.Confirmed objective responses were reported in 38 (31.7%, 95% CI 23.5-40.8) of the first 120 patients in the nivolumab group versus five (10.6%, 3.5-23.1) of 47 patients in the ICC group.Grade 3-4 adverse events related to nivolumab included increased lipase (three [1%] of 268 patients), increased alanine aminotransferase, anaemia, and fatigue (two [1%] each); for ICC, these included neutropenia (14 [14%] of 102), thrombocytopenia (six [6%]), and anaemia (five [5%]).We noted grade 3-4 drug-related serious adverse events in 12 (5%) nivolumab-treated patients and nine (9%) patients in the ICC group.No treatment-related deaths occurred.INTERPRETATION: Nivolumab led to a greater proportion of patients achieving an objective response and fewer toxic effects than with alternative available chemotherapy regimens for patients with advanced melanoma that has progressed after ipilimumab or ipilimumab and a BRAF inhibitor.Nivolumab represents a new treatment option with clinically meaningful durable objective responses in a population of high unmet need.FUNDING: Bristol-Myers Squibb.",1,1,1,1
23578722,"Dose-dense rituximab-CHOP compared with standard rituximab-CHOP in elderly patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (the LNH03-6B study): a randomised phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Immunochemotherapy with rituximab and cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) has become the standard of care for elderly patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.We aimed to ascertain if a dose-dense R-CHOP regimen administered every 2 weeks (R-CHOP14) was superior to the standard 3-week schedule (R-CHOP21).METHODS: We did a randomised phase 3 trial at 83 centres in four countries.602 patients aged 60-80 years with untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and at least one adverse prognostic factor (age-adjusted international prognostic index >/= 1) were eligible for the study.We randomly allocated individuals to R-CHOP-ie, rituximab (375 mg/m(2)), cyclophosphamide (750 mg/m(2)), doxorubicin (50 mg/m(2)), vincristine (1.4 mg/m(2), up to 2 mg) all on day 1, and prednisone 40 mg/m(2) daily for 5 days-administered every 14 days (n=304) or every 21 days (n=298) for eight cycles.We did permuted-block randomisation (block size four, allocation ratio 1:1) stratified by centre and number of adverse prognostic factors.The primary endpoint was event-free survival.Our analysis was of the intention-to-treat population, and we present the final analysis.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00144755.FINDINGS: Two patients allocated R-CHOP21 were ineligible for the study and were excluded from analyses.After median follow-up of 56 months (IQR 27-60), 3-year event-free survival was 56% (95% CI 50-62) in the R-CHOP14 group and 60% (55-66) in the R-CHOP21 group (hazard ratio 1.04, 95% CI 0.82-1.31; p=0.7614).Grade 3-4 neutropenia occurred in 224 (74%) of 304 patients allocated R-CHOP14 and 189 (64%) of 296 assigned R-CHOP21, despite increased use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor in the R-CHOP14 group compared with the R-CHOP21 group.143 (47%) patients in the R-CHOP14 group received at least one red-blood-cell transfusion versus 93 (31%) in the R-CHOP21 group (p=0.0001).35 (12%) patients allocated R-CHOP14 received at least one platelet transfusion versus 25 (8%) assigned R-CHOP21 (p=0.2156).155 (51%) patients who were assigned R-CHOP14 had at least one serious adverse event compared with 140 (47%) who were allocated R-CHOP21.INTERPRETATION: In elderly patients with untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and at least one adverse prognostic factor, a 2-week dose-dense R-CHOP regimen did not improve efficacy compared with the 3-week standard schedule.The frequency of toxic side-effects was similar between regimens, but R-CHOP14 was associated with increased need for red-blood-cell transfusion.FUNDING: Groupe d'Etude des Lymphomes de l'Adulte (GELA), Amgen.",1,1,1,0
27325147,"Adrenal vein sampling versus CT scan to determine treatment in primary aldosteronism: an outcome-based randomised diagnostic trial.BACKGROUND: The distinction between unilateral aldosterone-producing adenoma or bilateral adrenal hyperplasia as causes of primary aldosteronism is usually made by adrenal CT or by adrenal vein sampling (AVS).Whether CT or AVS represents the best test for diagnosis remains unknown.We aimed to compare the outcome of CT-based management with AVS-based management for patients with primary aldosteronism.METHODS: In a randomised controlled trial, we randomly assigned patients with aldosteronism to undergo either adrenal CT or AVS to determine the presence of aldosterone-producing adenoma (with subsequent treatment consisting of adrenalectomy) or bilateral adrenal hyperplasia (subsequent treatment with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists).The primary endpoint was the intensity of drug treatment for obtaining target blood pressure after 1 year of follow-up, in the intention-to-diagnose population.Intensity of drug treatment was expressed as daily defined doses.Key secondary endpoints included biochemical outcome in patients who received adrenalectomy, health-related quality of life, cost-effectiveness, and adverse events.This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01096654.FINDINGS: We recruited 200 patients between July 6, 2010, and May 30, 2013.Of the 184 patients that completed follow-up, 92 received CT-based treatment (46 adrenalectomy and 46 mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist) and 92 received AVS-based treatment (46 adrenalectomy and 46 mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist).We found no differences in the intensity of antihypertensive medication required to control blood pressure between patients with CT-based treatment and those with AVS-based treatment (median daily defined doses 3.0 [IQR 1.0-5.0] vs 3.0 [1.1-5.9], p=0.52; median number of drugs 2 [IQR 1-3] vs 2 [1-3], p=0.87).Target blood pressure was reached in 39 (42%) patients and 41 (45%) patients, respectively (p=0.82).On secondary endpoints we found no differences in health-related quality of life (median RAND-36 physical scores 52.7 [IQR 43.9-56.8] vs 53.2 [44.0-56.8], p=0.83; RAND-36 mental scores 49.8 [43.1-54.6] vs 52.7 [44.9-55.5], p=0.17) for CT-based and AVS-based treatment.Biochemically, 37 (80%) of patients with CT-based adrenalectomy and 41 (89%) of those with AVS-based adrenalectomy had resolved hyperaldosteronism (p=0.25).A non-significant mean difference of 0.05 (95% CI -0.04 to 0.13) in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) was found to the advantage of the AVS group, associated with a significant increase in mean health-care costs of euro2285 per patient (95% CI 1323-3248).At a willingness-to-pay value of euro30 000 per QALY, the probability that AVS compared with CT constitutes an efficient use of health-care resources in the diagnostic work-up of patients with primary aldosteronism is less than 0.2.There was no difference in adverse events between groups (159 events of which nine were serious vs 187 events of which 12 were serious) for CT-based and AVS-based treatment.INTERPRETATION: Treatment of primary aldosteronism based on CT or AVS did not show significant differences in intensity of antihypertensive medication or clinical benefits for patients after 1 year of follow-up.This finding challenges the current recommendation to perform AVS in all patients with primary aldosteronism.FUNDING: Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development-Medical Sciences, Institute of Cardiology, Warsaw.",0,0,0,0
28049139,"A randomized phase 2 study of MK-2206 versus everolimus in refractory renal cell carcinoma.Background: Activation of the phosphoinisitide-3 kinase (PI3K) pathway through mutation and constitutive upregulation has been described in renal cell carcinoma (RCC), making it an attractive target for therapeutic intervention.We performed a randomized phase II study in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy refractory patients to determine whether MK-2206, an allosteric inhibitor of AKT, was more efficacious than the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor everolimus.Patients and methods: A total of 43 patients were randomized in a 2:1 distribution, with 29 patients assigned to the MK-2206 arm and 14 to the everolimus arm.Progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary endpoint.Results: The trial was closed at the first futility analysis with an observed PFS of 3.68 months in the MK-2206 arm and 5.98 months in the everolimus arm.Dichotomous response rate profiles were seen in the MK-2206 arm with one complete response and three partial responses in the MK-2206 arm versus none in the everolimus arm.On the other hand, progressive disease was best response in 44.8% of MK2206 versus 14.3% of everolimus-treated patients.MK-2206 induced significantly more rash and pruritis than everolimus, and dose reduction occurred in 37.9% of MK-2206 versus 21.4% of everolimus-treated patients.Genomic analysis revealed that 57.1% of the patients in the PD group had either deleterious TP53 mutations or ATM mutations or deletions.In contrast, none of the patients in the non-PD group had TP53 or ATM defects.No predictive marker for response was observed in this small dataset.Conclusions: Dichotomous outcomes are observed when VEGF therapy refractory patients are treated with MK-2206, and MK-2206 does not demonstrate superiority to everolimus.Additionally, mutations in DNA repair genes are associated with early disease progression, indicating that dysregulation of DNA repair is associated with a more aggressive tumor phenotype in RCC.",1,1,1,1

24975432,"Morphine or oxycodone for cancer-related pain? A randomized, open-label, controlled trial.CONTEXT: There is wide interindividual variation in response to morphine for cancer-related pain; 30% of patients do not have a good therapeutic outcome.Alternative opioids such as oxycodone are increasingly being used, and opioid switching has become common clinical practice.OBJECTIVES: To compare clinical response to oral morphine vs. oral oxycodone when used as first-line or second-line (after switching) treatment in patients with cancer-related pain.METHODS: In this prospective, open-label, randomized, controlled trial (ISRCTN65155201) with a selected crossover phase, patients with cancer-related pain were randomized to receive either oral morphine or oxycodone as first-line treatment.Dose was individually titrated until the patient reported adequate pain control.Patients who did not respond to the first-line opioid (either because of inadequate analgesia or unacceptable adverse effects) were switched to the alternative opioid.RESULTS: Two hundred patients were recruited.On intention-to-treat analysis (n = 198, morphine 98, oxycodone 100), there was no significant difference between the numbers of patients responding to morphine (61/98 = 62%) or oxycodone (67/100 = 67%) when used as a first-line opioid.Similarly, there was no significant difference in subsequent response when patients were switched to either morphine (8/12 = 67%) or oxycodone (11/21 = 52%).Per-protocol analysis demonstrated a 95% response rate when both opioids were available.There was no difference in adverse reaction scores between morphine and oxycodone either in first-line responders or nonresponders.CONCLUSION: In this population, there was no difference between analgesic response or adverse reactions to oral morphine and oxycodone when used as a first- or second-line opioid.These data provide evidence to support opioid switching to improve outcomes.",0,0,0,0
33444529,"Ultra-hypofractionated versus conventionally fractionated radiotherapy for prostate cancer (HYPO-RT-PC): patient-reported quality-of-life outcomes of a randomised, controlled, non-inferiority, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: The HYPO-RT-PC trial compared conventionally fractionated radiotherapy with ultra-hypofractionated radiotherapy in patients with localised prostate cancer.Ultra-hypofractionation was non-inferior to conventional fractionation regarding 5-year failure-free survival and toxicity.We aimed to assess whether patient-reported quality of life (QOL) differs between conventional fractionation and ultra-hypofractionation up to 6 years after treatment in the HYPO-RT-PC trial.METHODS: HYPO-RT-PC is a multicentre, open-label, randomised, controlled, non-inferiority, phase 3 trial done in 12 centres (seven university hospitals and five county hospitals) in Sweden and Denmark.Inclusion criteria were histologically verified intermediate-to-high-risk prostate cancer (defined as T1c-T3a with one or two of the following risk factors: stage T3a; Gleason score >/=7; and prostate-specific antigen 10-20 ng/mL with no evidence of lymph node involvement or distant metastases), age up to 75 years, and WHO performance status 0-2.Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to conventional fractionation (78.0 Gy in 39 fractions, 5 days per week for 8 weeks) or ultra-hypofractionation (42.7 Gy in seven fractions, 3 days per week for 2.5 weeks) via a minimisation algorithm with stratification by trial centre, T-stage, Gleason score, and prostate-specific antigen.QOL was measured using the validated Prostate Cancer Symptom Scale (PCSS) and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) at baseline, the end of radiotherapy, months 3, 6, 12, and 24 after radiotherapy, every other year thereafter up to 10 years, and at 15 years.The primary endpoint (failure-free survival) has been reported elsewhere.Here we report QOL, a secondary endpoint analysed in the per-protocol population, up to 6 years after radiotherapy.The HYPO-RT-PC trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, ISRCTN45905321.FINDINGS: Between July 1, 2005, and Nov 4, 2015, 1200 patients were enrolled and 1180 were randomly assigned (conventional fractionation n=591, ultra-hypofractionation n=589); 1165 patients (conventional fractionation n=582, ultra-hypofractionation n=583) were included in this QOL analysis.158 (71%) of 223 patients in the conventional fractionation group and 146 (66%) of 220 in the ultra-hypofractionation group completed questionnaires at 6 years.The median follow-up was 48 months (IQR 25-72).In seven of ten bowel symptoms or problems the proportion of patients with clinically relevant deteriorations at the end of radiotherapy was significantly higher in the ultra-hypofractionation group than in the conventional fractionation group (stool frequency [p<0.0001], rush to toilet [p=0.0013], flatulence [p=0.0013], bowel cramp [p<0.0001], mucus [p=0.0014], blood in stool [p<0.0001], and limitation in daily activity [p=0.0014]).There were no statistically significant differences in the proportions of patients with clinically relevant acute urinary symptoms or problems (total 14 items) and sexual functioning between the two treatment groups at end of radiotherapy.Thereafter, there were no clinically relevant differences in urinary, bowel, or sexual functioning between the groups.At the 6-year follow-up there was no difference in the incidence of clinically relevant deterioration between the groups for overall urinary bother (43 [33%] of 132 for conventional fractionation vs 33 [28%] of 120 for ultra-hypofractionation; mean difference 5.1% [95% CI -4.4 to 14.6]; p=0.38), overall bowel bother (43 [33%] of 129 vs 34 [28%] of 123; 5.7% [-3.8 to 15.2]; p=0.33), overall sexual bother (75 [60%] of 126 vs 59 [50%] of 117; 9.1% [-1.4 to 19.6]; p=0.15), or global health/QOL (56 [42%] of 134 vs 46 [37%] of 125; 5.0% [-5.0 to 15.0]; p=0.41).INTERPRETATION: Although acute toxicity was higher for ultra-hypofractionation than conventional fractionation, this long-term patient-reported QOL analysis shows that ultra-hypofractionation was as well tolerated as conventional fractionation up to 6 years after completion of treatment.These findings support the use of ultra-hypofractionation radiotherapy for intermediate-to-high-risk prostate cancer.FUNDING: The Nordic Cancer Union, the Swedish Cancer Society, and the Swedish Research Council.",0,0,0,0
22610153,"Extended benefit from sequential administration of docetaxel after standard fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide regimen for node-positive breast cancer: the 8-year follow-up results of the UNICANCER-PACS01 trial.PURPOSE: The initial report from the Programme Action Concertee Sein (PACS) PACS01 trial demonstrated a benefit at 5 years for disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) rates with the sequential administration of docetaxel after FEC100 (fluorouracil 500 mg/m(2), epirubicin 100 mg/m(2), and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m(2)) for patients with node-positive, operable breast cancer.We evaluate here the impact of this regimen at 8 years.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between June 1997 and March 2000, a total of 1,999 patients (age <65) with localized, resectable, non-pretreated, unilateral breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive either standard FEC100 for 6 cycles or 3 cycles of FEC100 followed by 3 cycles of 100 mg/m(2) docetaxel (FEC-D), both given every 21 days.Radiotherapy was mandatory after conservative surgery and tamoxifen was given for 5 years to hormone receptor (HR)-positive patients.Five-year DFS was the trial's main endpoint.Updated 8-year survival data are presented.RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 92.8 months, 639 patients experienced at least one event.A total number of 383 deaths were registered.Eight-year DFS rates were 65.8% with FEC alone and 70.2% with FEC-D. OS rates at 8 years were 78% with FEC alone and 83.2% with FEC-D. Cox regression analysis adjusted for age and number of positive nodes showed a 15% reduction in the relative risk of relapse and a 25% reduction in the relative risk of death in favor of FEC-D. Significant relative risk reductions were observed in the HR-positive, HER2-positive, and Ki67 >/=20% subpopulations.CONCLUSION: Benefits for DFS and OS rates with the sequential FEC-D regimen are fully confirmed at 8 years.",1,1,1,1
27957785,"A thymidylate synthase polymorphism is associated with increased risk for bone toxicity among children treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia.BACKGROUND: Bone fractures and osteonecrosis frequently complicate therapy for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).Bone toxicity has been associated with exposure to corticosteroids and methotrexate (MTX) and age greater than 10 years.We tested whether common genetic polymorphisms were associated with bone toxicity during treatment for ALL.PROCEDURE: A total of 615 of 794 children enrolled on Dana Farber Cancer Institute ALL Consortium protocol 05-001 (NCT00400946) met eligibility criteria for inclusion in this analysis.Nineteen candidate polymorphisms were selected a priori, targeting genes related to glucocorticoid metabolism, oxidative damage, and folate physiology.Polymorphisms were genotyped using either PCR-based allelic discrimination or PCR product length analysis.RESULTS: Twenty percent of subjects were homozygous for two 28 bp repeats (2R/2R, where 2R is two 28-nucleotide repeats within the 5' untranslated region [UTR] of the thymidylate synthase [TS] gene) within the 5' UTR of the gene for TS.This 2R/2R genotype was associated with increased risk of osteonecrosis among children younger than 10 years at diagnosis (multivariable hazard ratio [HR] 2.71; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.23-5.95; P = 0.013), and with bone fracture among children >/= 10 years (multivariable HR 2.10; 95% CI 1.11-3.96; P = 0.022).No significant association was observed between TS genotype and red blood cell (RBC) folate, RBC MTX, or relapse risk.CONCLUSIONS: A common genetic variant is associated with increased risk of osteonecrosis among children younger than 10 years at diagnosis and with bone fractures among older children.These findings suggest that children and adolescents with the 2R/2R TS genotype should be closely monitored for the development of bone toxicity during therapy for ALL, and support a clinical trial testing the efficacy of protective interventions specifically in this vulnerable population.",0,0,0,0

RESULTS: The dose received by normal tissues in group B was lower than that of group A (P<0.05).The recovery of the dry mouth symptoms in group B was significantly improved than group B. The quality of life (QOL) scores in group B were higher than group A. With a median follow-up of 35months, the 1-year estimated overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), locoregional failure-free survival (LRFFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) in group A versus group B were 97.9% vs 97.3%, 90.7% vs 92,2%, 99.0% vs 98.2%, 91.8% vs 94.8%.The 2-year OS, PFS, LRFFS, DMFS in group A versus group B were 93.7% vs 92.9%, 83.4% vs 84.3%, 96.8% vs 95.5%, 86.5% vs 89.5%.The 3-year OS, PFS, LRFFS, DMFS in group A versus group B were 82.3% vs 87%, 74.7% vs 83.4%, 91.8 vs 93.9%, 81.3% vs 88.6%, respectively.CONCLUSION: Reducing the IMRT target volume after IC did not reduce the local control and survival rate in locoregionally advanced NPC but the doses received by normal tissues were decreased, and the QOL scores were improved.",1,1,1,1

Part 2 assessed efficacy and safety of siltuximab plus M/P versus M/P alone.The primary end-point was progression-free survival (PFS).Progression was defined as progressive disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST), or >/= 3 new skeletal lesions with clinical deterioration or without deterioration confirmed by repeated bone scan.Rising prostate-specific antigen was not considered progression.RESULTS: Siltuximab plus M/P was well tolerated in Part 1 (n=9).In Part 2, 48 and 49 patients received siltuximab plus M/P or M/P alone, respectively.Enrolment was prematurely terminated by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee since an apparent imbalance in patient baseline characteristics (favoring the M/P only arm) made it unlikely that the study could achieve its primary efficacy end-point.Median PFS was 97 days with siltuximab combination and 228 days with M/P alone (hazard ratio, 1.72; P=0.043).Use of a novel non-validated PFS definition may have contributed to this result.Abnormal laboratory assessments were more frequent with the combination.Infection and febrile neutropenia rates were similar between groups.Greater C-reactive protein suppression was achieved during siltuximab combination treatment compared with M/P alone (P=0.0003).CONCLUSION: While siltuximab plus M/P appeared well tolerated, improvement in outcomes was not demonstrated.",0,0,0,0
30303516,"NCI 8628: A randomized phase 2 study of ziv-aflibercept and high-dose interleukin 2 or high-dose interleukin 2 alone for inoperable stage III or IV melanoma.BACKGROUND: Interleukin 2 (IL-2) is a growth factor for T and natural killer cells, promotes proinflammatory cytokines, and can lead to durable responses in patients with melanoma.Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) promotes angiogenesis and modulates host innate and adaptive immunity.High VEGF levels were found to be associated with nonresponse to IL-2.Ziv-aflibercept may deplete VEGF and thereby enhance antitumor T-cell responses, thus supporting a combination immunotherapeutic strategy with IL-2.METHODS: NCI 8628 was a phase 2 trial of ziv-aflibercept and IL-2 (arm A) versus IL-2 alone (arm B) randomized at 2:1, respectively.Eligible patients had inoperable American Joint Committee on Cancer stage III or stage IV melanoma.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS).RESULTS: A total of 89 patients were enrolled and 84 patients were treated.The median follow-up was 41.4 months.Among treated patients (55 patients in arm A and 29 patients in arm B), PFS was significantly improved in favor of arm A, with a median of 6.9 months (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 4.1-8.7 months) versus 2.3 months (95% CI, 1.6-3.5 months) (P<.001).No significant difference was noted with regard to overall survival, with a median of 26.9 months (95% CI, 14.4-63.6 months) for arm A and 24.2 months (95% CI, 11.3-36.4 months) for arm B. The response rate (according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors [RECIST]) was 22% in arm A (4 complete responses [CRs] and 8 partial responses [PRs]) and 17% in arm B (1 CR and 4 PRs).Stable disease or PR or CR was noted in 65% of patients in arm A and 48% of patients in arm B. The combination was found to be superior to monotherapy in patients with high and low levels of serum VEGF and VEGF receptor 2.Adverse events were consistent with the expected profiles of monotherapy with IL-2 and ziv-aflibercept.CONCLUSIONS: Ziv-aflibercept and IL-2 were found to significantly improve PFS compared with IL-2 alone, thereby meeting the primary endpoint of the current study.These findings support further study of immunotherapeutic combination strategies involving VEGF inhibitors.",1,1,1,1

Investigator-assessed median progression-free survival was 9.2 months (95% CI, 7.4 to 15.6) and 12.9 months (95% CI, 11.1 to not reached) in arms A and B, respectively.Independent review committee-assessed intracranial ORR in patients with measurable brain metastases at baseline was 42% (11 of 26 patients) in arm A and 67% (12 of 18 patients) in arm B. Common treatment-emergent adverse events were nausea (arm A/B, 33%/40%), diarrhea (arm A/B, 19%/38%), headache (arm A/B, 28%/27%), and cough (arm A/B, 18%/34%), and were mainly grades 1 to 2.A subset of pulmonary adverse events with early onset (median onset: day 2) occurred in 14 of 219 treated patients (all grades, 6%; grade >/= 3, 3%); none occurred after escalation to 180 mg in arm B. Seven of 14 patients were successfully retreated with brigatinib.Conclusion Brigatinib yielded substantial whole-body and intracranial responses as well as robust progression-free survival; 180 mg (with lead-in) showed consistently better efficacy than 90 mg, with acceptable safety.",1,1,1,1
24186620,"Mepilex Lite dressings for managing acute radiation dermatitis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients: a systematic controlled clinical trial.More than 60% nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients receiving the radical radiotherapy treatment will develop moist desquamation skin reaction at some time during the course of treatment.The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of Mepilex Lite dressings and the usual care in the healing of postirradiation dermatitis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients.This was a randomized controlled trial, and a sample of 88 nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients who had developed radiation dermatitis was assessed.Comparisons were made regarding parameters related to wound healing, including healing time and wound pain, and also regarding the impact of wound on the patient, including restriction of neck movement, sleep problem, and disturbance in body image.The results showed that radiation-induced dermatitis in the study group (Mepilex Lite, 43 patients) healed in a median of 16 days, which was significantly different from the healing time in the control group (median 23 days, 45 patients; P = 0.009).No statistically significant differences were detected between the 2 groups with respect to neck mobility and appearance disturbance.However, Mepilex significantly improved patients' sleep (P = 0.005).The researchers conclude that Mepilex Lite dressing provides a promising alternative to radiation dermatitis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients and is worthy of further research.",0,0,0,0
22878823,"Optimal management of malignant pleural effusions (results of CALGB 30102).The optimal strategy to achieve palliation of malignant pleural effusions (MPEs) is unknown.This multi-institutional, prospective, randomized trial compares 2 established methods for controlling symptomatic unilateral MPEs.Patients with unilateral MPEs were randomized to either daily tunneled catheter drainage (TCD) or bedside talc pleurodesis (TP).This trial is patterned after a previous randomized trial that showed that bedside TP was equivalent to thoracoscopic TP (CALGB 9334).The primary end point of the current study was combined success: consistent/reliable drainage/pleurodesis, lung expansion, and 30-day survival.A secondary end point, survival with effusion control, was added retrospectively.This trial randomized 57 patients who were similar in terms of age (62 years), active chemotherapy (28%), and histologic diagnosis (lung, 63%; breast, 12%; other/unknown cancers, 25%) to either bedside TP or TCD.Combined success was higher with TCD (62%) than with TP (46%; odds ratio, 5.0; P = .064).Multivariate regression analysis revealed that patients treated with TCD had better 30-day activity without dyspnea scores (8.7 vs. 5.9; P = .036), especially in the subgroup with impaired expansion (9.1 vs. 4.6; P = .042).Patients who underwent TCD had better survival with effusion control at 30 days compared with those who underwent TP (82% vs. 52%, respectively; P = .024).In this prospective randomized trial, TCD achieved superior palliation of unilateral MPEs than TP, particularly in patients with trapped lungs.",0,0,0,0
29117336,"Clinical and genetic predictors of paclitaxel neurotoxicity based on patient- versus clinician-reported incidence and severity of neurotoxicity in the ICON7 trial.Background: Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a dose-limiting toxicity of paclitaxel, with no reliable method to identify at-risk patients.We investigated the incidence and risk factors including genetic polymorphisms associated with the development of CIPN based on clinician and patient reporting of neuropathic symptoms.Patients and methods: Risk factors for the development of CIPN were examined in 454 patients treated with paclitaxel/carboplatin from the International Collaboration on Ovarian Neoplasms 7 (ICON7) trial.Neuropathy was graded by clinicians by standard adverse event reporting and by patients utilising OV28 questionnaire.Genetic risk factors were examined by selecting six single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes associated with microtubule function.Risk factors were assessed via dose-to-event cox regression models.Results: Grade >2 neuropathy was reported by clinicians in 28% of patients, while 67% of patients reported 'quite a bit' or 'very much' tingling or numbness.Agreement between clinicians and patients was poor (kappa = 0.236, 95% confidence interval, 0.177-0.296, P < 0.001).Older age, bevacizumab treatment and bowel resection were associated with clinician reported CIPN, while older age and volume of residual disease were associated with patient-reported neuropathy.There were no significant associations between clinician-reported neuropathy or patient-reported neuropathy and TUBB2, CEP72 or individual MAPT or GSK3B SNPs, however MAPT additive polymorphisms were associated with patient-reported neuropathy and GSK3B additive polymorphisms were associated with clinician reported CIPN.Conclusions: There was significant discordance between patient- and clinician-reported neurotoxicity.The lack of consensus regarding optimal outcome measures and whose opinion with regard to CIPN takes precedence is a limitation in the investigation of risk factors for CIPN.Care must be taken to select and include patient-reported outcome measures in CIPN assessment to enable accurate identification of genetic and other risk factors for neuropathy.",0,0,0,0

24613816,"Final results of local-regional control and late toxicity of RTOG 9003: a randomized trial of altered fractionation radiation for locally advanced head and neck cancer.PURPOSE: To test whether altered radiation fractionation schemes (hyperfractionation [HFX], accelerated fractionation, continuous [AFX-C], and accelerated fractionation with split [AFX-S]) improved local-regional control (LRC) rates for patients with squamous cell cancers (SCC) of the head and neck when compared with standard fractionation (SFX) of 70 Gy.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients with stage III or IV (or stage II base of tongue) SCC (n=1076) were randomized to 4 treatment arms: (1) SFX, 70 Gy/35 daily fractions/7 weeks; (2) HFX, 81.6 Gy/68 twice-daily fractions/7 weeks; (3) AFX-S, 67.2 Gy/42 fractions/6 weeks with a 2-week rest after 38.4 Gy; and (4) AFX-C, 72 Gy/42 fractions/6 weeks.The 3 experimental arms were to be compared with SFX.RESULTS: With patients censored for LRC at 5 years, only the comparison of HFX with SFX was significantly different: HFX, hazard ratio (HR) 0.79 (95% confidence interval 0.62-1.00), P=.05; AFX-C, 0.82 (95% confidence interval 0.65-1.05), P=.11.With patients censored at 5 years, HFX improved overall survival (HR 0.81, P=.05).Prevalence of any grade 3, 4, or 5 toxicity at 5 years; any feeding tube use after 180 days; or feeding tube use at 1 year did not differ significantly when the experimental arms were compared with SFX.When 7-week treatments were compared with 6-week treatments, accelerated fractionation appeared to increase grade 3, 4 or 5 toxicity at 5 years (P=.06).When the worst toxicity per patient was considered by treatment only, the AFX-C arm seemed to trend worse than the SFX arm when grade 0-2 was compared with grade 3-5 toxicity (P=.09).CONCLUSIONS: At 5 years, only HFX improved LRC and overall survival for patients with locally advanced SCC without increasing late toxicity.",0,0,0,0
23167843,"Let-7 miRNA-binding site polymorphism in the KRAS 3'UTR; colorectal cancer screening population prevalence and influence on clinical outcome in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin +/- cetuximab.BACKGROUND: Recent studies have reported associations between a variant allele in a let-7 microRNA complementary site (LCS6) within the 3'untranslated region (3'UTR) of KRAS (rs61764370) and clinical outcome in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients receiving cetuximab.The variant allele has also been associated with increased cancer risk.We aimed to reveal the incidence of the variant allele in a colorectal cancer screening population and to investigate the clinical relevance of the variant allele in mCRC patients treated with 1st line Nordic FLOX (bolus 5-fluorouracil/folinic acid and oxaliplatin) +/- cetuximab.METHODS: The feasibility of the variant allele as a risk factor for CRC was investigated by comparing the LCS6 gene frequencies in 197 CRC patients, 1060 individuals with colorectal polyps, and 358 healthy controls.The relationship between clinical outcome and LCS6 genotype was analyzed in 180 mCRC patients receiving Nordic FLOX and 355 patients receiving Nordic FLOX + cetuximab in the NORDIC-VII trial (NCT00145314).RESULTS: LCS6 frequencies did not vary between CRC patients (23%), individuals with polyps (20%), and healthy controls (20%) (P = 0.50).No statistically significant differences were demonstrated in the NORDIC-VII cohort even if numerically increased progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were found in patients with the LCS6 variant allele (8.5 (95% CI: 7.3-9.7 months) versus 7.8 months (95% CI: 7.4-8.3 months), P = 0.16 and 23.5 (95% CI: 21.6-25.4 months) versus 19.5 months (95% CI: 17.8-21.2 months), P = 0.31, respectively).Addition of cetuximab seemed to improve response rate more in variant carriers than in wild-type carriers (from 35% to 57% versus 44% to 47%), however the difference was not statistically significant (interaction P = 0.16).CONCLUSIONS: The LCS6 variant allele does not seem to be a risk factor for development of colorectal polyps or CRC.No statistically significant effect of the LCS6 variant allele on response rate, PFS or OS was found in mCRC patients treated with 1st line Nordic FLOX +/- cetuximab.",0,0,0,0

25848883,"High definition bronchoscopy: a randomized exploratory study of diagnostic value compared to standard white light bronchoscopy and autofluorescence bronchoscopy.BACKGROUND: Videobronchoscopy is an essential diagnostic procedure for evaluation of the central airways and pivotal for the diagnosis and staging of lung cancer.Technological improvements have resulted in high definition (HD) images with advanced real time image enhancement techniques (i-scan).OBJECTIVES: In this study we aimed to explore the sensitivity of HD+ i-scan bronchoscopy for detection of epithelial changes like vascular abnormalities and suspicious preinvasive lesions, and tumors.METHODS: In patients scheduled for a therapeutic or diagnostic procedure under general anesthesia videos of the bronchial tree were made using 5 videobronchoscopy modes in random order: normal white light videobronchoscopy (WLB), HD-bronchoscopy (HD), HD bronchoscopy with surface enhancement technique (i-scan1), HD with surface- and tone enhancement technique (i-scan2) and dual mode autofluorescence videobronchoscopy (AFB).The videos were scored in random order by two independent and blinded expert bronchoscopists.RESULTS: In 29 patients all videos were available for analysis.Vascular abnormalities were scored most frequently in HD + i-scan2 bronchoscopy (1.33 +/- 0.29 abnormal or suspicious sites per patient) as compared to 0.12 +/-0.05 site for AFB (P = 0.003).Sites suspicious for preinvasive lesions were most frequently reported using AFB (0.74 +/- 0.12 sites per patient) as compared to 0.17 +/-0.06 for both WLB and HD bronchoscopy (P = 0.003).Tumors were detected equally by all modalities.The preferred modality was HD bronchoscopy with i-scan (tone- plus surface and surface enhancement in respectively 38% and 35% of cases P = 0.006).CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that high definition bronchoscopy with image enhancement technique may result in better detection of subtle vascular abnormalities in the airways.Since these abnormalities may be related to preneoplastic lesions and tumors this is of clinical relevance.Further investigations using this technique relating imaging to histology are warranted.",0,0,0,0
24123482,"Mediators of physical exercise for improvement in cancer survivors' quality of life.OBJECTIVE: Mediating mechanisms of a 12-week group-based exercise intervention on cancer survivors' quality of life (QoL) were examined to inform future exercise intervention development.METHODS: Two hundred nine cancer survivors >/= 3 months posttreatment (57% breast cancer) aged 49.5 (+/- 10.4) years were assigned to physical exercise (n = 147) or wait-list control (n = 62).QoL, fatigue, emotional distress, physical activity, general self-efficacy and mastery were assessed at baseline and post-intervention using questionnaires.Path analysis was conducted using Mplus to explore whether improved physical activity, general self-efficacy and mastery mediated the effects of exercise on fatigue and distress and consequently QoL. RESULTS: The intervention was associated with increased physical activity (beta = 0.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.14;0.59), general self-efficacy (beta = 2.41, 95%CI = 0.35;4.73), and mastery (beta = 1.75, 95%CI = 0.36;2.78).Further, the intervention had both a direct effect on fatigue (beta = -1.09, 95%CI = -2.12;0.01), and an indirect effect (beta = -0.54, 95%CI = -1.00;-0.21) via physical activity (beta = -0.29, 95%CI = -0.64;-0.07) and general self-efficacy (beta = -0.25, 95%CI = -0.61;-0.05).The intervention had a borderline significant direct effect on reduced distress (beta = -1.32, 95%CI = -2.68;0.11), and a significant indirect effect via increased general self-efficacy and mastery (beta = -1.06, 95%CI = -1.89;-0.38).Reductions in fatigue (beta = -1.33, 95%CI =-1.85;-0.83) and distress (beta = -0.86, 95%CI = -1.25;-0.52) were associated with improved QoL. Further, increased physical activity was directly associated with improved QoL (beta = 3.37, 95%CI = 1.01;5.54).CONCLUSION: The beneficial effect of group-based physical exercise on QoL was mediated by increased physical activity, general self-efficacy and mastery, and subsequent reductions in fatigue and distress.In addition to physical activity, future interventions should target self-efficacy and mastery.This may lead to reduced distress and fatigue, and consequently improved QoL of cancer survivors.",1,1,0,0
28341958,"Randomized phase II study comparing weekly docetaxel-cisplatin vs. gemcitabine-cisplatin in elderly or poor performance status patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.BACKGROUND: Docetaxel/cisplatin (DP) and gemcitabine/cisplatin (GP) are standard treatment regimens for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).In spite of potent efficacy, the conventional 1-day DP is regarded as having more toxicity as compared with GP.There is increasing interest in a biweekly split administration of DP to reduce its toxicity.Hypothesis was that first-line biweekly DP is as safe as GP in the elderly or poor performance status (PS) patients.METHODS: Chemotherapy-naive patients with advanced NSCLC (IIIB/IV) who were elderly (65<) or PS (ECOG 2) were randomized to DP or GP arm by balancing for ECOG (0-1 vs. 2) and stage (IIIB vs. IV).DP comprised docetaxel (35 mg/m(2))/cisplatin (30 mg/m(2)) iv on days 1 and 8, every 3 weeks.GP comprised gemcitabine (1000 mg/m(2))/cisplatin (30 mg/m(2)) iv on days 1 and 8, every 3 weeks.Chemotherapy lasted up to 4-6 cycles or until progression.Primary endpoint was safety (proportion of grade 3/4 toxicities).Planned sample size was 49 patients in each arm.RESULTS: From November 2009 to August 2012, a total of 99 patients were randomized (DP 50/GP 49) from nine institutions.Adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma were observed in 62% and 33% of patients, respectively.Toxicity profiles were comparable for both arms and the differences were not statistically significant except for anemia and leucocytopenia.Any grade of anemia (86 vs. 98%) and of leucocytopenia (18 vs. 43%) was more common in the GP arm with statistical significance.Oral mucositis tended to be predominant in the DP arm.Patients in the DP arm (51%) suffered grade 3 or higher toxicities as did 47% in the GP arm (47%).The most common grade 3 or higher toxicities were as follows: In the DP arm, neutropenia (8%), leucopenia (8%), anemia (4%), pneumonia with normal ANC (4%) and febrile neutropenia (2%) were observed.In the GP arm, anemia (15%), neutropenia (15%), pneumonia with normal ANC (4%), thrombocytopenia (4%) and leucopenia (2%) were observed.The best overall response rates (CR + PR) for the DP and GP arms were 20.0 and 21% with no CR, respectively, and disease control rates (CR + PR + SD) were 70.0 and 76%, respectively.Median progression-free survival and median overall survival were 3.7 and 14.9 months in the DP arm and 5.6 and 20.8 months in the GP arm, respectively.CONCLUSION: This study showed that DP is similar to GP in terms of efficacy and toxicity in treatment of elderly or poor performance patients.Both regimens showed similar grade 3/4 toxicities with different profiles.",1,1,1,0
25320361,"Tadalafil reduces myeloid-derived suppressor cells and regulatory T cells and promotes tumor immunity in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.PURPOSE: Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and regulatory T cells (Treg) play a key role in the progression of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).On the basis of our preclinical data demonstrating that phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibition can modulate these cell populations, we evaluated whether the PDE5 inhibitor tadalafil can revert tumor-induced immunosuppression and promote tumor immunity in patients with HNSCC.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: First, we functionally and phenotypically characterized MDSCs in HNSCCs and determined, retrospectively, whether their presence at the tumor site correlates with recurrence.Then, we performed a prospective single-center, double-blinded, randomized, three-arm study in which patients with HNSCC undergoing definitive surgical resection of oral and oropharyngeal tumors were treated with tadalafil 10 mg/day, 20 mg/day, or placebo for at least 20 days preoperatively.Blood and tumor MDSC and Treg presence and CD8(+) T-cell reactivity to tumor antigens were evaluated before and after treatment.RESULTS: MDSCs were characterized in HNSCC and their intratumoral presence significantly correlates with recurrence.Tadalafil treatment was well tolerated and significantly reduced both MDSCs and Treg concentrations in the blood and in the tumor (P < 0.05).In addition, the concentration of blood CD8(+) T cells reactive to autologous tumor antigens significantly increased after treatment (P < 0.05).Tadalafil immunomodulatory activity was maximized at an intermediate dose but not at higher doses.Mechanistic analysis suggests a possible off-target effect on PDE11 at high dosages that, by increasing intracellular cAMP, may negatively affect antitumor immunity.CONCLUSIONS: Tadalafil seems to beneficially modulate the tumor micro- and macro-environment in patients with HNSCC by lowering MDSCs and Tregs and increasing tumor-specific CD8(+) T cells in a dose-dependent fashion.",0,0,0,0

31513453,"The NEOLETEXE trial: a neoadjuvant cross-over study exploring the lack of cross resistance between aromatase inhibitors.The aromatase inhibitor letrozole (Femar((R))/Femara((R))) and the aromatase inactivator exemestane (Aromasin((R))) differ in their biochemical effect on the aromatase enzyme.Letrozole is a competitive aromatase inhibitor while exemestane binds irreversibly to the aromatase enzyme.This pharmacological difference is of clinical interest since a lack of cross-resistance has been documented.It has been demonstrated in several clinical trials that exemestane may cause a disease regression following resistance to nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors.The exact mechanism(s) behind this phenomenon is yet unknown.Here, we present the NEOLETEXE trial with the aim of exploring the individual mechanisms involved behind the observed lack of cross resistance.Clinical trial registration: The trial has been approved by the Regional Ethics Committee of South-East Norway (project number 2015/84).",0,0,0,0
23008288,"Association between circulating tumor cells and prognosis in patients with stage III melanoma with sentinel lymph node metastasis in a phase III international multicenter trial.PURPOSE: The outcomes of patients with melanoma who have sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastases can be highly variable, which has precluded establishment of consensus regarding treatment of the group.The detection of high-risk patients from this clinical setting may be helpful for determination of both prognosis and management.We report the utility of multimarker reverse-transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) detection of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in patients with melanoma diagnosed with SLN metastases in a phase III, international, multicenter clinical trial.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Blood specimens were collected from patients with melanoma (n = 331) who were clinically disease-free after complete lymphadenectomy (CLND) before entering onto a randomized adjuvant melanoma vaccine plus bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) versus BCG placebo trial from 30 melanoma centers (United States and international).Blood was assessed using a verified multimarker RT-qPCR assay (MART-1, MAGE-A3, and GalNAc-T) of melanoma-associated proteins.Cox regression analyses were used to evaluate the prognostic significance of CTC status for disease recurrence and melanoma-specific survival (MSS).RESULTS: Individual CTC biomarker detection ranged from 13.4% to 17.5%.There was no association of CTC status (zero to one positive biomarkers v two or more positive biomarkers) with known clinical or pathologic prognostic variables.However, two or more positive biomarkers was significantly associated with worse distant metastasis disease-free survival (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.13, P = .009) and reduced recurrence-free survival (HR = 1.70, P = .046) and MSS (HR = 1.88, P = .043) in a multivariable analysis.CONCLUSION: CTC biomarker status is a prognostic factor for recurrence-free survival, distant metastasis disease-free survival, and MSS after CLND in patients with SLN metastasis.This multimarker RT-qPCR analysis may therefore be useful in discriminating patients who may benefit from aggressive adjuvant therapy or stratifying patients for adjuvant clinical trials.",0,0,0,0

They were at least one-year post-diagnosis with BC.Controls received no further intervention.We tested the effect of intervention on breast-cancer-specific well-being and trauma symptoms as primary outcomes, and several secondary outcomes.In exploratory analyses, we tested whether responding to their diagnosis as a traumatic stressor moderated outcomes.RESULTS: We found that, compared with the control group, receiving a peer-counseling intervention significantly improved breast-cancer-specific well-being (p=0.01, Cohen's d=0.41) and maintained marital adjustment (p=0.01, Cohen's d=0.45) more effectively.Experiencing the diagnosis as a traumatic stressor moderated outcomes: those with a peer counselor in the traumatic stressor group improved significantly more than controls on well-being, trauma and depression symptoms, and cancer self-efficacy.CONCLUSIONS: Having a peer counselor trained and supervised to recognize and work with trauma symptoms can improve well-being and psychosocial morbidity during the first year following diagnosis of BC.Cancer 2016;122:2408-2417.(c) 2016 American Cancer Society.",0,0,0,0
24827123,"ABVD (8 cycles) versus BEACOPP (4 escalated cycles >/= 4 baseline): final results in stage III-IV low-risk Hodgkin lymphoma (IPS 0-2) of the LYSA H34 randomized trial.BACKGROUND: Treatment with escalated BEACOPP achieved a superior time to treatment failure over ABVD in patients with disseminated Hodgkin lymphoma.However, recent clinical trials have failed to confirm BEACOPP overall survival (OS) superiority over ABVD.In addition, the gain in low-risk patients is still a matter of debate.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We randomly compared ABVD (8 cycles) with BEACOPP (escalated 4 cycles >/= baseline 4 cycles) in low-risk patients with an International Prognostic Score (IPS) of 0-2.The primary end point was event-free survival (EFS).This parallel group, open-label phase 3 trial was registered under #RECF0219 at French National Cancer Institute.RESULTS: One hundred and fifty patients were randomized in this trial (ABVD 80, BEACOPP 70): 28 years was the median age, 50% were male and IPS was 0-1 for 64%.Complete remission rate was 85% for ABVD and 90% for BEACOPP.Progression or relapses were more frequent in the ABVD patients than in the BEACOPP patients (17 versus 5 patients).With a median follow-up period of 5.5 years, seven patients died: six in the ABVD arm and one in the BEACOPP arm (HL 3 and 0, 2nd cancer 2 and 1, accident 1 and 0).The EFS at 5 years was estimated at 62% for ABVD versus 77%, for BEACOPP [hazards ratio (HR) = 0.6, P = 0.07].The progression-free survival (PFS) at 5 years was 75% versus 93% (HR = 0.3, P = 0.007).The OS at 5 years was 92% versus 99% (HR = 0.18, P = 0.06).CONCLUSION: Fewer progressions/relapses were observed with BEACOPP, demonstrating the high efficacy of the more intensive regimen, even in low-risk patients.However, additional considerations, balancing treatment-related toxicity and late morbidity due to salvage may help with decision-making with regard to treatment with ABVD or BEACOPP.",0,0,0,0
30316737,"Comparison of the Effect of Intermittent and Continuous Aerobic Physical Training on Sexual Function of Women With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome: Randomized Controlled Trial.BACKGROUND: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common condition characterized by hyperandrogenism, anthropometric changes (increased weight and waist-to-hip ratio [WHR]), behavioral changes (sexual dysfunction, anxiety, and depression), and reduced quality of life.Physical exercise may reduce many of the adverse effects of PCOS.However, no studies have yet evaluated the effects of aerobic exercise on the sexual function of women with PCOS.AIM: To compare the effects of continuous and intermittent aerobic physical training on the sexual function and mood of women with PCOS.METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of a controlled clinical trial in which women with PCOS (18-39 years of age) were randomly allocated to 1 of 3 groups for 16 weeks: continuous aerobic training (CAT, n = 23), intermittent aerobic training (IAT, n = 22), or no training (control group, n = 24).The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) was used to assess sexual function, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to assess anxiety and depression.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The main outcome measure used was the FSFI.OUTCOMES: The primary outcomes were changes from baseline in total FSFI score and HAD scores at week 16 to prove the superiority of intermittent aerobic exercise compared with continuous aerobic exercise.RESULTS: After 16 weeks, the CAT group had a significant increase in the total FSFI score, improvements in the FSFI domains of satisfaction and pain, and a reduction in the WHR.The CAT and IAT groups also had significantly lower levels of testosterone after 16 weeks.The IAT group had a significant increase in the total FSFI score and improvements in the desire, excitation, lubrication, orgasm, and satisfaction FSFI domains.The CAT and IAT groups both had significant reductions in anxiety and depression scores after 16 weeks.CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Aerobic physical training protocols could be indicated to promote mental and sexual health in women with PCOS.STRENGTH & LIMITATIONS: This is one of the first studies to examine the effects of different physical training protocols on the sexual function of women with PCOS.The limitations of this study are that we did not consider diet or the frequency of sexual relations of participants with their partners.These factors could have interfered with the outcomes.CONCLUSION: The CAT and IAT protocols improved the sexual function and reduced the anxiety and depression of women with PCOS.Both protocols were similar to improve FSFI domain scores.Lopes IP, Ribeiro VB, Reis RM, et al.

A 15- to 20-point change in global QoL and functional scale scores predicted change in tumour status as did change in fatigue, pain and appetite loss scores.Smaller QoL changes (5-15 points) predicted PS change.Results were similar in patients regardless of baseline disease measurability.CONCLUSIONS: Our study underscores the importance of disease control for maintaining or improving QoL. These data could improve future trial design and routine clinical care for patients receiving therapy for previously treated gastric cancer.NCT00917384, NCT01170663.",0,0,0,0

32341031,"Single-Cell Circulating Tumor Cell Analysis Reveals Genomic Instability as a Distinctive Feature of Aggressive Prostate Cancer.PURPOSE: Aggressive variant prostate cancer (AVPC) represents a clinical subset distinguished by therapy resistance and poor prognosis, linked to combined losses of the tumor suppressor genes (TSG) PTEN, RB1, and TP53.Circulating tumor cells (CTC) provide a minimally invasive opportunity for identification and molecular characterization of AVPC.We aimed to evaluate the incidence and clinical significance of compound (2+)TSG losses and genomic instability in prostate cancer CTC, and to expand the set genomic biomarkers relevant to AVPC.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Genomic analysis of chromosomal copy-number alterations (CNA) at single-cell resolution was performed in CTC from patients with and without AVPC before initiating chemotherapy with cabazitaxel or cabazitaxel and carboplatin.We evaluated associations between single-CTC genomics and clinical features, progression-free survival, and overall survival.RESULTS: A total of 257 individual CTC were sequenced from 47 patients (1-22 CTC/patient).Twenty patients (42.6%) had concurrent 2+TSG losses in at least one CTC in association with poor survival and increased genomic instability, inferred by high large-scale transitions scores.Higher LST in CTC were independent of CTC enumerated, clinically more indicative of aggressive behavior than co-occurring TSG losses, and molecularly associated with gains in chromosomal regions including PTK2, Myc, and NCOA2; increased androgen receptor expression; and BRCA2 loss.In 57 patients with matched cell-free tumor DNA data, CTC were more frequently detectable and evaluable for CNA analysis (in 73.7% vs. 42.1%, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that genomic instability in CTC is a hallmark of advanced prostate cancer aggressiveness, and support single-CTC sequencing as a compelling tool to noninvasively characterize cancer heterogeneity.",0,0,0,0

26897518,"TOPical Imiquimod treatment of high-grade Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (TOPIC trial): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) is the premalignant condition of cervical cancer.Whereas not all high grade CIN lesions progress to cervical cancer, the natural history and risk of progression of individual lesions remain unpredictable.Therefore, high-grade CIN is currently treated by surgical excision: large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ).This procedure has potential complications, such as acute haemorrhage, prolonged bleeding, infection and preterm birth in subsequent pregnancies.These complications could be prevented by development of a non-invasive treatment modality, such as topical imiquimod treatment.The primary study objective is to investigate the efficacy of topical imiquimod 5% cream for the treatment of high-grade CIN and to develop a biomarker profile to predict clinical response to imiquimod treatment.Secondary study objectives are to assess treatment side-effects, disease recurrence and quality of life during and after different treatment modalities.METHODS/DESIGN: The study design is a randomized controlled trial.One hundred forty women with a histological diagnosis of high-grade CIN (CIN 2-3) will be randomized into two arms: imiquimod treatment during 16 weeks (experimental arm) or immediate LLETZ (standard care arm).Treatment efficacy will be evaluated by colposcopy with diagnostic biopsies at 20 weeks for the experimental arm.Successful imiquimod treatment is defined as regression to CIN 1 or less, successful LLETZ treatment is defined as PAP 1 after 6 months.Disease recurrence will be evaluated by cytology at 6, 12 and 24 months after treatment.Side-effects will be evaluated using a standardized report form.Quality of life will be evaluated using validated questionnaires at baseline, 20 weeks and 1 year after treatment.Biomarkers, reflecting both host and viral factors in the pathophysiology of CIN, will be tested at baseline with the aim of developing a predictive biomarker profile for the clinical response to imiquimod treatment.DISCUSSION: Treatment of high-grade CIN lesions with imiquimod in a selected patient population may diminish complications as a result of surgical intervention.More knowledge on treatment efficacy, side effects and long-term recurrence rates after treatment is necessary.TRIAL REGISTRATION: EU Clinical Trials Register EU-CTR2013-001260-34 .Registered 18 March 2013.Medical Ethical Committee approval number: NL44336.068.13 (Medical Ethical Committee Maastricht University Hospital, University of Maastricht).Affiliation: Maastricht University Hospital.Registration number ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02329171.",1,1,1,1
27951450,"Dose-dense adjuvant chemotherapy in premenopausal breast cancer patients: A pooled analysis of the MIG1 and GIM2 phase III studies.BACKGROUND: No evidence exists to recommend a specific chemotherapy regimen in young breast cancer patients.We performed a pooled analysis of two randomised clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of adjuvant dose-dense chemotherapy in premenopausal breast cancer patients and its impact on the risk of treatment-induced amenorrhoea.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the MIG1 study, node-positive or high-risk node-negative patients were randomised to 6 cycles of fluorouracil/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide every 2 (dose-dense) or 3 (standard-interval) weeks.In the GIM2 study, node-positive patients were randomised to 4 cycles of dose-dense or standard-interval EC or FEC followed by 4 cycles of dose-dense or standard-interval paclitaxel.Using individual patient data, the hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival by means of a Cox proportional hazards model and the odds ratio for treatment-induced amenorrhoea through a logistic regression model were calculated for each study.A meta-analysis of the two studies was performed using the random effect model to compute the parameter estimates.RESULTS: A total of 1,549 patients were included.Dose-dense chemotherapy was associated with a significant improved overall survival as compared to standard-interval chemotherapy (HR, 0.71; 95% confidence intervals [CI], 0.54-0.95; p = 0.021).The pooled HRs were 0.78 (95% CI, 0.54-1.12) and 0.65 (95% CI, 0.40-1.06) for patients with hormone receptor-positive and -negative tumours, respectively (interaction p = 0.330).No increased risk of treatment-induced amenorrhoea was observed with dose-dense chemotherapy (odds ratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.80-1.25; p = 0.989).CONCLUSION: Dose-dense adjuvant chemotherapy may be considered the preferred treatment option in high-risk premenopausal breast cancer patients.",1,1,1,1

22795435,"American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z4099/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 1021: a randomized study of sublobar resection compared with stereotactic body radiotherapy for high-risk stage I non-small cell lung cancer.During the past decade, tremendous interest has arisen in the use of nonoperative therapies for patients with non-small cell lung cancer.Of these therapies, stereotactic body radiotherapy has become established as an effective modality for treating peripheral cancer in medically inoperable patients.Toxicity is low, and the treatment is effective, with excellent local control rates.Several investigators have suggested that stereotactic body radiotherapy could be effective for high-risk operable patients (usually treated with sublobar resection) and even perhaps for standard-risk operable patients (usually treated with lobectomy); however, this is less accepted.A direct comparison of stereotactic body radiotherapy and sublobar resection is difficult for a number of reasons.These include different definitions of recurrence, different populations of patients in these studies (with those undergoing stereotactic body radiotherapy tending to be the medically inoperable group), and different methods of classifying morbidity in the surgical and radiation oncology studies.Imaging follow-up has also not been standardized among the studies.Thus, a randomized study is necessary and timely.Investigators from the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group and the Radiation Therapy and Oncology Group have collaborated to develop a phase III randomized study comparing stereotactic body radiotherapy and sublobar resection (with or without brachytherapy) for high-risk operable patients with non-small cell lung cancer.This study (American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z4099/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 1021) has recently opened for accrual.It is hoped that this will help to better define the role of these therapies for patients with non-small cell lung cancer.",0,0,0,0

29648580,"Bevacizumab plus hypofractionated radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone in elderly patients with glioblastoma: the randomized, open-label, phase II ARTE trial.Background: The addition of bevacizumab to temozolomide-based chemoradiotherapy (TMZ/RT --> TMZ) did not prolong overall survival (OS) in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma in phase III trials.Elderly and frail patients are underrepresented in clinical trials, but early reports suggested preferential benefit in this population.Patients and methods: ARTE was a 2 : 1 randomized, multi-center, open-label, non-comparative phase II trial of hypofractionated RT (40 Gy in 15 fractions) with bevacizumab (10 mg/kgx14 days) (arm A, N = 50) or without bevacizumab (arm B, N = 25) in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma aged >/=65 years.The primary objective was to obtain evidence for prolongation of median OS by the addition of bevacizumab to RT.Response was assessed by RANO criteria.Quality of life (QoL) was monitored by the EORTC QLQ-C30/BN20 modules.Exploratory studies included molecular subtyping by 450k whole methylome and gene expression analyses.Results: Median PFS was longer in arm A than in arm B (7.6 and 4.8 months, P = 0.003), but OS was similar (12.1 and 12.2 months, P = 0.77).Clinical deterioration was delayed and more patients came off steroids in arm A. Prolonged PFS in arm A was confined to tumors with the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) I methylation subtype (HR 0.25, P = 0.014) and proneural gene expression (HR 0.29, P = 0.025).In a Cox model of OS controlling for established prognostic factors, associations with more favorable outcome were identified for age <70 years (HR 0.52, P = 0.018) and Karnofsky performance score 90%-100% (HR 0.51, P = 0.026).Including molecular subtypes into that model identified an association of the RTK II gene methylation subtype with inferior OS (HR 1.73, P = 0.076).Conclusion: Efficacy outcomes and exploratory analyses of ARTE do not support the hypothesis that the addition of bevacizumab to RT generally prolongs survival in elderly glioblastoma patients.Molecular biomarkers may identify patients with preferential benefit from bevacizumab.Clinical trial registration number: NCT01443676.",1,1,1,1

26474517,"Cediranib combined with carboplatin and paclitaxel in patients with metastatic or recurrent cervical cancer (CIRCCa): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial.BACKGROUND: Patients treated with standard chemotherapy for metastatic or relapsed cervical cancer respond poorly to conventional chemotherapy (response achieved in 20-30% of patients) with an overall survival of less than 1 year.High tumour angiogenesis and high concentrations of intratumoural VEGF are adverse prognostic features.Cediranib is a potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor of VEGFR1, 2, and 3.In this trial, we aimed to assess the effect of the addition of cediranib to carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy in patients with metastatic or recurrent cervical cancer.METHODS: In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial, which was done in 17 UK cancer treatment centres, patients aged 18 years or older initially diagnosed with metastatic carcinoma or who subsequently developed metastatic disease or local pelvic recurrence after radical treatment that was not amenable to exenterative surgery were recruited.Eligible patients received carboplatin AUC of 5 plus paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2) by infusion every 3 weeks for a maximum of six cycles and were randomised centrally (1:1) through a minimisation approach to receive cediranib 20 mg or placebo orally once daily until disease progression.The stratification factors were disease site, disease-free survival after primary therapy or primary stage IVb disease, number of lines of previous treatment, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, and investigational site.All patients, investigators, and trial personnel were masked to study drug allocation.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival.Efficacy analysis was by intention to treat, and the safety analysis included all patients who received at least one dose of study drug.This trial is registered with the ISCRTN registry, number ISRCTN23516549, and has been completed.FINDINGS: Between Aug 19, 2010, and July 27, 2012, 69 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to cediranib (n=34) or placebo (n=35).After a median follow-up of 24.2 months (IQR 21.9-29.5), progression-free survival was longer in the cediranib group (median 8.1 months [80% CI 7.4-8.8]) than in the placebo group (6.7 months [6.2-7.2]), with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.58 (80% CI 0.40-0.85; one-sided p=0.032).Grade 3 or worse adverse events that occurred in the concurrent chemotherapy and trial drug period in more than 10% of patients were diarrhoea (five [16%] of 32 patients in the cediranib group vs one [3%] of 35 patients in the placebo group), fatigue (four [13%] vs two [6%]), leucopenia (five [16%] vs three [9%]), neutropenia (10 [31%] vs four [11%]), and febrile neutropenia (five [16%] vs none).The incidence of grade 2-3 hypertension was higher in the cediranib group than in the control group (11 [34%] vs four [11%]).Serious adverse events occurred in 18 patients in the placebo group and 19 patients in the cediranib group.INTERPRETATION: Cediranib has significant efficacy when added to carboplatin and paclitaxel in the treatment of metastatic or recurrent cervical cancer.This finding was accompanied by an increase in toxic effects (mainly diarrhoea, hypertension, and febrile neutropenia).FUNDING: Cancer Research UK and AstraZeneca.",0,0,0,0
34656227,"Nivolumab versus placebo in patients with relapsed malignant mesothelioma (CONFIRM): a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: No phase 3 trial has yet shown improved survival for patients with pleural or peritoneal malignant mesothelioma who have progressed following platinum-based chemotherapy.The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of nivolumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody, in these patients.METHODS: This was a multicentre, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel group, randomised, phase 3 trial done in 24 hospitals in the UK.Adult patients (aged >/=18 years) with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, with histologically confirmed pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma, who had received previous first-line platinum-based chemotherapy and had radiological evidence of disease progression, were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive nivolumab at a flat dose of 240 mg every 2 weeks over 30 min intravenously or placebo until disease progression or a maximum of 12 months.The randomisation sequence was generated within an interactive web response system (Alea); patients were stratified according to epithelioid versus non-epithelioid histology and were assigned in random block sizes of 3 and 6.Participants and treating clinicians were masked to group allocation.The co-primary endpoints were investigator-assessed progression-free survival and overall survival, analysed according to the treatment policy estimand (an equivalent of the intention-to-treat principle).All patients who were randomly assigned were included in the safety population, reported according to group allocation.This trial is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT03063450.FINDINGS: Between May 10, 2017, and March 30, 2020, 332 patients were recruited, of whom 221 (67%) were randomly assigned to the nivolumab group and 111 (33%) were assigned to the placebo group).Median follow-up was 11.6 months (IQR 7.2-16.8).Median progression-free survival was 3.0 months (95% CI 2.8-4.1) in the nivolumab group versus 1.8 months (1.4-2.6) in the placebo group (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.67 [95% CI 0.53-0.85; p=0.0012).Median overall survival was 10.2 months (95% CI 8.5-12.1) in the nivolumab group versus 6.9 months (5.0-8.0) in the placebo group (adjusted HR 0.69 [95% CI 0.52-0.91]; p=0.0090).The most frequently reported grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events were diarrhoea (six [3%] of 221 in the nivolumab group vs two [2%] of 111 in the placebo group) and infusion-related reaction (six [3%] vs none).Serious adverse events occurred in 90 (41%) patients in the nivolumab group and 49 (44%) patients in the placebo group.There were no treatment-related deaths in either group.INTERPRETATION: Nivolumab represents a treatment that might be beneficial to patients with malignant mesothelioma who have progressed on first-line therapy.FUNDING: Stand up to Cancer-Cancer Research UK and Bristol Myers Squibb.",0,0,0,0
26878247,"Dual-focus versus conventional magnification endoscopy for the diagnosis of superficial squamous neoplasms in the pharynx and esophagus: a randomized trial.BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Conventional magnification narrow-band imaging (CM-NBI) endoscopy has demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy for superficial squamous neoplasms in the pharynx and esophagus.This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic utility of the newly developed dual-focus NBI (DF-NBI) compared with that of CM-NBI.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We recruited patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in the head and neck, or esophagus, or with a history of SCC.The primary endpoint of this prospective controlled non-inferiority trial was the sensitivity of DF-NBI and CM-NBI for detecting superficial carcinoma in the pharynx and esophagus.Secondary endpoints included other diagnostic values and the resolving power of each endoscope.Superficial carcinoma was defined as high grade dysplasia and SCC invading up to the submucosal layer.RESULTS: The study included 93 patients.A total of 28 superficial carcinomas were detected in the pharynx and esophagus.The sensitivities of DF-NBI and CM-NBI for superficial carcinoma were 82 % and 71 %, respectively.The lower limit of the 90 % confidence interval for the difference between the sensitivities exceeded the non-inferiority threshold.The specificity and overall accuracy of DF-NBI vs. CM-NBI were 93 % vs. 90 % and 91 % vs. 86 %, respectively (both non-significant differences).The maximum resolving power of a conventional magnification endoscope was significantly higher than a dual-focus endoscope (7.2 microm vs. 11.6 microm: P < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate the non-inferiority of DF-NBI versus CM-NBI in detecting superficial carcinoma in the pharynx and esophagus.DF-NBI appears to have a resolving power that, although significantly lower, is sufficient to achieve high diagnostic accuracy, comparable to that of CM-NBI.University Hospital Medical Information Network (UMIN, No. 000007585).",0,0,0,0
27368915,"Comparison of dosimetric parameters and acute toxicity of intensity-modulated and three-dimensional radiotherapy in patients with cervix carcinoma: A randomized prospective study.PURPOSE: The use of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) to treat cervix carcinoma has increased, however prospective randomized trials are still lacking.AIM: To compare the dosimetric parameters and associated acute toxicity in patients with cervix carcinoma treated with three-dimensional (3D) conformal radiotherapy and IMRT.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty patients were randomized in two arms each consisting of 20 patients.Patients in both arms received concurrent chemoradiation (cisplatin 40mg/m(2) weekly; 50Gy/25 fractions).Patients were treated with 3D conformal radiotherapy in one arm and with IMRT in another arm.After external beam radiotherapy, all patients received brachytherapy (21Gy/3 fractions at weekly interval).For dosimetric comparison, both kinds of the plans were done for all the patients.All patients were assessed throughout and until 90 days after completion of treatment for acute gastrointestinal, genitourinary and hematologic toxicities.RESULTS: Both plans achieved adequate planning target volume coverage, while mean conformity index was found significantly better in IMRT plans (P-value=0.001).D35 (dose to 35% volume) and D50 for bladder was reduced by 14.62 and 32.57% and for rectum by 23.82 and 43.68% in IMRT.For IMRT, V45 (volume receiving 45Gy) of bowel were found significantly lesser (P-value=0.0001), non-tumour integral dose was found significantly higher (P-value=0.0240) and V20 of bone marrow was found significantly reduced (P-value=0.019) in comparison to that in 3D conformal radiotherapy.Significant reduction of grade 2 or more (20 vs 45%; P-value=0.058) and grade>/=3 (5 vs 15%, P-value=0.004) acute genitourinary toxicity and grade 2 or more (20 vs 45%, P-value=0.003) and grade 3 or more (5 vs. 20%, P-value=0.004) acute gastrointestinal toxicity while no significant difference for grade 2 and 3 or more haematological toxicity was noted in patients treated with IMRT compared to 3D conformal radiotherapy.CONCLUSION: IMRT provide a good alternative for treatment of cervix carcinoma with lower acute gastrointestinal and acute genitourinary toxicity with similar target coverage compared to 3D conformal radiotherapy.",1,1,1,0

23706168,"Difference in overall and age-specific prevalence of high-risk human papillomavirus infection in Italy: evidence from NTCC trial.BACKGROUND: Although among women a decreasing prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection with increasing age has been consistently observed in high-resource countries, different age profiles have been reported elsewhere.METHODS: We compared the age profile of high-risk (HR)-HPV prevalence in nine different areas of Northern and Central Italy by studying the women recruited in the intervention arm of the New Technologies in Cervical Cancer study and tested by Hybrid Capture 2.Differences in the age-distribution of HPV infection were investigated in each centre by the joinpoint approach in a logistic model.46,900 women aged 25 to 60 years were included in the analysis.RESULTS: The HR-HPV age-standardised (on Italian population) prevalence ranged from 5.7% (Trento) to 10.3% (Ravenna).HR-HPV prevalence decreased as a logistic function of increasing age in 6 of 9 centres (Trento, Verona, Florence, Bologna, Imola, and Viterbo).The effect of age on HR-HPV prevalence slopes did not differ significantly among these 6 centres, whereas significant heterogeneity in intercepts (p < 0.001) was found, reflecting different overall HR-HPV prevalence between centres.One significant joinpoint was observed in 2 centres (Padua and Ravenna), indicating that the decrease in HR-HPV prevalence by age was better described using a function composed with two logistic segments.In Padua HR-HPV prevalence decreased only slightly up to 39 years but showed a steep downturn thereafter.In Ravenna HR-HPV prevalence decreased steeply down to 45 years of age and then showed a plateau.Finally, in Turin two significant joinpoints were observed: prevalence decreased only after age 29 and showed a plateau after age 39.CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed substantial differences in overall and age-specific HR-HPV prevalence across Italian areas.These findings may be related to different timing of changes in sexual behaviours across regions.Age-specific HR-HPV prevalence in Italy does not support an influence of age per se.",0,0,0,0
29444771,"Consumption of ultra-processed foods and cancer risk: results from NutriNet-Sante prospective cohort.OBJECTIVE: To assess the prospective associations between consumption of ultra-processed food and risk of cancer.DESIGN: Population based cohort study.SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: 104 980 participants aged at least 18 years (median age 42.8 years) from the French NutriNet-Sante cohort (2009-17).Dietary intakes were collected using repeated 24 hour dietary records, designed to register participants' usual consumption for 3300 different food items.These were categorised according to their degree of processing by the NOVA classification.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Associations between ultra-processed food intake and risk of overall, breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer assessed by multivariable Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for known risk factors.RESULTS: Ultra-processed food intake was associated with higher overall cancer risk (n=2228 cases; hazard ratio for a 10% increment in the proportion of ultra-processed food in the diet 1.12 (95% confidence interval 1.06 to 1.18); P for trend<0.001) and breast cancer risk (n=739 cases; hazard ratio 1.11 (1.02 to 1.22); P for trend=0.02).These results remained statistically significant after adjustment for several markers of the nutritional quality of the diet (lipid, sodium, and carbohydrate intakes and/or a Western pattern derived by principal component analysis).CONCLUSIONS: In this large prospective study, a 10% increase in the proportion of ultra-processed foods in the diet was associated with a significant increase of greater than 10% in risks of overall and breast cancer.Further studies are needed to better understand the relative effect of the various dimensions of processing (nutritional composition, food additives, contact materials, and neoformed contaminants) in these associations.STUDY REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT03335644.",0,0,0,0
32816629,"Long-Term Outcomes of Laparoscopic Distal Gastrectomy for Locally Advanced Gastric Cancer: The KLASS-02-RCT Randomized Clinical Trial.PURPOSE: It is unclear whether laparoscopic distal gastrectomy for locally advanced gastric cancer is oncologically equivalent to open distal gastrectomy.The noninferiority of laparoscopic subtotal gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy for locally advanced gastric cancer compared with open surgery in terms of 3-year relapse-free survival rate was evaluated.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A phase III, open-label, randomized controlled trial was conducted for patients with histologically proven locally advanced gastric adenocarcinoma suitable for distal subtotal gastrectomy.The primary end point was the 3-year relapse-free survival rate; the upper limit of the hazard ratio (HR) for noninferiority was 1.43 between the laparoscopic and open distal gastrectomy groups.RESULTS: From November 2011 to April 2015, 1,050 patients were randomly assigned to laparoscopy (n = 524) or open surgery (n = 526).After exclusions, 492 patients underwent laparoscopic surgery and 482 underwent open surgery and were included in the analysis.The laparoscopy group, compared with the open surgery group, suffered fewer early complications (15.7% v 23.4%, respectively; P = .0027) and late complications (4.7% v 9.5%, respectively; P = .0038), particularly intestinal obstruction (2.0% v 4.4%, respectively; P = .0447).The 3-year relapse-free survival rate was 80.3% (95% CI, 76.0% to 85.0%) for the laparoscopy group and 81.3% (95% CI, 77.0% to 85.0%; log-rank P = .726) for the open group.Cox regression analysis after stratification by the surgeon revealed an HR of 1.035 (95% CI, 0.762 to 1.406; log-rank P = .827; P for noninferiority = .039).When stratified by pathologic stage, the HR was 1.020 (95% CI, 0.751 to 1.385; log-rank P = .900; P for noninferiority = .030).CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic distal gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy was comparable to open surgery in terms of relapse-free survival for patients with locally advanced gastric cancer.Laparoscopic distal gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy could be a potential standard treatment option for locally advanced gastric cancer.",0,0,0,0

27784046,"Effect of Polyglycolic Acid Mesh for Prevention of Pancreatic Fistula Following Distal Pancreatectomy: A Randomized Clinical Trial.Importance: The rate of postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) after distal pancreatectomy ranges from 13% to 64%.To prevent POPF, polyglycolic acid (PGA) mesh was introduced, but its effect has been evaluated only in small numbers of patients and retrospective studies.Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of PGA mesh in preventing POPF after distal pancreatectomy.Design, Setting, and Participants: Prospective randomized clinical, single-blind (participant), parallel-group trial at 5 centers between November 2011 and April 2014.The pancreatic parenchyma was divided using a stapling device; no patient was given prophylactic octreotide.Perioperative and clinical outcomes were compared including POPF, which was graded according to the criteria of the International Study Group For Pancreatic Fistulas.A total of 97 patients aged 20 to 85 years with curable benign, premalignant, or malignant disease of the pancreatic body or tail were enrolled (44 in the PGA group and 53 in the control group).Interventions: Patients in the PGA group underwent transection of the pancreas and application of fibrin glue followed by wrapping the PGA mesh around the remnant pancreatic stump.Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point of this study was the development of a clinically relevant POPF (grade B or C by the International Study Group grading system).The secondary end point was the evaluation of risk factors for POPF.Results: The study therefore evaluated a total of 97 patients, 44 in the PGA group and 53 in the control group.Thirty-nine patients were women and 58 patients were men.There were no differences in mean (SD) age (59.9 [12.0] years vs 54.5 [14.1] years, P = .05), male to female ratio (1.0:1.3 vs 1.0:1.7, P = .59), malignancy (40.9% vs 32.1%, P = .37), mean (SD) pancreatic duct diameter (1.92 [0.75] mm vs 1.94 [0.95] mm, P = .47), soft pancreatic texture (90.9% vs 83.0%, P = .17), and mean (SD) thickness of the transection margin (16.9 [5.4] mm vs 16.4 [4.9] mm, P = .63) between the PGA and control groups.The rate of clinically relevant POPF (grade B or C) was significantly lower in the PGA group than in the control group (11.4% vs 28.3%, P = .04).Conclusions and Relevance: Wrapping of the cut surface of the pancreas with PGA mesh is associated with a significantly reduced rate of clinically relevant POPF.Trial Registration: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01550406.",0,0,0,0
24987838,"Noninvasive image texture analysis differentiates K-ras mutation from pan-wildtype NSCLC and is prognostic.BACKGROUND: Non-invasive characterization of a tumor's molecular features could enhance treatment management.Quantitative computed tomography (CT) based texture analysis (QTA) has been used to derive tumor heterogeneity information, and the appearance of the tumors has been shown to relate to patient outcome in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and other cancers.In this study, we examined the potential of tumoral QTA to differentiate K-ras mutant from pan-wildtype tumors and its prognostic potential using baseline pre-treatment non-contrast CT imaging in NSCLC.METHODS: Tumor DNA from patients with early-stage NSCLC was analyzed on the LungCarta Panel.Cases with a K-ras mutation or pan-wildtype for 26 oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes were selected for QTA.QTA was applied to regions of interest in the primary tumor.Non-parametric Mann Whitney test assessed the ability of the QTA, clinical and patient characteristics to differentiate between K-ras mutation from pan-wildtype.A recursive decision tree was developed to determine whether the differentiation of K-ras mutant from pan-wildtype tumors could be improved by sequential application of QTA parameters.Kaplan-Meier survival analysis assessed the ability of these markers to predict survival.RESULTS: QTA was applied to 48 cases identified, 27 had a K-ras mutation and 21 cases were pan-wildtype.Positive skewness and lower kurtosis were significantly associated with the presence of a K-ras mutation.A five node decision tree had sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy values (95% CI) of 96.3% (78.1-100), 81.0% (50.5-97.4), and 89.6% (72.9-97.0); respectively.Kurtosis was a significant predictor of OS and DFS, with a lower kurtosis value linked with poorer survival.CONCLUSIONS: Lower kurtosis and positive skewness are significantly associated with K-ras mutations.A QTA feature such as kurtosis is prognostic for OS and DFS.Non-invasive QTA can differentiate the presence of K-ras mutation from pan-wildtype NSCLC and is associated with patient survival.",0,0,0,0

34446053,"Durvalumab (MEDI 4736) in combination with extended neoadjuvant regimens in rectal cancer: a study protocol of a randomised phase II trial (PRIME-RT).BACKGROUND: Advances in multi-modality treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) have resulted in low local recurrence rates, but around 30% of patients will still die from distant metastatic disease.In parallel, there is increasing recognition that with radiotherapy and systemic treatment, some patients achieve a complete response and may avoid surgical resection, including in many cases, the need for a permanent stoma.Extended neoadjuvant regimes have emerged to address these concerns.The inclusion of immunotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting has the potential to further enhance this strategy by priming the local immune microenvironment and engaging the systemic immune response.METHODS: PRIME-RT is a multi-centre, open label, phase II, randomised trial for patients with newly diagnosed LARC.Eligible patients will be randomised to receive either: short course radiotherapy (25 Gray in 5 fractions over one week) with concomitant durvalumab (1500 mg administered intravenously every 4 weeks), followed by FOLFOX (85 mg/m(2) oxaliplatin, 350 mg folinic acid and 400 mg/m(2) bolus 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) given on day 1 followed by 2400 mg/m(2) 5-FU infusion over 46-48 h, all administered intravenously every 2 weeks), and durvalumab, or long course chemoradiotherapy (50 Gray to primary tumour in 25 fractions over 5 weeks with concomitant oral capecitabine 825 mg/m(2) twice per day on days of radiotherapy) with durvalumab followed by FOLFOX and durvalumab.The primary endpoint is complete response rate in each arm.Secondary endpoints include treatment compliance, toxicity, safety, overall recurrence, proportion of patients with a permanent stoma, and survival.The study is translationally rich with collection of bio-specimens prior to, during, and following treatment in order to understand the molecular and immunological factors underpinning treatment response.The trial opened and the first patient was recruited in January 2021.The main trial will recruit up to 42 patients with LARC and commence after completion of a safety run-in that will recruit at least six patients with LARC or metastatic disease.DISCUSSION: PRIME-RT will explore if adding immunotherapy to neoadjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy for patients with LARC can prime the tumour microenvironment to improve complete response rates and stoma free survival.Sequential biopsies are a key component within the trial design that will provide new knowledge on how the tumour microenvironment changes at different time-points in response to multi-modality treatment.This expectation is that the trial will provide information to test this treatment within a large phase clinical trial.Trial registration Clinicaltrials.gov NCT04621370 (Registered 9th Nov 2020) EudraCT number 2019-001471-36 (Registered 6th Nov 2020).",1,1,1,1
30646153,"Effect of Positron Emission Tomography Imaging in Women With Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer: A Randomized Clinical Trial.Importance: In women with locally advanced cancer of the cervix (LACC), staging defines disease extent and guides therapy.Currently, undetected disease outside the radiation field can result in undertreatment or, if disease is disseminated, overtreatment.Objective: To determine whether adding fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) to conventional staging with CT of the abdomen and pelvis affects therapy received in women with LACC.Design, Setting, and Participants: A randomized clinical trial was conducted.Women with newly diagnosed histologically confirmed International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IB to IVA carcinoma of the cervix who were candidates for chemotherapy and radiation therapy (CRT) were allocated 2:1 to PET-CT plus CT of the abdomen and pelvis or CT alone.Enrollment occurred between April 2010 and June 2014 at 6 regional cancer centers in Ontario, Canada.The PET-CT scanners were at 6 associated academic institutions.The median follow-up at the time of the analysis was 3 years.The analysis was conducted on March 30, 2017.Interventions: Patients received either PET-CT plus CT of the abdomen and pelvis or CT of the abdomen and pelvis.Main Outcomes and Measures: Treatment delivered, defined as standard pelvic CRT vs more extensive CRT, ie, extended field radiotherapy or therapy with palliative intent.Results: One hundred seventy-one patients were allocated to PET-CT (n = 113) or CT (n = 58).The trial stopped early before the planned target of 288 was reached because of low recruitment.Mean (SD) age was 48.1 (11.2) years in the PET-CT group vs 48.9 (12.7) years in the CT group.In the 112 patients who received PET-CT, 68 (60.7%) received standard pelvic CRT, 38 (33.9%) more extensive CRT, and 6 (5.4%) palliative treatment.The corresponding data for the 56 patients who received CT alone were 42 (75.0%), 11 (19.6%), and 3 (5.4%).Overall, 44 patients (39.3%) in the PET-CT group received more extensive CRT or palliative treatment compared with 14 patients (25.0%) in the CT group (odds ratio, 2.05; 95% CI, 0.96-4.37; P = .06).Twenty-four patients in the PET-CT group (21.4%) received extended field radiotherapy to para-aortic nodes and 14 (12.5%) to common iliac nodes compared with 8 (14.3%) and 3 (5.4%), respectively, in the CT group (odds ratio, 1.64; 95% CI, 0.68-3.92; P = .27).Conclusions and Relevance: There was a trend for more extensive CRT with PET-CT, but the difference was not significant because the trial was underpowered.This trial provides information on the utility of PET-CT for staging in LACC.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00895349.",0,0,0,0
29730633,"Use of a GP-endorsed 12 months' reminder letter to promote uptake of bowel scope screening: protocol for a randomised controlled trial in a hard-to-reach population.INTRODUCTION: Flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS) screening is associated with reduced colorectal cancer incidence and mortality when offered as a one-off test to men and women aged 55-64.The test, also referred to as the 'bowel scope screening' (BSS) test, was added to England's national Bowel Cancer Screening Programme in March 2013, where it is offered to men and women aged 55.Since its implementation, uptake of the BSS test has been low, with only 43% of the eligible population attending an appointment.Sending non-participants a reminder at age 56 has been shown to improve uptake by up to nine percentage points at a single centre in London; we hypothesise that adding a general practitioners (GPs) endorsement to the reminder could improve uptake even further.METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This paper describes the protocol for a randomised controlled trial which will examine the effectiveness of adding a GPs endorsement to a reminder for BSS non-participants aged 56.All screening-eligible adults who have not responded to a BSS appointment at London North West Healthcare NHS Trust within 12 months of their initial invitation will be randomised to receive either a GP-endorsed reminder letter or reminder letter without GP endorsement.The primary outcome will be the proportion of individuals screened within each group 8 weeks after the reminder.Statistical comparisons will be made using univariate and multivariate logistic regression, with 'uptake' as the outcome variable, GP reminder group as the exposure and sociodemographic variables as covariates.ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study was approved by the Yorkshire & Humber-Bradford Leeds Research Ethics Committee (16/YH/0298) and the Confidentiality Advisory Group (17/CAG/0162).The results will be disseminated in a peer-reviewed journal in accordance with the Consort statement and will be made available to the public.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN82867861.",0,0,0,0

28577938,"Evaluation of the VeriStrat((R)) serum protein test in patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the lung treated with second-line afatinib or erlotinib in the phase III LUX-Lung 8 study.OBJECTIVES: Identification of biomarkers associated with clinical benefit may be crucial in establishing optimal treatment choice for patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the lung after first-line chemotherapy.In this study, the ability of the VeriStrat serum protein test to predict differential clinical benefit with afatinib versus erlotinib, and the association of VeriStrat status with clinical outcomes irrespective of EGFR-TKI used, was assessed in a retrospective analysis of the phase III LUX-Lung 8 trial.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pretreatment plasma samples were analyzed using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.Spectra were evaluated to assign a VeriStrat 'Good' (VS-G) or VeriStrat 'Poor' (VS-P) classification.Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival, and other endpoints were assessed with respect to pretreatment VeriStrat status; OS was the primary efficacy variable.Outcomes with other efficacy endpoints were similar.RESULTS: Of 795 patients randomized in LUX-Lung 8, 675 were classified (VS-G: 412; VS-P: 263).In the VS-G group, OS was significantly longer with afatinib versus erlotinib (HR 0.79 [95% CI: 0.63-0.98]).In the VS-P group, there was no significant difference in OS between afatinib and erlotinib (HR 0.90 [0.70-1.16]).However, there was no interaction between VeriStrat classification and treatment group for OS (pinteraction=0.5303).OS was significantly longer in VS-G versus VS-P patients, both in the overall VeriStrat-classified population (HR 0.41 [0.35-0.49]) and afatinib-treated patients (HR 0.40 [0.31-0.51]).Multivariate analysis showed that VeriStrat was an independent predictor of OS in afatinib-treated patients, regardless of ECOG PS or best response to first-line chemotherapy.CONCLUSION: VS-G classification is strongly associated with favorable survival outcomes with either afatinib or erlotinib compared with VS-P classification.In VS-G patients, survival outcomes with afatinib are superior to those with erlotinib.VeriStrat classification may guide treatment decisions in patients with SCC of the lung.ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT01523587.",1,1,1,1
26518352,"The Effect of Using an Electric Fan on Dyspnea in Chinese Patients With Terminal Cancer.BACKGROUND: Fan therapy is often suggested for relieving the symptom of dyspnea in patients with advanced cancer, but relevant literature among Asians is limited.OBJECTIVE: Phase 2 clinical trial to assess the clinical feasibility and outcome of using an electric fan to alleviate the symptom of dyspnea in Chinese patients with advanced cancer.METHODS: Thirty patients with advanced cancer having unresolved breathlessness were recruited from Hospice and Palliative Care Centre of Kiang Wu Hospital in Macau.Participants were randomly and equally allocated to the experimental group and the control group, respectively.OUTCOME MEASURES: Verbal numerical rating scale (NRS) of breathlessness, respiratory rate (RR), and saturation of peripheral oxygen (SpO2) was collected before and after the intervention.RESULTS: T test was used to analyze the data collected.There was a significant difference in the NRS scores of the experimental group ( P < .01), indicating a significant reduction in the patients' sensation of breathlessness after fan therapy, whereas no significant difference was found in the objective statistic results of RR and SpO2.No significant difference ( P > .05) was found in the control group for all the 3 variables before and after routine treatment.CONCLUSION: The results of the study suggested that fan therapy could be effective in alleviating dyspnea in Chinese patients with advanced cancer.It should be considered as one of the nonpharmacological treatment option.Future large-scale phase 3 clinical trials are warranted.",0,0,0,0
23281805,"Randomized Phase II trial of paclitaxel and carboplatin followed by gemcitabine switch-maintenance therapy versus gemcitabine and carboplatin followed by gemcitabine continuation-maintenance therapy in previously untreated advanced non-small cell lung cancer.BACKGROUND: In recent years, maintenance chemotherapy is increasingly being recognized as a new treatment strategy to improve the outcome of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).However, the optimal maintenance strategy is still controversial.Gemcitabine is a promising candidate for single-agent maintenance therapy because of little toxicity and good tolerability.We have conducted a randomized phase II study to evaluate the validity of single-agent maintenance chemotherapy of gemcitabine and to compare continuation- and switch-maintenance.METHODS: Chemonaive patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC were randomly assigned 1:1 to either arm A or B. Patients received paclitaxel (200 mg/m2, day 1) plus carboplatin (AUC 6 mg/mL/min, day 1) every 3 weeks in arm A, or gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2, days 1 and 8) plus carboplatin (AUC 5 mg/mL/min, day1) every 3 weeks in arm B. Non-progressive patients following 3 cycles of induction chemotherapy received maintenance gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2, days 1 and 8) every 3 weeks.( TRIAL REGISTRATION: UMIN000008252)RESULTS: The study was stopped because of delayed accrual at interim analysis.Of the randomly assigned 50 patients, 49 except for one in arm B were evaluable.Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 4.6 months for arm A vs. 3.5 months for arm B (HR = 1.03; 95% CI, 0.45-2.27; p = 0.95) and median overall survival (OS) was 15.0 months for arm A vs. 14.8 months for arm B (HR = 0.79; 95% CI, 0.40-1.51; p = 0.60), showing no difference between the two arms.The response rate, disease control rate, and the transit rate to maintenance phase were 36.0% (9/25), 64.0% (16/25), and 48% (12/25) for arm A vs. 16.7% (4/24), 50.0% (12/24), and 33% (8/24) for arm B, which were also statistically similar between the two arms (p = 0.13, p = 0.32, and p = 0.30, respectively).Both induction regimens were tolerable, except that more patients experienced peripheral neuropathy in arm A. Toxicities during the maintenance phase were also minimal.CONCLUSION: Survival and overall response were not significantly different between the two arms.Gemcitabine may be well-tolerable and feasible for maintenance therapy.",1,1,1,1
33289280,"High-Flow Nasal Cannula Therapy for Exertional Dyspnea in Patients with Cancer: A Pilot Randomized Clinical Trial.BACKGROUND: Exertional dyspnea is common in patients with cancer and limits their function.The impact of high-flow nasal cannula on exertional dyspnea in nonhypoxemic patients is unclear.In this double-blind, parallel-group, randomized trial, we assessed the effect of flow rate (high vs. low) and gas (oxygen vs. air) on exertional dyspnea in nonhypoxemic patients with cancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with cancer with oxygen saturation >90% at rest and exertion completed incremental and constant work (80% maximal) cycle ergometry while breathing low-flow air at 2 L/minute.They were then randomized to receive high-flow oxygen, high-flow air, low-flow oxygen, or low-flow air while performing symptom-limited endurance cycle ergometry at 80% maximal.The primary outcome was modified 0-10 Borg dyspnea intensity scale at isotime.Secondary outcomes included dyspnea unpleasantness, exercise time, and adverse events.RESULTS: Seventy-four patients were enrolled, and 44 completed the study (mean age 63; 41% female).Compared with low-flow air at baseline, dyspnea intensity was significantly lower at isotime with high-flow oxygen (mean change, -1.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], -2.1, -0.12) and low-flow oxygen (-1.83; 95% CI, -2.7, -0.9), but not high-flow air (-0.2; 95% CI, -0.97, 0.6) or low-flow air (-0.5; 95% CI, -1.3, 0.4).Compared with low-flow air, high-flow oxygen also resulted in significantly longer exercise time (difference + 2.5 minutes, p = .009), but not low-flow oxygen (+0.39 minutes, p = .65) or high-flow air (+0.63 minutes, p = .48).The interventions were well tolerated without significant adverse effects.CONCLUSION: Our preliminary findings support that high-flow oxygen improved both exertional dyspnea and exercise duration in nonhypoxemic patients with cancer.(ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02357134).IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: In this four-arm, double-blind, randomized clinical trial examining the role of high-flow nasal cannula on exertional dyspnea in patients with cancer without hypoxemia, high-flow oxygen, but not high-flow air, resulted in significantly lower dyspnea scores and longer exercise time.High-flow oxygen delivered by high-flow nasal cannula devices may improve clinically relevant outcomes even in patients without hypoxemia.",0,0,0,0
29126244,"Impact of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy on health-related quality of life in long-term survivors of esophageal or junctional cancer: results from the randomized CROSS trial.Background: Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) plus surgery is a standard of care for patients with esophageal or junctional cancer, but the long-term impact of nCRT on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is unknown.The purpose of this study is to compare very long-term HRQOL in long-term survivors of esophageal cancer who received nCRT plus surgery or surgery alone.Patients and methods: Patients were randomly assigned to receive nCRT (carboplatin/paclitaxel with 41.4-Gy radiotherapy) plus surgery or surgery alone.HRQOL was measured using EORTC-QLQ-C30, EORTC-QLQ-OES24 and K-BILD questionnaires after a minimum follow-up of 6 years.To allow for examination over time, EORTC-QLQ-C30 and QLQ-OES24 questionnaire scores were compared with pretreatment and 12 months postoperative questionnaire scores.Physical functioning (QLQ-C30), eating problems (QLQ-OES24) and respiratory problems (K-BILD) were predefined primary end points.Predefined secondary end points were global quality of life and fatigue (both QLQ-C30).Results: After a median follow-up of 105 months, 123/368 included patients (33%) were still alive (70 nCRT plus surgery, 53 surgery alone).No statistically significant or clinically relevant differential effects in HRQOL end points were found between both groups.Compared with 1-year postoperative levels, eating problems, physical functioning, global quality of life and fatigue remained at the same level in both groups.Compared with pretreatment levels, eating problems had improved (Cohen's d -0.37, P = 0.011) during long-term follow-up, whereas physical functioning and fatigue were not restored to pretreatment levels in both groups (Cohen's d -0.56 and 0.51, respectively, both P < 0.001).Conclusions: Although physical functioning and fatigue remain reduced after long-term follow-up, no adverse impact of nCRT is apparent on long-term HRQOL compared with patients who were treated with surgery alone.In addition to the earlier reported improvement in survival and the absence of impact on short-term HRQOL, these results support the view that nCRT according to CROSS can be considered as a standard of care.Trial registration number: Netherlands Trial Register NTR487.",0,0,0,0

26686313,"Anastrozole versus tamoxifen for the prevention of locoregional and contralateral breast cancer in postmenopausal women with locally excised ductal carcinoma in situ (IBIS-II DCIS): a double-blind, randomised controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Third-generation aromatase inhibitors are more effective than tamoxifen for preventing recurrence in postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive invasive breast cancer.However, it is not known whether anastrozole is more effective than tamoxifen for women with hormone-receptor-positive ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).Here, we compare the efficacy of anastrozole with that of tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive DCIS.METHODS: In a double-blind, multicentre, randomised placebo-controlled trial, we recruited women who had been diagnosed with locally excised, hormone-receptor-positive DCIS.Eligible women were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio by central computer allocation to receive 1 mg oral anastrozole or 20 mg oral tamoxifen every day for 5 years.Randomisation was stratified by major centre or hub and was done in blocks (six, eight, or ten).All trial personnel, participants, and clinicians were masked to treatment allocation and only the trial statistician had access to treatment allocation.The primary endpoint was all recurrence, including recurrent DCIS and new contralateral tumours.All analyses were done on a modified intention-to-treat basis (in all women who were randomised and did not revoke consent for their data to be included) and proportional hazard models were used to compute hazard ratios and corresponding confidence intervals.This trial is registered at the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN37546358.RESULTS: Between March 3, 2003, and Feb 8, 2012, we enrolled 2980 postmenopausal women from 236 centres in 14 countries and randomly assigned them to receive anastrozole (1449 analysed) or tamoxifen (1489 analysed).Median follow-up was 7.2 years (IQR 5.6-8.9), and 144 breast cancer recurrences were recorded.We noted no statistically significant difference in overall recurrence (67 recurrences for anastrozole vs 77 for tamoxifen; HR 0.89 [95% CI 0.64-1.23]).The non-inferiority of anastrozole was established (upper 95% CI <1.25), but its superiority to tamoxifen was not (p=0.49).A total of 69 deaths were recorded (33 for anastrozole vs 36 for tamoxifen; HR 0.93 [95% CI 0.58-1.50], p=0.78), and no specific cause was more common in one group than the other.The number of women reporting any adverse event was similar between anastrozole (1323 women, 91%) and tamoxifen (1379 women, 93%); the side-effect profiles of the two drugs differed, with more fractures, musculoskeletal events, hypercholesterolaemia, and strokes with anastrozole and more muscle spasm, gynaecological cancers and symptoms, vasomotor symptoms, and deep vein thromboses with tamoxifen.CONCLUSIONS: No clear efficacy differences were seen between the two treatments.Anastrozole offers another treatment option for postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive DCIS, which may be be more appropriate for some women with contraindications for tamoxifen.Longer follow-up will be necessary to fully evaluate treatment differences.FUNDING: Cancer Research UK, National Health and Medical Research Council Australia, Breast Cancer Research Fund, AstraZeneca, Sanofi Aventis.",1,1,1,1
33655778,"Personalized Decision Making on Genomic Testing in Early Breast Cancer: Expanding the MINDACT Trial with Decision-Analytic Modeling.BACKGROUND: Genomic tests may improve upon clinical risk estimation with traditional prognostic factors.We aimed to explore how evidence on the prognostic strength of a genomic signature (clinical validity) can contribute to individualized decision making on starting chemotherapy for women with breast cancer (clinical utility).METHODS: The MINDACT trial was a randomized trial that enrolled 6693 women with early-stage breast cancer.A 70-gene signature (Mammaprint) was used to estimate genomic risk, and clinical risk was estimated by a dichotomized version of the Adjuvant!Online risk calculator.Women with discordant risk results were randomized to the use of chemotherapy.We simulated the full risk distribution of these women and estimated individual benefit, assuming a constant relative effect of chemotherapy.RESULTS: The trial showed a prognostic effect of the genomic signature (adjusted hazard ratio 2.4).A decision-analytic modeling approach identified far fewer women as candidates for genetic testing (4% rather than 50%) and fewer benefiting from chemotherapy (3% rather than 27%) as compared with the MINDACT trial report.The selection of women benefitting from genetic testing and chemotherapy depended strongly on the required benefit from treatment and the assumed therapeutic effect of chemotherapy.CONCLUSIONS: A high-quality pragmatic trial was insufficient to directly inform clinical practice on the utility of a genomic test for individual women.The indication for genomic testing may be far more limited than suggested by the MINDACT trial.",1,1,1,1

27149489,"Efficacy of Intravenous Lidocaine During Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection for Gastric Neoplasm: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Controlled Study.Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is an advanced therapy for early gastric neoplasm and requires sedation with adequate analgesia.Lidocaine is a short-acting local anesthetic, and intravenous lidocaine has been shown to have analgesic efficacy in surgical settings.The aim of this study was to assess the effects of intravenous lidocaine on analgesic and sedative requirements for ESD and pain after ESD.Sixty-six patients scheduled for ESD randomly received either intravenous lidocaine as a bolus of 1.5 mg/kg before sedation, followed by continuous infusion at a rate of 2 mg/kg/h during sedation (lidocaine group; n = 33) or the same bolus and infusion volumes of normal saline (control group; n = 33).Sedation was achieved with propofol and fentanyl.The primary outcome was fentanyl requirement during ESD.We recorded hemodynamics and any events during ESD and evaluated post-ESD epigastric and throat pain.Fentanyl requirement during ESD reduced by 24% in the lidocaine group compared with the control group (105 +/- 28 vs. 138 +/- 37 mug, mean +/- SD; P < 0.001).The lidocaine group reached sedation faster [40 (20-100) vs. 55 (30-120) s, median (range); P = 0.001], and incidence of patient movement during ESD decreased in the lidocaine group (3% vs. 26%, P = 0.026).Numerical rating scale for epigastric pain was significantly lower at 6 hours after ESD [2 (0-6) vs. 3 (0-8), median (range); P = 0.023] and incidence of throat pain was significantly lower in the lidocaine group (27% vs. 65%, P = 0.003).No adverse events associated with lidocaine were discovered.Administration of intravenous lidocaine reduced fentanyl requirement and decreased patient movement during ESD.Moreover, it alleviated epigastric and throat pain after ESD.Thus, we conclude that the use of intravenous adjuvant lidocaine is a new and safe sedative method during ESD.",0,0,0,0
30408319,"The effect of preoperative chemotherapy on histological subtyping and staging of Wilms tumors: The United Kingdom Children's Cancer Study Group (UKCCSG) Wilms tumor trial 3 (UKW3) experience.BACKGROUND: Two principal approaches to Wilms tumor (WT) treatment are immediate surgery (IS) and preoperative chemotherapy (PCT), and both treatments use the risk-adapted approach that includes histological subclassification of the tumor, combined with additional prognostic factors.In the UKW3 trial, these two approaches were compared.The aim of the present study was to compare histological features between the two groups, to assess the impact of PCT on distribution of histological subtyping and staging and to evaluate whether PCT resulted in more staging discrepancies between local and central pathology review (CPR).MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cases were identified from the UKW3 trial database.The criteria for inclusion in the study were unilateral, nonmetastatic, nonanaplastic WTs, and submitted for CPR with an adequate number of slides.They were subclassified according to the NWTS and later the SIOP 9301 criteria.RESULTS: There were 244 WTs in the IS and 182 in the PCT group subclassified as follows: blastemal 86 (35%) vs 9 (5%), epithelial 34 (14%) vs 12 (7%), stromal 12 (5%) vs 25 (14%), mixed 112 (46%) vs 45 (25%), respectively, plus 40% regressive and 10% completely necrotic WTs in the PCT group.The differences between the two groups for blastemal and mixed types were statistically significant.In the PCT group, there was a significant decrease in stage III tumors.The discrepancies in staging between local and CPR were not significant.CONCLUSION: PCT significantly altered histological features and typing of WTs.It resulted in fewer stage III tumors, and staging discrepancies were equally represented in both groups.",0,0,0,0
24076063,"Neoadjuvant treatment of endometrial cancer using anastrozole: a randomised pilot study.OBJECTIVE: Excessive oestrogenic stimulation is a well-known risk factor for the development and progression of endometrial cancer.Aromatase is the key enzyme which catalyses the conversion of androgens to oestrogens in postmenopausal women.Inhibition of aromatase may therefore be a useful strategy in the management of endometrial cancer.A pilot study was designed to assess the feasibility of a neoadjuvant model and understand the biological effects of anastrozole, an aromatase inhibitor, in the treatment of endometrial cancer.METHODS: Patients with endometrial cancer who consented to participate in the study were randomised to receive anastrozole or placebo for a minimum of 14 days prior to definitive surgery.Endometrial samples were obtained before and after treatment.Immunohistochemistry was performed to ascertain the expression of oestrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha), progesterone receptor (PR), androgen receptor (AR), ki-67 and Bcl2 before and after treatment in glands and stroma of the endometrium.RESULTS: A total of 16 patients were randomised to the anastrozole arm and 8 to the placebo arm (2:1 randomisation).A significant decrease in the glandular expression of ERalpha and AR was observed in the anastrozole arm.There was no significant change in the expression of PR or Bcl2.Expression of ki-67, a proliferation marker, also decreased significantly following treatment with anastrozole.CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with anastrozole caused a significant decrease in proliferation as demonstrated by decreased ki-67 expression.A large randomised controlled trial is warranted to fully assess the role of anastrozole in the neoadjuvant treatment of endometrial cancer.",1,1,1,1

31477558,"Aspirin as an adjuvant treatment for cancer: feasibility results from the Add-Aspirin randomised trial.BACKGROUND: Preclinical, epidemiological, and randomised data indicate that aspirin might prevent tumour development and metastasis, leading to reduced cancer mortality, particularly for gastro-oesophageal and colorectal cancer.Randomised trials evaluating aspirin use after primary radical therapy are ongoing.We present the pre-planned feasibility analysis of the run-in phase of the Add-Aspirin trial to address concerns about toxicity, particularly bleeding after radical treatment for gastro-oesophageal cancer.METHODS: The Add-Aspirin protocol includes four phase 3 randomised controlled trials evaluating the effect of daily aspirin on recurrence and survival after radical cancer therapy in four tumour cohorts: gastro-oesophageal, colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer.An open-label run-in phase (aspirin 100 mg daily for 8 weeks) precedes double-blind randomisation (for participants aged under 75 years, aspirin 300 mg, aspirin 100 mg, or matched placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio; for patients aged 75 years or older, aspirin 100 mg or matched placebo in a 2:1 ratio).A preplanned analysis of feasibility, including recruitment rate, adherence, and toxicity was performed.The trial is registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trials Number registry (ISRCTN74358648) and remains open to recruitment.FINDINGS: After 2 years of recruitment (October, 2015, to October, 2017), 3494 participants were registered (115 in the gastro-oesophageal cancer cohort, 950 in the colorectal cancer cohort, 1675 in the breast cancer cohort, and 754 in the prostate cancer cohort); 2719 (85%) of 3194 participants who had finished the run-in period proceeded to randomisation, with rates consistent across tumour cohorts.End of run-in data were available for 2253 patients; 2148 (95%) of the participants took six or seven tablets per week.11 (0.5%) of the 2253 participants reported grade 3 toxicity during the run-in period, with no upper gastrointestinal bleeding (any grade) in the gastro-oesophageal cancer cohort.The most frequent grade 1-2 toxicity overall was dyspepsia (246 [11%] of 2253 participants).INTERPRETATION: Aspirin is well-tolerated after radical cancer therapy.Toxicity has been low and there is no evidence of a difference in adherence, acceptance of randomisation, or toxicity between the different cancer cohorts.Trial recruitment continues to determine whether aspirin could offer a potential low cost and well tolerated therapy to improve cancer outcomes.FUNDING: Cancer Research UK, The National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment Programme, The MRC Clinical Trials Unit at UCL.",1,1,1,1
27504605,"Inflammatory biomarkers, aspirin, and risk of colorectal cancer: Findings from the physicians' health study.BACKGROUND: Chronic inflammation has been implicated in colorectal carcinogenesis.However, the associations between plasma inflammatory markers and risk of colorectal cancer have been inconsistent.METHODS: In a nested case-control study in the Physicians' Health Study, we prospectively investigated the associations of plasma C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR-2) with risk of colorectal cancer, and whether aspirin modified these associations among 268 colorectal cancer patients and 446 age- and smoking-matched controls.RESULTS: In multivariate-adjusted models, plasma levels of CRP, IL-6 and TNFR-2 were not significantly associated with risk of colorectal cancer, although a positive trend was observed for TNFR-2 (RRhighestvs.lowestquartile=1.55; 95% CI=0.95-2.54; Ptrend=0.05).We observed a statistically significant association between elevated TNFR-2 levels and colorectal cancer risk in the placebo arm (RRhighestvs.lowesttertile=1.77; 95% CI=1.02-3.06; Ptrend=0.02), but not in the aspirin arm (Ptrend=0.72).However, the interaction between TNFR-2 and aspirin was not statistically significant (Pinteraction=0.34).CONCLUSION: Plasma inflammatory markers were not significantly associated with colorectal cancer risk among men, though there was a statistically non-significant positive trend between TNFR-2 and colorectal cancer risk.More studies are required to understand the relationship between the role of TNFalpha pathway, aspirin, and colorectal cancer risk.",0,0,0,0
29274828,"Mean medical costs associated with vaginal and vulvar cancers for commercially insured patients in the United States and Texas.OBJECTIVE: To estimate the average medical costs for vaginal and vulvar cancers in a commercially insured population in the U.S. and Texas.METHODS: 2011-2014U.S. MarketScan databases were used to estimate the average medical costs associated with vaginal and vulvar cancers.Women with newly diagnosed vaginal or vulvar cancer were matched to a comparison group without cancer using propensity score.Year 1 and year 2 costs after index diagnosis date were estimated.A generalized linear model was used to estimate the cost for censored months.The differential costs between groups were defined as the net costs associated with cancer diagnosis and treatment.RESULTS: The analysis included 355 women with vaginal cancer and 997 with vulvar cancer in the U.S. The year 1 and year 2 costs for vaginal cancer were $86,995 and $51,107, respectively.The year 1 and year 2 costs for vulvar cancer were $37,657 and $19,139, respectively.The major factors associated with higher monthly vaginal and vulvar cancer costs were higher Charlson Comorbidity Index score and higher medical costs prior to cancer diagnosis.Monthly costs for vaginal and vulvar cancers decreased rapidly from month 1 to month 6 after diagnosis and then remained stable.CONCLUSIONS: Seventy to 75% of all vaginal and vulvar cancers are due to HPV infections and mean medical costs associated with these cancers are substantial.These data will serve as key cost parameters in the economic evaluation of HPV vaccination dissemination and estimation of the long-term net economic benefit of promoting HPV vaccination.",0,0,0,0
27557302,"Daratumumab, Bortezomib, and Dexamethasone for Multiple Myeloma.BACKGROUND: Daratumumab, a human IgGkappa monoclonal antibody that targets CD38, induces direct and indirect antimyeloma activity and has shown substantial efficacy as monotherapy in heavily pretreated patients with multiple myeloma, as well as in combination with bortezomib in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.METHODS: In this phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 498 patients with relapsed or relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma to receive bortezomib (1.3 mg per square meter of body-surface area) and dexamethasone (20 mg) alone (control group) or in combination with daratumumab (16 mg per kilogram of body weight) (daratumumab group).The primary end point was progression-free survival.RESULTS: A prespecified interim analysis showed that the rate of progression-free survival was significantly higher in the daratumumab group than in the control group; the 12-month rate of progression-free survival was 60.7% in the daratumumab group versus 26.9% in the control group.After a median follow-up period of 7.4 months, the median progression-free survival was not reached in the daratumumab group and was 7.2 months in the control group (hazard ratio for progression or death with daratumumab vs. control, 0.39; 95% confidence interval, 0.28 to 0.53; P<0.001).The rate of overall response was higher in the daratumumab group than in the control group (82.9% vs. 63.2%, P<0.001), as were the rates of very good partial response or better (59.2% vs. 29.1%, P<0.001) and complete response or better (19.2% vs. 9.0%, P=0.001).Three of the most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events reported in the daratumumab group and the control group were thrombocytopenia (45.3% and 32.9%, respectively), anemia (14.4% and 16.0%, respectively), and neutropenia (12.8% and 4.2%, respectively).Infusion-related reactions that were associated with daratumumab treatment were reported in 45.3% of the patients in the daratumumab group; these reactions were mostly grade 1 or 2 (grade 3 in 8.6% of the patients), and in 98.2% of these patients, they occurred during the first infusion.CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with relapsed or relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, daratumumab in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone resulted in significantly longer progression-free survival than bortezomib and dexamethasone alone and was associated with infusion-related reactions and higher rates of thrombocytopenia and neutropenia than bortezomib and dexamethasone alone.(Funded by Janssen Research and Development; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02136134.).",1,1,1,1
30386984,"Short-term surgical outcomes of laparoscopy-assisted versus open D2 distal gastrectomy for locally advanced gastric cancer in North China: a multicenter randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Although laparoscopic surgery has been recommended as an optional therapy for patients with early gastric cancer, whether patients with locally advanced gastric cancer (AGC) could benefit from laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy (LADG) with D2 lymphadenectomy remains elusive due to a lack of comprehensive clinical data.To evaluate the efficacy of LADG, we conducted a multi-institutional randomized controlled trial to compare laparoscopy-assisted versus open distal gastrectomy (ODG) for AGC in North China.METHODS: In this RCT, after patients were enrolled according to the eligibility criteria, they were preoperatively assigned to LADG or ODG arm randomly with a 1:1 allocation ratio.The primary endpoint was the morbidity and mortality within 30 postoperative days to evaluate the surgical safety of LADG.The secondary endpoint was 3-year disease-free survival.This trial was registered at ClinicalTrial.gov as NCT02464215.RESULTS: Between March 2014 and August 2017, a total of 446 patients with cT2-4aN0-3M0 (AJCC 7th staging system) were enrolled.Of these, 222 patients underwent LADG and 220 patients underwent ODG were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis.The compliance rate of D2 lymph node dissection was identical between the LADG and ODG arms (99.5%, P = 1.000).No significant difference was observed regarding the overall postoperative complication rate in two groups (LADG 13.1%, ODG 17.7%, P = 0.174).No operation-related death occurred in both arms.CONCLUSIONS: This trial confirmed that LADG performed by credentialed surgeons was safe and feasible for patients with AGC compared with conventional ODG.",1,1,1,1

26686313,"Anastrozole versus tamoxifen for the prevention of locoregional and contralateral breast cancer in postmenopausal women with locally excised ductal carcinoma in situ (IBIS-II DCIS): a double-blind, randomised controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Third-generation aromatase inhibitors are more effective than tamoxifen for preventing recurrence in postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive invasive breast cancer.However, it is not known whether anastrozole is more effective than tamoxifen for women with hormone-receptor-positive ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).Here, we compare the efficacy of anastrozole with that of tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive DCIS.METHODS: In a double-blind, multicentre, randomised placebo-controlled trial, we recruited women who had been diagnosed with locally excised, hormone-receptor-positive DCIS.Eligible women were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio by central computer allocation to receive 1 mg oral anastrozole or 20 mg oral tamoxifen every day for 5 years.Randomisation was stratified by major centre or hub and was done in blocks (six, eight, or ten).All trial personnel, participants, and clinicians were masked to treatment allocation and only the trial statistician had access to treatment allocation.The primary endpoint was all recurrence, including recurrent DCIS and new contralateral tumours.All analyses were done on a modified intention-to-treat basis (in all women who were randomised and did not revoke consent for their data to be included) and proportional hazard models were used to compute hazard ratios and corresponding confidence intervals.This trial is registered at the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN37546358.RESULTS: Between March 3, 2003, and Feb 8, 2012, we enrolled 2980 postmenopausal women from 236 centres in 14 countries and randomly assigned them to receive anastrozole (1449 analysed) or tamoxifen (1489 analysed).Median follow-up was 7.2 years (IQR 5.6-8.9), and 144 breast cancer recurrences were recorded.We noted no statistically significant difference in overall recurrence (67 recurrences for anastrozole vs 77 for tamoxifen; HR 0.89 [95% CI 0.64-1.23]).The non-inferiority of anastrozole was established (upper 95% CI <1.25), but its superiority to tamoxifen was not (p=0.49).A total of 69 deaths were recorded (33 for anastrozole vs 36 for tamoxifen; HR 0.93 [95% CI 0.58-1.50], p=0.78), and no specific cause was more common in one group than the other.The number of women reporting any adverse event was similar between anastrozole (1323 women, 91%) and tamoxifen (1379 women, 93%); the side-effect profiles of the two drugs differed, with more fractures, musculoskeletal events, hypercholesterolaemia, and strokes with anastrozole and more muscle spasm, gynaecological cancers and symptoms, vasomotor symptoms, and deep vein thromboses with tamoxifen.CONCLUSIONS: No clear efficacy differences were seen between the two treatments.Anastrozole offers another treatment option for postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive DCIS, which may be be more appropriate for some women with contraindications for tamoxifen.Longer follow-up will be necessary to fully evaluate treatment differences.FUNDING: Cancer Research UK, National Health and Medical Research Council Australia, Breast Cancer Research Fund, AstraZeneca, Sanofi Aventis.",1,1,1,1
29370781,"The PANDA study: a randomized phase II study of first-line FOLFOX plus panitumumab versus 5FU plus panitumumab in RAS and BRAF wild-type elderly metastatic colorectal cancer patients.BACKGROUND: Few data are available regarding the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer elderly patients with anti-EGFR agents in combination with chemotherapy.FOLFOX plus panitumumab is a standard first-line option for RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer.Slight adjustments in chemo-dosage are commonly applied in clinical practice to elderly patients, but those modified schedules have never been prospectively tested.Clinical definition of elderly (>/=70 years old) patients that may deserve a more or less intensive combination therapy is still debated.Several geriatric screening tools have been developed to predict survival and risk of toxicity from treatment.Among those, the G8 screening tool has been tested in cancer patients showing the strongest prognostic value for overall survival, while the CRASH score can stratify patients according to an estimated risk of treatment-related toxicities.METHODS: The PANDA study is a prospective, open-label, multicenter, randomized phase II trial of first-line therapy with panitumumab in combination with dose-adjusted FOLFOX or with 5-fluorouracil monotherapy, in previously untreated elderly patients (>/=70 years) with RAS and BRAF wild-type unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer.RAS and BRAF analyses are centralized.Geriatric assessment by means of G8 and CRASH score is planned at baseline and G8 will be re-evaluated at disease progression.The primary endpoint is duration of progression-free survival in both arms.Secondary endpoints include prospective evaluation of the prognostic role of G8 score and the correlation of CRASH risk categories with toxicity.DISCUSSION: The PANDA study aims at exploring safety and efficacy of panitumumab in combination with FOLFOX or with 5FU/LV in elderly patients affected by RAS and BRAF wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer, to identify the most promising treatment strategy in this setting.Additionally, this is the first trial in which the prognostic role of the G8 score will be prospectively evaluated.Results of this study will drive further experimental developments for one or both combinations.TRIAL REGISTRATION: PANDA is registered at Clinicaltrials.gov : NCT02904031 , July 11, 2016.PANDA is registered at EudraCT-No.: 2015-003888-10, September 3, 2015.",1,1,1,1

27951450,"Dose-dense adjuvant chemotherapy in premenopausal breast cancer patients: A pooled analysis of the MIG1 and GIM2 phase III studies.BACKGROUND: No evidence exists to recommend a specific chemotherapy regimen in young breast cancer patients.We performed a pooled analysis of two randomised clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of adjuvant dose-dense chemotherapy in premenopausal breast cancer patients and its impact on the risk of treatment-induced amenorrhoea.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the MIG1 study, node-positive or high-risk node-negative patients were randomised to 6 cycles of fluorouracil/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide every 2 (dose-dense) or 3 (standard-interval) weeks.In the GIM2 study, node-positive patients were randomised to 4 cycles of dose-dense or standard-interval EC or FEC followed by 4 cycles of dose-dense or standard-interval paclitaxel.Using individual patient data, the hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival by means of a Cox proportional hazards model and the odds ratio for treatment-induced amenorrhoea through a logistic regression model were calculated for each study.A meta-analysis of the two studies was performed using the random effect model to compute the parameter estimates.RESULTS: A total of 1,549 patients were included.Dose-dense chemotherapy was associated with a significant improved overall survival as compared to standard-interval chemotherapy (HR, 0.71; 95% confidence intervals [CI], 0.54-0.95; p = 0.021).The pooled HRs were 0.78 (95% CI, 0.54-1.12) and 0.65 (95% CI, 0.40-1.06) for patients with hormone receptor-positive and -negative tumours, respectively (interaction p = 0.330).No increased risk of treatment-induced amenorrhoea was observed with dose-dense chemotherapy (odds ratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.80-1.25; p = 0.989).CONCLUSION: Dose-dense adjuvant chemotherapy may be considered the preferred treatment option in high-risk premenopausal breast cancer patients.",1,1,1,1
31553661,"Adjuvant Whole-Brain Radiation Therapy Compared With Observation After Local Treatment of Melanoma Brain Metastases: A Multicenter, Randomized Phase III Trial.PURPOSE: The brain is a common site of metastasis for patients with high-risk melanoma.Although surgery or stereotactic radiosurgery are highly effective local treatments for a small number of metastases, there is a high risk of developing additional brain metastases.The role of adjuvant whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) in reducing new metastases is controversial, with a lack of high-level evidence specifically for melanoma.METHODS: In this randomized phase III trial, patients who had local treatment of one to three melanoma brain metastases were randomly assigned to WBRT or observation.The primary end point was distant intracranial failure within 12 months, and secondary end points included time to intracranial failure, survival, and time to deterioration in performance status.RESULTS: Between April 2009 and September 2017, 215 patients were randomly assigned from 24 centers.Median follow-up was 48.1 months (range, 39.6 to 68 months).Forty-two percent of patients in the WBRT group and 50.5% of those in the observation developed distant intracranial failure within 12 months (odds ratio, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.41 to 1.23; P = .22) and the rates over the entire follow-up period were 52.0% and 57.9%, respectively (odds ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.45 to 1.36; P = .39).Local failure rate was lower after WBRT (20.0% v 33.6%; P = .03).At 12 months, 41.5% of patients in the WBRT group and 51.4% of patients in the observation group had died (P = .28), with no difference in the rate of neurologic death.Median time to deterioration in performance status was 3.8 months after WBRT and 4.4 months with observation (P = .32).WBRT was associated with more grade 1 to 2 acute toxicity.CONCLUSION: After local treatment of one to three melanoma brain metastases, adjuvant WBRT does not provide clinical benefit in terms of distant intracranial control, survival, or preservation of performance status.",1,1,0,0
27313086,"Addition of high-dose cytarabine to immunochemotherapy before autologous stem-cell transplantation in patients aged 65 years or younger with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL Younger): a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial of the European Mantle Cell Lymphoma Network.BACKGROUND: Mantle cell lymphoma is characterised by a poor long-term prognosis.The European Mantle Cell Lymphoma Network aimed to investigate whether the introduction of high-dose cytarabine to immunochemotherapy before autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) improves outcome.METHODS: This randomised, open-label, parallel-group, phase 3 trial was done in 128 haemato-oncological hospital departments or private practices in Germany, France, Belgium, and Poland.Patients aged 65 years or younger with untreated stage II-IV mantle cell lymphoma were centrally randomised (1:1), with computer-assisted random block selection, to receive either six courses of R-CHOP (rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) followed by myeloablative radiochemotherapy and ASCT (control group), or six courses of alternating R-CHOP or R-DHAP (rituximab plus dexamethasone, high-dose cytarabine, and cisplatin) followed by a high-dose cytarabine-containing conditioning regimen and ASCT (cytarabine group).Patients were stratified by study group and international prognostic index.The primary outcome was time to treatment failure from randomisation to stable disease after at least four induction cycles, progression, or death from any cause.Patients with stage II-IV mantle cell lymphoma were included in the primary analysis if treatment was started according to randomisation.For safety analyses, patients were assessed according to the treatment actually started.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00209222.FINDINGS: Of 497 patients (median age 55 years [IQR 49-60]) randomised from July 20, 2004, to March 18, 2010, 234 of 249 in the control group and 232 of 248 in the cytarabine group were included in the primary analysis.After a median follow-up of 6.1 years (95% CI 5.4-6.4), time to treatment failure was significantly longer in the cytarabine group (median 9.1 years [95% CI 6.3-not reached], 5 year rate 65% [95% CI 57-71]) than in the control group (3.9 years [3.2-4.4], 40% [33-46]; hazard ratio 0.56; p=0.038).During induction immunochemotherapy, patients who received high-dose cytarabine had increased grade 3 or 4 haematological toxicity (haemoglobin 71 [29%] of 241m vs 19 [8%] of 227 controls; platelets 176 [73%] of 240 vs 21 [9%] of 225), grade 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia (39 [17%] of 230 vs 19 [8%] of 224), and grade 1 or 2 renal toxicity (creatinine 102 [43%] of 236 vs 22 [10%] of 224).The number of ASCT-related deaths was similar (eight [3.4%]) in both groups.INTERPRETATION: Immunochemotherapy containing high-dose cytarabine followed by ASCT should be considered standard of care in patients aged 65 years or younger with mantle cell lymphoma.FUNDING: European Commission, Lymphoma Research Foundation, and Roche.",0,0,0,0
28577938,"Evaluation of the VeriStrat((R)) serum protein test in patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the lung treated with second-line afatinib or erlotinib in the phase III LUX-Lung 8 study.OBJECTIVES: Identification of biomarkers associated with clinical benefit may be crucial in establishing optimal treatment choice for patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the lung after first-line chemotherapy.In this study, the ability of the VeriStrat serum protein test to predict differential clinical benefit with afatinib versus erlotinib, and the association of VeriStrat status with clinical outcomes irrespective of EGFR-TKI used, was assessed in a retrospective analysis of the phase III LUX-Lung 8 trial.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pretreatment plasma samples were analyzed using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.Spectra were evaluated to assign a VeriStrat 'Good' (VS-G) or VeriStrat 'Poor' (VS-P) classification.Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival, and other endpoints were assessed with respect to pretreatment VeriStrat status; OS was the primary efficacy variable.Outcomes with other efficacy endpoints were similar.RESULTS: Of 795 patients randomized in LUX-Lung 8, 675 were classified (VS-G: 412; VS-P: 263).In the VS-G group, OS was significantly longer with afatinib versus erlotinib (HR 0.79 [95% CI: 0.63-0.98]).In the VS-P group, there was no significant difference in OS between afatinib and erlotinib (HR 0.90 [0.70-1.16]).However, there was no interaction between VeriStrat classification and treatment group for OS (pinteraction=0.5303).OS was significantly longer in VS-G versus VS-P patients, both in the overall VeriStrat-classified population (HR 0.41 [0.35-0.49]) and afatinib-treated patients (HR 0.40 [0.31-0.51]).Multivariate analysis showed that VeriStrat was an independent predictor of OS in afatinib-treated patients, regardless of ECOG PS or best response to first-line chemotherapy.CONCLUSION: VS-G classification is strongly associated with favorable survival outcomes with either afatinib or erlotinib compared with VS-P classification.In VS-G patients, survival outcomes with afatinib are superior to those with erlotinib.VeriStrat classification may guide treatment decisions in patients with SCC of the lung.ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT01523587.",1,1,1,1

32966755,"Aprepitant for Cough in Lung Cancer. A Randomized Placebo-controlled Trial and Mechanistic Insights.Rationale: Effective cough treatments are a significant unmet need in patients with lung cancer.Aprepitant is a licensed treatment for nausea and vomiting, which blocks substance P activation of NK-1 (neurokinin 1) receptors, a mechanism also implicated in cough.Objectives: To assess aprepitant in patients with lung cancer with cough and evaluate mechanisms in vagal nerve tissue.Methods: Randomized double-blind crossover trial of patients with lung cancer and bothersome cough.They received 3 days of aprepitant or matched placebo; after a 3-day washout, patients crossed to the alternative treatment.The primary endpoint was awake cough frequency measured at screening and Day 3 of each treatment; secondary endpoints included patient-reported outcomes.In vitro, the depolarization of isolated guinea pig and human vagus nerve sections in grease-gap recording chambers, indicative of sensory nerve activation, was measured to evaluate the mechanism.Measurements and Main Results: Twenty patients with lung cancer enrolled, with a mean age 66 years (+/-7.7); 60% were female and 80% had non-small cell cancer, 50% had advanced stage, and 55% had World Health Organization performance status 1.Cough frequency improved with aprepitant, reducing by 22.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.8-37.7%) over placebo while awake (P = 0.03), 30.3% (95% CI, 12.7-44.3) over 24 hours (P = 0.002), and 59.8% (95% CI, 15.1-86.0) during sleep (P = 0.081).Patient-reported outcomes all significantly improved.Substance P depolarized both guinea pig and human vagus nerve.Aprepitant significantly inhibited substance P-induced depolarization by 78% in guinea pig (P = 0.0145) and 94% in human vagus (P = 0.0145).Conclusions: Substance P activation of NK-1 receptors appears to be an important mechanism driving cough in lung cancer, and NK-1 antagonists show promise as antitussive therapies.",1,1,0,0

25795410,"Nivolumab versus chemotherapy in patients with advanced melanoma who progressed after anti-CTLA-4 treatment (CheckMate 037): a randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Nivolumab, a fully human IgG4 PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor antibody, can result in durable responses in patients with melanoma who have progressed after ipilimumab and BRAF inhibitors.We assessed the efficacy and safety of nivolumab compared with investigator's choice of chemotherapy (ICC) as a second-line or later-line treatment in patients with advanced melanoma.METHODS: In this randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 3 trial, we recruited patients at 90 sites in 14 countries.Eligible patients were 18 years or older, had unresectable or metastatic melanoma, and progressed after ipilimumab, or ipilimumab and a BRAF inhibitor if they were BRAF(V 600) mutation-positive.Participating investigators randomly assigned (with an interactive voice response system) patients 2:1 to receive an intravenous infusion of nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks or ICC (dacarbazine 1000 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks or paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2) combined with carboplatin area under the curve 6 every 3 weeks) until progression or unacceptable toxic effects.We stratified randomisation by BRAF mutation status, tumour expression of PD-L1, and previous best overall response to ipilimumab.We used permuted blocks (block size of six) within each stratum.Primary endpoints were the proportion of patients who had an objective response and overall survival.Treatment was given open-label, but those doing tumour assessments were masked to treatment assignment.We assessed objective responses per-protocol after 120 patients had been treated with nivolumab and had a minimum follow-up of 24 weeks, and safety in all patients who had had at least one dose of treatment.The trial is closed and this is the first interim analysis, reporting the objective response primary endpoint.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01721746.FINDINGS: Between Dec 21, 2012, and Jan 10, 2014, we screened 631 patients, randomly allocating 272 patients to nivolumab and 133 to ICC.Confirmed objective responses were reported in 38 (31.7%, 95% CI 23.5-40.8) of the first 120 patients in the nivolumab group versus five (10.6%, 3.5-23.1) of 47 patients in the ICC group.Grade 3-4 adverse events related to nivolumab included increased lipase (three [1%] of 268 patients), increased alanine aminotransferase, anaemia, and fatigue (two [1%] each); for ICC, these included neutropenia (14 [14%] of 102), thrombocytopenia (six [6%]), and anaemia (five [5%]).We noted grade 3-4 drug-related serious adverse events in 12 (5%) nivolumab-treated patients and nine (9%) patients in the ICC group.No treatment-related deaths occurred.INTERPRETATION: Nivolumab led to a greater proportion of patients achieving an objective response and fewer toxic effects than with alternative available chemotherapy regimens for patients with advanced melanoma that has progressed after ipilimumab or ipilimumab and a BRAF inhibitor.Nivolumab represents a new treatment option with clinically meaningful durable objective responses in a population of high unmet need.FUNDING: Bristol-Myers Squibb.",1,1,1,1
24881631,"Ibrutinib versus ofatumumab in previously treated chronic lymphoid leukemia.BACKGROUND: In patients with chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), a short duration of response to therapy or adverse cytogenetic abnormalities are associated with a poor outcome.We evaluated the efficacy of ibrutinib, a covalent inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase, in patients at risk for a poor outcome.METHODS: In this multicenter, open-label, phase 3 study, we randomly assigned 391 patients with relapsed or refractory CLL or SLL to receive daily ibrutinib or the anti-CD20 antibody ofatumumab.The primary end point was the duration of progression-free survival, with the duration of overall survival and the overall response rate as secondary end points.RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 9.4 months, ibrutinib significantly improved progression-free survival; the median duration was not reached in the ibrutinib group (with a rate of progression-free survival of 88% at 6 months), as compared with a median of 8.1 months in the ofatumumab group (hazard ratio for progression or death in the ibrutinib group, 0.22; P<0.001).Ibrutinib also significantly improved overall survival (hazard ratio for death, 0.43; P=0.005).At 12 months, the overall survival rate was 90% in the ibrutinib group and 81% in the ofatumumab group.The overall response rate was significantly higher in the ibrutinib group than in the ofatumumab group (42.6% vs. 4.1%, P<0.001).An additional 20% of ibrutinib-treated patients had a partial response with lymphocytosis.Similar effects were observed regardless of whether patients had a chromosome 17p13.1 deletion or resistance to purine analogues.The most frequent nonhematologic adverse events were diarrhea, fatigue, pyrexia, and nausea in the ibrutinib group and fatigue, infusion-related reactions, and cough in the ofatumumab group.CONCLUSIONS: Ibrutinib, as compared with ofatumumab, significantly improved progression-free survival, overall survival, and response rate among patients with previously treated CLL or SLL.(Funded by Pharmacyclics and Janssen; RESONATE ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01578707.).",1,1,1,1
30833647,"Phase III randomised trial comparing 6 vs. 12-month of capecitabine as adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with stage III colon cancer: final results of the JFMC37-0801 study.BACKGROUND: Up to 6-months oxaliplatin-containing regimen is now widely accepted as a standard adjuvant chemotherapy for stage III colorectal cancer (CRC).However, oral fluoropyrimidine monotherapy is used for some part of patients, especially in Asian countries including Japan, and its optimal duration is yet to be fully investigated.METHODS: A total of 1306 patients with curatively-resected stage III CRC were randomly assigned to receive capecitabine (2500 mg/m(2)/day) for 14 out of 21 days for 6 (n = 654) or 12 (n = 650) months.The primary endpoint was disease-free survival (DFS), and the secondary endpoints were relapse-free survival (RFS), overall survival (OS), and adverse events.RESULTS: The 3- and 5-year DFS were 70.0% and 65.3% in the 6M group and 75.3% and 68.7% in the 12M group, respectively (p = 0.0549, HR = 0.858, 90% CI: 0.732-1.004).The 5-year RFS was 69.3% and 74.1% in the 6M and 12M groups, respectively (p = 0.0143, HR = 0.796, 90% CI: 0.670-0.945).The 5-year OS was 83.2% and 87.6%, respectively (p = 0.0124, HR = 0.727, 90% CI: 0.575-0.919).The incidence of overall grade 3-4 adverse events was almost comparable in both groups.CONCLUSIONS: Although 12-month adjuvant capecitabine did not demonstrate superior DFS to that of 6-month, the observed better RFS and OS in the 12-month treatment period could be of value in selected cases.",1,1,1,1
33655778,"Personalized Decision Making on Genomic Testing in Early Breast Cancer: Expanding the MINDACT Trial with Decision-Analytic Modeling.BACKGROUND: Genomic tests may improve upon clinical risk estimation with traditional prognostic factors.We aimed to explore how evidence on the prognostic strength of a genomic signature (clinical validity) can contribute to individualized decision making on starting chemotherapy for women with breast cancer (clinical utility).METHODS: The MINDACT trial was a randomized trial that enrolled 6693 women with early-stage breast cancer.A 70-gene signature (Mammaprint) was used to estimate genomic risk, and clinical risk was estimated by a dichotomized version of the Adjuvant!Online risk calculator.Women with discordant risk results were randomized to the use of chemotherapy.We simulated the full risk distribution of these women and estimated individual benefit, assuming a constant relative effect of chemotherapy.RESULTS: The trial showed a prognostic effect of the genomic signature (adjusted hazard ratio 2.4).A decision-analytic modeling approach identified far fewer women as candidates for genetic testing (4% rather than 50%) and fewer benefiting from chemotherapy (3% rather than 27%) as compared with the MINDACT trial report.The selection of women benefitting from genetic testing and chemotherapy depended strongly on the required benefit from treatment and the assumed therapeutic effect of chemotherapy.CONCLUSIONS: A high-quality pragmatic trial was insufficient to directly inform clinical practice on the utility of a genomic test for individual women.The indication for genomic testing may be far more limited than suggested by the MINDACT trial.",1,1,1,1

34487222,"Short-term fasting in glioma patients: analysis of diet diaries and metabolic parameters of the ERGO2 trial.PURPOSE: The prospective, randomized ERGO2 trial investigated the effect of calorie-restricted ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting (KD-IF) on re-irradiation for recurrent brain tumors.The study did not meet its primary endpoint of improved progression-free survival in comparison to standard diet (SD).We here report the results of the quality of life/neurocognition and a detailed analysis of the diet diaries.METHODS: 50 patients were randomized 1:1 to re-irradiation combined with either SD or KD-IF.The KD-IF schedule included 3 days of ketogenic diet (KD: 21-23 kcal/kg/d, carbohydrate intake limited to 50 g/d), followed by 3 days of fasting and again 3 days of KD.Follow-up included examination of cognition, quality of life and serum samples.RESULTS: The 20 patients who completed KD-IF met the prespecified goals for calorie and carbohydrate restriction.Substantial decreases in leptin and insulin and an increase in uric acid were observed.The SD group, of note, had a lower calorie intake than expected (21 kcal/kg/d instead of 30 kcal/kg/d).Neither quality of life nor cognition were affected by the diet.Low glucose emerged as a significant prognostic parameter in a best responder analysis.CONCLUSION: The strict caloric goals of the ERGO2 trial were tolerated well by patients with recurrent brain cancer.The short diet schedule led to significant metabolic changes with low glucose emerging as a candidate marker of better prognosis.The unexpected lower calorie intake of the control group complicates the interpretation of the results.Clinicaltrials.gov number: NCT01754350; Registration: 21.12.2012.",1,1,1,1
29534639,"Cytokeratin-18 fragments predict treatment response and overall survival in gastric cancer in a randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer is common malignancy and exhibits a poor prognosis.At the time of diagnosis, the majority of patients present with metastatic disease which precludes curative treatment.Non-invasive biomarkers which discriminate early from advanced stages or predict the response to treatment are urgently required.This study explored the cytokeratin-18 fragment M30 and full-length cytokeratin-18 M65 in predicting treatment response and survival in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of advanced gastric cancer.METHODS: Patients enrolled in the SUN-CASE study received sunitinib or placebo as an adjunct to standard therapy with leucovorin (Ca-folinate), 5-fluorouracil, and irinotecan in second or third line.Treatment response rates, progression-free survival and overall survival were assessed during a follow-up period of 12 months.Cytokeratin-18 fragments were analyzed in 52 patients at baseline and day 14 of therapy.RESULTS: Levels of M30 correlated with the presence of metastasis and lymph node involvement and decreased significantly during chemotherapy.Importantly, baseline levels of M30 were significantly higher in patients who failed therapy.In addition, patients who did not respond to treatment were also identifiable at day 14 based on elevated M30 levels.By stepwise regression analysis, M30 at day 14 was identified as independent predictor of treatment response.Likewise, serum levels of full-length cytokeratin-18 M65 at baseline also correlated with treatment failure and progression-free survival.The addition of sunitinib did not exert any effects on serum levels of M30 or M65.CONCLUSION: The cytokeratin-18 fragment M30 at day 14 identifies patients that fail to second- or third-line therapy for advanced gastric cancer.Validation of this non-invasive biomarker in gastric cancer is warranted.",1,1,1,1

27112319,"Protocol of a randomized controlled trial of the fear of recurrence therapy (FORT) intervention for women with breast or gynecological cancer.BACKGROUND: Clinically significant levels of fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) affect up to 49% of cancer survivors and are more prevalent among women.FCR is associated with psychological distress, lower quality of life, and increased use of medical resources.Despite its prevalence, FCR is poorly addressed in clinical care.To address this problem, we first developed, and pilot tested a 6-week, 2 h, Cognitive-existential group intervention therapy that targeted FCR in survivors of breast or gynecological cancer.Following the positive outcome of the pilot, we are now testing this approach in a randomized clinical trial (RCT).Goal and hypotheses: This multicenter, prospective RCT aims to test the efficacy of the intervention.The study hypotheses are that, compared to a control group, cancer survivors participating in the intervention (1) will have less FCR, (2) will show more favorable outcomes on the following measures: cancer-specific distress, quality of life, illness uncertainty, intolerance of uncertainty, perceived risk of cancer recurrence, and coping skills.We further postulate that the between-group differences will persist three and 6 months post-intervention.METHODS: Sixteen groups of seven to nine women are being allocated to the intervention or the control group.The control group receives a 6-week, 2 h, structurally equivalent support group.We are recruiting 144 cancer survivors from four hospital sites in three Canadian cities.The sample size was based on the moderate pre/post-test changes found in our pilot study and adjusted to the drop-out rates.MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome, FCR, is measured by the Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory.Secondary outcomes measured include cancer-specific distress, perceived risk of cancer recurrence, illness uncertainty, intolerance of uncertainty, coping, and quality of life.We use reliable and recognized valid scales.Participants are to complete the questionnaire package at four times: before the first group session (baseline), immediately after the sixth session, and 3 and 6 months post-intervention.ANALYSIS: In the descriptive analysis, comparison of group equivalent baseline variables, identification of confounding/intermediate variables and univariate analysis are planned.Each participant's trajectory is calculated using Generalized Estimating Equation models to determine the time and group effects, after considering the correlation structures of the groups.An intent-to-treat analysis approach may be adopted.DISCUSSION: Our Fear of Recurrence Therapy (FORT) intervention has direct implications for clinical service development to improve the quality of life for patients with breast (BC) and gynecological cancer (GC).Based on our pilot data, we are confident that the FORT intervention can guide the development of effective psychosocial cancer survivorship interventions to reduce FCR and improve psychological functioning among women with BC or GC.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Dr. Christine Maheu registered the trial with ISRCTN registry (Registration number: ISRCTN83539618, date assigned 03/09/2014).",0,0,0,0
33891194,"Clinical usefulness of eribulin as first- or second-line chemotherapy for recurrent HER2-negative breast cancer: a randomized phase II study (JBCRG-19).BACKGROUND: Anthracycline (A) or taxane T-based regimens are the standard early-line chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer (BC).A previous study has shown a survival benefit of eribulin in heavily pretreated advanced/recurrent BC patients.The present study aimed to compare the benefit of eribulin with treatment of physician's choice (TPC) as first- or second-line chemotherapy for recurrent HER2-negative BC.METHODS: Patients with recurrent HER2-negative BC previously receiving anthracycline and taxane AT-based chemotherapy in the adjuvant or first-line setting were eligible for this open-label, randomized, parallel-group study.Patients were randomized 1:1 by the minimization method to receive either eribulin (1.4 mg/m(2) on day one and eight of each 21-day cycle) or TPC (paclitaxel, docetaxel, nab-paclitaxel or vinorelbine) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS).Secondary endpoints included time to treatment failure (TTF), overall response rate (ORR), duration of response, and safety (UMIN000009886).RESULTS: Between May 2013 and January 2017, 58 patients were randomized, 57 of whom (26 eribulin and 31 TPC) were analyzed for efficacy.The median PFS was 6.6 months with eribulin versus 4.2 months with TPC (hazard ratio: 0.72 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.40-1.30], p = 0.276).Median TTF was 6.0 months with eribulin versus 3.6 months with TPC (hazard ratio: 0.66 [95% CI, 0.39-1.14], p = 0.136).Other endpoints were also similar between groups.The most common grade >/= 3 adverse event was neutropenia (22.2% with eribulin versus 16.1% with TPC).CONCLUSIONS: Eribulin seemed to improve PFS or TTF compared with TPC without statistical significance.Further validation studies are needed.",1,1,1,1

Patients received 7 treatment cycles in median (1-35) with a median treatment duration of 4.7 months (141 days, 8-765).PFS rate at 6 months was 54% in patients treated with cisplatin/gemcitabine and panitumumab but was 73% in patients treated with cisplatin/gemcitabine without antibody, respectively.Secondary end-points were an ORR of 45% in treatment arm A compared with 39% receiving treatment B and a median OS of 12.8 months (arm A) and of 20.1 months (arm B), respectively.In contrast to the p53-status, genetic alterations in IDH1/2 were linked to a high response after chemotherapy and prolonged survival.In accordance with our results, the meta-analysis of 12 trials did not reveal a survival advantage for patients treated with EGFR antibodies compared with chemotherapy alone.CONCLUSIONS: Panitumumab in combination with chemotherapy does not improve ORR, PFS and OS in patients with KRAS wild-type, advanced biliary cancer.Genetic profiling should be included in CCA trials to identify and validate predictive and prognostic biomarkers.CLINICAL TRIALS NUMBER: The trial was registered with NCT01320254.",1,1,1,1
30150014,"Erlotinib versus vinorelbine plus cisplatin as adjuvant therapy in Chinese patients with stage IIIA EGFR mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (EVAN): a randomised, open-label, phase 2 trial.BACKGROUND: Adjuvant chemotherapy after radical resection of stage IIIA non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has quite poor outcomes.We aimed to investigate whether adjuvant erlotinib therapy improves 2-year disease-free survival compared with chemotherapy in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation-positive stage IIIA NSCLC.METHODS: In this randomised, open-label, phase 2 trial, eligible patients aged 18-75 years who had undergone complete (R0) resection of histologically or pathologically confirmed stage IIIA EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC and had not received any previous anticancer therapies were enrolled.Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either adjuvant erlotinib (150 mg once daily administered orally) or vinorelbine and cisplatin chemotherapy (four cycles of vinorelbine [25 mg/m(2) intravenously on days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle] plus cisplatin [75 mg/m(2) intravenously on day 1 of each 21-day cycle]).Randomisation was done by Simon's minimisation with a random element and was stratified by EGFR activating mutation type (exon 19 vs 21), histology (adenocarcinoma vs non-adenocarcinoma), and smoking status (smoker vs non-smoker).The primary endpoint in the unblinded intention-to-treat analysis was 2-year disease-free survival.This ongoing study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01683175.FINDINGS: Between Sept 8, 2012, and May 21, 2015, 102 patients from 16 centres across China were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive erlotinib (n=51) or chemotherapy (n=51).Median follow-up was 33.0 months (IQR 17.8-43.1).2-year disease-free survival was 81.4% (95% CI 69.6-93.1) in the erlotinib group and 44.6% (26.9-62.4) in the chemotherapy group (relative risk 1.823 [95% CI 1.194-2.784; p=0.0054).The difference in 2-year disease-free survival between the groups was 36.7% (95% CI 15.5-58.0; p=0.0007).Adverse events of any grade occurred in 29 (58%) of 50 patients in the erlotinib group and 28 (65%) of 43 patients in the chemotherapy group.Grade 3 or worse adverse events occurred in six (12%) of 50 patients in the erlotinib group versus 11 (26%) of 43 in the chemotherapy group; the most common of these in the erlotinib group was rash (in two [4%] of 50 patients) and in the chemotherapy group were decreased neutrophil count (in seven [16%] of 43 patients) and myelosuppression (in four [9%]).No treatment-related deaths were reported.INTERPRETATION: Adjuvant erlotinib improved 2-year disease-free survival in patients with EGFR mutation-positive stage IIIA NSCLC compared with chemotherapy, with a better tolerability profile.This study suggests that tyrosine kinase inhibitors could have a potentially important role as adjuvant therapy in EGFR mutation-positive stage IIIA NSCLC.However, this trial was a phase 2 study.Mature overall survival data are also needed.Ongoing studies will hopefully confirm the role of adjuvant EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy in patients with NSCLC.FUNDING: National Key Research and Development Program of China and Shanghai Roche Pharmaceuticals Ltd.",1,1,1,1

The response rate (according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors [RECIST]) was 22% in arm A (4 complete responses [CRs] and 8 partial responses [PRs]) and 17% in arm B (1 CR and 4 PRs).Stable disease or PR or CR was noted in 65% of patients in arm A and 48% of patients in arm B. The combination was found to be superior to monotherapy in patients with high and low levels of serum VEGF and VEGF receptor 2.Adverse events were consistent with the expected profiles of monotherapy with IL-2 and ziv-aflibercept.CONCLUSIONS: Ziv-aflibercept and IL-2 were found to significantly improve PFS compared with IL-2 alone, thereby meeting the primary endpoint of the current study.These findings support further study of immunotherapeutic combination strategies involving VEGF inhibitors.",1,1,1,1

27823821,"Prostate high dose-rate brachytherapy as monotherapy for low and intermediate risk prostate cancer: Early toxicity and quality-of life results from a randomized phase II clinical trial of one fraction of 19Gy or two fractions of 13.5Gy.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Multi-fraction high dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy as monotherapy is safe and effective for low and intermediate risk prostate cancer.Two or single fraction regimens have some radiobiological rationale.The purpose is to determine toxicity and effect on health related quality of life (HRQOL) of single fraction 19Gy or 13.5Gyx2.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eligible patients had low or intermediate risk prostate cancer, prostate volume <60cc, and no androgen deprivation use.170 patients were randomized to receive either a single 19Gy or two fractions of 13.5Gy 1week apart.HRQOL was measured using the Expanded Prostate Index Composite (EPIC), toxicity with Common Terminology for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0 and urinary symptoms with the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS).RESULTS: Median follow-up is 20months.Grade 2 urinary toxicity occurred in 51% within the first 3months and in 31% thereafter with no significant difference between treatment arms.Ten patients (6%) developed urinary retention in the acute phase, although only 4 (2.4%) required a catheter for more than 48h.One Grade 3 acute (3months) and late (>3months) urinary toxicity occurred.No more than 1% had any Grade 2 GI toxicity.The 2-fraction arm had a higher occurrence of grade 2 erectile dysfunction (29% vs. 11.5%, p=0.0249) and higher IPSS scores for the first year.Mean EPIC urinary scores at 12months decreased by 4.0 and 4.6, and sexual scores decreased by 8 and 15.9 (p=0.035) in the single and 2-fraction arms, respectively.No change occurred in the bowel or hormonal domains.CONCLUSIONS: Single 19Gy and 13.5Gyx2 are both well tolerated.During the first 12months, urinary symptoms and erectile dysfunction are more common in the 2-fraction arm.",0,0,0,0
30160789,"Multicenter randomized trial of arsenic trioxide and Realgar-Indigo naturalis formula in pediatric patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia: Interim results of the SCCLG-APL clinical study.Intravenous arsenic trioxide (ATO) has been adopted as the first-line treatment for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL).Another arsenic compound named the Realgar-Indigo naturalis formula (RIF), an oral traditional Chinese medicine containing As4 S4 , has been shown to be highly effective in treating adult APL.In the treatment of pediatric APL, the safety and efficacy of RIF remains to be confirmed.This randomized, multicenter, and noninferiority trial was conducted to determine whether intravenous ATO can be substituted by oral RIF in the treatment of pediatric APL.From September 2011 to January 2017, among 92 patients who were 16 years old or younger with newly diagnosed PML-RARa positive APL, 82 met eligible criteria and were randomly assigned to ATO (n = 42) or RIF (n = 40) group.The remaining 10 patients did not fulfilled eligible criteria because five did not accept randomization, four died and one had hemiplegia prior to arsenic randomization due to intracranial hemorrhage or cerebral thrombosis.Induction and consolidation treatment contained ATO or RIF, all-trans-retinoic acid and low intensity chemotherapy.End points included event-free survival (EFS), adverse events and hospital days.After a median 3-year follow-up, the estimated 5-year EFS was 100% in both groups, and adverse events were mild.However, patients in the RIF group had significantly less hospital stay than those in the ATO group.This interim analysis shows that oral RIF is as effective and safe as intravenous ATO for the treatment of pediatric APL, with the advantage of reducing hospital stay.Final trial analysis will reveal mature outcome data.",1,1,1,1
28579538,"Late Recurrence of Barrett's Esophagus After Complete Eradication of Intestinal Metaplasia is Rare: Final Report From Ablation in Intestinal Metaplasia Containing Dysplasia Trial.BACKGROUND & AIMS: The goal of treatment for Barrett's esophagus (BE) with dysplasia is complete eradication of intestinal metaplasia (CEIM).The long-term durability of CEIM has not been well characterized, so the frequency and duration of surveillance are unclear.We report results from a 5-year follow-up analysis of patients with BE and dysplasia treated by radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in the randomized controlled Ablation of Intestinal Metaplasia Containing Dysplasia (AIM) trial.METHODS: Participants for the AIM Dysplasia trial (18-80 years old) were recruited from 19 sites in the United States and had endoscopic evidence of non-nodular dysplastic BE </=8 cm in length.Subjects (n = 127) were randomly assigned (2:1 ratio) to receive either RFA (entire BE segment ablated circumferentially) or a sham endoscopic procedure; patients in the sham group were offered RFA treatment 1 year later, and all patients were followed for 5 years.We collected data on BE recurrence (defined as intestinal metaplasia in the tubular esophagus) and dysplastic BE recurrence among patients who achieved CEIM.We constructed Kaplan-Meier estimates and applied parametric survival analysis to examine proportions of patients without any recurrence and without dysplastic recurrence.RESULTS: Of 127 patients in the AIM Dysplasia trial, 119 received RFA and met inclusion criteria.Of those 119, 110 (92%) achieved CEIM.Over 401 person-years of follow-up (mean, 3.6 years per patient; range, 0.2-5.8 years), 35 of 110 (32%) patients had recurrence of BE or dysplasia, and 19 (17%) had dysplasia recurrence.The incidence rate of BE recurrence was 10.8 per 100 person-years overall (95% CI, 7.8-15.0); 8.3 per 100 person-years among patients with baseline low-grade dysplasia (95% CI, 4.9-14.0), and 13.5 per 100 person-years among patients with baseline high-grade dysplasia (95% CI 8.8-20.7).The incidence rate of dysplasia recurrence was 5.2 per 100 person-years overall (95% CI 3.3-8.2); 3.3 per 100 person-years among patients with baseline low-grade dysplasia (95% CI 1.5-7.2), and 7.3 per 100 person-years among patients with baseline high-grade dysplasia (95% CI 4.2-12.5).Neither BE nor dysplasia recurred at a constant rate.There was a greater probability of recurrence in the first year following CEIM than in the following 4 years combined.CONCLUSIONS: In this analysis of prospective cohort data from the AIM Dysplasia trial, we found BE to recur after CEIM by RFA in almost one third of patients with baseline dysplastic disease; most recurrences occurred during the first year after CEIM.However, patients who achieved CEIM and remained BE free at 1 year after RFA had a low risk of BE recurrence.Studies are needed to determine when surveillance can be decreased or discontinued; our study did not identify any BE or dysplasia recurrence after 4 years of surveillance.",0,0,0,0

The goal of our study was to determine interest in participating in our 3-month home-based walking regimen in patients with advanced stage lung cancer.We used a randomized design to evaluate for potential benefit in PA and patient-reported outcomes.METHODS: We performed an open-label, 1:1 randomized trial in 40 patients with stage III/IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) evaluating enrollment rate, PA, QoL, dyspnea, depression, and biomarkers.Compared to usual care (UC), the intervention group (IG) received an accelerometer, in-person teaching session, and gain-framed text messages for 12 weeks.RESULTS: We enrolled 56% (40/71) of eligible patients.Participants were on average 65 years and enrolled 1.9 years from diagnosis.Most patients were women (75%), and receiving treatment (85%) for stage IV (73%) adenocarcinoma (83%).A minority of patients were employed part-time or full time (38%).Both groups reported low baseline PA (IG mean 37 (Standard deviation (SD) 46) vs UC 59 (SD 56) minutes/week; p = 0.25).The IG increased PA more than UC (mean change IG + 123 (SD 212) vs UC + 35 (SD 103) minutes/week; p = 0.051)).Step count in the IG was not statistically different between baseline (4707 step/day), week 6 (5605; p = 0.16), and week 12 (4606 steps/day; p = 0.87).The intervention improved EORTC role functioning domain (17 points; p = 0.022) with borderline improvement in dyspnea (- 13 points; p = 0.051) compared to UC.In patients with two blood samples (25%), we observed a significant increase in soluble PD-1 (219.8 (SD 54.5) pg/mL; p < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Our pilot trial using a 3-month, home-based, mobile health intervention enrolled over half of eligible patients with stage III and IV NSCLC.The intervention increased PA, and may improve several aspects of QoL. We also identified potential biomarker changes relevant to lung cancer biology.Future research should use a larger sample to examine the effect of exercise on cancer biomarkers, which may mediate the association between PA and QoL.

32246224,"A randomized, phase 2 study of deoxyuridine triphosphatase inhibitor, TAS-114, in combination with S-1 versus S-1 alone in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.Introduction TAS-114 is a potent inhibitor of deoxyuridine triphosphatase, which is a gatekeeper protein preventing uracil and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) misincorporation into DNA.TAS-114 has been suggested to enhance the antitumor activity of 5-FU.This randomized, phase 2 study investigated TAS-114 plus S-1 (TAS-114/S-1) vs. S-1 in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.Methods Patients with advanced NSCLC, previously treated with >/= 2 regimens, were randomized 1:1 to receive TAS-114 (400 mg)/S-1 (30 mg/m(2)) or S-1 (30 mg/m(2)).Progression-free survival (PFS, independent central review) was the primary endpoint.Secondary endpoints included disease control rate (DCR), overall survival (OS), overall response rate (ORR), and safety.Results In total, 127 patients received treatment.Median PFS was 3.65 and 4.17 months in the TAS-114/S-1 and S-1 groups, respectively (hazard ratio [HR] 1.16, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.71-1.88; P = 0.2744).DCR was similar between groups (TAS-114/S-1 80.3%, S-1 75.9%) and median OS was 7.92 and 9.82 months for the TAS-114/S-1 and S-1 groups, respectively (HR 1.31, 95% CI 0.80-2.14; P = 0.1431).The ORR was higher in the TAS-114/S-1 group than the S-1 group (19.7% vs. 10.3%), and more patients with tumor shrinkage were observed in the TAS-114/S-1 group.Incidence rates of anemia, skin toxicities, and Grade >/= 3 treatment-related adverse events were higher in the TAS-114/S-1 group compared with the monotherapy group.Conclusions Although the TAS-114/S-1 combination improved the response rate, this did not translate into improvements in PFS.Clinical Trial Registration No. NCT02855125 (ClinicalTrials.gov) registered on 4 August 2016.",1,1,1,1
28958502,"Dacomitinib versus gefitinib as first-line treatment for patients with EGFR-mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (ARCHER 1050): a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Dacomitinib is a second-generation, irreversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor.We compared its efficacy and safety with that of the reversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib in the first-line treatment of patients with advanced EGFR-mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).METHODS: In this international, multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3 study (ARCHER 1050), we enrolled adults (aged >/=18 years or >/=20 years in Japan and South Korea) with newly diagnosed advanced NSCLC and one EGFR mutation (exon 19 deletion or Leu858Arg) at 71 academic medical centres and university hospitals in seven countries or special administrative regions.We randomly assigned participants (1:1) to receive oral dacomitinib 45 mg/day (in 28-day cycles) or oral gefitinib 250 mg/day (in 28-day cycles) until disease progression or another discontinuation criterion was met.Randomisation, stratified by race and EGFR mutation type, was done with a computer-generated random code assigned by a central interactive web response system.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival assessed by masked independent review in the intention-to-treat population.Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01774721, and is ongoing but no longer recruiting patients.FINDINGS: Between May 9, 2013, and March 20, 2015, 452 eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive dacomitinib (n=227) or gefitinib (n=225).Median duration of follow-up for progression-free survival was 22.1 months (95% CI 20.3-23.9).Median progression-free survival according to masked independent review was 14.7 months (95% CI 11.1-16.6) in the dacomitinib group and 9.2 months (9.1-11.0) in the gefitinib group (hazard ratio 0.59, 95% CI 0.47-0.74; p<0.0001).The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were dermatitis acneiform (31 [14%] of 227 patients given dacomitinib vs none of 224 patients given gefitinib), diarrhoea (19 [8%] vs two [1%]), and raised alanine aminotransferase levels (two [1%] vs 19 [8%]).Treatment-related serious adverse events were reported in 21 (9%) patients given dacomitinib and in ten (4%) patients given gefitinib.Two treatment-related deaths occurred in the dacomitinib group (one related to untreated diarrhoea and one to untreated cholelithases/liver disease) and one in the gefitinib group (related to sigmoid colon diverticulitis/rupture complicated by pneumonia).INTERPRETATION: Dacomitinib significantly improved progression-free survival over gefitinib in first-line treatment of patients with EGFR-mutation-positive NSCLC and should be considered as a new treatment option for this population.FUNDING: SFJ Pharmaceuticals Group and Pfizer.",1,1,1,1
25795410,"Nivolumab versus chemotherapy in patients with advanced melanoma who progressed after anti-CTLA-4 treatment (CheckMate 037): a randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Nivolumab, a fully human IgG4 PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor antibody, can result in durable responses in patients with melanoma who have progressed after ipilimumab and BRAF inhibitors.We assessed the efficacy and safety of nivolumab compared with investigator's choice of chemotherapy (ICC) as a second-line or later-line treatment in patients with advanced melanoma.METHODS: In this randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 3 trial, we recruited patients at 90 sites in 14 countries.Eligible patients were 18 years or older, had unresectable or metastatic melanoma, and progressed after ipilimumab, or ipilimumab and a BRAF inhibitor if they were BRAF(V 600) mutation-positive.Participating investigators randomly assigned (with an interactive voice response system) patients 2:1 to receive an intravenous infusion of nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks or ICC (dacarbazine 1000 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks or paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2) combined with carboplatin area under the curve 6 every 3 weeks) until progression or unacceptable toxic effects.We stratified randomisation by BRAF mutation status, tumour expression of PD-L1, and previous best overall response to ipilimumab.We used permuted blocks (block size of six) within each stratum.Primary endpoints were the proportion of patients who had an objective response and overall survival.Treatment was given open-label, but those doing tumour assessments were masked to treatment assignment.We assessed objective responses per-protocol after 120 patients had been treated with nivolumab and had a minimum follow-up of 24 weeks, and safety in all patients who had had at least one dose of treatment.The trial is closed and this is the first interim analysis, reporting the objective response primary endpoint.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01721746.FINDINGS: Between Dec 21, 2012, and Jan 10, 2014, we screened 631 patients, randomly allocating 272 patients to nivolumab and 133 to ICC.Confirmed objective responses were reported in 38 (31.7%, 95% CI 23.5-40.8) of the first 120 patients in the nivolumab group versus five (10.6%, 3.5-23.1) of 47 patients in the ICC group.Grade 3-4 adverse events related to nivolumab included increased lipase (three [1%] of 268 patients), increased alanine aminotransferase, anaemia, and fatigue (two [1%] each); for ICC, these included neutropenia (14 [14%] of 102), thrombocytopenia (six [6%]), and anaemia (five [5%]).We noted grade 3-4 drug-related serious adverse events in 12 (5%) nivolumab-treated patients and nine (9%) patients in the ICC group.No treatment-related deaths occurred.INTERPRETATION: Nivolumab led to a greater proportion of patients achieving an objective response and fewer toxic effects than with alternative available chemotherapy regimens for patients with advanced melanoma that has progressed after ipilimumab or ipilimumab and a BRAF inhibitor.Nivolumab represents a new treatment option with clinically meaningful durable objective responses in a population of high unmet need.FUNDING: Bristol-Myers Squibb.",1,1,1,1
25891302,"The effect, moderators, and mediators of resistance and aerobic exercise on health-related quality of life in older long-term survivors of prostate cancer.BACKGROUND: The current study examined effects, moderators (for whom), and mediators (working mechanisms) of 12 months of exercise on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in older long-term survivors of prostate cancer.METHODS: In total, 100 men aged 71.7 years (standard deviation, 6.4 years) were randomly assigned to 6 months of supervised aerobic and resistance exercise followed by 6 months of a home-based exercise maintenance program (EX group) or printed education material regarding physical activity for 12 months (PA group).Assessments took place at baseline and after 6 and 12 months.Generalized estimating equations were used to study the effects of EX versus PA on HRQoL at 6 and 12 months, adjusting for baseline HRQoL. The authors examined potential sociodemographic and clinical moderators by adding interaction terms, and potential physical and psychological mediators using the product-of-coefficients test.RESULTS: At 6 months, significant beneficial effects were found for global QoL, physical function, and social function in the EX group compared with the PA group.For physical function, beneficial effects were sustained at 12 months.Moderation analyses demonstrated larger effects of EX versus PA for patients who were married, started exercising sooner after their diagnosis, and previously used bisphosphonates.Changes in lower body functional performance significantly mediated the effect of EX on global QoL, physical function, and social function.No mediating effects on HRQoL were found for aerobic fitness, physical activity, fatigue, distress, or falls self-efficacy.CONCLUSIONS: Aerobic and resistance exercise appears to have beneficial effects on HRQoL among older, long-term survivors of prostate cancer.Effects were moderated by marital status, time since diagnosis, and use of bisphosphonates, and were mediated by lower body functional performance.",0,0,0,0
25057173,"EGFR biomarkers predict benefit from vandetanib in combination with docetaxel in a randomized phase III study of second-line treatment of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.BACKGROUND: ZODIAC was a randomized phase III study of second-line treatment in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that evaluated the addition of vandetanib to docetaxel.The study showed a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival and objective response rate, but not in overall survival for unselected patients.This study evaluated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutation, copy number gain, and protein expression, and KRAS gene mutation, in pretreatment tumor samples as potential biomarkers predicting benefit from vandetanib as second-line treatment of NSCLC.PATIENTS AND METHODS: After progression following first-line chemotherapy, 1391 patients with locally advanced or metastatic (stage IIIB/IV) NSCLC were randomized 1 : 1 to receive vandetanib (100 mg/day) plus docetaxel (75 mg/m(2) every 21 days) or placebo plus docetaxel in the ZODIAC study.Archival tumor samples (n = 570) were collected from consenting patients (n = 958) for predefined, prospective biomarker analyses.RESULTS: Of evaluable samples, 14% were EGFR mutation positive, 35% were EGFR FISH positive, 88% were EGFR protein expression positive, and 13% were KRAS mutation positive.Compared with the overall study population, in which progression-free survival (PFS) [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.79] but not OS (HR = 0.91) were significantly improved with vandetanib, there was greater relative clinical benefit for patients with EGFR mutation-positive tumors [PFS HR 0.51, confidence interval (CI) 0.25-1.06 and OS HR 0.46, CI 0.14-1.57] and EGFR FISH-positive tumors (PFS HR 0.61, CI 0.39-0.94 and OS HR 0.48, CI 0.28-0.84).Similarly, patients with EGFR mutation or FISH-positive tumor samples who received vandetanib had an increased chance of objective tumor response (odds ratios 3.34, CI 0.8-13.89, and 3.90, CI 1.02-14.82, respectively).There did not appear to be benefit for vandetanib in patients with KRAS mutation-positive tumors.CONCLUSIONS: High EGFR gene copy number or activating EGFR mutations may identify patient subgroups who receive increased clinical benefit from vandetanib in combination with docetaxel in second-line NSCLC.CLINICALTRIALSGOV: NCT00312377.",1,1,1,1

Week 8 AFP response rate was 50% for cabozantinib versus 13% for placebo.In the cabozantinib arm, median OS for patients with and without AFP response was 16.1 versus 9.1 months (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.45-0.84).AFP response was independently associated with longer OS.The optimal cutoff for association with OS in the cabozantinib arm was </=0% change in AFP at Week 8 [AFP control; HR 0.50 (95% CI, 0.35-0.71)].HRs for PFS were consistent with those for OS.CONCLUSIONS: Cabozantinib improved outcomes versus placebo across a range of baseline AFP levels.On-treatment AFP response and control rates were higher with cabozantinib than placebo, and were associated with longer OS and PFS with cabozantinib.",1,1,1,1
31808921,"Effect of True and Sham Acupuncture on Radiation-Induced Xerostomia Among Patients With Head and Neck Cancer: A Randomized Clinical Trial.Importance: Radiation-induced xerostomia (RIX) is a common, often debilitating, adverse effect of radiation therapy among patients with head and neck cancer.Quality of life can be severely affected, and current treatments have limited benefit.Objective: To determine if acupuncture can prevent RIX in patients with head and neck cancer undergoing radiation therapy.Design, Setting, and Participants: This 2-center, phase 3, randomized clinical trial compared a standard care control (SCC) with true acupuncture (TA) and sham acupuncture (SA) among patients with oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal carcinoma who were undergoing radiation therapy in comprehensive cancer centers in the United States and China.Patients were enrolled between December 16, 2011, and July 7, 2015.Final follow-up was August 15, 2016.Analyses were conducted February 1 through 28, 2019.Intervention: Either TA or SA using a validated acupuncture placebo device was performed 3 times per week during a 6- to 7-week course of radiation therapy.Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was RIX, as determined by the Xerostomia Questionnaire in which a higher score indicates worse RIX, for combined institutions 1 year after radiation therapy ended.Secondary outcomes included incidence of clinically significant xerostomia (score >30), salivary flow, quality of life, salivary constituents, and role of baseline expectancy related to acupuncture on outcomes.Results: Of 399 patients randomized, 339 were included in the final analysis (mean [SD] age, 51.3 [11.7] years; age range, 21-79 years; 258 [77.6%] men), including 112 patients in the TA group, 115 patients in the SA group, and 112 patients in the SCC group.For the primary aim, the adjusted least square mean (SD) xerostomia score in the TA group (26.6 [17.7]) was significantly lower than in the SCC group (34.8 [18.7]) (P = .001; effect size = -0.44) and marginally lower but not statistically significant different from the SA group (31.3 [18.6]) (P = .06; effect size = -0.26).Incidence of clinically significant xerostomia 1 year after radiation therapy ended followed a similar pattern, with 38 patients in the TA group (34.6%), 54 patients in the SA group (47.8%), and 60 patients in the SCC group (55.1%) experiencing clinically significant xerostomia (P = .009).Post hoc comparisons revealed a significant difference between the TA and SCC groups at both institutions, but TA was significantly different from SA only at Fudan University Cancer Center, Shanghai, China (estimated difference [SE]: TA vs SCC, -9.9 [2.5]; P < .001; SA vs SCC, -1.7 [2.5]; P = .50; TA vs SA, -8.2 [2.5]; P = .001), and SA was significantly different from SCC only at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas (estimated difference [SE]: TA vs SCC, -8.1 [3.4]; P = .016; SA vs SCC, -10.5 [3.3]; P = .002; TA vs SA, 2.4 [3.2]; P = .45).Conclusions and Relevance: This randomized clinical trial found that TA resulted in significantly fewer and less severe RIX symptoms 1 year after treatment vs SCC.However, further studies are needed to confirm clinical relevance and generalizability of this finding and to evaluate inconsistencies in response to sham acupuncture between patients in the United States and China.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01266044.",0,0,0,0
31628954,"Underwater versus conventional endoscopic resection of nondiminutive nonpedunculated colorectal lesions: a prospective randomized controlled trial (with video).BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Incomplete resection of colorectal neoplasia decreases the efficacy of colonoscopy.Conventional resection (CR) of polyps, performed in a gas-distended colon, is the current standard, but incomplete resection rates of approximately 2% to 30% for nondiminutive (>5 mm), nonpedunculated lesions are reported.Underwater resection (UR) is a novel technique.The aim of this study was to determine the incomplete resection rates of colorectal lesions removed by UR versus CR.METHODS: In a randomized controlled trial, patients with small (6-9 mm) and large (>/=10 mm) nonpedunculated lesions were assigned to CR (gas-distended lumen) or UR (water-filled, gas-excluded lumen).Small lesions in both arms were removed with a dedicated cold snare.For CR, large lesions were removed with a hot snare after submucosal injection.For UR, large lesions were removed with a hot snare without submucosal injection.Four-quadrant biopsy samples around the resection sites were used to evaluate for incomplete resection.RESULTS: Four hundred sixty-two eligible polyps (248 UR vs 214 CR) from 255 patients were removed.Incomplete resection rates for UR and CR were low and did not differ (2% vs 1.9%, P = .91).UR was performed significantly faster for lesions >/=10mm in size (10-19 mm, 2.9 minutes vs 5.6 minutes, P < .0001); >/=20 mm, 7.3 minutes vs 9.5 minutes, P = .015).CONCLUSIONS: Low incomplete resection rates are achievable with UR and CR.UR is effective and safe with the advantage of faster resection and potential cost savings for removal of larger (>/=10 mm) lesions by avoiding submucosal injection.As an added approach, UR has potential to improve the cost-effectiveness of colonoscopy by increasing efficiency and reducing cost while maintaining quality.(Clinical trial registration number: NCT02889679.).",0,0,0,0

28743247,"A randomized phase II study of paclitaxel alone versus paclitaxel plus sorafenib in second- and third-line treatment of patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer (PASO).BACKGROUND: We conducted an open-label, randomized, two-arm multi-center study to assess the efficacy and safety of paclitaxel versus paclitaxel + sorafenib in patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer.METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive either paclitaxel monotherapy (80 mg/m(2)) weekly (3 weeks on, 1 week off) plus sorafenib 400 mg orally, twice a day taken continuously throughout 28 day cycles.Sorafenib dose was gradually escalated from a starting dose of 200 mg twice a day.The primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS).RESULTS: A pre-planned efficacy interim analysis was performed on the data of 60 patients, 30 patients in each treatment arm.Median PFS was estimated at 6.6 months (95% CI: 5.1 to 9.0) in patients randomized to single-agent paclitaxel (Arm A) and 5.6 months (95% CI: 3.8 to 6.5) in patients randomized to paclitaxel-sorafenib combination (Arm B) therapy.Contrary to the hypothesis, the treatment effect was statistically significant in favor of paclitaxel monotherapy (hazard ratio 1.80, 95% CI: 1.02 to 3.20; log-rank test P = 0.0409).It was decided to stop the trial early for futility.Median OS was also in favor of Arm A (20.7 months (95% CI: 16.4 to 26.7) versus 12.1 months (95% CI: 5.8 to 20.4) in Arm B. Clinical control was achieved in 28 patients (93.3%) in Arm A and in 21 patients 70.0% in Arm B. Overall response rate was met in 43.3% of patients in Arm A and in 40.0% in Arm B. Toxicities were increased in Arm B with higher rates of diarrhea, nausea, neutropenia, hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) and anorexia, Grad 3 and 4 toxicities were rare.CONCLUSIONS: In this pre-planned interim analysis, paclitaxel-sorafenib combination therapy was not found to be superior to paclitaxel monotherapy with regard to the primary end point, progression-free survival.The trial was therefore discontinued early.There was no indication of more favorable outcomes for combination therapy in secondary efficacy end points.As expected, the safety and toxicity profile of the combination therapy was less favorable compared to monotherapy.Overall, this trial did not demonstrate that adding sorafenib to second- or third-line paclitaxel provides any clinical benefit to patients with HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer.Cautious dosing using a sorafenib ramp up schedule might have contributed to negative results.TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered at EudraCT (No 2009-018025-73) and retrospectively registered at Clinical trials.gov on March 17, 2011 ( NCT01320111 ).",1,1,1,1

33667670,"Phase III, randomized trial of mirvetuximab soravtansine versus chemotherapy in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer: primary analysis of FORWARD I.BACKGROUND: Mirvetuximab soravtansine (MIRV) is an antibody-drug conjugate comprising a folate receptor alpha (FRalpha)-binding antibody, cleavable linker, and the maytansinoid DM4, a potent tubulin-targeting agent.The randomized, open-label, phase III study FORWARD I compared MIRV and investigator's choice chemotherapy in patients with platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC).PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients with 1-3 prior lines of therapy and whose tumors were positive for FRalpha expression were randomly assigned, in a 2 : 1 ratio, to receive MIRV (6 mg/kg, adjusted ideal body weight) or chemotherapy (paclitaxel, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, or topotecan).The primary endpoint was progression-free survival [PFS, Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, blinded independent central review] in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population and in the prespecified FRalpha high population.RESULTS: A total of 366 patients were randomized; 243 received MIRV and 109 received chemotherapy.The primary endpoint, PFS, did not reach statistical significance in either the ITT [hazard ratio (HR), 0.98, P = 0.897] or the FRalpha high population (HR, 0.69, P = 0.049).Superior outcomes for MIRV over chemotherapy were observed in all secondary endpoints in the FRalpha high population including improved objective response rate (24% versus 10%), CA-125 responses (53% versus 25%), and patient-reported outcomes (27% versus 13%).Fewer treatment-related grade 3 or higher adverse events (25.1% versus 44.0%), and fewer events leading to dose reduction (19.8% versus 30.3%) and treatment discontinuation (4.5% versus 8.3%) were seen with MIRV compared with chemotherapy.CONCLUSIONS: In patients with platinum-resistant EOC, MIRV did not result in a significant improvement in PFS compared with chemotherapy.Secondary endpoints consistently favored MIRV, particularly in patients with high FRalpha expression.MIRV showed a differentiated and more manageable safety profile than chemotherapy.",1,1,1,1
28399902,"Efficacy and safety of everolimus in combination with trastuzumab and paclitaxel in Asian patients with HER2+ advanced breast cancer in BOLERO-1.BACKGROUND: The current exploratory analysis was performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of everolimus for treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (HER2+) advanced breast cancer in the Asian subset of patients in the BOLERO-1 trial.METHODS: Postmenopausal women with HER2+ advanced breast cancer, who had not received systemic therapy for advanced disease, were randomized 2:1 to receive everolimus or placebo, plus trastuzumab and paclitaxel.The two primary end points were investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) in the full population and in the hormone receptor-negative (HR-) subpopulation.Secondary end points included assessment of the objective response rate, the clinical benefit rate, and safety.RESULTS: In the Asian subset, median PFS was similar in the everolimus (n = 198) and placebo (n = 105) arms in the full analysis set (hazard ratio = 0.82 (95% CI 0.61-1.11)).In the HR- subpopulation, everolimus prolonged median PFS by 10.97 months vs placebo (25.46 vs 14.49 months; hazard ratio = 0.48 (95% CI 0.29-0.79)).In the everolimus arm of the Asian subset, the most common adverse events of any grade were stomatitis (62.2%), diarrhea (48.0%), rash (43.4%) and neutropenia (42.3%).Neutropenia (grade 3: 27.6%; grade 4: 4.6%) and decreased neutrophil count (grade 3: 11.2%; grade 4: 3.6%)were the most frequent grade 3/4 adverse events.Serious adverse events included pneumonia (5.1%), pneumonitis (3.1%), and interstitial lung disease (3.1%).There were three deaths (1.5%) during treatment in the everolimus arm vs none in the placebo arm.CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy and safety of everolimus plus trastuzumab and paclitaxel as first-line treatment for HER2+ advanced breast cancer in the Asian subset was consistent with that reported previously in the overall population.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00876395 .Registered on 2 April 2009.",1,1,1,1
29580733,"The administration of adjuvant chemo(-immuno) therapy in the post ACOSOG-Z0011 era; a population based study.PURPOSE: The ACOSOG-Z0011-study has resulted in a trend to a more conservative treatment of the axilla for selected sentinel-node-positive patients.However, axillary nodal involvement has always been an important factor for tumor staging and tailoring adjuvant chemotherapy plans.This study evaluates the impact of omitting completion axillary lymph node dissection (cALND) on the administration of adjuvant chemo (-immuno)therapy in Dutch clinical T1-2N0M0 (cT1-2N0M0) sentinel-node-positive breast cancer patients.METHODS: Data were obtained from the nationwide NABON breast cancer audit.Descriptive analyses were used to demonstrate trends in axillary surgery and adjuvant chemo (-immuno)therapy.Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with the prescription of chemo (-immuno)therapy.RESULTS: In this cohort of 4331 patients, the omission of a cALND increased from 34% to 92%, and the administration of chemo (-immuno)therapy decreased from 68% to 55%, between 2011 and 2015 (P < 0.001).Patients treated with cALND had an OR of 2.2 for receiving adjuvant chemo (-immuno)therapy compared with SLNB only patients.Lower age, a hormone receptor (HR) status other than HR-positive, HER2-negative, increasing tumor grade and stage, and a lymph node status >/= pN2 were independently associated with a higher probability of chemo (-immuno)therapy (P < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that Dutch cT1-2N0M0 sentinel node-positive breast cancer patients treated with cALND had a higher independent probability for receiving adjuvant chemo (-immuno)therapy compared with SLNB only patients, even when corrected for lymph node status and HR-status.Probably, the decisions to administer adjuvant chemo (-immuno)therapy were not only based on guidelines and tumor characteristics, but also on the preferences from physicians and patients.",0,0,0,0
25907945,"[Perioperative immunomodulatory therapy does not decrease postoperative recurrence rate of rectal cancer].OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of perioperative immunomodulatory therapy on postoperative recurrence of rectal cancer.METHODS: This prospective study was conducted among 238 rectal/anal cancer patients undergoing intersphincteric resection at our center between January, 2010 and January, 2011, among whom 150 were eligible to be included and completed the study.The 150 patients were randomized in a double-blinded fashion into 3 equal groups to receive immunomodulatory therapy with 8 mg/kg celecoxib (group A), 0.4 mg/kg Sou-Medrol (group B), or placebo (group C), given daily from 5 days before surgery to 5 days after surgery, and the postoperative cancer recurrence were compared.RESULTS: At 3 days after the operation, the 3 groups showed significantly different C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, which decreased obviously in all the 3 groups compared with those at 1 day following the operation (P=0.022), especially in group B. The levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) at 3 days after the operation also differed significantly between the 3 groups but were lower in all the 3 groups than those at 1 day after the operation (P=0.046), and this reduction was the most obvious in group A. COX-2 expression differed significantly between the 3 groups (P=0.017), among which group A showed the most obvious suppression of COX-2 expression.During the follow-up for a mean of 45 months, no significant difference in the recurrence rate was found between the 3 groups (P=0.549).CONCLUSION: With a lower efficacy than Sou-Medrol in decreasing postoperative inflammation, celecoxib produces a better effect in inhibiting COX-2 expression, but it does not lower postoperative recurrence rate of rectal cancer.",0,0,0,0

24654201,"Food or medicine: ethnic variations in perceptions of advanced cancer patients and their caregivers regarding artificial hydration during the last weeks of life.PURPOSE: To identify whether advanced cancer patients receiving home hospice care and their primary caregivers view artificial hydration (AH) as food or medicine, and the demographic and clinical factors influencing these perceptions.METHODS: Participants were enrolled in a randomised, double-blind controlled trial examining the efficacy of AH in cancer hospice patients.In-depth interviews at days 1 and 4 of study enrolment explored the meanings attributed to AH at the end of life.Responses to the question, 'Are these fluids more like food or more like medicine?' were categorised as 'food', 'medicine', 'both' or 'other'. chi(2) analyses were conducted with data from 122 interviews (54 patients and 68 caregivers) to identify differences between patients and caregivers, and by gender, age, ethnicity and caregiver relationship.Predictors of perceptions were identified using logistic regression analysis.RESULTS: Overall, 47 participants (38%) understood the fluids to be more like food, 41 (34%) as medicine, 17 (14%) as both, and 17 (14%)as 'other'. Ethnic minority participants (n=34, 66%) were significantly more likely than non-Hispanic European Americans (n=30, 42%) to view AH as food, or both as food and medicine (p=0.034).Ethnic differences persisted in the final regression model (OR 2.7; 95% CI 1.3 to 5.7, p=0.010).No significant differences were detected between patients and caregivers, or across gender, age, caregivers' relationship to the patients, group assignment, disease severity or cancer type.CONCLUSIONS: AH was perceived as food/nutrition by many cancer patients and caregivers in the study, particularly among ethnic minorities.This perception may lead to greater distress if fluids are discontinued or withheld.Asking patients/caregivers about their AH perceptions may enhance patient/provider communication and culturally appropriate end-of-life care.",0,0,0,0
