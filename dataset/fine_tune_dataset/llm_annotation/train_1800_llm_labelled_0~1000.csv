24004741,"A work-directed intervention to enhance the return to work of employees with cancer: a case study.The purpose of this case study was to describe how the return-to-work process evolved in an employee with cancer in the Netherlands and how a work-directed intervention supported this process.The patient was a 35-year old female employee diagnosed with cervix carcinoma.After surgery, the patient experienced depression, fatigue, fear of recurrence, and low mental working capacity.Communication with the occupational physician was difficult.A social worker at the hospital provided three counselling sessions aimed to support return to work and sent letters to the occupational physician to improve the communication.The support by the social worker helped the patient to resume work gradually and the sending of information from the treating physician and social worker improved the communication with the occupational physician.This resulted in the patient being able to achieve lasting return to work.This work-directed intervention was highly valued by the patient and could be an important addition to usual psycho-oncological care for employees with cancer.",0,0,0,0
23185750,"[Effects of qisheng mixture on chemotherapy induced myelosuppression in patients with colorectal cancer].OBJECTIVE: To observe the intervention of Qisheng Mixture (QM) on the chemotherapy induced myelosuppression in patients with colorectal cancer.METHODS: One hundred and twenty patients with colorectal cancer at Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine were randomly assigned to the pure chemotherapy group (as the control group) and the QM + chemotherapy group (as the treatment group), 60 in each group.All patients received FOLFOX4 or XELOX regimen for totally 6 cycles.Patients in the treatment group took QM 150 mL at the end of chemotherapy, once in the morning and once in the evening for 7 successive days, totally 6 therapeutic courses.The total and average dosages of using granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) were observed in all patients.The changes of white blood cell (WBC) counts were determined before chemotherapy and after the 6th chemotherapy.The hemoglobin (Hb), red blood cell (RBC), and platelet (PLT) counts were observed before chemotherapy, before the 4th chemotheray, and after the 6th chemotherapy.The clinical symptoms integrals (fatigue, liability to catch cold, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngalgia, pale complexion, poor appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, and so on) and the safety indicators (the functions of the liver and kidney, urine routines) were observed.The grading toxic and adverse reactions, KPS scoring, body weight, and the efficacy of the symptoms integrals were compared between the two groups.RESULTS: During the treatment period the total and average dosages of G-CSF used were larger in the control group than in the treatment group (P<0.01).After treatment the WBC count of the two groups were reduced with statistical difference (P<0.01).The WBC counts were higher in the treatment group than in the control group in the whole therapeutic process except the first chemotherapy (P<0.01, P<0.05).Compared with before treatment in the same group, RBC and PLT were reduced in the two groups before the 4th chemotherapy, RBC, Hb, and PLT were reduced after treatment (P<0.05, P<0.01).Better effects on body weight were obtained in the treatment group than in the control group with statistical difference (P<0.01).Compared with the control group, the clinical symptoms integrals such as fatigue, liability to catch cold, pharyngalgia, pale complexion, poor appetite, vomiting, and diarrhea were reduced (P<0.01).Compared with the control group, the toxic and adverse reactions were reduced in the treatment group before the 4th chemotherapy (P<0.01).CONCLUSIONS: QM could effectively intervene chemotherapy induced myelosuppression in patients with colorectal cancer.It was a safe Chinese medicine compound with lower toxicity.",0,0,0,0
25791173,"A Pilot Study to Investigate the Efficacy of Fibrin Sealant (Tisseel(R)) in the Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedure.AIMS: The objective of the current study was to evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of fibrin sealant (Tisseel(R)) in the loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 2 or 3).METHODS: We designed a single-blind, prospective, randomized study in 40 consecutive women undergoing LEEP for CIN 2 or 3 at our institute.Two milliliters of fibrin sealant (Tisseel) was applied to the uterine cervix of 20 women immediately after LEEP surgery (treatment group).We evaluated abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, vaginal discharge and impairment in daily living after 1 week using visual analogue scale questionnaires and compared the results with those of 20 women who did not receive fibrin sealant (control group).RESULTS: Among 40 women who returned for a follow-up 1 week after LEEP, 25 women (62.5%) reported at least one moderate to severe postprocedural symptom.The mean duration of moderate to severe vaginal bleeding and impairment in daily living during postoperative week 1 for the treatment group and the control group was 0.3 +/- 0.80 versus 1.7 +/- 2.36 days (p = 0.015) and 0.9 +/- 1.37 versus 3.00 +/- 2.62 days (p = 0.060), respectively.CONCLUSION: Intraoperative application of fibrin sealant (Tisseel) in LEEP can decrease postoperative vaginal bleeding and impairment in daily living.",0,0,0,0
24323034,"Targeted androgen pathway suppression in localized prostate cancer: a pilot study.PURPOSE: Ligand-mediated activation of the androgen receptor (AR) is critical for prostate cancer (PCa) survival and proliferation.The failure to completely ablate tissue androgens may limit suppression of PCa growth.We evaluated combinations of CYP17A and 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors for reducing prostate androgen levels, AR signaling, and PCa volumes.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-five men with intermediate/high-risk clinically localized PCa were randomly assigned to goserelin combined with dutasteride (ZD), bicalutamide and dutasteride (ZBD), or bicalutamide, dutasteride, and ketoconazole (ZBDK) for 3 months before prostatectomy.Controls included patients receiving combined androgen blockade with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist and bicalutamide.The primary outcome measure was tissue dihydrotestosterone (DHT) concentration.RESULTS: Prostate DHT levels were substantially lower in all experimental arms (0.02 to 0.04 ng/g v 0.92 ng/g in controls; P < .001).The ZBDK group demonstrated the greatest percentage decline in serum testosterone, androsterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (P < .05 for all).Staining for AR and the androgen-regulated genes prostate-specific antigen and TMPRSS2 was strongly suppressed in benign glands and moderately in malignant glands (P < .05 for all).Two patients had pathologic complete response, and nine had </= 0.2 cm(3) of residual tumor (defined as a near-complete response), with the largest numbers of complete and near-complete responses in the ZBDK group.CONCLUSION: Addition of androgen synthesis inhibitors lowers prostate androgens below that achieved with standard therapy, but significant AR signaling remains.Tissue-based analysis of steroids and AR signaling is critical to informing the search for optimal local and systemic control of high-risk prostate cancer.",1,1,1,1
24276777,"Nurse navigators in early cancer care: a randomized, controlled trial.PURPOSE: To determine whether a nurse navigator intervention improves quality of life and patient experience with care for people recently given a diagnosis of breast, colorectal, or lung cancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Adults with recently diagnosed primary breast, colorectal, or lung cancer (n = 251) received either enhanced usual care (n = 118) or nurse navigator support for 4 months (n = 133) in a two-group cluster randomized, controlled trial with primary care physicians as the units of randomization.Patient-reported measures included the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) Quality of Life scale, three subscales of the Patient Assessment of Chronic Illness Care (PACIC), and selected subscales from a cancer adaptation of the Picker Institute's patient experience survey.Self-report measures were collected at baseline, 4 months, and 12 months.Automated administrative data were used to assess time to treatment and total health care costs.RESULTS: There were no significant differences between groups in FACT-G scores.Nurse navigator patients reported significantly higher scores on the PACIC and reported significantly fewer problems with care, especially psychosocial care, care coordination, and information, as measured by the Picker instrument.Cumulative costs after diagnosis did not differ significantly between groups, but lung cancer costs were $6,852 less among nurse navigator patients.CONCLUSION: Compared with enhanced usual care, nurse navigator support for patients with cancer early in their course improves patient experience and reduces problems in care, but did not differentially affect quality of life.",0,0,0,0
27718781,"Adjuvant Sunitinib in High-Risk Renal-Cell Carcinoma after Nephrectomy.BACKGROUND: Sunitinib, a vascular endothelial growth factor pathway inhibitor, is an effective treatment for metastatic renal-cell carcinoma.We sought to determine the efficacy and safety of sunitinib in patients with locoregional renal-cell carcinoma at high risk for tumor recurrence after nephrectomy.METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trial, we assigned 615 patients with locoregional, high-risk clear-cell renal-cell carcinoma to receive either sunitinib (50 mg per day) or placebo on a 4-weeks-on, 2-weeks-off schedule for 1 year or until disease recurrence, unacceptable toxicity, or consent withdrawal.The primary end point was disease-free survival, according to blinded independent central review.Secondary end points included investigator-assessed disease-free survival, overall survival, and safety.RESULTS: The median duration of disease-free survival was 6.8 years (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.8 to not reached) in the sunitinib group and 5.6 years (95% CI, 3.8 to 6.6) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.98; P=0.03).Overall survival data were not mature at the time of data cutoff.Dose reductions because of adverse events were more frequent in the sunitinib group than in the placebo group (34.3% vs. 2%), as were dose interruptions (46.4% vs. 13.2%) and discontinuations (28.1% vs. 5.6%).Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were more frequent in the sunitinib group (48.4% for grade 3 events and 12.1% for grade 4 events) than in the placebo group (15.8% and 3.6%, respectively).There was a similar incidence of serious adverse events in the two groups (21.9% for sunitinib vs. 17.1% for placebo); no deaths were attributed to toxic effects.CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with locoregional clear-cell renal-cell carcinoma at high risk for tumor recurrence after nephrectomy, the median duration of disease-free survival was significantly longer in the sunitinib group than in the placebo group, at a cost of a higher rate of toxic events.(Funded by Pfizer; S-TRAC ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00375674 .).",0,0,0,0
26951379,"AVAREG: a phase II, randomized, noncomparative study of fotemustine or bevacizumab for patients with recurrent glioblastoma.BACKGROUND: Few prospective studies have assessed the role of bevacizumab and included a control arm with standard treatments for recurrent glioblastoma.We conducted a noncomparative phase II trial (AVAREG) to examine the efficacy of bevacizumab or fotemustine in this setting.METHODS: Eligible patients were randomized 2:1 to receive bevacizumab (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks) or fotemustine (75 mg/m(2) on days 1, 8, and 15, then 100 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks after a 35-day interval).The primary endpoint was 6-month overall survival (OS) rate (OS-6).No formal efficacy comparison was made between the treatment arms.RESULTS: Ninety-one patients were enrolled (bevacizumab n = 59; fotemustine n = 32).Median age was 57 years (range, 28-78 y), and patients had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 (n = 42), 1 (n = 35), or 2 (n = 14).OS-6 rate was 62.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 48.4-74.5) with bevacizumab and 73.3% (95% CI, 54.1-87.7) with fotemustine.OS-6 rates were lower in bevacizumab-treated patients with MGMT promoter methylated tumors than in those with unmethylated tumors (50% and 85%, respectively), but higher in fotemustine-treated patients (87.5% and 50%, respectively).OS rates at 9 months were 37.9% (95% CI, 25.5-51.6) and 46.7% (95% CI, 28.3-65.7) with bevacizumab and fotemustine, respectively, and median OS was 7.3 months (95% CI, 5.8-9.2) and 8.7 months (95% CI, 6.3-15.4), respectively.Toxicity was as expected with the 2 agents.CONCLUSION: Single-agent bevacizumab may have a role in patients with recurrent glioblastoma.",1,1,1,1
25581207,"Colorectal adenomas and diabetes: implications for disease prevention.AIM: This study assessed the baseline type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) risk status among overweight patients with screen-detected colorectal adenomas and explored the implications of the findings for preventative practice.METHOD: Participants aged between 50 and 74 years (73% of whom were men) were recruited from four Scottish health boards and assessed for diabetes risk.Participants were categorized as at 'high' diabetes risk if glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) was between 6.0 and 6.4% or fasting plasma glucose (FPG) was between 5.5 and 6.9 mmol/l and as potentially undiagnosed T2DM when HbA1c >/= 6.5% or FPG >/= 7 mmol/l.Secondary outcome measures included anthropometric measurements, blood pressure and the plasma lipid profile.The tests were repeated at 12 months and diabetes risk categories were reassessed following intervention procedures.RESULTS: Forty-seven (14.3%) of the 329 participants had a preexisting diagnosis of T2DM.Of the remainder with complete biochemistry results (n = 250), 19 (7.6%) were classified as having potentially undiagnosed T2DM and 125 (50.0%) as being at high risk of developing diabetes.More than a quarter of participants in all categories had raised waist circumference, hypertension and plasma lipids, indicative of raised cardiovascular risk.At 12 months' follow-up, the diabetes risk category diminished in 20% of the intervention group vs 11% in the controls [OR 2.26 (95% CI 1.03-4.96)].CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that a diagnosis of adenoma in overweight patients provides a health service opportunity for diabetes assessment, prevention and management in a high-risk population at a potentially teachable moment.",0,0,0,0
25604851,"Randomized multicenter phase III study of a modified docetaxel and cisplatin plus fluorouracil regimen compared with cisplatin and fluorouracil as first-line therapy for advanced or locally recurrent gastric cancer.BACKGROUND: The V325 study showed that docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil (DCF) prolonged overall survival (OS) of patients with advanced gastric cancer, but with a high incidence of dose-limiting toxicities.We investigated the efficacy and safety of a modified DCF (mDCF) regimen for Chinese patients with advanced gastric cancer.METHODS: Untreated advanced gastric cancer patients randomly received docetaxel and cisplatin at 60 mg/m(2) (day 1) followed by fluorouracil at 600 mg/m(2)/day (days 1-5; mDCF regimen) or cisplatin at 75 mg/m(2) (day 1) followed by fluorouracil at 600 mg/m(2)/day (days 1-5; CF) every 3 weeks.The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS).The secondary end points were OS, overall response rate (ORR), time-to-treatment failure (TTF), and safety.RESULTS: In total, 243 patients were randomized to treatment (mDCF regimen 121; CF 122).Compared with CF, the mDCF regimen significantly improved PFS and OS: the median PFS was 7.2 and 4.9 months, respectively [hazard ratio (HR) 0.58, log-rank P = 0.0008], and the median OS was 10.2 and 8.5 months, respectively (HR = 0.71, P = 0.0319).Additionally, the mDCF regimen improved the parameters used as secondary objectives: the ORR was 48.7% with the mDCF regimen versus 33.9% with CF (P = 0.0244); the median TTF was 3.4 months with the mDCF regimen and 2.4 months with CF (HR = 0.67, P = 0.0027).Grade 3 and grade 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 77.3 % of patients who received the mDCF regimen versus 46.1% of patients who received CF (P < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: The mDCF regimen, compared with CF, significantly prolonged PFS and OS and enhanced ORR of Chinese patients with advanced gastric cancer.The mDCF regimen achieved efficacy comparable to that of DCF but with fewer toxicities, which is appropriate for the Chinese population.",1,1,1,1
27091875,"Randomized phase 2 study: elotuzumab plus bortezomib/dexamethasone vs bortezomib/dexamethasone for relapsed/refractory MM.In this proof-of-concept, open-label, phase 2 study, patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) received elotuzumab with bortezomib and dexamethasone (EBd) or bortezomib and dexamethasone (Bd) until disease progression/unacceptable toxicity.Primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS); secondary/exploratory endpoints included overall response rate (ORR) and overall survival (OS).Two-sided 0.30 significance level was specified (80% power, 103 events) to detect hazard ratio (HR) of 0.69.Efficacy and safety analyses were performed on all randomized patients and all treated patients, respectively.Of 152 randomized patients (77 EBd, 75 Bd), 150 were treated (75 EBd, 75 Bd).PFS was greater with EBd vs Bd (HR, 0.72; 70% confidence interval [CI], 0.59-0.88; stratified log-rank P = .09); median PFS was longer with EBd (9.7 months) vs Bd (6.9 months).In an updated analysis, EBd-treated patients homozygous for the high-affinity FcgammaRIIIa allele had median PFS of 22.3 months vs 9.8 months in EBd-treated patients homozygous for the low-affinity allele.ORR was 66% (EBd) vs 63% (Bd).Very good partial response or better occurred in 36% of patients (EBd) vs 27% (Bd).Early OS results, based on 40 deaths, revealed an HR of 0.61 (70% CI, 0.43-0.85).To date, 60 deaths have occurred (28 EBd, 32 Bd).No additional clinically significant adverse events occurred with EBd vs Bd.Grade 1/2 infusion reaction rate was low (5% EBd) and mitigated with premedication.In patients with RRMM, elotuzumab, an immunostimulatory antibody, appears to provide clinical benefit without added clinically significant toxicity when combined with Bd vs Bd alone.Registered to ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT01478048.",1,1,1,1
23261355,"Risk of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia during follow-up in HPV-positive women according to baseline p16-INK4A results: a prospective analysis of a nested substudy of the NTCC randomised controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Immunostaining for p16-INK4A (henceforth p16) is a sensitive and specific method for detection of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) in women infected with human papillomavirus (HPV), but longitudinal data have not been obtained.We investigated the relation between p16 status and risk of CIN during 3 years of follow-up.METHODS: Women aged 25-60 years were enrolled between June 10, 2003, and Dec 31, 2004, in a multicentre randomised trial comparing HPV testing with cytology.HPV-positive women were referred for colposcopy and, in seven of nine centres, were tested for p16 overexpression by immunostaining.If no CIN was detected, these women were followed up at yearly intervals until clearance of HPV infection.The primary endpoint was histologically confirmed CIN of grade 2 or worse (CIN of grade 2 [CIN2], CIN of grade 3 [CIN3], or invasive cervical cancer) at recruitment or during follow-up.We calculated the absolute and relative risks by p16 status at recruitment.We also calculated the longitudinal sensitivity of p16 testing.Additionally, we assessed the relative sensitivity of an alternative strategy (referral to colposcopy and follow-up of only HPV-positive, p16-positive women) versus conventional cytology in two age groups.Percentages were weighted by the inverse of the tested fraction.The trial in which this study is nested is registered, number ISRCTN81678807.FINDINGS: Of 1042 HPV-positive women who were tested for p16 with no CIN detected during the first round of screening, 944 (91%) had further HPV tests.793 (84%) of these 944 were followed up until detection of CIN2 or worse, HPV infection clearance, or for at least 3 years.CIN2 or worse was detected during follow-up in more p16-positive women (31 of 365, 8.8% [95% CI 5.8-11.8]) than in p16-negative women (17 of 579, 3.7% [1.9-5.4]; relative risk [RR] 2.61 [95% CI 1.49-4.59]).RR was higher in women aged 35-60 years at recruitment (3.37 [1.39-8.15]) than in those aged 25-34 years (2.15 [1.00-4.61]), but age was not a significant modifier.CIN3 or worse was detected during follow-up in more p16-positive women (16 of 365, 4.4% [2.3-6.6]) than in p16-negative women (six of 579, 1.3% [0.2-2.3]; RR 3.90 [95% CI 1.57-9.68]).Longitudinal sensitivity of p16 testing for detection of CIN3 or worse during follow-up at all ages was 77.8% (95% CI 63.9-91.6).The relative sensitivity of the alternative strategy compared with conventional cytology was 2.08 (1.13-3.56) in women aged 35-60 years and 2.86 (1.28-5.36) in those aged 25-34 years.HPV-positive, p16-negative women aged 35-60 years had a higher cumulative risk of CIN3 or worse during recruitment or follow-up (2.0%, 95% CI 0.3-3.7) than did HPV-negative women (0.01%, 0-0.04) or those who were cytologically normal (0.04%, 0.02-0.09) at recruitment.INTERPRETATION: p16 overexpression is a marker for CIN2 or worse or for development of CIN2 or worse within 3 years in HPV-positive women, especially those aged 35-60 years.HPV-positive, p16-positive women need immediate colposcopy and, if the assessment is negative, annual follow-up.Immediate colposcopy can be avoided in HPV-positive, p16-negative women, who can be safely managed with repeat screening after 2-3 year intervals.FUNDING: European Union; Italian Ministry of Health; Regional Health Administrations of Piemonte, Tuscany, Veneto and Emilia Romagna; and Public Health Agency of Lazio Region.",0,0,0,0

27114605,"Response to Cetuximab With or Without Irinotecan in Patients With Refractory Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Harboring the KRAS G13D Mutation: Australasian Gastro-Intestinal Trials Group ICECREAM Study.PURPOSE: RAS mutations predict lack of response to epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody therapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), but preclinical studies and retrospective clinical data suggest that patients with tumors harboring the exon 2 KRAS G13D mutation may benefit from cetuximab.We aimed to assess cetuximab monotherapy and cetuximab plus irinotecan in patients with molecularly selected (G13D mutation) chemotherapy-refractory mCRC in a randomized phase II trial of this rare molecular subtype.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with chemotherapy-refractory KRAS G13D mutation-positive mCRC who had progressed within 6 months of irinotecan therapy were randomly assigned to cetuximab 400 mg/m(2) loading dose and then 250 mg/m(2) once per week with or without irinotecan 180 mg/m(2) once every 2 weeks.The primary end point was 6-month progression-free survival; secondary end points were response rate, overall survival, quality of life, and toxicity.RESULTS: Fifty-one of 53 patients recruited over 2 years were eligible.The 6-month progression-free survival rate was 10% (95% CI, 2% to 26%) for cetuximab versus 23% (95% CI, 9% to 40%) for cetuximab plus irinotecan with a hazard ratio of 0.74 (95% CI, 0.42 to 1.32).Response and stable disease rates were 0% and 58% for monotherapy versus 9% and 70% for combination treatment, respectively.Overall survival and quality of life were similar; toxicities were higher with combination therapy.CONCLUSION: In patients with G13D-mutated chemotherapy-refractory mCRC, there was no statistically significant improvement in disease control at 6 months with either cetuximab monotherapy or cetuximab plus irinotecan.No responses were seen with single-agent cetuximab.The responses observed with the combination of cetuximab and irinotecan may reflect true drug synergy or persistent irinotecan sensitivity.The ICECREAM (Irinotecan Cetuximab Evaluation and Cetuximab Response Evaluation Among Patients with a G13D Mutation) study demonstrates the need to prospectively evaluate hypotheses that were previously supported by retrospective analyses and exemplifies the value of international collaboration in trials of rare molecular subtypes.",1,1,1,1
21750964,"Pathological complete response rates following different neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens for operable breast cancer according to ER status, in two parallel, randomized phase II trials with an adaptive study design (ECTO II).Sequential doxorubicin/paclitaxel (AT) followed by CMF treatment was shown to be an active neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen in the first European Cooperative Trial in Operable Breast Cancer (ECTO I trial).The aim of the current study (ECTO II) is to assess the complete pathological response (pCR) rate following three different anthracycline and taxane-containing neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens, with or without capecitabine (X).Patients with operable, invasive breast cancer > 2.0 cm in diameter, were randomized to AT-->CMF, AT-->CMX or AC-->TX regimens in two parallel, randomized, open-label, phase II trials (within a single study) in patients with estrogen receptor negative (ER-) and estrogen receptor positive (ER+) diseases, respectively.Exemestane was delivered concomitantly with neoadjuvant chemotherapy in ER+ tumors.Achievement of pCR was more common in ER- than ER+ women (45.3 vs. 10.4%).Capecitabine was only associated with a higher frequency of pCR in ER+ patients receiving AT-->CMX.Overall response rates (ORR) ranged from 88 to 97%, and this translated into high rates of breast-conserving surgery (67% of ER- patients and 72% of ER+ patients).All three regimens were well tolerated.Febrile neutropenia and gastrointestinal effects were the most common grade >/= 3 adverse events.As expected, the ECTO II study showed higher pCR rates in patients with ER- disease.Substituting capecitabine for fluorouracil (+/- methotrexate) in anthracycline/taxane-containing regimens appeared to be beneficial only in ER+ tumors.Translational studies investigating interactions between therapeutic agents and tumor biology are warranted to refine patient selection and improve the results of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.",0,0,0,0
25038874,"HER2 screening data from ToGA: targeting HER2 in gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancer.BACKGROUND: In the Trastuzumab for GAstric cancer (ToGA) study, trastuzumab plus chemotherapy improved median overall survival by 2.7 months in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive [immunohistochemistry (IHC) 3+/fluorescence in situ hybridization-positive] gastric/gastroesophageal junction cancer compared with chemotherapy alone (hazard ratio 0.74).Post hoc exploratory analyses in patients expressing higher HER2 levels (IHC 2+/fluorescence in situ hybridization-positive or IHC 3+) demonstrated a 4.2-month improvement in median overall survival with trastuzumab (hazard ratio 0.65).The ToGA study provides the largest screening dataset available on HER2 overexpression/amplification in this indication.We further analyzed correlation(s) of HER2 overexpression/amplification with clinical and epidemiological factors.METHODS: HER2-positivity was analyzed by histological subtype, tumor location, geographic region, and specimen type.Exploratory efficacy analyses were performed.RESULTS: The HER2-positivity rate was 22.1 % across analyzed tumor samples.Rates were similar between European and Asian patients (23.6 % vs. 23.9 %), but higher in intestinal- vs. diffuse-type (31.8 % vs. 6.1 %), and gastroesophageal junction cancer versus gastric tumors (32.2 % vs. 21.4 %).Across all IHC scores, variability in HER2 staining (</=30 % stained cells) was observed in almost 50 % of cases, with increasing rates in lower IHC categories, and did not affect treatment outcome.The polysomy rate was 4 %.CONCLUSIONS: HER2 expression varies by tumor location and type.All patients with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer should be tested for HER2 status, preferably using IHC initially.Due to the unique characteristics of gastric cancer, specific testing/scoring guidelines should be adhered to.",0,0,0,0
28209746,"A Phase II Randomized Trial (GO27827) of First-Line FOLFOX Plus Bevacizumab with or Without the MET Inhibitor Onartuzumab in Patients with Metastatic Colorectal Cancer.BACKGROUND: Dysregulated hepatocyte growth factor/mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) signaling is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to vascular endothelial growth factor inhibition in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).We report outcomes from a double-blind, multicenter phase II trial of the MET inhibitor onartuzumab in combination with mFOLFOX-6 and bevacizumab for mCRC (GO27827; NCT01418222).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive onartuzumab (10 mg/kg intravenously [IV]) or placebo plus mFOLFOX-6 and bevacizumab (5 mg/kg IV).Oxaliplatin was given for 8-12 cycles; other agents were continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or death.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) in the intent-to-treat (ITT) and MET immunohistochemistry (IHC) expression-positive populations.RESULTS: Between September 2011 and November 2012, 194 patients were enrolled.In September 2013, an interim analysis recommended stopping onartuzumab treatment due to lack of efficacy.At the time of the final analysis in February 2014, no significant improvement in PFS was seen with onartuzumab versus placebo in either the ITT or MET IHC-positive populations.An improvement in PFS was noted in the MET IHC-negative population.Neither overall survival nor response rate was improved with onartuzumab.The incidence of fatigue, peripheral edema, and deep vein thrombosis was increased with onartuzumab relative to placebo.CONCLUSION: Onartuzumab combined with mFOLFOX-6 and bevacizumab did not significantly improve efficacy outcomes in either the ITT or MET IHC-positive populations.MET expression by IHC was not a predictive biomarker in this setting.The Oncologist 2017;22:264-271 IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The addition of onartuzumab to mFOLFOX-6 plus bevacizumab did not improve outcomes in patients with previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer in this randomized, phase II study.Although initial results with onartuzumab were promising, a number of phase II/III clinical trials have reported a lack of improvement in efficacy with onartuzumab combined with standard-of-care therapies in several tumor types.Furthermore, negative study data have been published for rilotumumab and ficlatuzumab, both of which block hepatocyte growth factor binding to the mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) receptor.MET immunohistochemistry was not a predictive biomarker.It remains to be seen if other biomarkers or small molecule inhibitors may be more appropriate for inhibiting this oncogenic pathway.",1,1,1,1

Results from the GEICAM/2006-03, multicenter study.Chemotherapy remains as the only systemic treatment option available for basal-like breast cancer (BC) patients.Preclinical models and several phase II studies suggested that platinum salts are active drugs in this BC subtype though there is no randomized study supporting this hypothesis.This study investigates if the addition of carboplatin to a combination of an alkylating agent together with anthracyclines and taxanes is able to increase the efficacy in the neoadjuvant treatment context.Patients with operable breast cancer and immunophenotypically defined basal-like disease (ER-/PR-/HER2- and cytokeratin 5/6+ or EGFR+) were recruited.Patients were randomized to receive EC (epirubicin 90 mg/m(2) plus cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2) for 4 cycles) followed either by D (docetaxel 100 mg/m(2) x 4 cycles; EC-D) or DCb (docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) plus carboplatin AUC 6 x 4 cycles; EC-DCb).The primary end point was pathological complete response (pCR) in the breast following the Miller and Payne criteria.Ninety-four patients were randomized (46 EC-D, 48 EC-DCb).pCR rate in the breast was seen in 16 patients (35 %) with EC-D and 14 patients (30 %) with EC-DCb (P value = 0.61).pCR in the breast and axilla was seen in 30 % of patients in both arms.The overall clinical response rate was 70 % (95 % CI 56-83) in the EC-D arm and 77 % (95 % CI 65-87) in the EC-DCb arm.Grade 3/4 toxicity was similar in both arms.The addition of carboplatin to conventional chemotherapy with EC-D in basal-like breast cancer patients did not improve the efficacy probably because they had already received an alkylating agent.These findings should be taken into consideration when developing new agents for this disease.",1,1,1,1

28399902,"Efficacy and safety of everolimus in combination with trastuzumab and paclitaxel in Asian patients with HER2+ advanced breast cancer in BOLERO-1.BACKGROUND: The current exploratory analysis was performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of everolimus for treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (HER2+) advanced breast cancer in the Asian subset of patients in the BOLERO-1 trial.METHODS: Postmenopausal women with HER2+ advanced breast cancer, who had not received systemic therapy for advanced disease, were randomized 2:1 to receive everolimus or placebo, plus trastuzumab and paclitaxel.The two primary end points were investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) in the full population and in the hormone receptor-negative (HR-) subpopulation.Secondary end points included assessment of the objective response rate, the clinical benefit rate, and safety.RESULTS: In the Asian subset, median PFS was similar in the everolimus (n = 198) and placebo (n = 105) arms in the full analysis set (hazard ratio = 0.82 (95% CI 0.61-1.11)).In the HR- subpopulation, everolimus prolonged median PFS by 10.97 months vs placebo (25.46 vs 14.49 months; hazard ratio = 0.48 (95% CI 0.29-0.79)).In the everolimus arm of the Asian subset, the most common adverse events of any grade were stomatitis (62.2%), diarrhea (48.0%), rash (43.4%) and neutropenia (42.3%).Neutropenia (grade 3: 27.6%; grade 4: 4.6%) and decreased neutrophil count (grade 3: 11.2%; grade 4: 3.6%)were the most frequent grade 3/4 adverse events.Serious adverse events included pneumonia (5.1%), pneumonitis (3.1%), and interstitial lung disease (3.1%).There were three deaths (1.5%) during treatment in the everolimus arm vs none in the placebo arm.CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy and safety of everolimus plus trastuzumab and paclitaxel as first-line treatment for HER2+ advanced breast cancer in the Asian subset was consistent with that reported previously in the overall population.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00876395 .Registered on 2 April 2009.",1,1,1,1
24315404,"A phase III randomized study comparing neoadjuvant chemotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy for locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma: updated long-term survival outcomes.OBJECTIVE: To determine whether concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) can improve survival rates compared to the neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) regimen in locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 338 patients with biopsy-proven NPC were randomly assigned to receive NACT followed by radical radiotherapy (RT) then adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) or CCRT followed by AC.RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 60 months, the 5-year overall survival (OS) rate did not differ significantly between two groups (75.5% vs 79.4% in CCRT and NACT group respectively, P=0.47, HR=0.84, 95%CI 0.53-1.33).Metastasis-free survival (MFS) rate was significantly improved by the CCRT (79.0% vs 86.9%, P=0.05, HR=0.59, 95%CI 0.35-1.00).Subgroup analysis indicated that the benefit of CCRT was derived from N0/N1 tumors (78.0% vs 93.5%, P=0.05, HR=0.35, 95%CI 0.12-0.99).Higher rates of mucositis (52.4% vs. 35.9% P=0.02) and vomiting (13.7% vs. 4.7% P=0.00) were noted in the CCRT arm.Late toxicities were similar in two groups.CONCLUSIONS: The updated results demonstrated no significant survival benefit of CCRT over NACT in patients with locoregionally advanced NPC.CCRT only showed significant MFS efficacy in T3-4N0-1 populations.",1,1,1,1
26438237,"The effects of short-term fasting on tolerance to (neo) adjuvant chemotherapy in HER2-negative breast cancer patients: a randomized pilot study.BACKGROUND: Preclinical evidence shows that short-term fasting (STF) protects healthy cells against side effects of chemotherapy and makes cancer cells more vulnerable to it.This pilot study examines the feasibility of STF and its effects on tolerance of chemotherapy in a homogeneous patient group with early breast cancer (BC).METHODS: Eligible patients had HER2-negative, stage II/III BC.Women receiving (neo)-adjuvant TAC (docetaxel/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide) were randomized to fast 24 h before and after commencing chemotherapy, or to eat according to the guidelines for healthy nutrition.Toxicity in the two groups was compared.Chemotherapy-induced DNA damage in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was quantified by the level of gamma-H2AX analyzed by flow cytometry.RESULTS: Thirteen patients were included of whom seven were randomized to the STF arm.STF was well tolerated.Mean erythrocyte- and thrombocyte counts 7 days post-chemotherapy were significantly higher (P = 0.007, 95 % CI 0.106-0.638 and P = 0.00007, 95 % CI 38.7-104, respectively) in the STF group compared to the non-STF group.Non-hematological toxicity did not differ between the groups.Levels of gamma-H2AX were significantly increased 30 min post-chemotherapy in CD45 + CD3- cells in non-STF, but not in STF patients.CONCLUSIONS: STF during chemotherapy was well tolerated and reduced hematological toxicity of TAC in HER2-negative BC patients.Moreover, STF may reduce a transient increase in, and/or induce a faster recovery of DNA damage in PBMCs after chemotherapy.Larger studies, investigating a longer fasting period, are required to generate more insight into the possible benefits of STF during chemotherapy.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01304251 , March 2011.",1,1,1,1

23788002,"Rapid incorporation of omega-3 fatty acids into colonic tissue after oral supplementation in patients with colorectal cancer: a randomized, placebo-controlled intervention trial.BACKGROUND: The purpose of the study was to examine whether a preoperative supplement with omega-3 fatty acids (FAs) leads to their incorporation into colonic tissue in patients scheduled for colorectal cancer surgery.This would be of interest because omega-3 FAs have potential beneficial (local) immunological effects that might benefit these patients.METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, prospective, placebo-controlled, single-center intervention trial, patients referred for elective colorectal cancer surgery received either an omega-3 FA-enriched oral nutrition supplement (ONS) (200 mL twice daily) providing 2.0 g of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 1.0 g of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) per day or a standard ONS for 7 days before surgery.Tissue samples from healthy colonic tissue (mucosa and muscular layer) were obtained during surgery, and tissue fatty acid composition was analyzed by gas chromatography.RESULTS: EPA was significantly higher in colonic mucosa (P = .001) and in the colonic muscular layer (P = .004) in the omega-3 FA group compared with controls.Patients in the omega-3 FA group also tended to have higher docosapentaenoic acid and DHA levels in colonic tissue.CONCLUSIONS: EPA is incorporated rapidly into colonic mucosa and colonic muscular layer in patients given 3 g of omega-3 FA daily for 7 days before surgery for colorectal cancer.This may lead to potential beneficially effects on (local) immune function, which might benefit these patients.",0,0,0,0
24076063,"Neoadjuvant treatment of endometrial cancer using anastrozole: a randomised pilot study.OBJECTIVE: Excessive oestrogenic stimulation is a well-known risk factor for the development and progression of endometrial cancer.Aromatase is the key enzyme which catalyses the conversion of androgens to oestrogens in postmenopausal women.Inhibition of aromatase may therefore be a useful strategy in the management of endometrial cancer.A pilot study was designed to assess the feasibility of a neoadjuvant model and understand the biological effects of anastrozole, an aromatase inhibitor, in the treatment of endometrial cancer.METHODS: Patients with endometrial cancer who consented to participate in the study were randomised to receive anastrozole or placebo for a minimum of 14 days prior to definitive surgery.Endometrial samples were obtained before and after treatment.Immunohistochemistry was performed to ascertain the expression of oestrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha), progesterone receptor (PR), androgen receptor (AR), ki-67 and Bcl2 before and after treatment in glands and stroma of the endometrium.RESULTS: A total of 16 patients were randomised to the anastrozole arm and 8 to the placebo arm (2:1 randomisation).A significant decrease in the glandular expression of ERalpha and AR was observed in the anastrozole arm.There was no significant change in the expression of PR or Bcl2.Expression of ki-67, a proliferation marker, also decreased significantly following treatment with anastrozole.CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with anastrozole caused a significant decrease in proliferation as demonstrated by decreased ki-67 expression.A large randomised controlled trial is warranted to fully assess the role of anastrozole in the neoadjuvant treatment of endometrial cancer.",1,1,1,1

26953983,"Pathologic Complete Response in Rectal Cancer: Can We Detect It? Lessons Learned From a Proposed Randomized Trial of Watch-and-Wait Treatment of Rectal Cancer.BACKGROUND: Chemoradiotherapy has the potential to downsize and downstage tumors before surgery, decrease locoregional recurrence, and induce a complete sterilization of tumor cells for middle and low locally advanced rectal cancer.A watch-and-wait tactic has been proposed for patients with clinical complete response.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to verify our ability to identify complete clinical response in patients with rectal cancer based on clinical and radiologic criteria.DESIGN: This was a prospective study.SETTINGS: The study was conducted at a single institution, in the setting of a watch-and-wait randomized trial.PATIENTS: Consecutive patients with stage T3 to T4N0M0 or T(any)N+M0 cancer located within 10 cm from anal verge or T2N0 within 7 cm from anal verge were included in the study.Patients were staged and restaged 8 weeks after completion of chemoradiation (5-fluorouracil, 5040 cGy) by digital examination, colonoscopy, pelvic MRI, and thorax and abdominal CT scans.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical and radiologic judgments of tumor response were compared with pathologic response of patients treated by total mesorectal excision or clinical follow-up of patients selected for nonoperative treatment.RESULTS: A total of 118 patients were treated.Six patients were considered clinic complete responders (2 randomly assigned for surgery (1 ypT0N0 and 1 ypT2N0) and 4 patients randomly assigned for observation (3 sustained clinic complete response and 1 had tumor regrowth)).The 112 clinic incomplete responders underwent total mesorectal excision, and 18 revealed pathologic complete response.These 18 patients were not considered complete responders at restaging because they presented at least 1 of the following conditions: mucosal ulceration and/or deformity and/or substenosis of rectal lumen at digital rectal examination and colonoscopy (n = 16), ymrT1 to T4 (n = 16), ymrN+ (n = 2), involvement of circumferential resection margin on MRI (n = 3), extramural vascular invasion on MRI (n = 4), MRI tumor response grade 2 to 4 (n = 15), and pelvic side wall lymph node involvement on MRI (n = 1).Sensitivity for identification of ypT0N0 or sustained clinic complete response was 18.2%.LIMITATIONS: This study has a short follow-up and small sample size.Radiologists who reviewed the restaging examination were not blinded to the pretreatment stage.Only 1 radiologist read the images of each patient.CONCLUSIONS: Evaluation of clinic complete response according to current adopted criteria has low sensitivity because pathologic complete response more frequently presented as clinic incomplete response (see Video, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/DCR/A221).",0,0,0,0
22614994,"Reach out to enhance wellness home-based diet-exercise intervention promotes reproducible and sustainable long-term improvements in health behaviors, body weight, and physical functioning in older, overweight/obese cancer survivors.PURPOSE: Diet and exercise interventions have been tested in cancer survivors as a means to reduce late effects and comorbidity, but few have assessed adherence and health outcomes long term.METHODS: Between July 2005 and May 2007, the Reach Out to Enhance Wellness (RENEW) trial accrued 641 locoregionally staged, long-term (>/= 5 years from diagnosis) colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer survivors in the United States (21 states), Canada, and the United Kingdom.All participants were sedentary (< 150 minutes of physical activity [PA] a week), overweight or obese (body mass index, 25 to 40 kg/m(2)), and over age 65 years.The trial tested a diet-exercise intervention delivered via mailed print materials and telephone counseling.RENEW used a wait-list control, cross-over design (ie, participants received the year-long intervention immediately or after a 1-year delay), which allowed the opportunity to assess program efficacy (previously reported primary outcome), durability, and reproducibility (reported herein).Measures included diet quality (DQ), PA, BMI, and physical function (PF).RESULTS: No significant relapse was observed in the immediate-intervention arm for DQ, PA, and BMI; however, rates of functional decline increased when the intervention ceased.From year 1 to year 2, significant improvements were observed in the delayed-intervention arm; mean change scores in behaviors and BMI and PF slopes were as follows: DQ score, 5.2 (95% CI, 3.4 to 7.0); PA, 45.8 min/wk (95% CI, 26.9 to 64.6 min/wk); BMI, -0.56 (95% CI, -0.75 to -0.36); and Short Form-36 PF, -1.02 versus -5.52 (P < .001 for all measures).Overall, both arms experienced significant improvements in DQ, PA, and BMI from baseline to 2-year follow-up (P < .001).CONCLUSION: Older cancer survivors respond favorably to lifestyle interventions and make durable changes in DQ and PA that contribute to sustained weight loss.These changes positively reorient functional decline trajectories during intervention delivery.",1,1,0,0
24435063,"Interest and informational preferences regarding genomic testing for modest increases in colorectal cancer risk.BACKGROUND/AIMS: This study explored the interest in genomic testing for modest changes in colorectal cancer risk and preferences for receiving genomic risk communications among individuals with intermediate disease risk due to a family history of colorectal cancer.METHODS: Surveys were conducted on 272 men and women at intermediate risk for colorectal cancer enrolled in a randomized trial comparing a remote personalized risk communication intervention (TeleCARE) aimed at promoting colonoscopy to a generic print control condition.Guided by Leventhal's Common Sense Model of Self-Regulation, we examined demographic and psychosocial factors possibly associated with interest in SNP testing.Descriptive statistics and logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with interest in SNP testing and preferences for receiving genomic risk communications.RESULTS: Three-fourths of participants expressed interest in SNP testing for colorectal cancer risk.Testing interest did not markedly change across behavior modifier scenarios.Participants preferred to receive genomic risk communications from a variety of sources: printed materials (69.5%), oncologists (54.8%), primary-care physicians (58.4%), and the web (58.1%).Overall, persons who were unmarried (p = 0.029), younger (p = 0.003) and with greater cancer-related fear (p = 0.019) were more likely to express interest in predictive genomic testing for colorectal cancer risk.In a stratified analysis, cancer-related fear was associated with the interest in predictive genomic testing in the intervention group (p = 0.017), but not the control group.CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with intermediate familial risk for colorectal cancer are highly interested in genomic testing for modest increases in disease risk, specifically unmarried persons, younger age groups and those with greater cancer fear.",0,0,0,0

24383843,"Imatinib 800 mg daily induces deeper molecular responses than imatinib 400 mg daily: results of SWOG S0325, an intergroup randomized PHASE II trial in newly diagnosed chronic phase chronic myeloid leukaemia.The standard dose of imatinib for newly diagnosed patients with chronic phase chronic myeloid leukaemia (CP-CML) is 400 mg daily (IM400), but the optimal dose is unknown.This randomized phase II study compared the rates of molecular, haematological and cytogenetic response to IM400 vs. imatinib 400 mg twice daily (IM800) in 153 adult patients with CP-CML.Dose adjustments for toxicity were flexible to maximize retention on study.Molecular response (MR) at 12 months was deeper in the IM800 arm (4-log reduction of BCR-ABL1 mRNA: 25% vs. 10% of patients, P = 0.038; 3-log reduction: 53% vs. 35%, P = 0.049).During the first 12 months BCR-ABL1 levels in the IM800 arm were an average 2.9-fold lower than in the IM400 arm (P = 0.010).Complete haematological response was similar, but complete cytogenetic response was higher with IM800 (85% vs. 67%, P = 0.040).Grade 3-4 toxicities were more common for IM800 (58% vs. 31%, P = 0.0007), and were most commonly haematological.Few patients have relapsed, progressed or died, but both progression-free (P = 0.048) and relapse-free (P = 0.031) survival were superior for IM800.In newly diagnosed CP-CML patients, IM800 induced deeper MRs than IM400, with a trend for improved progression-free and overall survival, but was associated with more severe toxicity.",1,1,1,1
24030729,"FLT3-ITD and MLL-PTD influence the expression of MDR-1, MRP-1, and BCRP mRNA but not LRP mRNA assessed with RQ-PCR method in adult acute myeloid leukemia.Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3-internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) and mixed-lineage leukemia gene-partial tandem duplication (MLL-PTD) are aberrations associated with leukemia which indicate unsatisfactory prognosis.Downstream regulatory targets of FLT3-ITD and MLL-PTD are not well defined.We have analyzed the expression of MDR-1, multidrug resistant protein-1 (MRP-1), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), and lung resistance protein (LRP) messenger RNA (mRNA) in relation to the mutational status of FLT3-ITD and MLL-PTD in 185 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) adult patients.The real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction method was performed to assess the expression of the MDR-1, MRP-1, BCRP, and LRP mRNA, and the results were presented as coefficients calculated using an intermediate method according to Pfaffl's rule.Significantly higher expressions of MDR-1 mRNA were found in patients who did not harbor FLT3-ITD (0.20 vs. 0.05; p = 0.0001) and MRP-1 mRNA in patients with this mutation (0.96 vs. 0.70; p = 0.002) and of BCRP mRNA in patients with MLL-PTD (0.61 vs. 0.38; p = 0.03).In univariate analysis, the high expression of MDR-1 mRNA (>/=0.1317) negatively influenced the outcome of induction therapy (p = 0.05), whereas the high expression of BCRP mRNA (>/=1.1487) was associated with a high relapse rate (RR) (p = 0.013).We found that the high expression of MDR-1 (>/=0.1317), MRP-1 (>/=0.8409), and BCRP mRNA (>/=1.1487) significantly influenced disease-free survival (DFS; p = 0.059, 0.032, and 0.009, respectively) and overall survival (0.048, 0.014, and 0.059, respectively).Moreover, a high expression of BCRP mRNA (>/=1.1487) proved to be an independent prognostic factor for RR (p = 0.01) and DFS (p = 0.002) in multivariate analysis.The significant correlation between the expression of MDR-1, MRP-1, and BCRP mRNA and FLT3-ITD or MLL-PTD in AML patients requires further investigation.",0,0,0,0
27956565,"Randomized placebo-controlled study of lovastatin in children with neurofibromatosis type 1.OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of lovastatin on visuospatial learning and attention for treating cognitive and behavioral deficits in children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1).METHODS: A multicenter, international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted between July 2009 and May 2014 as part of the NF Clinical Trials Consortium.Children with NF1 aged 8-15 years were screened for visuospatial learning or attention deficits (n = 272); 146 children demonstrated deficits at baseline and were randomly assigned to lovastatin (n = 74; 40 mg/d) or placebo (n = 70).Treatment was administered once daily for 16 weeks.Primary outcomes were total errors on the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery Paired Associate Learning task (visuospatial learning) and the Score subtest from the Test of Everyday Attention for Children (sustained attention).Secondary outcomes measured executive function, attention, visuospatial skills, behavior, and quality of life.Primary analyses were performed on the intention-to-treat population.RESULTS: Lovastatin had no significant effect on primary outcomes after 16 weeks of treatment: visuospatial learning (Cohen d = -0.15, 95% confidence interval -0.47 to 0.18) or sustained attention (Cohen d = 0.19, 95% confidence interval -0.14 to 0.53).Lovastatin was well tolerated, with no increase in reported adverse events compared to placebo.CONCLUSIONS: Lovastatin administered once daily for 16 weeks did not improve visuospatial learning or attention in children with NF1 and is not recommended for amelioration of cognitive deficits in this population.CLINICALTRIALSGOV IDENTIFIER: This study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00853580) and Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12607000560493).CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class I evidence that for children with NF1, lovastatin does not improve visuospatial learning or attention deficits.",1,1,0,0
26714164,"Influence of tumour burden on trastuzumab pharmacokinetics in HER2 positive non-metastatic breast cancer.AIMS: Trastuzumab, an antibody binding to epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), has been approved to treat HER2-positive breast cancer in different settings.This study aimed at evaluating the influence of tumour size on trastuzumab pharmacokinetics (PK) in non-metastatic breast cancer patients treated with short term pre-operative trastuzumab.METHODS: Trastuzumab PK data were obtained from a multicentre, randomized and comparative study.This antibody was administered pre-operatively to patients with localized HER2-positive breast cancer as a single 4 mg kg(-1) loading dose followed by 5 weekly 2 mg kg(-1) doses.Trastuzumab concentrations were measured repeatedly using an ELISA technique.Tumour size was evaluated at baseline using breast echography.Trastuzumab pharmacokinetics were studied using a population approach and a two compartment model.The influence of tumour burden on trastuzumab pharmacokinetics was quantified as a covariate.RESULTS: A total of 784 trastuzumab concentrations were available from the 79 eligible patients.Estimated parameters (interindiviual standard deviation) were central volume of distribution =2.1 l (23%), peripheral volume of distribution =1.3 l (38%), intercompartment clearance =0.36 l day(-1) , with an elimination half-life of 11.8 days.Typical clearance was 0.22 l day(-1) (19%) and its value was increased with tumour size.In patients with the highest tumour size, trastuzumab clearance was 50% [18%-92%] higher than in patients with the lowest tumour size.CONCLUSIONS: In non-metastatic breast cancer patients, trastuzumab clearance increases with tumour size.The elimination half-life of trastuzumab was shorter in the present population of patients than in metastatic breast cancer patients previously studied.",0,0,0,0

24076063,"Neoadjuvant treatment of endometrial cancer using anastrozole: a randomised pilot study.OBJECTIVE: Excessive oestrogenic stimulation is a well-known risk factor for the development and progression of endometrial cancer.Aromatase is the key enzyme which catalyses the conversion of androgens to oestrogens in postmenopausal women.Inhibition of aromatase may therefore be a useful strategy in the management of endometrial cancer.A pilot study was designed to assess the feasibility of a neoadjuvant model and understand the biological effects of anastrozole, an aromatase inhibitor, in the treatment of endometrial cancer.METHODS: Patients with endometrial cancer who consented to participate in the study were randomised to receive anastrozole or placebo for a minimum of 14 days prior to definitive surgery.Endometrial samples were obtained before and after treatment.Immunohistochemistry was performed to ascertain the expression of oestrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha), progesterone receptor (PR), androgen receptor (AR), ki-67 and Bcl2 before and after treatment in glands and stroma of the endometrium.RESULTS: A total of 16 patients were randomised to the anastrozole arm and 8 to the placebo arm (2:1 randomisation).A significant decrease in the glandular expression of ERalpha and AR was observed in the anastrozole arm.There was no significant change in the expression of PR or Bcl2.Expression of ki-67, a proliferation marker, also decreased significantly following treatment with anastrozole.CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with anastrozole caused a significant decrease in proliferation as demonstrated by decreased ki-67 expression.A large randomised controlled trial is warranted to fully assess the role of anastrozole in the neoadjuvant treatment of endometrial cancer.",1,1,1,1
27114605,"Response to Cetuximab With or Without Irinotecan in Patients With Refractory Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Harboring the KRAS G13D Mutation: Australasian Gastro-Intestinal Trials Group ICECREAM Study.PURPOSE: RAS mutations predict lack of response to epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody therapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), but preclinical studies and retrospective clinical data suggest that patients with tumors harboring the exon 2 KRAS G13D mutation may benefit from cetuximab.We aimed to assess cetuximab monotherapy and cetuximab plus irinotecan in patients with molecularly selected (G13D mutation) chemotherapy-refractory mCRC in a randomized phase II trial of this rare molecular subtype.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with chemotherapy-refractory KRAS G13D mutation-positive mCRC who had progressed within 6 months of irinotecan therapy were randomly assigned to cetuximab 400 mg/m(2) loading dose and then 250 mg/m(2) once per week with or without irinotecan 180 mg/m(2) once every 2 weeks.The primary end point was 6-month progression-free survival; secondary end points were response rate, overall survival, quality of life, and toxicity.RESULTS: Fifty-one of 53 patients recruited over 2 years were eligible.The 6-month progression-free survival rate was 10% (95% CI, 2% to 26%) for cetuximab versus 23% (95% CI, 9% to 40%) for cetuximab plus irinotecan with a hazard ratio of 0.74 (95% CI, 0.42 to 1.32).Response and stable disease rates were 0% and 58% for monotherapy versus 9% and 70% for combination treatment, respectively.Overall survival and quality of life were similar; toxicities were higher with combination therapy.CONCLUSION: In patients with G13D-mutated chemotherapy-refractory mCRC, there was no statistically significant improvement in disease control at 6 months with either cetuximab monotherapy or cetuximab plus irinotecan.No responses were seen with single-agent cetuximab.The responses observed with the combination of cetuximab and irinotecan may reflect true drug synergy or persistent irinotecan sensitivity.The ICECREAM (Irinotecan Cetuximab Evaluation and Cetuximab Response Evaluation Among Patients with a G13D Mutation) study demonstrates the need to prospectively evaluate hypotheses that were previously supported by retrospective analyses and exemplifies the value of international collaboration in trials of rare molecular subtypes.",1,1,1,1
25833781,"Dietary modifications, weight loss, and changes in metabolic markers affect global DNA methylation in Hispanic, African American, and Afro-Caribbean breast cancer survivors.BACKGROUND: Lower levels of global DNA methylation in tissue and blood have been associated with increased cancer risk.Conversely, cross-sectional analyses of healthier lifestyle patterns have been associated with higher levels of global DNA methylation.OBJECTIVE: In this trial, we explored the associations between changes in lifestyle modifications (diet, weight loss), metabolic markers, and global epigenetic biomarkers in white blood cells.METHODS: Study participants were Hispanic, African American, and Afro-Caribbean overweight and sedentary female breast cancer survivors (n = 24) who participated in a larger randomized, crossover, pilot study of a 6-mo weight loss intervention and who had available blood specimens.Anthropometric measures, a food-frequency questionnaire, and peripheral blood were collected at baseline, 6 mo, and 12 mo.Plasma samples were analyzed for metabolic markers (insulin, glucose).We measured DNA methylation of long interspersed nucleotide element 1 (LINE-1) and satellite 2 by pyrosequencing and MethyLight, respectively, and global DNA methylation by the luminometric methylation assay (LUMA).RESULTS: DNA methylation of LINE-1 was statistically significantly elevated at 6 mo [75.5% vs. 78.5% (P < 0.0001)] and 12 mo [75.5% vs. 77.7% (P < 0.0001)], compared to baseline.Over a 12-mo period, changes in percentage body fat and plasma glucose concentrations were positively associated with LINE-1 DNA methylation (beta = 0.19, P = 0.001) and LUMA DNA methylation levels (beta = 0.24, P = 0.02), respectively.Similarly, 12-mo changes in dietary measures such as vegetable (beta = 0.009, P = 0.048), protein (beta = 0.04, P = 0.001), and total caloric (beta = 0.05, P = 0.01) intake were positively associated with changes in LUMA DNA methylation, as was intake of fruit positively associated with changes in LINE-1 DNA methylation (beta = 0.004, P = 0.02).CONCLUSIONS: Our hypothesis-generating results suggest that lifestyle modifications may be associated with changes in global DNA methylation detectable at 6 and 12 mo.These biomarkers may be useful intermediate biomarkers to use in future intervention trials.This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00811824.",0,0,0,0
27557302,"Daratumumab, Bortezomib, and Dexamethasone for Multiple Myeloma.BACKGROUND: Daratumumab, a human IgGkappa monoclonal antibody that targets CD38, induces direct and indirect antimyeloma activity and has shown substantial efficacy as monotherapy in heavily pretreated patients with multiple myeloma, as well as in combination with bortezomib in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.METHODS: In this phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 498 patients with relapsed or relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma to receive bortezomib (1.3 mg per square meter of body-surface area) and dexamethasone (20 mg) alone (control group) or in combination with daratumumab (16 mg per kilogram of body weight) (daratumumab group).The primary end point was progression-free survival.RESULTS: A prespecified interim analysis showed that the rate of progression-free survival was significantly higher in the daratumumab group than in the control group; the 12-month rate of progression-free survival was 60.7% in the daratumumab group versus 26.9% in the control group.After a median follow-up period of 7.4 months, the median progression-free survival was not reached in the daratumumab group and was 7.2 months in the control group (hazard ratio for progression or death with daratumumab vs. control, 0.39; 95% confidence interval, 0.28 to 0.53; P<0.001).The rate of overall response was higher in the daratumumab group than in the control group (82.9% vs. 63.2%, P<0.001), as were the rates of very good partial response or better (59.2% vs. 29.1%, P<0.001) and complete response or better (19.2% vs. 9.0%, P=0.001).Three of the most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events reported in the daratumumab group and the control group were thrombocytopenia (45.3% and 32.9%, respectively), anemia (14.4% and 16.0%, respectively), and neutropenia (12.8% and 4.2%, respectively).Infusion-related reactions that were associated with daratumumab treatment were reported in 45.3% of the patients in the daratumumab group; these reactions were mostly grade 1 or 2 (grade 3 in 8.6% of the patients), and in 98.2% of these patients, they occurred during the first infusion.CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with relapsed or relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, daratumumab in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone resulted in significantly longer progression-free survival than bortezomib and dexamethasone alone and was associated with infusion-related reactions and higher rates of thrombocytopenia and neutropenia than bortezomib and dexamethasone alone.(Funded by Janssen Research and Development; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02136134.).",1,1,1,1
23335153,"Reducing the psychological distress of family caregivers of home-based palliative care patients: short-term effects from a randomised controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Palliative care is expected to incorporate comprehensive support for family caregivers given that many caregivers suffer psychological morbidity.However, systematically implemented evidence-based psychological support initiatives are lacking.AIM: The objective of this study was to prepare caregivers for the role of supporting a patient with advanced cancer receiving home-based palliative care by offering a one-to-one psycho-educational intervention.We hypothesised that primary family caregivers who participated in the intervention would report decreased psychological distress (primary outcome), fewer unmet needs and increased levels of perceived preparedness, competence and positive emotions.METHODS: A three-arm randomised controlled trial was conducted comparing two versions of the intervention (one face-to-face visit versus two visits) plus standard care to a control group (standard care) across four sites in Australia.RESULTS: A total of 298 participants were recruited; 148 were in the Control condition, 57 in Intervention 1 (one visit) and 93 in Intervention 2 (two visits).Relative to participants in the control group; the psychological well-being of participants in the intervention condition was improved by a small amount but non-significantly.No significant reduction in unmet needs or improvements in positive aspects of caregiving amongst the intervention group were identified.However, the intervention demonstrated significant improvements in participants' levels of preparedness and competence for Intervention 2.CONCLUSION/IMPLICATIONS: This research adds to accumulating body of evidence demonstrating that relatively short psycho-educational interventions can enable family caregivers to feel more prepared and competent in the role of supporting a dying relative.Further investigation is required to determine the longer term outcomes of such interventions.",0,0,0,0
28412590,"Baseline carcinoembryonic antigen as a predictive factor of ramucirumab efficacy in RAISE, a second-line metastatic colorectal carcinoma phase III trial.BACKGROUND: The RAISE phase III clinical trial demonstrated that ramucirumab + (folinic acid plus 5-fluorouracil plus irinotecan) FOLFIRI significantly improved overall survival (OS) versus placebo + FOLFIRI for second-line metastatic colorectal carcinoma (mCRC) patients failing bevacizumab- and oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.73-0.98, P = 0.022).Post hoc analyses of RAISE patient data examined the association of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) subgroups with efficacy parameters.METHODS: CEA subgroups (</=10 versus >10 ng/ml) were based on 2X upper limit of normal (ULN) (5 ng/ml).The Kaplan-Meier method estimated the median OS and the progression-free survival (PFS).Log-rank test compared the survival distributions within the subgroups.Hazard ratio (HR) (95% confidence interval [CI]) and treatment-by-subgroup interaction p-values were calculated by Cox proportional hazards model.RESULTS: Ramucirumab treatment prolonged survival for the CEA </=10 subgroup (HR = 0.68; 95% CI = 0.50-0.92; P = 0.013) and CEA >10 subgroup (HR = 0.90; 95% CI = 0.76-1.07; P = 0.233).However, the ramucirumab OS benefit over placebo was greater for the CEA </=10 subgroup than for the CEA >10 subgroup (median OS: 3.6 versus 0.8 months greater, respectively).The interaction P-value between CEA level and treatment effect on OS was 0.088.This trend was observed across randomisation strata and to a lesser extent for PFS (P = 0.594).CONCLUSIONS: Although patients in both high- and low-CEA subgroups derive OS and PFS benefits from ramucirumab treatment, the low baseline CEA level may identify a subgroup of patients with mCRC who obtain greater benefit from ramucirumab.",1,1,1,1

23928139,"Tumor consistency of pituitary macroadenomas: predictive analysis on the basis of imaging features with contrast-enhanced 3D FIESTA at 3T.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Preoperative evaluation of pituitary macroadenoma tumor consistency is important for neurosurgery.Thus, we aimed to retrospectively assess the role of contrast-enhanced FIESTA in predicting the tumor consistency of pituitary macroadenomas.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-nine patients with pituitary macroadenomas underwent conventional MR imaging sequences and contrast-enhanced FIESTA before surgery.Two neuroradiologists assessed the contrast-enhanced FIESTA, contrast-enhanced T1WI, and T2WI.On the basis of surgical findings, the macroadenomas were classified by the neurosurgeons as either soft or hard.Finally, Fisher exact probability tests and unpaired t tests were used to compare predictions on the basis of the MR imaging findings with the tumor consistency, collagen content, and postoperative tumor size.RESULTS: The 29 pituitary macroadenomas were classified as either solid or mosaic types.Solid type was characterized by a homogeneous pattern of tumor signal intensity without intratumoral hyperintense dots, whereas the mosaic type was characterized by many intratumoral hyperintense dots on each MR image.Statistical analyses revealed a significant correlation between tumor consistency and contrast-enhanced FIESTA findings.Sensitivity and specificity were higher for contrast-enhanced FIESTA (1.00 and 0.88-0.92, respectively) than for contrast-enhanced T1WI (0.80 and 0.25-0.33, respectively) and T2WI (0.60 and 0.38-0.54, respectively).Compared with mosaic-type adenomas, solid-type adenomas tended to have a hard tumor consistency as well as a significantly higher collagen content and lower postoperative tumor size.CONCLUSIONS: Contrast-enhanced FIESTA may provide preoperative information regarding the consistency of macroadenomas that appears to be related to the tumor collagen content.",0,0,0,0
26767313,"Use of an Abdominal Compression Device in Colonoscopy: A Randomized, Sham-Controlled Trial.BACKGROUND & AIMS: Looping is a common problem during colonoscopy that prolongs procedure time.We aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of ColoWrap, an external abdominal compression device, with respect to insertion time and other procedural outcomes.METHODS: We performed a prospective study of outpatients undergoing elective colonoscopy (40-80 years old; mean age, 60.5 years) at endoscopy facilities in the University of North Carolina Hospitals from April 2013 through March 2014.Subjects were randomly assigned to groups that received either ColoWrap (n = 175) or a sham device (control, n = 175) during colonoscopy.Colonoscopists and staff were blinded to the application.The primary outcome was cecal intubation time (CIT).Secondary outcomes included use of manual pressure and position change.RESULTS: The mean CIT was similar for the control and ColoWrap groups (6.69 vs 6.67 minutes; P = .98).There were no statistical differences in the frequency of manual pressure (45% for controls vs 37% for ColoWrap group, P = .13) or position changes (4% for controls vs 2% for ColoWrap group, P = .36).Among patients with body mass index between 30 and 40 kg/m(2) (n = 78), CIT was significantly lower for patients in the ColoWrap group (4.69 minutes) than controls (6.10 minutes) (P = .03).Adverse events were similar between groups.CONCLUSIONS: In patients undergoing elective colonoscopy, application of an external abdominal compression device did not improve CIT or affect the frequency of ancillary maneuvers.A possible benefit was observed in patients with body mass index between 30 and 40 kg/m(2), but further studies are needed.ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT02025504.",0,0,0,0
25701170,"Orteronel plus prednisone in patients with chemotherapy-naive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (ELM-PC 4): a double-blind, multicentre, phase 3, randomised, placebo-controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Orteronel is an investigational, partially selective inhibitor of CYP 17,20-lyase in the androgen signalling pathway, a validated therapeutic target for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.We assessed orteronel in chemotherapy-naive patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.METHODS: In this phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we recruited patients with progressive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and no previous chemotherapy from 324 study centres (ie, hospitals or large urologic or group outpatient offices) in 43 countries.Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 400 mg orteronel plus 5 mg prednisone twice daily or placebo plus 5 mg prednisone twice daily.Randomisation was done centrally with an interactive voice response system and patients were stratified by region (Europe, North America, and not Europe or North America) and the presence or absence of radiographic disease progression at baseline.The two primary endpoints were radiographic progression-free survival and overall survival, determined in the intention-to-treat population.This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01193244.FINDINGS: From Oct 31, 2010, to June 29, 2012, 2353 patients were assessed for eligibility.Of those, 1560 were randomly assigned to receive either orteronel plus prednisone (n=781) or placebo plus prednisone (n=779).The clinical cutoff date for the final analysis was Jan 15, 2014 (with 611 deaths).Median follow-up for radiographic progression-free survival was 8.4 months (IQR 3.7-16.6).Median radiographic progression-free survival was 13.8 months (95% CI 13.1-14.9) with orteronel plus prednisone and 8.7 months (8.3-10.9) with placebo plus prednisone (hazard ratio [HR] 0.71, 95% CI 0.63-0.80; p<0.0001).After a median follow-up of 20.7 months (IQR 14.2-25.4), median overall survival was 31.4 months (95% CI 28.6-not estimable) with orteronel plus prednisone and 29.5 months (27.0-not estimable) with placebo plus prednisone (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.79-1.08; p=0.31).The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events were increased lipase (137 [17%] of 784 patients in the orteronel plus prednisone group vs 14 [2%] of 770 patients in the placebo plus prednisone group), increased amylase (77 [10%] vs nine [1%]), fatigue (50 [6%] vs 14 [2%]), and pulmonary embolism (40 [5%] vs 27 [4%]).Serious adverse events were reported in 358 [46%] patients receiving orteronel plus prednisone and in 292 [38%] patients receiving placebo plus prednisone.INTERPRETATION: In chemotherapy-naive patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, radiographic progression-free survival was prolonged with orteronel plus prednisone versus placebo plus prednisone.However, no improvement was noted in the other primary endpoint, overall survival.Orteronel plus prednisone was associated with increased toxic effects compared with placebo plus prednisone.On the basis of these and other data, orteronel is not undergoing further development in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.FUNDING: Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc, a wholly owned subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited.",1,1,1,1
22565002,"Randomized phase II trial of everolimus in combination with tamoxifen in patients with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative metastatic breast cancer with prior exposure to aromatase inhibitors: a GINECO study.PURPOSE: Cross-talk between signal transduction pathways likely contributes to hormone resistance in metastatic breast cancer (mBC).Everolimus, an oral inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin, has restored sensitivity in endocrine-resistance models and shown anticancer activity in early-phase mBC clinical trials.This analysis evaluated efficacy and safety of everolimus in combination with tamoxifen in patients with mBC resistant to aromatase inhibitors (AIs).PATIENTS AND METHODS: This open-label, phase II study randomly assigned postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative, AI-resistant mBC to tamoxifen 20 mg/d plus everolimus 10 mg/d (n = 54) or tamoxifen 20 mg/d alone (n = 57).Randomization was stratified by primary and secondary hormone resistance.Primary end point was clinical benefit rate (CBR), defined as the percentage of all patients with a complete or partial response or stable disease at 6 months.No formal statistical comparison between groups was planned.RESULTS: The 6-month CBR was 61% (95% CI, 47 to 74) with tamoxifen plus everolimus and 42% (95% CI, 29 to 56) with tamoxifen alone.Time to progression (TTP) increased from 4.5 months with tamoxifen alone to 8.6 months with tamoxifen plus everolimus, corresponding to a 46% reduction in risk of progression with the combination (hazard ratio [HR], 0.54; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.81).Risk of death was reduced by 55% with tamoxifen plus everolimus versus tamoxifen alone (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.24 to 0.81).The main toxicities associated with tamoxifen plus everolimus were fatigue (72% v 53% with tamoxifen alone), stomatitis (56% v 7%), rash (44% v 7%), anorexia (43% v 18%), and diarrhea (39% v 11%).CONCLUSION: This study suggests that tamoxifen plus everolimus increased CBR, TTP, and overall survival compared with tamoxifen alone in postmenopausal women with AI-resistant mBC.",1,1,1,1

27112319,"Protocol of a randomized controlled trial of the fear of recurrence therapy (FORT) intervention for women with breast or gynecological cancer.BACKGROUND: Clinically significant levels of fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) affect up to 49% of cancer survivors and are more prevalent among women.FCR is associated with psychological distress, lower quality of life, and increased use of medical resources.Despite its prevalence, FCR is poorly addressed in clinical care.To address this problem, we first developed, and pilot tested a 6-week, 2 h, Cognitive-existential group intervention therapy that targeted FCR in survivors of breast or gynecological cancer.Following the positive outcome of the pilot, we are now testing this approach in a randomized clinical trial (RCT).Goal and hypotheses: This multicenter, prospective RCT aims to test the efficacy of the intervention.The study hypotheses are that, compared to a control group, cancer survivors participating in the intervention (1) will have less FCR, (2) will show more favorable outcomes on the following measures: cancer-specific distress, quality of life, illness uncertainty, intolerance of uncertainty, perceived risk of cancer recurrence, and coping skills.We further postulate that the between-group differences will persist three and 6 months post-intervention.METHODS: Sixteen groups of seven to nine women are being allocated to the intervention or the control group.The control group receives a 6-week, 2 h, structurally equivalent support group.We are recruiting 144 cancer survivors from four hospital sites in three Canadian cities.The sample size was based on the moderate pre/post-test changes found in our pilot study and adjusted to the drop-out rates.MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome, FCR, is measured by the Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory.Secondary outcomes measured include cancer-specific distress, perceived risk of cancer recurrence, illness uncertainty, intolerance of uncertainty, coping, and quality of life.We use reliable and recognized valid scales.Participants are to complete the questionnaire package at four times: before the first group session (baseline), immediately after the sixth session, and 3 and 6 months post-intervention.ANALYSIS: In the descriptive analysis, comparison of group equivalent baseline variables, identification of confounding/intermediate variables and univariate analysis are planned.Each participant's trajectory is calculated using Generalized Estimating Equation models to determine the time and group effects, after considering the correlation structures of the groups.An intent-to-treat analysis approach may be adopted.DISCUSSION: Our Fear of Recurrence Therapy (FORT) intervention has direct implications for clinical service development to improve the quality of life for patients with breast (BC) and gynecological cancer (GC).Based on our pilot data, we are confident that the FORT intervention can guide the development of effective psychosocial cancer survivorship interventions to reduce FCR and improve psychological functioning among women with BC or GC.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Dr. Christine Maheu registered the trial with ISRCTN registry (Registration number: ISRCTN83539618, date assigned 03/09/2014).",0,0,0,0

Five-Year Outcomes of the RACS Sentinel Node Biopsy Versus Axillary Clearance (SNAC) 1 Trial: Assessment and Incidence of True Lymphedema.PURPOSE: To determine whether the benefits of sentinel-node-based management (SNBM) over routine axillary clearance (RAC) persisted to 5 years.METHODS: A total of 1088 women with breast cancer less than 3 cm in diameter and clinically negative axillary nodes were randomized to SNBM with axillary clearance if the sentinel node was positive or RAC preceded by sentinel-node biopsy.The outcomes were: (1) objectively measured change in the volume of the operated and contralateral nonoperated arms; (2) the proportion with an increase in arm volume <15%; and (3) subjectively assessed arm morbidity for the domains swelling, symptoms, dysfunction, and disability.Assessments were performed at 1 and 6 months after surgery and then annually.RESULTS: Limb volume increased progressively in the operated and nonoperated arms for 2 years and persisted unchanged to year 5, accompanied by weight gain.Correction by change in the nonoperated arm showed a mean volume increase of 70 mL in the RAC group and 26 mL in the SNBM group (P < 0.001) at 5 years.Only 28 patients (3.3%) had a corrected increase >15% from baseline (RAC 5.0% vs. SNBM 1.7%).Significant predictors were surgery type (RAC vs. SNBM), obesity, diabetes, palpable tumor, and weight gain exceeding 10% of baseline value.CONCLUSIONS: Subjective assessments revealed persisting patient concerns about swelling and symptoms but not overall disability at 5 years.Subjective scores were only moderately correlated with volume increase.SNAC1 has demonstrated that objective morbidity and subjective morbidity persist for 5 years after surgery and that SNBM significantly lowers the risk of both.",0,0,0,0
24486636,"Protocol and recruitment results from a randomized controlled trial comparing group phone-based versus newsletter interventions for weight loss maintenance among rural breast cancer survivors.Obesity is a risk factor for breast cancer recurrence and death.Women who reside in rural areas have higher obesity prevalence and suffer from breast cancer treatment-related disparities compared to urban women.The objective of this 5-year randomized controlled trial is to compare methods for delivering extended care for weight loss maintenance among rural breast cancer survivors.Group phone-based counseling via conference calls addresses access barriers, is more cost-effective than individual phone counseling, and provides group support which may be ideal for rural breast cancer survivors who are more likely to have unmet support needs.Women (n=210) diagnosed with Stage 0 to III breast cancer in the past 10 years who are >/= 3 months out from initial cancer treatments, have a BMI 27-45 kg/m(2), and have physician clearance were enrolled from multiple cancer centers.During Phase I (months 0 to 6), all women receive a behavioral weight loss intervention delivered through group phone sessions.Women who successfully lose 5% of weight enter Phase II (months 6 to 18) and are randomized to one of two extended care arms: continued group phone-based treatment or a mail-based newsletter.During Phase III, no contact is made (months 18 to 24).The primary outcome is weight loss maintenance from 6 to 18 months.Secondary outcomes include quality of life, serum biomarkers, and cost-effectiveness.This study will provide essential information on how to reach rural survivors in future efforts to establish weight loss support for breast cancer survivors as a standard of care.",0,0,0,0
27951450,"Dose-dense adjuvant chemotherapy in premenopausal breast cancer patients: A pooled analysis of the MIG1 and GIM2 phase III studies.BACKGROUND: No evidence exists to recommend a specific chemotherapy regimen in young breast cancer patients.We performed a pooled analysis of two randomised clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of adjuvant dose-dense chemotherapy in premenopausal breast cancer patients and its impact on the risk of treatment-induced amenorrhoea.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the MIG1 study, node-positive or high-risk node-negative patients were randomised to 6 cycles of fluorouracil/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide every 2 (dose-dense) or 3 (standard-interval) weeks.In the GIM2 study, node-positive patients were randomised to 4 cycles of dose-dense or standard-interval EC or FEC followed by 4 cycles of dose-dense or standard-interval paclitaxel.Using individual patient data, the hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival by means of a Cox proportional hazards model and the odds ratio for treatment-induced amenorrhoea through a logistic regression model were calculated for each study.A meta-analysis of the two studies was performed using the random effect model to compute the parameter estimates.RESULTS: A total of 1,549 patients were included.Dose-dense chemotherapy was associated with a significant improved overall survival as compared to standard-interval chemotherapy (HR, 0.71; 95% confidence intervals [CI], 0.54-0.95; p = 0.021).The pooled HRs were 0.78 (95% CI, 0.54-1.12) and 0.65 (95% CI, 0.40-1.06) for patients with hormone receptor-positive and -negative tumours, respectively (interaction p = 0.330).No increased risk of treatment-induced amenorrhoea was observed with dose-dense chemotherapy (odds ratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.80-1.25; p = 0.989).CONCLUSION: Dose-dense adjuvant chemotherapy may be considered the preferred treatment option in high-risk premenopausal breast cancer patients.",1,1,1,1

26564483,"Anisotropy of Solid Breast Lesions in 2D Shear Wave Elastography is an Indicator of Malignancy.RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To investigate if anisotropy at two-dimensional shear wave elastography (SWE) suggests malignancy and whether it correlates with prognostic and predictive factors in breast cancer.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Study group A of 244 solid breast lesions was imaged with SWE between April 2013 and May 2014.Each lesion was imaged in radial and in antiradial planes, and the maximum elasticity, mean elasticity, and standard deviation were recorded and correlated with benign/malignant status, and if malignant, correlated with conventional predictive and prognostic factors.The results were compared to a study group B of 968 solid breast lesions, which were imaged in sagittal and in axial planes between 2010 and 2013.RESULTS: Neither benign nor malignant lesion anisotropy is plane dependent.However, malignant lesions are more anisotropic than benign lesions (P </= 0.001).Anisotropy correlates with increasing elasticity parameters, breast imaging-reporting and data system categories, core biopsy result, and tumor grade.Large cancers are significantly more anisotropic than small cancers (P </= 0.001).The optimal anisotropy cutoff threshold for benign/malignant differentiation of 150 kPa(2) achieves the best sensitivity (74%) with a reasonable specificity (63%).CONCLUSIONS: Anisotropy may be useful during benign/malignant differentiation of solid breast masses using SWE.Anisotropy also correlates with some prognostic factors in breast cancer.",0,0,0,0
22383680,"Influence of zoledronic acid on disseminated tumor cells in primary breast cancer patients.BACKGROUND: The presence of disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) in bone marrow of patients with early breast cancer (EBC) has been correlated with increased risk of metastatic disease or locoregional relapse.Zoledronic acid (ZOL) treatment has reduced DTCs in the bone marrow of patients with EBC in several studies.This controlled study sought to confirm these observations.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with EBC and DTC-positive bone marrow were randomized (N = 96) to treatment with ZOL plus adjuvant systemic therapy or adjuvant systemic therapy alone.The change in DTC numbers at 12 months versus baseline was measured.RESULTS: DTC-positive patients treated with ZOL were more likely to become DTC-negative after 12 months of treatment compared with the controls (67% versus 35%; P = 0.009).At 12 months, DTC counts decreased to a mean of 0.5 +/- 0.8 DTCs in the ZOL group and to 0.9 +/- 0.8 DTCs in the control group.In addition, ZOL was generally well tolerated.CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with ZOL improves elimination of DTCs.Further studies are needed to determine whether the reduction in DTCs by ZOL provides clinical benefit.",1,1,1,1
25403578,"FOLFOX4 versus sequential dose-dense FOLFOX7 followed by FOLFIRI in patients with resectable metastatic colorectal cancer (MIROX): a pragmatic approach to chemotherapy timing with perioperative or postoperative chemotherapy from an open-label, randomized phase III trial.BACKGROUND: Perioperative FOLFOX4 (oxaliplatin plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin) chemotherapy is the current standard in patients with resectable metastases from colorectal cancer (CRC).We aimed to determine whether a sequential chemotherapy with dose-dense oxaliplatin (FOLFOX7) and irinotecan (FOLFIRI; irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin) is superior to FOLFOX4.The chemotherapy timing was not imposed, and was perioperative or postoperative.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this open-label, phase III trial, patients with resectable or resected metastases were randomly assigned either to 12 cycles of FOLFOX4 (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m(2)) or 6 cycles of FOLFOX7 (oxaliplatin 130 mg/m(2)) followed by 6 cycles of FOLFIRI (irinotecan 180 mg/m(2)).Randomization was done centrally, with stratification by chemotherapy timing, type of local treatment (surgery versus radiofrequency ablation with/without surgery), and Fong's prognostic score.The primary end point was 2-year disease-free survival (DFS).RESULTS: A total of 284 patients were randomized, 142 in each treatment group.Chemotherapy was perioperative in 168 (59.2%) patients and postoperative in 116 (40.8%) patients.Perioperative chemotherapy was preferentially proposed for synchronous metastases, whereas postoperative chemotherapy was more frequently used for metachronous metastases.Two-year DFS was 48.5% in the FOLFOX4 group and 50.0% in the FOLFOX7-FOLFIRI group.In the multivariable analysis, more than one metastasis [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.15] and synchronous metastases (HR = 1.63) were independent prognostic factors for shorter DFS.Five-year overall survival (OS) rate was 69.5% with FOLFOX4 versus 66.6% with FOLFOX7-FOLFIRI.CONCLUSIONS: FOLFOX7-FOLFIRI is not superior to FOLFOX4 in patients with resectable metastatic CRC.Five-year OS rates observed in both groups are the highest ever reported in this setting, possibly reflecting the pragmatic approach to chemotherapy timing.CLINICAL TRIALS NUMBER: NCT00268398.",1,1,1,1
24987838,"Noninvasive image texture analysis differentiates K-ras mutation from pan-wildtype NSCLC and is prognostic.BACKGROUND: Non-invasive characterization of a tumor's molecular features could enhance treatment management.Quantitative computed tomography (CT) based texture analysis (QTA) has been used to derive tumor heterogeneity information, and the appearance of the tumors has been shown to relate to patient outcome in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and other cancers.In this study, we examined the potential of tumoral QTA to differentiate K-ras mutant from pan-wildtype tumors and its prognostic potential using baseline pre-treatment non-contrast CT imaging in NSCLC.METHODS: Tumor DNA from patients with early-stage NSCLC was analyzed on the LungCarta Panel.Cases with a K-ras mutation or pan-wildtype for 26 oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes were selected for QTA.QTA was applied to regions of interest in the primary tumor.Non-parametric Mann Whitney test assessed the ability of the QTA, clinical and patient characteristics to differentiate between K-ras mutation from pan-wildtype.A recursive decision tree was developed to determine whether the differentiation of K-ras mutant from pan-wildtype tumors could be improved by sequential application of QTA parameters.Kaplan-Meier survival analysis assessed the ability of these markers to predict survival.RESULTS: QTA was applied to 48 cases identified, 27 had a K-ras mutation and 21 cases were pan-wildtype.Positive skewness and lower kurtosis were significantly associated with the presence of a K-ras mutation.A five node decision tree had sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy values (95% CI) of 96.3% (78.1-100), 81.0% (50.5-97.4), and 89.6% (72.9-97.0); respectively.Kurtosis was a significant predictor of OS and DFS, with a lower kurtosis value linked with poorer survival.CONCLUSIONS: Lower kurtosis and positive skewness are significantly associated with K-ras mutations.A QTA feature such as kurtosis is prognostic for OS and DFS.Non-invasive QTA can differentiate the presence of K-ras mutation from pan-wildtype NSCLC and is associated with patient survival.",0,0,0,0

27339115,"Conventional versus hypofractionated high-dose intensity-modulated radiotherapy for prostate cancer: 5-year outcomes of the randomised, non-inferiority, phase 3 CHHiP trial.BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer might have high radiation-fraction sensitivity that would give a therapeutic advantage to hypofractionated treatment.We present a pre-planned analysis of the efficacy and side-effects of a randomised trial comparing conventional and hypofractionated radiotherapy after 5 years follow-up.METHODS: CHHiP is a randomised, phase 3, non-inferiority trial that recruited men with localised prostate cancer (pT1b-T3aN0M0).Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to conventional (74 Gy delivered in 37 fractions over 7.4 weeks) or one of two hypofractionated schedules (60 Gy in 20 fractions over 4 weeks or 57 Gy in 19 fractions over 3.8 weeks)all delivered with intensity-modulated techniques.Most patients were given radiotherapy with 3-6 months of neoadjuvant and concurrent androgen suppression.Randomisation was by computer-generated random permuted blocks, stratified by National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk group and radiotherapy treatment centre, and treatment allocation was not masked.The primary endpoint was time to biochemical or clinical failure; the critical hazard ratio (HR) for non-inferiority was 1.208.Analysis was by intention to treat.Long-term follow-up continues.The CHHiP trial is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN97182923.FINDINGS: Between Oct 18, 2002, and June 17, 2011, 3216 men were enrolled from 71 centres and randomly assigned (74 Gy group, 1065 patients; 60 Gy group, 1074 patients; 57 Gy group, 1077 patients).Median follow-up was 62.4 months (IQR 53.9-77.0).The proportion of patients who were biochemical or clinical failure free at 5 years was 88.3% (95% CI 86.0-90.2) in the 74 Gy group, 90.6% (88.5-92.3) in the 60 Gy group, and 85.9% (83.4-88.0) in the 57 Gy group.60 Gy was non-inferior to 74 Gy (HR 0.84 [90% CI 0.68-1.03], pNI=0.0018) but non-inferiority could not be claimed for 57 Gy compared with 74 Gy (HR 1.20 [0.99-1.46], pNI=0.48).Long-term side-effects were similar in the hypofractionated groups compared with the conventional group.There were no significant differences in either the proportion or cumulative incidence of side-effects 5 years after treatment using three clinician-reported as well as patient-reported outcome measures.The estimated cumulative 5 year incidence of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) grade 2 or worse bowel and bladder adverse events was 13.7% (111 events) and 9.1% (66 events) in the 74 Gy group, 11.9% (105 events) and 11.7% (88 events) in the 60 Gy group, 11.3% (95 events) and 6.6% (57 events) in the 57 Gy group, respectively.No treatment-related deaths were reported.INTERPRETATION: Hypofractionated radiotherapy using 60 Gy in 20 fractions is non-inferior to conventional fractionation using 74 Gy in 37 fractions and is recommended as a new standard of care for external-beam radiotherapy of localised prostate cancer.FUNDING: Cancer Research UK, Department of Health, and the National Institute for Health Research Cancer Research Network.",1,1,1,1
26202595,"Randomized phase II study evaluating veliparib (ABT-888) with temozolomide in patients with metastatic melanoma.BACKGROUND: Veliparib (ABT-888) is a potent, orally bioavailable, small-molecule inhibitor of the DNA repair enzymes poly ADP-ribose polymerase-1 and -2.Veliparib enhances the efficacy of temozolomide (TMZ) and other cytotoxic agents in preclinical tumor models.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this multicenter, double-blind trial, adults with unresectable stage III or IV metastatic melanoma were randomized 1:1:1 to TMZ plus veliparib 20 or 40 mg, or placebo twice daily.Efficacy end points included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and objective response rate (ORR).RESULTS: Patients (N = 346) were randomized between February 2009 and January 2010.Median [95% confidence interval (CI)] PFS was 3.7 (3.0-5.5), 3.6 (1.9-4.1), and 2 (1.9-3.7) months in the 20-mg, 40-mg, and placebo arms, respectively.Median (95% CI) OS was 10.8 (9.0-13.1), 13.6 (11.4-15.9), and 12.9 (9.8-14.3) months, respectively; ORR was 10.3%, 8.7%, and 7.0%.Exploratory analyses showed patients with low ERCC1 expression had longer PFS when TMZ was combined with veliparib.Toxicities were as expected for TMZ.The frequencies of thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and leukopenia were significantly increased in the veliparib groups.Grade 3 or 4 adverse events, mainly hematologic toxicities, were seen in 55%, 63%, and 41% of patients in the 20-mg, 40-mg, and placebo arms, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Median PFS with 20 and 40 mg veliparib almost doubled numerically compared with placebo, but the improvements did not reach statistical significance.OS was not increased with veliparib.Toxicities were similar to TMZ monotherapy, but with increased frequency.",1,1,1,1
25374187,"Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in non-cardia gastric cancer patients--does it improve survival?BACKGROUND: Survival rates after resection of advanced gastric cancer are extremely poor.An increasing number of patients with gastric carcinomas (GC) are therefore being treated with preoperative chemotherapy.We evaluated 36 month survival rate of GC patients that were treated by adding a neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy before gastrostomy.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with stage II or III gastric adenocarcinomas were enrolled.The patients divided into two groups: (A) Neoadjuvant group that received concurrent chemoradiation before surgery (4,500 cGy of radiation at 180 cGy per day plus chemotherapy with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil, in the first and the end four days of radiotherapy).Resection was attempted 5 to 6 weeks after end of chemoradiotherapy.(B) Adjuvant group that received concurrent chemo-radiation after surgical resection.RESULTS: Two (16.7%) patients out of 12 patients treated with neoadjuvant chemo-radiotherapy and 5 (38.5%) out of 13 in the surgery group survived after 36 months.These rates were not significantly different with per protocol and intention-to-treat analysis.The median survival time of patients in group A and B were 13.4 and 21.6 months , respectively, again not significantly different.Survival was significantly greater in patients with well differentiated adenocarcinoma in group B than in group A (p<0.004).CONCLUSIONS: According to this study we suggest surgery then chemoradiotherapy for patients with well differentiated gastric adenocarcinoma rather than other approaches.Additional studies with greater sample size and accurate matching relying on cancer molecular behavior are recommended.",0,0,0,0

Chronic pain was evaluated 3 months, 6 months, and 1 yr after surgery by the brief pain inventory, hospital anxiety and depression, and neuropathic pain questionnaires.RESULTS: Ropivacaine wound infiltration significantly decreased immediate postoperative pain for the first 90 min, but did not decrease chronic pain at 3 months (primary endpoint), or at 6 and 12 months postoperatively.At 3 months, the incidence of chronic pain was 33% and 27% (P = 0.37) in the ropivacaine and placebo groups, respectively.During follow-up, brief pain inventory, neuropathic pain, and anxiety increased over time in both groups (P < 0.001) while depression remained stable.No complications occurred.CONCLUSION: This multicenter, prospective study shows that ropivacaine wound infiltration after breast cancer surgery decreased immediate postoperative pain but did not decrease chronic pain at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively.",0,0,0,0
27044367,"Evaluating a computer aid for assessing stomach symptoms (ECASS): study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.BACKGROUND: For most cancers, only a minority of patients have symptoms meeting the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidance for urgent referral.For gastro-oesophageal cancers, the 'alarm' symptoms of dysphagia and weight loss are reported by only 32 and 8 % of patients, respectively, and their presence correlates with advanced-stage disease.Electronic clinical decision-support tools that integrate with clinical computer systems have been developed for general practice, although uncertainty remains concerning their effectiveness.The objectives of this trial are to optimise the intervention and establish the acceptability of both the intervention and randomisation, confirm the suitability and selection of outcome measures, finalise the design for the phase III definitive trial, and obtain preliminary estimates of the intervention effect.METHODS/DESIGN: This is a two-arm, multi-centre, cluster-randomised, controlled phase II trial design, which will extend over a 16-month period, across 60 general practices within the North East and North Cumbria and the Eastern Local Clinical Research Network areas.Practices will be randomised to receive either the intervention (the electronic clinical decision-support tool) or to act as a control (usual care).From these practices, we will recruit 3000 adults who meet the trial eligibility criteria and present to their GP with symptoms suggestive of gastro-oesophageal cancer.The main measures are the process data, which include the practitioner outcomes, service outcomes, diagnostic intervals, health economic outcomes, and patient outcomes.One-on-one interviews in a sub-sample of 30 patient-GP dyads will be undertaken to understand the impact of the use or non-use of the electronic clinical decision-support tool in the consultation.A further 10-15 GPs will be interviewed to identify and gain an understanding of the facilitators and constraints influencing implementation of the electronic clinical decision-support tool in practice.DISCUSSION: We aim to generate new knowledge on the process measures regarding the use of electronic clinical decision-support tools in primary care in general and to inform a subsequent definitive phase III trial.Preliminary data on the impact of the support tool on resource utilisation and health care costs will also be collected.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN Registry, ISRCTN12595588 .",0,0,0,0

24793078,"A randomized trial of the effectiveness of topical ""ABH Gel"" (Ativan((R)), Benadryl((R)), Haldol((R))) vs. placebo in cancer patients with nausea.CONTEXT: The topical gel known as ""ABH gel,"" comprising lorazepam (Ativan((R))), diphenhydramine (Benadryl((R))), and haloperidol (Haldol((R))), is frequently used to treat nausea because of its perceived efficacy, relatively low cost, and ease of use in the home setting.There are limited scientific data on this medication, however.Recent pilot studies showed no absorption of the active ingredients of the gel, prompting further prospective studies into the cause of the perceived efficacy in the clinical setting.OBJECTIVES: To determine any difference in the effectiveness of ABH gel compared with placebo in cancer patients with nausea.METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, noninferiority clinical trial was developed to test the hypothesis that there is no difference in the effectiveness of ABH gel compared with placebo in cancer patients with nausea.The primary outcome was the difference in nausea score (on a 0-10 scale) at baseline and at 60 minutes in each treatment group.The difference in the ABH gel-treated group compared with placebo was evaluated for noninferiority.Secondary outcomes included the number of vomiting episodes and side effects over time.RESULTS: The mean change in nausea score from baseline to 60 minutes after treatment in the ABH gel group was 1.7 +/- 2.05 and 0.9 +/- 2.45 for the placebo group (P = 0.42).The placebo group was found to be noninferior to the ABH gel group in reducing the nausea score.ABH gel also did not decrease vomiting events better than placebo (P = 0.34).Only one patient reported any side effects from the treatments in either arm of the study.CONCLUSION: ABH gel in its current formulation should not be used in cancer patients experiencing nausea.",0,0,0,0
25403578,"FOLFOX4 versus sequential dose-dense FOLFOX7 followed by FOLFIRI in patients with resectable metastatic colorectal cancer (MIROX): a pragmatic approach to chemotherapy timing with perioperative or postoperative chemotherapy from an open-label, randomized phase III trial.BACKGROUND: Perioperative FOLFOX4 (oxaliplatin plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin) chemotherapy is the current standard in patients with resectable metastases from colorectal cancer (CRC).We aimed to determine whether a sequential chemotherapy with dose-dense oxaliplatin (FOLFOX7) and irinotecan (FOLFIRI; irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin) is superior to FOLFOX4.The chemotherapy timing was not imposed, and was perioperative or postoperative.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this open-label, phase III trial, patients with resectable or resected metastases were randomly assigned either to 12 cycles of FOLFOX4 (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m(2)) or 6 cycles of FOLFOX7 (oxaliplatin 130 mg/m(2)) followed by 6 cycles of FOLFIRI (irinotecan 180 mg/m(2)).Randomization was done centrally, with stratification by chemotherapy timing, type of local treatment (surgery versus radiofrequency ablation with/without surgery), and Fong's prognostic score.The primary end point was 2-year disease-free survival (DFS).RESULTS: A total of 284 patients were randomized, 142 in each treatment group.Chemotherapy was perioperative in 168 (59.2%) patients and postoperative in 116 (40.8%) patients.Perioperative chemotherapy was preferentially proposed for synchronous metastases, whereas postoperative chemotherapy was more frequently used for metachronous metastases.Two-year DFS was 48.5% in the FOLFOX4 group and 50.0% in the FOLFOX7-FOLFIRI group.In the multivariable analysis, more than one metastasis [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.15] and synchronous metastases (HR = 1.63) were independent prognostic factors for shorter DFS.Five-year overall survival (OS) rate was 69.5% with FOLFOX4 versus 66.6% with FOLFOX7-FOLFIRI.CONCLUSIONS: FOLFOX7-FOLFIRI is not superior to FOLFOX4 in patients with resectable metastatic CRC.Five-year OS rates observed in both groups are the highest ever reported in this setting, possibly reflecting the pragmatic approach to chemotherapy timing.CLINICAL TRIALS NUMBER: NCT00268398.",1,1,1,1
26686313,"Anastrozole versus tamoxifen for the prevention of locoregional and contralateral breast cancer in postmenopausal women with locally excised ductal carcinoma in situ (IBIS-II DCIS): a double-blind, randomised controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Third-generation aromatase inhibitors are more effective than tamoxifen for preventing recurrence in postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive invasive breast cancer.However, it is not known whether anastrozole is more effective than tamoxifen for women with hormone-receptor-positive ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).Here, we compare the efficacy of anastrozole with that of tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive DCIS.METHODS: In a double-blind, multicentre, randomised placebo-controlled trial, we recruited women who had been diagnosed with locally excised, hormone-receptor-positive DCIS.Eligible women were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio by central computer allocation to receive 1 mg oral anastrozole or 20 mg oral tamoxifen every day for 5 years.Randomisation was stratified by major centre or hub and was done in blocks (six, eight, or ten).All trial personnel, participants, and clinicians were masked to treatment allocation and only the trial statistician had access to treatment allocation.The primary endpoint was all recurrence, including recurrent DCIS and new contralateral tumours.All analyses were done on a modified intention-to-treat basis (in all women who were randomised and did not revoke consent for their data to be included) and proportional hazard models were used to compute hazard ratios and corresponding confidence intervals.This trial is registered at the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN37546358.RESULTS: Between March 3, 2003, and Feb 8, 2012, we enrolled 2980 postmenopausal women from 236 centres in 14 countries and randomly assigned them to receive anastrozole (1449 analysed) or tamoxifen (1489 analysed).Median follow-up was 7.2 years (IQR 5.6-8.9), and 144 breast cancer recurrences were recorded.We noted no statistically significant difference in overall recurrence (67 recurrences for anastrozole vs 77 for tamoxifen; HR 0.89 [95% CI 0.64-1.23]).The non-inferiority of anastrozole was established (upper 95% CI <1.25), but its superiority to tamoxifen was not (p=0.49).A total of 69 deaths were recorded (33 for anastrozole vs 36 for tamoxifen; HR 0.93 [95% CI 0.58-1.50], p=0.78), and no specific cause was more common in one group than the other.The number of women reporting any adverse event was similar between anastrozole (1323 women, 91%) and tamoxifen (1379 women, 93%); the side-effect profiles of the two drugs differed, with more fractures, musculoskeletal events, hypercholesterolaemia, and strokes with anastrozole and more muscle spasm, gynaecological cancers and symptoms, vasomotor symptoms, and deep vein thromboses with tamoxifen.CONCLUSIONS: No clear efficacy differences were seen between the two treatments.Anastrozole offers another treatment option for postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive DCIS, which may be be more appropriate for some women with contraindications for tamoxifen.Longer follow-up will be necessary to fully evaluate treatment differences.FUNDING: Cancer Research UK, National Health and Medical Research Council Australia, Breast Cancer Research Fund, AstraZeneca, Sanofi Aventis.",1,1,1,1
27382257,"Fondaparinux vs warfarin for the treatment of unsuspected pulmonary embolism in cancer patients.INTRODUCTION: In cancer patients, the chest computer tomography (CT) can be used to identify asymptomatic pulmonary embolism (APE).In most cases, these patients are treated with anticoagulant drugs for at least 3 months.The American College of Physicians recommend treatment of these patients as patients with symptomatic pulmonary embolism.In this study, we evaluated and compared the efficacy and safety of fondaparinux vs warfarin in the prevention of unsuspected pulmonary embolism in patients with active cancer.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective and parallel group study was performed on 64 cancer patients (29 males and 35 females) with APE.A multidetector CT angiography with high spatial and temporal resolution and quality of arterial opacification was used to make the diagnosis.Lung scintigraphy was reserved to selected patients only.Patients were randomized to either the warfarin (Group A) or the fondaparinux (Group B) for 90 days.The first end point of efficacy was the persistence, reduction, or disappearance of thrombosis after 90 days.The second end point was the reappearance of thrombosis after 1 year.The first end point of safety was the development of major bleeding.RESULTS: We enrolled 32 patients into each treatment group.We reached the first end point of efficacy and safety in Group B which showed that fondaparinux was able to induce the disappearance of thrombotic pulmonary with a lower incidence of major bleeding events compared with warfarin.No difference in the secondary end point was recorded.CONCLUSION: We suggest that the treatment of cancer patients with APE can be oriented with the administration of a standard dose of fondaparinux until the next CT lung control (3 months).However, the lack of a randomized clinical trial, including a larger patient cohort, does not allow formulation of final recommendations in these patients.A broader study would be desirable, involving a larger number of patients and a longer follow-up period.",0,0,0,0

23281805,"Randomized Phase II trial of paclitaxel and carboplatin followed by gemcitabine switch-maintenance therapy versus gemcitabine and carboplatin followed by gemcitabine continuation-maintenance therapy in previously untreated advanced non-small cell lung cancer.BACKGROUND: In recent years, maintenance chemotherapy is increasingly being recognized as a new treatment strategy to improve the outcome of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).However, the optimal maintenance strategy is still controversial.Gemcitabine is a promising candidate for single-agent maintenance therapy because of little toxicity and good tolerability.We have conducted a randomized phase II study to evaluate the validity of single-agent maintenance chemotherapy of gemcitabine and to compare continuation- and switch-maintenance.METHODS: Chemonaive patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC were randomly assigned 1:1 to either arm A or B. Patients received paclitaxel (200 mg/m2, day 1) plus carboplatin (AUC 6 mg/mL/min, day 1) every 3 weeks in arm A, or gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2, days 1 and 8) plus carboplatin (AUC 5 mg/mL/min, day1) every 3 weeks in arm B. Non-progressive patients following 3 cycles of induction chemotherapy received maintenance gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2, days 1 and 8) every 3 weeks.( TRIAL REGISTRATION: UMIN000008252)RESULTS: The study was stopped because of delayed accrual at interim analysis.Of the randomly assigned 50 patients, 49 except for one in arm B were evaluable.Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 4.6 months for arm A vs. 3.5 months for arm B (HR = 1.03; 95% CI, 0.45-2.27; p = 0.95) and median overall survival (OS) was 15.0 months for arm A vs. 14.8 months for arm B (HR = 0.79; 95% CI, 0.40-1.51; p = 0.60), showing no difference between the two arms.The response rate, disease control rate, and the transit rate to maintenance phase were 36.0% (9/25), 64.0% (16/25), and 48% (12/25) for arm A vs. 16.7% (4/24), 50.0% (12/24), and 33% (8/24) for arm B, which were also statistically similar between the two arms (p = 0.13, p = 0.32, and p = 0.30, respectively).Both induction regimens were tolerable, except that more patients experienced peripheral neuropathy in arm A. Toxicities during the maintenance phase were also minimal.CONCLUSION: Survival and overall response were not significantly different between the two arms.Gemcitabine may be well-tolerable and feasible for maintenance therapy.",1,1,1,1

23850170,"Which patients benefit most from primary surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy in stage IIIC or IV ovarian cancer? An exploratory analysis of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer 55971 randomised trial.BACKGROUND: To investigate whether biomarkers consisting of baseline characteristics of advanced stage ovarian cancer patients can help in identifying subgroups of patients who would benefit more from primary surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy.METHODS: We used data of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 55971 trial in which 670 patients were randomly assigned to primary surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy.The primary outcome was overall survival.Ten baseline clinical and pathological characteristics were selected as potential biomarkers.Using Subpopulation Treatment Effect Pattern Plots (STEPP), biomarkers with a statistically significant qualitative additive interaction with treatment were considered as potentially informative for treatment selection.We also combined selected biomarkers to form a multimarker treatment selection rule.FINDINGS: The size of the largest metastatic tumour and clinical stage were significantly associated with the magnitude of the benefit from treatment, in terms of five-year survival (p for interaction: 0.008 and 0.016, respectively).Stage IIIC patients with metastatic tumours 45 mm benefited more from primary surgery while stage IV patients with metastatic tumours >45 mm benefited more from neoadjuvant chemotherapy.In stage IIIC patients with larger metastatic tumours and in stage IV patients with less extensive metastatic tumours both treatments were equally effective.We estimated that by selecting treatments for patients based on largest metastatic tumour and clinical stage, the potential five-year survival rate in the population of treated patients would be 27.3% (95% confidence interval (CI) 21.9-33.0), 7.8% higher than if all were treated with primary surgery, and 5.6% higher if all were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.INTERPRETATION: Although survival was comparable after primary surgery and neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the overall group of patients with ovarian cancer in the EORTC 55971 trial, we found in this exploratory analysis that patients with stage IIIC and less extensive metastatic tumours had higher survival with primary surgery, while patients with stage IV disease and large metastatic tumours had higher survival with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.For patients who did not meet these criteria, both treatment options led to comparable survival rates.",1,1,1,1
23388205,"A preliminary exploration of the feasibility of offering men information about potential prostate cancer treatment options before they know their biopsy results.BACKGROUND: A small pre-test study was conducted to ascertain potential harm and anxiety associated with distributing information about possible cancer treatment options at the time of biopsy, prior to knowledge about a definitive cancer diagnosis.Priming men about the availability of multiple options before they have a confirmed diagnosis may be an opportunity to engage patients in more informed decision-making.METHODS: Men with an elevated PSA test or suspicious Digital Rectal Examination (DRE) who were referred to a urology clinic for a biopsy were randomized to receive either the clinic's usual care (UC) biopsy instruction sheet (n = 11) or a pre-biopsy educational (ED) packet containing the biopsy instruction sheet along with a booklet about the biopsy procedure and a prostate cancer treatment decision aid originally written for newly diagnosed men that described in detail possible treatment options (n = 18).RESULTS: A total of 62% of men who were approached agreed to be randomized, and 83% of the ED group confirmed they used the materials.Anxiety scores were similar for both groups while awaiting the biopsy procedure, with anxiety scores trending lower in the ED group: 41.2 on a prostate-specific anxiety instrument compared to 51.7 in the UC group (p = 0.13).ED participants reported better overall quality of life while awaiting biopsy compared to the UC group (76.4 vs. 48.5, p = 0.01).The small number of men in the ED group who went on to be diagnosed with cancer reported being better informed about the risks and side effects of each option compared to men diagnosed with cancer in the UC group (p = 0.07).In qualitative discussions, men generally reported they found the pre-biopsy materials to be helpful and indicated having information about possible treatment options reduced their anxiety.However, 2 of 18 men reported they did not want to think about treatment options until after they knew their biopsy results.CONCLUSIONS: In this small sample offering pre-biopsy education about potential treatment options was generally well received by patients, appeared to be beneficial to men who went on to be diagnosed, and did not appear to increase anxiety unnecessarily among those who had a negative biopsy.",0,0,0,0

24162448,"A randomized controlled trial of diet and physical activity in BRCA mutation carriers.High serum levels of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) are associated with an increased risk of sporadic breast cancer (BC).Furthermore, insulin and markers of insulin resistance, such as abdominal obesity, high blood glucose, high serum testosterone and metabolic syndrome, may affect both BC incidence and prognosis.We hypothesized that all these factors might be relevant also for hereditary BC, due to a deleterious mutation of BRCA genes.Epidemiological observation suggested that weight, energy intake (usually associated with higher bio-availability of growth factors) and physical activity may be relevant in BRCA mutation carriers.Mechanistic studies hypothesized a functional interaction between BRCA genes and the IGF-I system.We have provided some evidence that high serum levels of IGF-I are associated with a significantly increased penetrance.We are recruiting a larger cohort of BRCA mutation carriers in order to test potential modulators of penetrance and prognosis.Within this cohort, we have planned a randomized controlled trial to test whether moderate calorie and protein restriction, together with physical activity, decrease IGF-I. Eligible study subjects are women with or without BC, aged 18-70, with a proven deleterious BRCA mutation, and without metastases.All the women will receive recommendations for the dietary prevention of cancer.The women will be then randomized into an active life-style intervention group and into a control group that will receive only the baseline recommendations.We expect to significantly reduce IGF-I in the intervention group.This trial and the subsequent cohort follow-up might open up primary prevention options for genetic BC.",0,0,0,0

26438237,"The effects of short-term fasting on tolerance to (neo) adjuvant chemotherapy in HER2-negative breast cancer patients: a randomized pilot study.BACKGROUND: Preclinical evidence shows that short-term fasting (STF) protects healthy cells against side effects of chemotherapy and makes cancer cells more vulnerable to it.This pilot study examines the feasibility of STF and its effects on tolerance of chemotherapy in a homogeneous patient group with early breast cancer (BC).METHODS: Eligible patients had HER2-negative, stage II/III BC.Women receiving (neo)-adjuvant TAC (docetaxel/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide) were randomized to fast 24 h before and after commencing chemotherapy, or to eat according to the guidelines for healthy nutrition.Toxicity in the two groups was compared.Chemotherapy-induced DNA damage in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was quantified by the level of gamma-H2AX analyzed by flow cytometry.RESULTS: Thirteen patients were included of whom seven were randomized to the STF arm.STF was well tolerated.Mean erythrocyte- and thrombocyte counts 7 days post-chemotherapy were significantly higher (P = 0.007, 95 % CI 0.106-0.638 and P = 0.00007, 95 % CI 38.7-104, respectively) in the STF group compared to the non-STF group.Non-hematological toxicity did not differ between the groups.Levels of gamma-H2AX were significantly increased 30 min post-chemotherapy in CD45 + CD3- cells in non-STF, but not in STF patients.CONCLUSIONS: STF during chemotherapy was well tolerated and reduced hematological toxicity of TAC in HER2-negative BC patients.Moreover, STF may reduce a transient increase in, and/or induce a faster recovery of DNA damage in PBMCs after chemotherapy.Larger studies, investigating a longer fasting period, are required to generate more insight into the possible benefits of STF during chemotherapy.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01304251 , March 2011.",1,1,1,1
25873295,"An Exploratory Study of the Effects of Mind-Body Interventions Targeting Sleep on Salivary Oxytocin Levels in Cancer Survivors.Cancer survivors experience high levels of distress, associated with a host of negative psychological states, including anxiety, depression, and fear of recurrence, which often lead to sleep problems and reduction in quality of life (QOL) and well-being.As a neuropeptide hormone associated with affiliation, calmness, and well-being, oxytocin may be a useful biological measure of changes in health outcomes in cancer survivors.In this exploratory study, which comprised a subset of participants from a larger study, we evaluated (a) the feasibility and reliability of salivary oxytocin (sOT) levels in cancer survivors and (b) the effects of 2 sleep-focused mind-body interventions, mind-body bridging (MBB) and mindfulness meditation (MM), compared with a sleep hygiene education (SHE) control, on changes in sOT levels in 30 cancer survivors with self-reported sleep disturbance.Interventions were conducted in 3 sessions, once per week for 3 weeks.Saliva samples were collected at baseline, postintervention (~1 week after the last session), and at the 2-month follow-up.In this cancer survivor group, we found that intra-individual sOT levels were fairly stable across the 3 time points, of about 3 months' duration, and mean baseline sOT levels did not differ between females and males and were not correlated with age.Correlations between baseline sOT and self-report measures were weak; however, several of these relationships were in the predicted direction, in which sOT levels were negatively associated with sleep problems and depression and positively associated with cancer-related QOL and well-being.Regarding intervention effects on sOT, baseline-subtracted sOT levels were significantly larger at postintervention in the MBB group as compared with those in SHE.In this sample of cancer survivors assessed for sOT, at postintervention, greater reductions in sleep problems were noted for MBB and MM compared with that of SHE, and increases in mindfulness and self-compassion were observed in the MBB group compared with those in SHE.The findings in this exploratory study suggest that sOT may be a reliable biological measure over time that may provide insight into the effects of mind-body interventions on health outcomes in cancer survivors.",0,0,0,0

25971958,"Perioperative Bundle Decreases Postoperative Hepatic Surgery Infections.BACKGROUND: Postoperative infections are a costly and morbid complication.The introduction of perioperative infection prevention bundles have decreased surgical site infections (SSIs) in patients undergoing colorectal and pancreatic surgery.AIM: The purpose of this study was to determine if the implementation of a perioperative bundle would reduce postoperative infectious complications in patients undergoing hepatic surgery.METHODS: An evidence-based, low cost, perioperative infection bundle was created, and a retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database was performed on 163 consecutive patients undergoing hepatic surgery.Patient characteristics, operative details, outcomes, and complications were reviewed, and differences pre- and post-bundle were assessed with univariate and multivariate analyses.RESULTS: A total of 113 patients received standard infection prophylaxis, while 50 received the perioperative bundle.Twenty-five patients had infections (16 deep abscesses, 3 superficial SSIs, 4 urinary tract infections, 1 pneumonia, 1 bacteremia).The overall infection rate decreased from 20.4 % (23/133) pre-bundle to 4 % (2/50) post-bundle.The SSI rate also decreased from 15 % (17/113) to 4 % (2/50).Univariate analysis showed that institution of the bundle was associated with a lower overall infection rate (p = 0.008), lower SSI rate (p = 0.06), and lower overall complication rate (p = 0.04).Multivariate analysis confirmed that the use of the bundle was independently associated with a lower infection (p = 0.008) and SSI (p = 0.05) rate.The primary length of stay (LOS) and LOS for 60 days postoperatively both significantly decreased post-bundle (from median of 5-4 days, p </= 0.001; 6-4 days, p </= 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a perioperative infection prevention bundle significantly decreased overall infections, SSIs, and postoperative LOS in patients undergoing hepatic surgery.",0,0,0,0
26686313,"Anastrozole versus tamoxifen for the prevention of locoregional and contralateral breast cancer in postmenopausal women with locally excised ductal carcinoma in situ (IBIS-II DCIS): a double-blind, randomised controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Third-generation aromatase inhibitors are more effective than tamoxifen for preventing recurrence in postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive invasive breast cancer.However, it is not known whether anastrozole is more effective than tamoxifen for women with hormone-receptor-positive ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).Here, we compare the efficacy of anastrozole with that of tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive DCIS.METHODS: In a double-blind, multicentre, randomised placebo-controlled trial, we recruited women who had been diagnosed with locally excised, hormone-receptor-positive DCIS.Eligible women were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio by central computer allocation to receive 1 mg oral anastrozole or 20 mg oral tamoxifen every day for 5 years.Randomisation was stratified by major centre or hub and was done in blocks (six, eight, or ten).All trial personnel, participants, and clinicians were masked to treatment allocation and only the trial statistician had access to treatment allocation.The primary endpoint was all recurrence, including recurrent DCIS and new contralateral tumours.All analyses were done on a modified intention-to-treat basis (in all women who were randomised and did not revoke consent for their data to be included) and proportional hazard models were used to compute hazard ratios and corresponding confidence intervals.This trial is registered at the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN37546358.RESULTS: Between March 3, 2003, and Feb 8, 2012, we enrolled 2980 postmenopausal women from 236 centres in 14 countries and randomly assigned them to receive anastrozole (1449 analysed) or tamoxifen (1489 analysed).Median follow-up was 7.2 years (IQR 5.6-8.9), and 144 breast cancer recurrences were recorded.We noted no statistically significant difference in overall recurrence (67 recurrences for anastrozole vs 77 for tamoxifen; HR 0.89 [95% CI 0.64-1.23]).The non-inferiority of anastrozole was established (upper 95% CI <1.25), but its superiority to tamoxifen was not (p=0.49).A total of 69 deaths were recorded (33 for anastrozole vs 36 for tamoxifen; HR 0.93 [95% CI 0.58-1.50], p=0.78), and no specific cause was more common in one group than the other.The number of women reporting any adverse event was similar between anastrozole (1323 women, 91%) and tamoxifen (1379 women, 93%); the side-effect profiles of the two drugs differed, with more fractures, musculoskeletal events, hypercholesterolaemia, and strokes with anastrozole and more muscle spasm, gynaecological cancers and symptoms, vasomotor symptoms, and deep vein thromboses with tamoxifen.CONCLUSIONS: No clear efficacy differences were seen between the two treatments.Anastrozole offers another treatment option for postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive DCIS, which may be be more appropriate for some women with contraindications for tamoxifen.Longer follow-up will be necessary to fully evaluate treatment differences.FUNDING: Cancer Research UK, National Health and Medical Research Council Australia, Breast Cancer Research Fund, AstraZeneca, Sanofi Aventis.",1,1,1,1

27951450,"Dose-dense adjuvant chemotherapy in premenopausal breast cancer patients: A pooled analysis of the MIG1 and GIM2 phase III studies.BACKGROUND: No evidence exists to recommend a specific chemotherapy regimen in young breast cancer patients.We performed a pooled analysis of two randomised clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of adjuvant dose-dense chemotherapy in premenopausal breast cancer patients and its impact on the risk of treatment-induced amenorrhoea.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the MIG1 study, node-positive or high-risk node-negative patients were randomised to 6 cycles of fluorouracil/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide every 2 (dose-dense) or 3 (standard-interval) weeks.In the GIM2 study, node-positive patients were randomised to 4 cycles of dose-dense or standard-interval EC or FEC followed by 4 cycles of dose-dense or standard-interval paclitaxel.Using individual patient data, the hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival by means of a Cox proportional hazards model and the odds ratio for treatment-induced amenorrhoea through a logistic regression model were calculated for each study.A meta-analysis of the two studies was performed using the random effect model to compute the parameter estimates.RESULTS: A total of 1,549 patients were included.Dose-dense chemotherapy was associated with a significant improved overall survival as compared to standard-interval chemotherapy (HR, 0.71; 95% confidence intervals [CI], 0.54-0.95; p = 0.021).The pooled HRs were 0.78 (95% CI, 0.54-1.12) and 0.65 (95% CI, 0.40-1.06) for patients with hormone receptor-positive and -negative tumours, respectively (interaction p = 0.330).No increased risk of treatment-induced amenorrhoea was observed with dose-dense chemotherapy (odds ratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.80-1.25; p = 0.989).CONCLUSION: Dose-dense adjuvant chemotherapy may be considered the preferred treatment option in high-risk premenopausal breast cancer patients.",1,1,1,1
24646327,"Standardization of D2 lymphadenectomy and surgical quality control (KLASS-02-QC): a prospective, observational, multicenter study [NCT01283893].BACKGROUND: Extended systemic lymphadenectomy (D2) is standard procedure for surgical treatment of advanced gastric cancer (AGC) although less extensive lymphadenectomy (D1) can be applied to early gastric cancer.Complete D2 lymphadenectomy is the mandatory procedure for studies that evaluate surgical treatment results of AGC.However, the actual extent of D2 lymphadenectomy varies among surgeons because of a lacking consensus on the anatomical definition of each lymph node station.This study is aimed to develop a consensus for D2 lymphadenectomy and also to qualify surgeons that can perform both laparoscopic and open D2 gastrectomy.METHODS/DESIGN: This (KLASS-02-QC) is a prospective, observational, multicenter study to qualify the surgeons that will participate in the KLASS-02-RCT, which is a prospective, randomized, clinical trial comparing laparoscopic and open gastrectomy for AGC.Surgeons and reviewers participating in the study will be required to complete a questionnaire detailing their professional experience and specific gastrectomy surgical background/training, and the gastrectomy metrics of their primary hospitals.All surgeons must submit three laparoscopic and three open D2 gastrectomy videos, respectively.Each video will be allocated to five peer reviewers; thus each surgeon's operations will be assessed by a total of 30 reviews.Based on blinded assessment of unedited videos by experts' review, a separate review evaluation committee will decide whether or not the evaluated surgeon will participate in the KLASS-02-RCT.The primary outcome measure is each surgeon's proficiency, as assessed by the reviewers based on evaluation criteria for completeness of D2 lymphadenectomy.DISCUSSION: We believe that our study for standardization of D2 lymphadenectomy and surgical quality control (KLASS-02-QC) will guarantee successful implementation of the subsequent KLASS-02-RCT study.After making consensus on D2 lymphadenectomy, we developed evaluation criteria for completeness of D2 lymphadenectomy.We also developed a unique surgical standardization and quality control system that consists of recording unedited surgical videos, and expert review according to evaluation criteria for completeness of D2 lymphadenectomy.We hope our systematic approach will set a milestone in surgical standardization that is essential for surgical clinical trials.Additionally, our methods will serve as a novel system for educating surgeons and assessing surgical proficiency.TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT01283893.",0,0,0,0

22892060,"Hormone replacement therapy after breast cancer: 10 year follow up of the Stockholm randomised trial.BACKGROUND: The management of hormonal deficiency symptoms in breast cancer survivors is an unsolved problem.While hormone replacement therapy (HRT) may increase the risk of breast cancer in healthy women, its effects on recurrence is unclear.Observational studies have suggested decreased recurrence rates from HRT.The few clinical trials in this field have all been closed preterm.METHODS: The Stockholm trial was started in 1997 and designed to minimise the dose of progestogen in the HRT arm.Disease-free women with a history of breast cancer were randomised to HRT (n=188) or no HRT (n=190).The trial was stopped in 2003 when another Swedish study (HABITS, the Hormonal Replacement After Breast Cancer - Is it Safe?) reported increased recurrence.However the Stockholm material showed no excess risk after 4 years of follow-up.A long term follow-up has now been performed.FINDINGS: After 10.8 years of follow-up, there was no difference in new breast cancer events: 60 in the HRT group versus 48 among controls (hazard ratio (HR)=1.3; 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.9-1.9).Among women on HRT, 11 had local recurrence and 12 distant metastases versus 15 and 12 for the controls.There were 14 contra-lateral breast cancers in the HRT group and four in the control group (HR=3.6; 95% CI=1.2-10.9; p=0.013).No differences in mortality or new primary malignancies were found.INTERPRETATION: The number of new events did not differ significantly between groups, in contrast to previous reports.The increased recurrence in HABITS has been attributed to higher progestogen exposure.As both trials were prematurely closed, data do not allow firm conclusions.Both studies found no increased mortality from breast cancer or other causes from HRT.Current guidelines typically consider HRT contraindicated in breast cancer survivors.Findings suggest that, in some women symptom relief may outweigh the potential risks of HRT.",0,0,0,0
27061082,"Randomized phase III trial of amrubicin/cisplatin versus etoposide/cisplatin as first-line treatment for extensive small-cell lung cancer.BACKGROUND: Extensive-disease small-cell lung cancer (ED-SCLC) is characterized by rapid progression and relapse, despite high initial response rates to chemotherapy.The primary objective of this trial was to demonstrate the non-inferiority of amrubicin and cisplatin (AP) combination therapy compared with the standard first-line regimen of etoposide and cisplatin (EP) for previously untreated ED-SCLC in a Chinese population.When non-inferiority was verified, the objective was switched from non-inferiority to superiority.METHODS: From June 2008 to July 2010, 300 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio to AP and EP groups.AP-treated patients received cisplatin (60 mg/m(2), day 1) and amrubicin (40 mg/m(2), days 1-3) once every 21 days.EP-treated patients received cisplatin (80 mg/m(2), day 1) and etoposide (100 mg/m(2), days 1-3) once every 21 days.Treatment was continued for four to six cycles, except in cases of progressive disease or toxicity, and patient refusal.RESULTS: Median overall survival (OS) for AP vs. EP treatment was 11.8 vs. 10.3 months (p = 0.08), respectively, demonstrating non-inferiority of AP to EP (AP group: 95% confidence interval for hazard ratio 0.63-1.03 months).Median progression-free survival and overall response rates for AP vs. EP groups were 6.8 vs. 5.7 months (p = 0.35) and 69.8% vs. 57.3%, respectively.Drug-related adverse events in both groups were similar, with neutropenia being the most frequent (AP 54.4%; EP 44.0%).Leukopenia, pyrexia, and fatigue were more prevalent in the AP group, but all were clinically reversible and manageable.CONCLUSIONS: AP therapy demonstrated non-inferiority to EP therapy, prolonging OS for 1.5 months, but this difference was not statistically significant; thus we propose AP as a promising treatment option for ED-SCLC in China.TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was registered on 10 April 2008 (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00660504).",1,1,1,1

27869649,"Randomized trial of calcipotriol combined with 5-fluorouracil for skin cancer precursor immunotherapy.BACKGROUND: Actinic keratosis is a precursor to cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.Long treatment durations and severe side effects have limited the efficacy of current actinic keratosis treatments.Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is an epithelium-derived cytokine that induces a robust antitumor immunity in barrier-defective skin.Here, we investigated the efficacy of calcipotriol, a topical TSLP inducer, in combination with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) as an immunotherapy for actinic keratosis.METHODS: The mechanism of calcipotriol action against skin carcinogenesis was examined in genetically engineered mouse models.The efficacy and safety of 0.005% calcipotriol ointment combined with 5% 5-FU cream were compared with Vaseline plus 5-FU for the field treatment of actinic keratosis in a randomized, double-blind clinical trial involving 131 participants.The assigned treatment was self-applied to the entirety of the qualified anatomical sites (face, scalp, and upper extremities) twice daily for 4 consecutive days.The percentage of reduction in the number of actinic keratoses (primary outcome), local skin reactions, and immune activation parameters were assessed.RESULTS: Calcipotriol suppressed skin cancer development in mice in a TSLP-dependent manner.Four-day application of calcipotriol plus 5-FU versus Vaseline plus 5-FU led to an 87.8% versus 26.3% mean reduction in the number of actinic keratoses in participants (P < 0.0001).Importantly, calcipotriol plus 5-FU treatment induced TSLP, HLA class II, and natural killer cell group 2D (NKG2D) ligand expression in the lesional keratinocytes associated with a marked CD4+ T cell infiltration, which peaked on days 10-11 after treatment, without pain, crusting, or ulceration.CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate the synergistic effects of calcipotriol and 5-FU treatment in optimally activating a CD4+ T cell-mediated immunity against actinic keratoses and, potentially, cancers of the skin and other organs.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02019355.FUNDING: Not applicable (investigator-initiated clinical trial).",1,1,1,1
24081946,"Randomized multicenter phase II trial comparing two schedules of etirinotecan pegol (NKTR-102) in women with recurrent platinum-resistant/refractory epithelial ovarian cancer.PURPOSE: Etirinotecan pegol (NKTR-102) is a unique, long-acting topoisomerase-I inhibitor with prolonged systemic exposure to SN38 (7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin), the active metabolite of irinotecan.This randomized phase II trial investigated two dosing schedules of etirinotecan pegol in patients with platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian carcinoma.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 71 eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive etirinotecan pegol 145 mg/m(2) every 14 or 21 days until progression or unacceptable adverse events (AEs).The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR) by RECIST (version 1.0).Secondary end points included response by Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup criteria, duration of ORR, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).RESULTS: The overall confirmed ORR was 20% (95% CI, 10% to 30%): 20% for once every 14 days, and 19% for once every 21 days.Median response duration was 4.1 months for once every 14 days and 4.0 months for once every 21 days.Median PFS for every 14 and every 21 days was 4.1 and 5.3 months, respectively, and median OS was 10.0 and 11.7 months, respectively.Etirinotecan pegol was well tolerated, with the most common grade 3 to 4 AEs being dehydration (24%) and diarrhea (23%).Diarrhea, dehydration, nausea, and neutropenia were less frequent with the schedule of once every 21 days than with that of once every 14 days.CONCLUSION: Both schedules of etirinotecan pegol showed activity in patients with heavily pretreated ovarian cancer, with encouraging ORR and PFS rates.The schedule of once every 21 days was better tolerated and had slightly longer PFS and OS rates.The treatment schedule of etirinotecan pegol 145 mg/m(2) once every 21 days was selected for the expanded phase II study and is preferred for future phase III studies.These findings provide support to directly compare etirinotecan pegol versus one of the approved drugs (eg, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or topotecan) in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.",1,1,1,1

28646893,"Clinical features of serous retinopathy observed with cobimetinib in patients with BRAF-mutated melanoma treated in the randomized coBRIM study.BACKGROUND: Serous chorioretinopathy has been associated with MEK inhibitors, including cobimetinib.We describe the clinical features of serous retinopathy observed with cobimetinib in patients with BRAF (V600)-mutated melanoma treated in the Phase III coBRIM study.METHODS: In the coBRIM study, 493 patients were treated in two randomly assigned treatment groups: cobimetinib and vemurafenib (n = 247) or vemurafenib (n = 246).All patients underwent prospective ophthalmic examinations at screening, at regular intervals during the study, and whenever ocular symptoms developed.Patients with serous retinopathy were identified in the study database using a group of relevant and synonymous adverse event terms.RESULTS: Eighty-six serous retinopathy events were reported in 70 patients (79 events in 63 cobimetinib and vemurafenib-treated patients vs seven events in seven vemurafenib-treated patients).Most patients with serous retinopathy identified by ophthalmic examination had no symptoms or had mild symptoms, among them reduced visual acuity, blurred vision, dyschromatopsia, and photophobia.Serous retinopathy usually occurred early during cobimetinib and vemurafenib treatment; median time to onset was 1.0 month.Most events were managed by observation and continuation of cobimetinib without dose modification and resolved or were resolving by the data cutoff date (19 Sept 2014).CONCLUSIONS: Cobimetinib treatment was associated with serous retinopathy in patients with BRAF (V600)-mutated melanoma.Retinopathy was generally asymptomatic or mild.Periodic ophthalmologic evaluations at regular intervals and at the manifestation of any visual disturbance are recommended to facilitate early detection and resolution of serous retinopathy while patients are taking cobimetinib.Trial Registration Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01689519).First received: September 18, 2012.",1,1,1,1
27795558,"Expression of CD33 is a predictive factor for effect of gemtuzumab ozogamicin at different doses in adult acute myeloid leukaemia.It remains unclear in adult acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) whether leukaemic expression of CD33, the target antigen for gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO), adds prognostic information on GO effectiveness at different doses.CD33 expression quantified in 1583 patients recruited to UK-NCRI-AML17 (younger adults) and UK-NCRI-AML16 (older adults) trials was correlated with clinical outcomes and benefit from GO including a dose randomisation.CD33 expression associated with genetic subgroups, including lower levels in both adverse karyotype and core-binding factor (CBF)-AML, but was not independently prognostic.When comparing GO versus no GO (n=393, CBF-AMLs excluded) by stratified subgroup-adjusted analysis, patients with lowest quartile (Q1) %CD33-positivity had no benefit from GO (relapse risk, HR 2.41 (1.27-4.56), P=0.009 for trend; overall survival, HR 1.52 (0.92-2.52)).However, from the dose randomisation (NCRI-AML17, n=464, CBF-AMLs included), 6 mg/m(2) GO only had a relapse benefit without increased early mortality in CD33-low (Q1) patients (relapse risk HR 0.64 (0.36-1.12) versus 1.70 (0.99-2.92) for CD33-high, P=0.007 for trend).Thus CD33 expression is a predictive factor for GO effect in adult AML; although GO does not appear to benefit the non-CBF AML patients with lowest CD33 expression a higher GO dose may be more effective for CD33-low but not CD33-high younger adults.",0,0,0,0
25678394,"Double-blinded, randomized phase II study using embolization with or without granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor in uveal melanoma with hepatic metastases.PURPOSE: To investigate the effects of immunoembolization with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in patients with uveal melanoma (UM) with liver-only metastasis.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this double-blind phase II clinical trial, patients were randomized to undergo immunoembolization or bland embolization (BE).Lobar treatment was performed with GM-CSF or normal saline solution mixed with ethiodized oil followed by embolization with gelatin sponge emulsified with iodinated contrast medium.Fifty-two patients (immunoembolization, n = 25; BE, n = 27) were enrolled.Response was assessed after every two treatments.The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR) of liver metastases.Progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and immunologic responses were secondary endpoints.RESULTS: There were five partial responses in the immunoembolization group (ORR, 21.2%; 90% confidence interval [CI], 10.3%-30.5%) and three in the BE group (ORR, 16.7%; 90% CI, 6.3%-26.9%).Stable disease was seen in 12 patients in the immunoembolization group and 19 in the BE group.OS times were 21.5 months (95% CI, 18.5-24.8 mo) with immunoembolization and 17.2 months (95% CI, 11.9-22.4 mo) with BE.The degree of proinflammatory cytokine production was more robust after immunoembolization and correlated with time to ""systemic"" extrahepatic progression.In the immunoembolization group, interleukin (IL)-6 levels at 1 hour (P = .001) and IL-8 levels at 18 hours after the procedure (P < .001) were significant predictors of longer systemic PFS.Moreover, a dose-response pattern was evident between posttreatment serum cytokine concentrations and systemic PFS.CONCLUSIONS: Immunoembolization induced more robust inflammatory responses, which correlated with the delayed progression of extrahepatic systemic metastases.",1,1,1,1
22366983,"The effect of the neutrophil elastase inhibitor sivelestat on early injury after liver resection.BACKGROUND: The effects of sivelestat on endotoxin-induced lung injury, postperfusion lung injury, and ischemia-reperfusion are known, yet the benefits of sivelestat during liver surgery have yet to be elucidated.The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of sivelestat, with a focus on postoperative chemical data, in hepatectomized patients.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective clinical study was conducted in 50 patients undergoing hepatic resection.Patients were randomly assigned to receive Elaspol, sivelestat (ELP group, n = 25) or placebo (control group, n = 25).Perioperative blood chemistry values in both groups, including high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and interleukin (IL)-6, were monitored.RESULTS: The HMGB1 levels increased immediately after the operation (from the intraoperative period to the second postoperative day [POD]) in the control group.Compared to the control group, the levels of HMGB1 in the ELP group were significantly suppressed by the perioperative administration of sivelestat.At POD 1, the levels of IL-6 in the ELP group decreased more rapidly than those before the operation compared to the control group.CONCLUSIONS: A human clinical study demonstrated the effect of polymorphonuclear leukocyte elastase inhibitor on the earliest markers of liver injury.The present study showed that patients who received sivelestat had reduced release of HMGB1, and that IL-6 levels decreased more rapidly in patients treated with sivelestat than in those who received the placebo.The most appropriate dose, timing, and duration of sivelestat in humans remain unclear; however, it may have therapeutic potential for various liver injuries.",0,0,0,0

24123482,"Mediators of physical exercise for improvement in cancer survivors' quality of life.OBJECTIVE: Mediating mechanisms of a 12-week group-based exercise intervention on cancer survivors' quality of life (QoL) were examined to inform future exercise intervention development.METHODS: Two hundred nine cancer survivors >/= 3 months posttreatment (57% breast cancer) aged 49.5 (+/- 10.4) years were assigned to physical exercise (n = 147) or wait-list control (n = 62).QoL, fatigue, emotional distress, physical activity, general self-efficacy and mastery were assessed at baseline and post-intervention using questionnaires.Path analysis was conducted using Mplus to explore whether improved physical activity, general self-efficacy and mastery mediated the effects of exercise on fatigue and distress and consequently QoL. RESULTS: The intervention was associated with increased physical activity (beta = 0.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.14;0.59), general self-efficacy (beta = 2.41, 95%CI = 0.35;4.73), and mastery (beta = 1.75, 95%CI = 0.36;2.78).Further, the intervention had both a direct effect on fatigue (beta = -1.09, 95%CI = -2.12;0.01), and an indirect effect (beta = -0.54, 95%CI = -1.00;-0.21) via physical activity (beta = -0.29, 95%CI = -0.64;-0.07) and general self-efficacy (beta = -0.25, 95%CI = -0.61;-0.05).The intervention had a borderline significant direct effect on reduced distress (beta = -1.32, 95%CI = -2.68;0.11), and a significant indirect effect via increased general self-efficacy and mastery (beta = -1.06, 95%CI = -1.89;-0.38).Reductions in fatigue (beta = -1.33, 95%CI =-1.85;-0.83) and distress (beta = -0.86, 95%CI = -1.25;-0.52) were associated with improved QoL. Further, increased physical activity was directly associated with improved QoL (beta = 3.37, 95%CI = 1.01;5.54).CONCLUSION: The beneficial effect of group-based physical exercise on QoL was mediated by increased physical activity, general self-efficacy and mastery, and subsequent reductions in fatigue and distress.In addition to physical activity, future interventions should target self-efficacy and mastery.This may lead to reduced distress and fatigue, and consequently improved QoL of cancer survivors.",1,1,0,0

Primary end-point was mortality; secondary end-points were morbidity, readmission and reoperation rate.Limitations are: it is a single-center experience; it is not double-blind, with the intrinsic risk of intentional or unconscious bias; exclusion criteria because of ""non-compliance"" may be considered arbitrary.RESULTS: Mortality was 0.89 % in ""Ultra"" E.R.A.S. group and 0.59 % in Classic E.R.A.S. (p = 0.571).Morbidity was 34.1 % for ""Ultra"" E.R.A.S. arm and 35.4 % for Classic E.R.A.S. (p = 0.753).Readmissions were 5.6 % for ""Ultra"" E.R.A.S. and 5.9 % for Classic E.R.A.S. (p = 0.359).Reoperation rate was 3.8 % for ""Ultra"" ERAS and 4.7 % for Classic E.R.A.S. (p = 0.713).Multivariate regression analyses using Cox's proportional hazard model showed that mortality (primary end-point), morbidity, reoperation and readmission (secondary end-points) were not significantly influenced by the two different perioperative regimens; conversely, the global cost of ""Ultra"" E.R.A.S. regimen was more economically effective.CONCLUSION: ""Ultra"" E.R.A.S. showed to be safe, actual and effective; discharge on postoperative day 2 after the first flatus passage, in the absence of complication-related symptoms, should be actively considered in a modern, multidisciplinary, multimodal laparoscopic management of colonic cancer.",0,0,0,0
22511495,"High-dose imatinib induction followed by standard-dose maintenance in pre-treated chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia patients--final analysis of a randomized, multicenter, phase III trial.BACKGROUND: Previous data suggest that the response of chronic myeloid leukemia cells to imatinib is dose-dependent.The potential benefit of initial dose intensification of imatinib in pre-treated patients with chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia remains unknown.DESIGN AND METHODS: Two hundred and twenty-seven pre-treated patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase were randomly assigned to continuous treatment with a standard dose of imatinib (400 mg/day; n=113) or to 6 months of high-dose induction with imatinib (800 mg/day) followed by a standard dose of imatinib as maintenance therapy (n=114).RESULTS: The rates of major and complete cytogenetic responses were significantly higher in the high-dose arm than in the standard-dose arm at both 3 and 6 months (major cytogenetic responses: 36.8% versus 21.2%, P=0.01 and 50.0% versus 34.5%, P=0.018; complete cytogenetic responses: 22.8% versus 6.2%, P<0.001 and 40.4% versus 16.8%, P<0.001) on the basis of an intention-to-treat analysis.At 12 months, the difference between treatment arms remained statistically significant for complete cytogenetic responses (40.4% versus 24.8%, P=0.012) but not for major cytogenetic responses (49.1% versus 44.2%, P=0.462).The rate of major molecular responses was also significantly better at 3 and 6 months in the high-dose arm (month 3: 14.9% versus 3.5%, P=0.003; month 6: 32.5% versus 8.8%, P<0.001).Overall and progression-free survival rates were comparable between arms, but event-free survival was significantly worse in the high-dose arm (P=0.014).CONCLUSIONS: Standard-dose imatinib remains the standard of care for pre-treated patients with chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT00327262).",1,1,1,1
25611313,"Paclitaxel/carboplatin with or without belinostat as empiric first-line treatment for patients with carcinoma of unknown primary site: A randomized, phase 2 trial.BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of belinostat, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, when added to paclitaxel/carboplatin in the empiric first-line treatment of patients with carcinoma of unknown primary site (CUP).METHODS: In this randomized phase 2 trial, previously untreated patients with CUP were randomized to receive belinostat plus paclitaxel/carboplatin (group A) or paclitaxel/carboplatin alone (group B) repeated every 21 days.Patients were re-evaluated every 2 cycles, and those without disease progression continued treatment for 6 cycles.Patients in group A then continued receiving single-agent belinostat, whereas patients in group B stopped treatment.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS): The authors postulated that the addition of belinostat would improve PFS from 5 months (expected with paclitaxel/carboplatin) to 8 months.RESULTS: In total, 89 patients were randomized (group A, n = 44; group B, n = 45), and the demographics and disease characteristics were balanced between the 2 groups.The addition of belinostat to paclitaxel/carboplatin did not improve PFS (group A, 5.4 months [95% confidence interval, 3.0-6.0 months]; group B, 5.3 months [95% confidence interval, 2.8-6.6 months]; P = .85).Overall survival was 12.4 months for group A versus 9.1 months for group B (P = .20).The response rate favored the belinostat group (45% vs 21%; P = .02).Belinostat resulted in a modest increase in treatment toxicity.CONCLUSIONS: The addition of belinostat to paclitaxel/carboplatin did not improve the PFS of patients with CUP who were receiving first-line therapy, although the patients who received belinostat had a higher investigator-assessed response rate.Future trials in CUP should focus on specific subsets, defined either by the predicted tissue of origin or by the identification of targetable molecular abnormalities.",0,0,0,0
25287137,"Impact of a mindfulness stress management program on stress, anxiety, depression and quality of life in women with polycystic ovary syndrome: a randomized controlled trial.Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder with a significant psychological burden throughout the life course of affected women.Thus, use of mindful awareness may be beneficial as an adjunct to conventional medical management of women with PCOS.A randomized, controlled trial was conducted at the Evgenideion Hospital of the Athens University Medical School to explore the impact of an 8-week mindfulness stress management program on measures of depression, anxiety and stress as well as on the quality of life in reproductive age women with PCOS.The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee.Twenty-three and 15 women with PCOS were randomly allocated to the intervention or control group, respectively.All participants were administered DASS21, PSS-14, PCOSQ, Daily Life and General Life Satisfaction Questionnaires and provided three-timed daily samples of salivary cortisol, before and after the intervention.Intervention group participants were provided with the Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire at the day of enrolment, to check for possible placebo effect on the outcome.Post-intervention, between-group results revealed statistically significant reductions in stress, depressive and anxiety symptoms, as well as in salivary cortisol concentrations, along with an increase in Life Satisfaction and Quality of Life scores in the intervention group only.There was no significant ""placebo"" effect on the outcome measures.Mindfulness techniques seem promising in ameliorating stress, anxiety, depression and the quality of life in women with PCOS and could be used as an adjunct method to the conventional management of these women.",0,0,0,0

27118453,"Minimal residual disease monitoring and immune profiling in multiple myeloma in elderly patients.The value of minimal residual disease (MRD) in multiple myeloma (MM) has been more frequently investigated in transplant-eligible patients than in elderly patients.Because an optimal balance between treatment efficacy and toxicity is of utmost importance in patients with elderly MM, sensitive MRD monitoring might be particularly valuable in this patient population.Here, we used second-generation 8-color multiparameter-flow cytometry (MFC) to monitor MRD in 162 transplant-ineligible MM patients enrolled in the PETHEMA/GEM2010MAS65 study.The transition from first- to second-generation MFC resulted in increased sensitivity and allowed us to identify 3 patient groups according to MRD levels: MRD negative (<10(-5); n = 54, 34%), MRD positive (between <10(-4) and >/=10(-5); n = 20, 12%), and MRD positive (>/=10(-4); n = 88, 54%).MRD status was an independent prognostic factor for time to progression (TTP) (hazard ratio [HR], 2.7; P = .007) and overall survival (OS) (HR, 3.1; P = .04), with significant benefit for MRD-negative patients (median TTP not reached, 70% OS at 3 years), and similar poorer outcomes for cases with MRD levels between <10(-4) and >/=10(-5) vs >/=10(-4) (both with a median TTP of 15 months; 63% and 55% OS at 3 years, respectively).Furthermore, MRD negativity significantly improved TTP of patients >75 years (HR, 4.8; P < .001), as well as those with high-risk cytogenetics (HR, 12.6; P = .01).Using second-generation MFC, immune profiling concomitant to MRD monitoring also contributed to identify patients with poor, intermediate, and favorable outcomes (25%, 61%, and 100% OS at 3 years, respectively; P = .01), the later patients being characterized by an increased compartment of mature B cells.Our results show that similarly to transplant candidates, MRD monitoring is one of the most relevant prognostic factors in elderly MM patients, irrespectively of age or cytogenetic risk.This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT01237249.",0,0,0,0
23957945,"Initial biopsy Gleason score as a predictive marker for survival benefit in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with docetaxel: data from the TAX327 study.BACKGROUND: Since 2004, docetaxel has been the standard first-line systemic therapy for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).With abiraterone recently becoming available in the predocetaxel setting, it is warranted to identify subgroups of patients who may obtain the greatest benefit from docetaxel and particularly qualify for receiving docetaxel as first-line treatment for mCRPC.OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify factors that could characterize subgroups of patients who obtain the greatest benefit from the use of docetaxel.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: TAX327 was multinational, randomized, phase 3 study that was conducted from 2000 to 2002 in 1006 men with mCRPC.INTERVENTION: Patients were randomized to receive docetaxel every 3 wk (D3), weekly docetaxel (D1), or mitoxantrone every 3 wk (M3), each with prednisone.OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: We investigated whether patients with poorly differentiated tumors (Gleason score >/=7) at diagnosis had greater benefit from D3 compared with M3 than patients with better differentiated tumors (Gleason score </=6).Using a Cox model, we compared overall survival (OS) between the treatment groups within each subgroup of Gleason score.RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: The TAX 327 data showed that the OS benefit of D3 versus M3 was greater in patients with high-grade tumors (median OS: 18.9 vs 14.5 mo; p=0.009) than in patients with low-grade tumors (median OS: 21.6 vs 20.7 mo; p=0.674).Limitations of a retrospective analysis apply.CONCLUSIONS: The survival benefit obtained with docetaxel is most pronounced in patients with high-Gleason-score tumors (Gleason >/=7).In a time of shifting paradigms in mCRPC, with abiraterone becoming available prior to docetaxel chemotherapy, Gleason score may help in selecting patients who obtain the greatest benefit from docetaxel as first-line treatment for mCRPC.Prospective validation of these findings is warranted.",1,1,1,1

23008288,"Association between circulating tumor cells and prognosis in patients with stage III melanoma with sentinel lymph node metastasis in a phase III international multicenter trial.PURPOSE: The outcomes of patients with melanoma who have sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastases can be highly variable, which has precluded establishment of consensus regarding treatment of the group.The detection of high-risk patients from this clinical setting may be helpful for determination of both prognosis and management.We report the utility of multimarker reverse-transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) detection of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in patients with melanoma diagnosed with SLN metastases in a phase III, international, multicenter clinical trial.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Blood specimens were collected from patients with melanoma (n = 331) who were clinically disease-free after complete lymphadenectomy (CLND) before entering onto a randomized adjuvant melanoma vaccine plus bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) versus BCG placebo trial from 30 melanoma centers (United States and international).Blood was assessed using a verified multimarker RT-qPCR assay (MART-1, MAGE-A3, and GalNAc-T) of melanoma-associated proteins.Cox regression analyses were used to evaluate the prognostic significance of CTC status for disease recurrence and melanoma-specific survival (MSS).RESULTS: Individual CTC biomarker detection ranged from 13.4% to 17.5%.There was no association of CTC status (zero to one positive biomarkers v two or more positive biomarkers) with known clinical or pathologic prognostic variables.However, two or more positive biomarkers was significantly associated with worse distant metastasis disease-free survival (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.13, P = .009) and reduced recurrence-free survival (HR = 1.70, P = .046) and MSS (HR = 1.88, P = .043) in a multivariable analysis.CONCLUSION: CTC biomarker status is a prognostic factor for recurrence-free survival, distant metastasis disease-free survival, and MSS after CLND in patients with SLN metastasis.This multimarker RT-qPCR analysis may therefore be useful in discriminating patients who may benefit from aggressive adjuvant therapy or stratifying patients for adjuvant clinical trials.",0,0,0,0
24076063,"Neoadjuvant treatment of endometrial cancer using anastrozole: a randomised pilot study.OBJECTIVE: Excessive oestrogenic stimulation is a well-known risk factor for the development and progression of endometrial cancer.Aromatase is the key enzyme which catalyses the conversion of androgens to oestrogens in postmenopausal women.Inhibition of aromatase may therefore be a useful strategy in the management of endometrial cancer.A pilot study was designed to assess the feasibility of a neoadjuvant model and understand the biological effects of anastrozole, an aromatase inhibitor, in the treatment of endometrial cancer.METHODS: Patients with endometrial cancer who consented to participate in the study were randomised to receive anastrozole or placebo for a minimum of 14 days prior to definitive surgery.Endometrial samples were obtained before and after treatment.Immunohistochemistry was performed to ascertain the expression of oestrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha), progesterone receptor (PR), androgen receptor (AR), ki-67 and Bcl2 before and after treatment in glands and stroma of the endometrium.RESULTS: A total of 16 patients were randomised to the anastrozole arm and 8 to the placebo arm (2:1 randomisation).A significant decrease in the glandular expression of ERalpha and AR was observed in the anastrozole arm.There was no significant change in the expression of PR or Bcl2.Expression of ki-67, a proliferation marker, also decreased significantly following treatment with anastrozole.CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with anastrozole caused a significant decrease in proliferation as demonstrated by decreased ki-67 expression.A large randomised controlled trial is warranted to fully assess the role of anastrozole in the neoadjuvant treatment of endometrial cancer.",1,1,1,1

26438237,"The effects of short-term fasting on tolerance to (neo) adjuvant chemotherapy in HER2-negative breast cancer patients: a randomized pilot study.BACKGROUND: Preclinical evidence shows that short-term fasting (STF) protects healthy cells against side effects of chemotherapy and makes cancer cells more vulnerable to it.This pilot study examines the feasibility of STF and its effects on tolerance of chemotherapy in a homogeneous patient group with early breast cancer (BC).METHODS: Eligible patients had HER2-negative, stage II/III BC.Women receiving (neo)-adjuvant TAC (docetaxel/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide) were randomized to fast 24 h before and after commencing chemotherapy, or to eat according to the guidelines for healthy nutrition.Toxicity in the two groups was compared.Chemotherapy-induced DNA damage in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was quantified by the level of gamma-H2AX analyzed by flow cytometry.RESULTS: Thirteen patients were included of whom seven were randomized to the STF arm.STF was well tolerated.Mean erythrocyte- and thrombocyte counts 7 days post-chemotherapy were significantly higher (P = 0.007, 95 % CI 0.106-0.638 and P = 0.00007, 95 % CI 38.7-104, respectively) in the STF group compared to the non-STF group.Non-hematological toxicity did not differ between the groups.Levels of gamma-H2AX were significantly increased 30 min post-chemotherapy in CD45 + CD3- cells in non-STF, but not in STF patients.CONCLUSIONS: STF during chemotherapy was well tolerated and reduced hematological toxicity of TAC in HER2-negative BC patients.Moreover, STF may reduce a transient increase in, and/or induce a faster recovery of DNA damage in PBMCs after chemotherapy.Larger studies, investigating a longer fasting period, are required to generate more insight into the possible benefits of STF during chemotherapy.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01304251 , March 2011.",1,1,1,1

23532629,"Erythropoietin treatment in chemotherapy-induced anemia in previously untreated advanced esophagogastric cancer patients.BACKGROUND: The impact of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents in chemotherapy-induced anemia has been a constant topic of debate over recent years.We prospectively assessed the efficacy of epoetin beta (Epo-b) in improving hemoglobin (Hb) levels and outcome in patients within an open label, randomized clinical phase II trial with advanced or metastatic gastric/esophagogastric cancer.METHODS: Previously untreated patients were randomized to receive 3-weekly cycles of capecitabine (1000 mg/m(2) bid) for 14 days plus on day 1 either irinotecan 250 mg/m(2) or cisplatin 80 mg/m(2).Epo-b (30000 IU once weekly) was initiated in patients with Hb <11 g/dl and continued until Hb >/=12 g/dl was reached.If after 4 weeks the Hb increase was <0.5 g/dl, Epo-b was increased to 30000 IU, twice weekly.RESULTS: Of 118 patients enrolled, 32 received Epo-b treatment; of these, 65 % achieved an increase in Hb levels of at least 2 g/dl, with 74 % achieving the target Hb of >/=12 g/dl.Within the study population, patients receiving Epo-b showed better overall survival (median 14.5 vs. 8.0 months, P = 0.056) as well as a significantly improved disease control rate (78 vs. 55 %, P = 0.025).Patients in the irinotecan group profited significantly (P < 0.05) in terms of progression-free survival and overall survival under Epo-b treatment (median 6.5 vs 4.1 months and median 15.4 vs 8.4 months, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: Epo-b was effective in raising Hb levels in patients with advanced esophagogastric cancer.Patients receiving Epo-b had a significantly increased response to chemotherapy and a clear trend to improved survival.",1,1,1,1
25881805,"The Impact of Husbands' Prostate Cancer Diagnosis and Participation in a Behavioral Lifestyle Intervention on Spouses' Lives and Relationships With Their Partners.BACKGROUND: A prostate cancer diagnosis affects the patient and his spouse.Partners of cancer patients are often the first to respond to the demands related to their husband's illness and thus are likely to be the most supportive individuals available to the patients.It is therefore important to examine how spouses react and handle their husband's prostate cancer diagnosis.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore how the prostate cancer diagnosis and the participation in their partners' behavioral lifestyle intervention program influenced the spouses' life, their relationship with their partner, and how they handle the situation.METHODS: Interviews were recorded with 8 spouses of potential low-risk prostate cancer patients on active surveillance as part of a clinical self-management lifestyle trial.RESULTS: We identified 3 phases that the spouses went through: feeling insecure about their situation, coping strategies to deal with these insecurities, and feeling reassured.CONCLUSIONS: The framework of a clinical trial should include mobilizing spousal empowerment so that they can take on an active and meaningful role in relation to their husband's disease.The observations here substantiate that the framework of active surveillance in combination with a lifestyle intervention in 1 specific prostate cancer clinical trial can mobilize spousal empowerment.IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Creating well-designed clinical patient programs that actively involve the spouse appears to promote empowerment (meaning, self-efficacy, positive impact, and self-determination) in spouses.Spousal participation in clinical patient programs can give spouses relief from anxieties while recognizing them as a vital support for their husband.",0,0,0,0

23374147,"Immunomodulatory effects of total intravenous and balanced inhalation anesthesia in patients with bladder cancer undergoing elective radical cystectomy: preliminary results.BACKGROUND: Although surgery and anesthesia induce immunesuppression, remains largely unknown whether various anesthetic techniques have different immunosuppressive effects on cancer patients.Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the influence of total intravenous anesthesia with target-controlled infusion (TIVA-TCI) and balanced inhalation anesthesia (BAL) on the peri-operative levels of inflammatory cytokines and regulatory T cells (Tregs) in patients with bladder cancer undergoing surgery.METHODS: Twenty eight consecutive patients with bladder cancer who underwent radical cystectomy were prospectively randomized into two groups to receive TIVA-TCI (n = 14) or BAL (n = 14).Before the induction of anesthesia (T0), 6-8 hours (T1) post-surgery, and 5 days post-surgery (T2), Tregs and serum levels of interleukin -1beta (IL-1beta), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin -2 (IL-2), interleukin -6 (IL-6), and interleukin -10 (IL-10) were measured.RESULTS: In the peri-operative period all cancer patients showed a marked and significant increase in IL-6.Moreover, TIVA-TCI patients also showed a higher increase in IFN-gamma, whereas in BAL patients Tregs were reduced by approximately 30% during surgery.The incidence of infections, metastases, and death was similar in both groups.CONCLUSIONS: The increase in the Th1 response in the TIVA-TCI group and the reduction in Tregs in the BAL group seem to balance the immunosuppressive effect induced by IL-6.Therefore TIVA-TCI and BAL can be both used in major surgery in patients with bladder cancer without worsening the outcome.",0,0,0,0
22540955,"The impact of routine open nonsuction drainage on fluid accumulation after thyroid surgery: a prospective randomised clinical trial.BACKGROUND: Thyroid drains following thyroid surgery are routinely used despite minimal supportive evidence.Our aim in this study is to determine the impact of routine open drainage of the thyroid bed postoperatively on ultrasound-determined fluid accumulation at 24 hours.METHODS: We conducted a prospective randomised clinical trial on patients undergoing thyroid surgery.Patients were randomly assigned to a drain group (n = 49) or a no-drain group (n = 44) immediately prior to wound closure.Patients underwent a neck ultrasound on day 1 and day 2 postoperatively.After surgery, we evaluated visual analogue scale pain scores, postoperative analgesic requirements, self-reported scar satisfaction at 6 weeks and complications.RESULTS: There was significantly less mean fluid accumulated in the drain group on both day 1, 16.4 versus 25.1 ml (P-value = 0.005), and day 2, 18.4 versus 25.7 ml (P-value = 0.026), following surgery.We found no significant differences between the groups with regard to length of stay, scar satisfaction, visual analogue scale pain score and analgesic requirements.There were four versus one wound infections in the drain versus no-drain groups.This finding was not statistically significant (P = 0.154).No life-threatening bleeds occurred in either group.CONCLUSIONS: Fluid accumulation after thyroid surgery was significantly lessened by drainage.However, this study did not show any clinical benefit associated with this finding in the nonemergent setting.Drains themselves showed a trend indicating that they may augment infection rates.The results of this study suggest that the frequency of acute life-threatening bleeds remains extremely low following abandoning drains.We advocate abandoning routine use of thyroid drains.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN94715414.",0,0,0,0
25014687,"Lanreotide in metastatic enteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.BACKGROUND: Somatostatin analogues are commonly used to treat symptoms associated with hormone hypersecretion in neuroendocrine tumors; however, data on their antitumor effects are limited.METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational study of the somatostatin analogue lanreotide in patients with advanced, well-differentiated or moderately differentiated, nonfunctioning, somatostatin receptor-positive neuroendocrine tumors of grade 1 or 2 (a tumor proliferation index [on staining for the Ki-67 antigen] of <10%) and documented disease-progression status.The tumors originated in the pancreas, midgut, or hindgut or were of unknown origin.Patients were randomly assigned to receive an extended-release aqueous-gel formulation of lanreotide (Autogel [known in the United States as Depot], Ipsen) at a dose of 120 mg (101 patients) or placebo (103 patients) once every 28 days for 96 weeks.The primary end point was progression-free survival, defined as the time to disease progression (according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.0) or death.Secondary end points included overall survival, quality of life (assessed with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer questionnaires QLQ-C30 and QLQ-GI.NET21), and safety.RESULTS: Most patients (96%) had no tumor progression in the 3 to 6 months before randomization, and 33% had hepatic tumor volumes greater than 25%.Lanreotide, as compared with placebo, was associated with significantly prolonged progression-free survival (median not reached vs. median of 18.0 months, P<0.001 by the stratified log-rank test; hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.47; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.30 to 0.73).The estimated rates of progression-free survival at 24 months were 65.1% (95% CI, 54.0 to 74.1) in the lanreotide group and 33.0% (95% CI, 23.0 to 43.3) in the placebo group.The therapeutic effect in predefined subgroups was generally consistent with that in the overall population, with the exception of small subgroups in which confidence intervals were wide.There were no significant between-group differences in quality of life or overall survival.The most common treatment-related adverse event was diarrhea (in 26% of the patients in the lanreotide group and 9% of those in the placebo group).CONCLUSIONS: Lanreotide was associated with significantly prolonged progression-free survival among patients with metastatic enteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors of grade 1 or 2 (Ki-67 <10%).(Funded by Ipsen; CLARINET ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00353496; EudraCT 2005-004904-35.).",0,0,0,0
22306907,"Autologous cytokine-induced killer cell transfusion in combination with gemcitabine plus cisplatin regimen chemotherapy for metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma.In this study, we evaluate the efficacy of autologous cytokine-induced killer cells (CIK) transfusion used in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin (GC) chemotherapy to treat nasopharyngeal carcinoma in patients with distant metastasis after radiotherapy.From September 2007 to August 2008, 60 patients with distant metastasis after radiotherapy were followed up and were randomly divided into 2 groups.The 30 patients in the GC+CIK group were treated with adoptive autologous CIK cell transfusion in combination with GC chemotherapy; the 30 patients in the GC group were treated with chemotherapy alone.Short-term efficacy evaluation revealed that in the GC+CIK group, there were 3 cases of complete remission, 18 cases of partial remission, 2 cases of stabilization of disease, and 7 cases of progression of disease and the total effective rate was 70% (21/30).In the GC group, there were 0 cases of complete remission, 14 cases of partial remission, 3 case of stable disease, and 13 cases of progressive disease and the total effective rate was 46.7% (14/21).Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that the overall survival of the GC+CIK group was higher than that of the GC group, but the difference was not significant (P=0.1374, log-rank test).However, the progression-free survival of the GC+CIK group was significantly higher than that of the GC group (P=0.0234, log-rank test).Thus, our study indicated that CIK cell transfusion therapy used in combination with GC chemotherapy may be a more effective treatment for postradiotherapy distant metastasis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients.",1,1,1,1
24504441,"Functional and symptom impact of trametinib versus chemotherapy in BRAF V600E advanced or metastatic melanoma: quality-of-life analyses of the METRIC study.BACKGROUND: In a randomized phase III study, trametinib prolonged progression-free survival and improved overall survival versus chemotherapy in patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients' quality of life (QOL) was assessed at baseline and follow-up visits using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core QOL questionnaire.RESULTS: In the primary efficacy population (BRAF V600E+, no brain metastases) from baseline to weeks 6 and 12, patients' global health status scores worsened by 4-5 points with chemotherapy but improved by 2-3 points with trametinib.Rapid and substantive reductions in QOL functionality (e.g. role functioning, 8-11 points at weeks 6 and 12) and symptom exacerbation (e.g. fatigue, 4-8 points; nausea and vomiting, 5 points, both at weeks 6 and 12) were observed in chemotherapy-treated patients.In contrast, trametinib-treated patients reported small improvements or slight worsening from baseline at week 12, depending on the functional dimension and symptom.The mean symptom-scale scores for chemotherapy-treated patients increased from baseline (symptoms worsened) for seven of eight symptoms at week 6 (except insomnia) and six of eight symptoms at week 12 (except dyspnea and insomnia).In contrast, at weeks 6 and 12, the mean symptom-scale scores for trametinib decreased from baseline (symptoms improved) for pain (11-12 points), insomnia (10-12 points), and appetite loss (1-5 points), whereas those for diarrhea worsened (15-16 points).Mixed-model repeated-measures analyses showed significant (P < 0.05) and/or clinically meaningful improvements (small to moderate) from baseline in favor of trametinib for global health; physical, role, and social functioning; fatigue; pain; insomnia; nausea and vomiting; constipation; dyspnea; and appetite at weeks 6 and/or 12.QOL results for the intent-to-treat population were consistent.CONCLUSIONS: This first QOL assessment for a MEK inhibitor in metastatic melanoma demonstrated that trametinib was associated with less functional impairment, smaller declines in health status, and less exacerbation of symptoms versus chemotherapy.",0,0,0,0
28111430,"Incorporating Erlotinib or Irinotecan Plus Cisplatin into Chemoradiotherapy for Stage III Non-small Cell Lung Cancer According to EGFR Mutation Status.PURPOSE: Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) is the standard care for stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients; however, a more effective regimen is needed to improve the outcome by better controlling occult metastases.We conducted two parallel randomized phase II studies to incorporate erlotinib or irinotecan-cisplatin (IP) into CCRT for stage III NSCLC depending on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation status.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with EGFR-mutant tumors were randomized to receive three cycles of erlotinib first and then either CCRT with erlotinib followed by erlotinib (arm A) or CCRT with IP only (arm B).Patients with EGFR unknown or wild-type tumors were randomized to receive either three cycles of IP before (arm C) or after CCRT with IP (arm D).RESULTS: Seventy-three patients were screened and the study was closed early because of slow accrual after 59 patients were randomized.Overall, there were seven patients in arm A, five in arm B, 22 in arm C, and 25 in arm D. The response rate was 71.4% and 80.0% for arm A and B, and 70.0% and 73.9% for arm C and D. The median overall survival (OS) was 39.3 months versus 31.2 months for arm A and B (p=0.442), and 16.3 months versus 25.3 months for arm C and D (p=0.050).Patients with sensitive EGFR mutations had significantly longer OS than EGFR-wild patients (74.8 months vs. 25.3 months, p=0.034).There were no unexpected toxicities.CONCLUSION: Combined-modality treatment by molecular diagnostics is feasible in stage III NSCLC.EGFR-mutant patients appear to be a distinct subset with longer survival.",1,1,1,1

27022118,"Intracranial Efficacy of Crizotinib Versus Chemotherapy in Patients With Advanced ALK-Positive Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer: Results From PROFILE 1014.PURPOSE: Intracranial efficacy of first-line crizotinib versus chemotherapy was compared prospectively in the phase III PROFILE 1014 study in ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive crizotinib (250 mg twice daily; n = 172) or chemotherapy (pemetrexed 500 mg/m(2) plus cisplatin 75 mg/m(2) or carboplatin at area under the curve 5 to 6, every 3 weeks for </= six cycles; n = 171).Patients with stable treated brain metastases (tBM) were eligible.Intracranial efficacy was assessed at baseline and every 6 or 12 weeks in patients with or without known brain metastases (BM), respectively; intracranial time to tumor progression (IC-TTP; per protocol) and intracranial disease control rate (IC-DCR; post hoc) were measured.The intent-to-treat population was also assessed.RESULTS: Of 343 patients in the intent-to-treat population, 23% had tBM at baseline.A nonsignificant IC-TTP improvement was observed with crizotinib in the intent-to-treat population (hazard ratio [HR], 0.60; P = .069), patients with tBM (HR, 0.45; P = .063), and patients without BM (HR, 0.69; P = .323).Among patients with tBM, IC-DCR was significantly higher with crizotinib versus chemotherapy at 12 weeks (85% v 45%, respectively; P < .001) and 24 weeks (56% v 25%, respectively; P = .006).Progression-free survival was significantly longer with crizotinib versus chemotherapy in both subgroups (tBM present: HR, 0.40; P < .001; median, 9.0 v 4.0 months, respectively; BM absent: HR, 0.51; P < .001; median, 11.1 v 7.2 months, respectively) and in the intent-to-treat population (HR, 0.45; P < .001; median, 10.9 v 7.0 months, respectively).CONCLUSION: Compared with chemotherapy, crizotinib demonstrated a significantly higher IC-DCR in patients with tBM.Improvements in IC-TTP were not statistically significant in patients with or without tBM, although sensitivity to detect treatment differences in or between the two subgroups was low.",1,1,1,1
27951450,"Dose-dense adjuvant chemotherapy in premenopausal breast cancer patients: A pooled analysis of the MIG1 and GIM2 phase III studies.BACKGROUND: No evidence exists to recommend a specific chemotherapy regimen in young breast cancer patients.We performed a pooled analysis of two randomised clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of adjuvant dose-dense chemotherapy in premenopausal breast cancer patients and its impact on the risk of treatment-induced amenorrhoea.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the MIG1 study, node-positive or high-risk node-negative patients were randomised to 6 cycles of fluorouracil/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide every 2 (dose-dense) or 3 (standard-interval) weeks.In the GIM2 study, node-positive patients were randomised to 4 cycles of dose-dense or standard-interval EC or FEC followed by 4 cycles of dose-dense or standard-interval paclitaxel.Using individual patient data, the hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival by means of a Cox proportional hazards model and the odds ratio for treatment-induced amenorrhoea through a logistic regression model were calculated for each study.A meta-analysis of the two studies was performed using the random effect model to compute the parameter estimates.RESULTS: A total of 1,549 patients were included.Dose-dense chemotherapy was associated with a significant improved overall survival as compared to standard-interval chemotherapy (HR, 0.71; 95% confidence intervals [CI], 0.54-0.95; p = 0.021).The pooled HRs were 0.78 (95% CI, 0.54-1.12) and 0.65 (95% CI, 0.40-1.06) for patients with hormone receptor-positive and -negative tumours, respectively (interaction p = 0.330).No increased risk of treatment-induced amenorrhoea was observed with dose-dense chemotherapy (odds ratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.80-1.25; p = 0.989).CONCLUSION: Dose-dense adjuvant chemotherapy may be considered the preferred treatment option in high-risk premenopausal breast cancer patients.",1,1,1,1
27114605,"Response to Cetuximab With or Without Irinotecan in Patients With Refractory Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Harboring the KRAS G13D Mutation: Australasian Gastro-Intestinal Trials Group ICECREAM Study.PURPOSE: RAS mutations predict lack of response to epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody therapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), but preclinical studies and retrospective clinical data suggest that patients with tumors harboring the exon 2 KRAS G13D mutation may benefit from cetuximab.We aimed to assess cetuximab monotherapy and cetuximab plus irinotecan in patients with molecularly selected (G13D mutation) chemotherapy-refractory mCRC in a randomized phase II trial of this rare molecular subtype.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with chemotherapy-refractory KRAS G13D mutation-positive mCRC who had progressed within 6 months of irinotecan therapy were randomly assigned to cetuximab 400 mg/m(2) loading dose and then 250 mg/m(2) once per week with or without irinotecan 180 mg/m(2) once every 2 weeks.The primary end point was 6-month progression-free survival; secondary end points were response rate, overall survival, quality of life, and toxicity.RESULTS: Fifty-one of 53 patients recruited over 2 years were eligible.The 6-month progression-free survival rate was 10% (95% CI, 2% to 26%) for cetuximab versus 23% (95% CI, 9% to 40%) for cetuximab plus irinotecan with a hazard ratio of 0.74 (95% CI, 0.42 to 1.32).Response and stable disease rates were 0% and 58% for monotherapy versus 9% and 70% for combination treatment, respectively.Overall survival and quality of life were similar; toxicities were higher with combination therapy.CONCLUSION: In patients with G13D-mutated chemotherapy-refractory mCRC, there was no statistically significant improvement in disease control at 6 months with either cetuximab monotherapy or cetuximab plus irinotecan.No responses were seen with single-agent cetuximab.The responses observed with the combination of cetuximab and irinotecan may reflect true drug synergy or persistent irinotecan sensitivity.The ICECREAM (Irinotecan Cetuximab Evaluation and Cetuximab Response Evaluation Among Patients with a G13D Mutation) study demonstrates the need to prospectively evaluate hypotheses that were previously supported by retrospective analyses and exemplifies the value of international collaboration in trials of rare molecular subtypes.",1,1,1,1
25395283,"Randomized, phase III trial of figitumumab in combination with erlotinib versus erlotinib alone in patients with nonadenocarcinoma nonsmall-cell lung cancer.BACKGROUND: Figitumumab (CP-751,871) is a fully human IgG2 monoclonal antibody that inhibits the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor.This multicenter, randomized, phase III study investigated the efficacy of figitumumab plus erlotinib compared with erlotinib alone in patients with pretreated, nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients (stage IIIB/IV or recurrent disease with nonadenocarcinoma histology) who had previously received at least one platinum-based regimen were randomized to receive open-label figitumumab (20 mg/kg) plus erlotinib 150 mg/day or erlotinib alone every 3 weeks.The primary end point was overall survival (OS).RESULTS: Of 583 patients randomized, 579 received treatment.The study was closed early by an independent data safety monitoring committee due to results crossing the prespecified futility boundary.At the final analysis, median OS was 5.7 months for figitumumab plus erlotinib and 6.2 months for erlotinib alone [hazard ratio (HR) 1.09; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91-1.31; P = 0.35].Median progression-free survival was 2.1 months for figitumumab plus erlotinib and 2.6 months for erlotinib alone (HR 1.08; 95% CI 0.90-1.29; P = 0.43).Treatment-related nonfatal serious adverse events occurred in 18% and 5% of patients in the figitumumab arm or erlotinib alone arm, respectively.There were nine treatment-related deaths (three related to both drugs, four related to erlotinib alone and two related to figitumumab).CONCLUSIONS: The addition of figitumumab to erlotinib did not improve OS in patients with advanced, pretreated, nonadenocarcinoma NSCLC.Clinical development of figitumumab has been discontinued.CLINICAL TRIAL ID: NCT00673049.",1,1,1,1
24192009,"Strategies to improve repeat fecal occult blood testing cancer screening.BACKGROUND: A comparative effectiveness intervention by this team improved initial fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) rates from 3% to 53% among community clinic patients.The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and costs associated with a literacy-informed intervention on repeat FOBT testing.METHODS: Between 2008 and 2011, a three-arm quasi-experiential comparative effectiveness evaluation was conducted in eight community clinics in Louisiana.Clinics were randomly assigned to receive: enhanced care, a screening recommendation, and FOBT kit annually; a brief educational intervention where patients additionally received a literacy appropriate pamphlet and simplified FOBT instructions; or nurse support where a nurse manager provided the education and followed up with phone support.In year 2, all materials were mailed.The study consisted of 461 patients, ages 50 to 85 years, with a negative initial FOBT.RESULTS: Repeat FOBT rates were 38% enhanced care, 33% education, and 59% with nurse support (P = 0.017).After adjusting for age, race, gender, and literacy, patients receiving nurse support were 1.46 times more likely to complete repeat FOBT screening than those receiving education [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.14-1.06; P = 0.002] and 1.45 times more likely than those in enhanced care but this was not significant (95% CI, 0.93-2.26; P = 0.10).The incremental cost per additional person screened was $2,450 for nurse over enhanced care.CONCLUSION: A mailed pamphlet and FOBT with simplified instructions did not improve annual screening.IMPACT: Telephone outreach by a nurse manager was effective in improving rates of repeat FOBT, yet this may be too costly for community clinics.",0,0,0,0
24813752,"Combined coenzyme Q10 and clomiphene citrate for ovulation induction in clomiphene-citrate-resistant polycystic ovary syndrome.This prospective randomized controlled trial evaluated the effect of combined oral coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) and clomiphene citrate for ovulation induction in clomiphene-citrate-resistant polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).A total of 101 infertile women with PCOS resistant to clomiphene citrate were randomized either to combined CoQ10 and clomiphene citrate (51 patients, 82 cycles) or to clomiphene citrate alone (50 patients, 71 cycles).The outcome measures were number of follicles, serum oestradiol, serum progesterone, endometrial thickness and ovulation, clinical pregnancy and miscarriage rates.Numbers of follicles >14 mm and >/=18 mm were significantly higher in the CoQ10 group.Endometrial thickness on the day of human chorionic gonadotrophin was significantly greater in the CoQ10 group (8.82 +/- 0.27 mm versus 7.03 +/- 0.74 mm).Ovulation occurred in 54/82 cycles (65.9%) in the CoQ10 group and 11/71 cycles (15.5%) in the control group.Clinical pregnancy rate was significantly higher in the CoQ10 group (19/51, 37.3%) versus the control group (3/50, 6.0%).Combination of CoQ10 and clomiphene citrate in the treatment of clomiphene-citrate-resistant PCOS patients improves ovulation and clinical pregnancy rates.It is an effective and safe option and can be considered before gonadotrophin therapy or laparoscopic ovarian drilling.",0,0,0,0
22978687,"In thyroidectomized patients with thyroid cancer, a serum thyrotropin of 30 muU/mL after thyroxine withdrawal is not always adequate for detecting an elevated stimulated serum thyroglobulin.BACKGROUND: The thyrotropin (TSH) level or duration of thyroid hormone withdrawal (THW) required to detect stimulated thyroglobulin (Tg) in differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) monitoring is unknown.The objective of this study was to evaluate the TSH cutoff of >30 muU/mL as a means to detect stimulated Tg >/=2 ng/mL after THW (THW-Tg>/=2), and sensitivity of the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) questionnaire for detecting hypothyroid symptoms.METHODS: This was a prospective longitudinal cohort study done at a tertiary academic medical center.Forty-seven patients with DTC undergoing their first Tg stimulation or after previously abnormal Tg stimulation had weekly measurements of TSH and Tg during the 4 weeks THW, and repeated questionnaire assessments.RESULTS: TSH did not reach a plateau in any patient, and in those whose Tg did not remain undetectable, Tg continued to rise.Seventy-five percent of patients had an undetectable Tg <0.2 ng/mL at baseline (95% were <0.5 mg/mL) with 16% remaining undetectable throughout THW.The majority of patients (72.7% and 97.8%) achieved TSH >30 muU/mL by 3 and 4 weeks THW, respectively.Of the 15 patients with maximum stimulated THW-Tg>/=2, 38% were detected before the minimal TSH >30 muU/mL cutoff.At 2 weeks THW, 3 had a TSH>30 muU/mL, and none of them had Tg >/=2 ng/mL. At 3 weeks THW, 11 had a TSH >30 muU/mL, and 64% of them had Tg >/=2 ng/mL. Only 60% were detected at 3-week THW regardless of their TSH level.Eighty-six percent were detected by TSH 60-<80 muU/mL. Conversely, all patients whose serum Tg was <0.2 ng/mL when their serum TSH was >20 muU/mL did not achieve a THW-Tg>/=2.CONCLUSION: The minimal TSH cutoff of >30 muU/mL was inadequate to detect many patients with final stimulated THW-Tg>/=2 during complete THW.TSH >80-100 muU/mL was a better cutoff, achieved in only 53% after 4-week THW.Conversely, we propose a preliminary THW-stopping rule for ending THW early in selected patients.In patients with a Tg <0.2 ng/mL when TSH >20 muU/mL, all had a final stimulated Tg </=2 ng/mL, potentially saving qualifying patients 40% of THW duration compared to 4-week THW.FACIT-F correlated with TSH, but was not sensitive to detect mild hypothyroidism.",0,0,0,0
25018037,"Impact of baseline corticosteroids on survival and steroid androgens in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: exploratory analysis from COU-AA-301.BACKGROUND: Corticosteroids have been used to mitigate mineralocorticoid-related effects and restore sensitivity to abiraterone acetate.Corticosteroids may also mediate glucocorticoid receptor or mutated androgen receptor activation and adversely influence outcome.OBJECTIVE: This post hoc exploratory analysis investigated whether baseline corticosteroids were an independent prognostic factor and its level of contribution in the presence of other prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) in study COU-AA-301.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: COU-AA-301 was a randomised study of abiraterone plus prednisone versus prednisone in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients after docetaxel.INTERVENTION: Patients were randomised 2:1 to abiraterone 1000 mg plus prednisone 5mg by mouth twice daily versus prednisone.OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Association of OS with baseline corticosteroids was determined by univariate and multivariate Cox models.RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: At study entry, 33% of patients received corticosteroids, had worse disease characteristics (p<0.05 except liver metastases), and were more likely to have testosterone levels below the median (odds ratio:2.92; chi-square p<0.0001).Associations between prostate-specific antigen response as well as circulating tumour cell decline and higher baseline androgen levels were demonstrated.Patients taking baseline corticosteroids had inferior OS in univariate analysis (hazard ratio: 1.48; p<0.0001); however, in multivariate stepwise selection modelling, baseline corticosteroids did not add substantially to the model.This analysis is limited as a retrospective analysis and restricted to patients after docetaxel.CONCLUSIONS: In the COU-AA-301 study, baseline corticosteroids were associated with adverse prognostic features, inferior OS, and lower baseline androgen levels but did not add substantial information to the final prognostic model.Thus in these data from study COU-AA-301, concurrent baseline corticosteroids did not have an independent impact on OS.PATIENT SUMMARY: Baseline corticosteroids did not adversely affect abiraterone clinical benefit in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.Their use was associated with patients having worse disease characteristics.",1,1,1,1
22890582,"Oral supplementation of branched-chain amino acids reduces early recurrence after hepatic resection in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma: a prospective study.PURPOSES: The long-term outcomes of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) administration after hepatic resection in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unclear.This study assessed the effect of oral supplementation with BCAA on the development of liver tumorigenesis after hepatic resection in HCC patients.METHODS: Fifty-six patients were randomly assigned to receive either BCAA supplementation (Livact group, n = 26) or a conventional diet (Control group, n = 30).Twenty-six patients in the BCAA group were treated orally for 2 weeks before and 6 months after hepatic resection.Postoperative tumor recurrence was continuously evaluated in all patients by measuring various clinical parameters.RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the overall survival rate between the two patient groups; however, the recurrence rate at 30 months after surgery was significantly better in the Livact group in comparison to the Control group.Interestingly, the tumor markers, such as AFP and PIVKA-II, significantly decreased at 36 months after liver resection in the Livact group in comparison to the Control group.CONCLUSIONS: Oral supplementation of BCAA reduces early recurrence after hepatic resection in patients with HCC.This treatment regimen offers potential benefits for clinical use in such patients, even in cases with a well-preserved preoperative liver function.",1,1,1,1
22321061,"Effects of exemestane and tamoxifen on hormone levels within the Tamoxifen Exemestane Adjuvant Multicentre (TEAM) trial: results of a German substudy.AIM: The aim of this study was to compare the effects of exemestane and tamoxifen on hormone levels in postmenopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer within a Germany substudy of the Tamoxifen Exemestane Adjuvant Multinational (TEAM) trial.METHODS: Within the TEAM trial, patients were randomized to receive adjuvant treatment with exemestane for 5 years or tamoxifen for 2.5-3 years followed by exemestane for 2-2.5 years.Serum levels of testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and parathyroid hormone (PTH)-intact were measured at screening and after 3, 6 and 12 months of treatment.RESULTS: Data on hormone levels were available from 63 patients in the tamoxifen arm and 68 patients in the exemestane arm.Treatment with exemestane resulted in decreases from baseline in SHBG and PTH-intact levels, and increases from baseline in testosterone, DHEAS and FSH levels.Tamoxifen treatment resulted in increases from baseline in SHBG and PTH-intact, whereas levels of testosterone and FSH decreased and DHEAS levels did not change.At all time points assessed, the absolute change from baseline was significantly different between tamoxifen and exemestane for testosterone, SHBG, FSH and PTH-intact (all p < 0.0001).CONCLUSIONS: Exemestane and tamoxifen had statistically significantly different effects on hormone levels, including testosterone, SHBG, FSH and PTH-intact.",1,1,1,1
27339115,"Conventional versus hypofractionated high-dose intensity-modulated radiotherapy for prostate cancer: 5-year outcomes of the randomised, non-inferiority, phase 3 CHHiP trial.BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer might have high radiation-fraction sensitivity that would give a therapeutic advantage to hypofractionated treatment.We present a pre-planned analysis of the efficacy and side-effects of a randomised trial comparing conventional and hypofractionated radiotherapy after 5 years follow-up.METHODS: CHHiP is a randomised, phase 3, non-inferiority trial that recruited men with localised prostate cancer (pT1b-T3aN0M0).Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to conventional (74 Gy delivered in 37 fractions over 7.4 weeks) or one of two hypofractionated schedules (60 Gy in 20 fractions over 4 weeks or 57 Gy in 19 fractions over 3.8 weeks)all delivered with intensity-modulated techniques.Most patients were given radiotherapy with 3-6 months of neoadjuvant and concurrent androgen suppression.Randomisation was by computer-generated random permuted blocks, stratified by National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk group and radiotherapy treatment centre, and treatment allocation was not masked.The primary endpoint was time to biochemical or clinical failure; the critical hazard ratio (HR) for non-inferiority was 1.208.Analysis was by intention to treat.Long-term follow-up continues.The CHHiP trial is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN97182923.FINDINGS: Between Oct 18, 2002, and June 17, 2011, 3216 men were enrolled from 71 centres and randomly assigned (74 Gy group, 1065 patients; 60 Gy group, 1074 patients; 57 Gy group, 1077 patients).Median follow-up was 62.4 months (IQR 53.9-77.0).The proportion of patients who were biochemical or clinical failure free at 5 years was 88.3% (95% CI 86.0-90.2) in the 74 Gy group, 90.6% (88.5-92.3) in the 60 Gy group, and 85.9% (83.4-88.0) in the 57 Gy group.60 Gy was non-inferior to 74 Gy (HR 0.84 [90% CI 0.68-1.03], pNI=0.0018) but non-inferiority could not be claimed for 57 Gy compared with 74 Gy (HR 1.20 [0.99-1.46], pNI=0.48).Long-term side-effects were similar in the hypofractionated groups compared with the conventional group.There were no significant differences in either the proportion or cumulative incidence of side-effects 5 years after treatment using three clinician-reported as well as patient-reported outcome measures.The estimated cumulative 5 year incidence of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) grade 2 or worse bowel and bladder adverse events was 13.7% (111 events) and 9.1% (66 events) in the 74 Gy group, 11.9% (105 events) and 11.7% (88 events) in the 60 Gy group, 11.3% (95 events) and 6.6% (57 events) in the 57 Gy group, respectively.No treatment-related deaths were reported.INTERPRETATION: Hypofractionated radiotherapy using 60 Gy in 20 fractions is non-inferior to conventional fractionation using 74 Gy in 37 fractions and is recommended as a new standard of care for external-beam radiotherapy of localised prostate cancer.FUNDING: Cancer Research UK, Department of Health, and the National Institute for Health Research Cancer Research Network.",1,1,1,1
27228369,"Baseline AMH Level Associated With Ovulation Following Ovulation Induction in Women With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome.CONTEXT: Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) reduces aromatase activity and sensitivity of follicles to FSH stimulation.Therefore, elevated serum AMH may indicate a higher threshold for response to ovulation induction in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).OBJECTIVE: This study sought to determine the association between AMH levels and ovulatory response to treatment among the women enrolled into the Pregnancy in PCOS II (PPCOS II) trial.DESIGN AND SETTING: This was a secondary analysis of data from a randomized clinical trial in academic health centers throughout the United States Participants: A total of 748 women age 18-40 years, with PCOS and measured AMH levels at baseline, were included in this study.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Couples were followed for up to five treatment cycles to determine ovulation (midluteal serum progesterone > 5 ng/mL) and the dose required to achieve ovulation.RESULTS: A lower mean AMH and AMH per follicle was observed among women who ovulated compared with women who never achieved ovulation during the study (geometric mean AMH, 5.54 vs 7.35 ng/mL; P = .0001; geometric mean AMH per follicle, 0.14 vs 0.18; P = .01) after adjustment for age, body mass index, T, and insulin level.As AMH levels increased, the dose of ovulation induction medication needed to achieve ovulation also increased.No associations were observed between antral follicle count and ovulation.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that high serum AMH is associated with a reduced response to ovulation induction among women with PCOS.Women with higher AMH levels may require higher doses of medication to achieve ovulation.",0,0,0,0
28577938,"Evaluation of the VeriStrat((R)) serum protein test in patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the lung treated with second-line afatinib or erlotinib in the phase III LUX-Lung 8 study.OBJECTIVES: Identification of biomarkers associated with clinical benefit may be crucial in establishing optimal treatment choice for patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the lung after first-line chemotherapy.In this study, the ability of the VeriStrat serum protein test to predict differential clinical benefit with afatinib versus erlotinib, and the association of VeriStrat status with clinical outcomes irrespective of EGFR-TKI used, was assessed in a retrospective analysis of the phase III LUX-Lung 8 trial.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pretreatment plasma samples were analyzed using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.Spectra were evaluated to assign a VeriStrat 'Good' (VS-G) or VeriStrat 'Poor' (VS-P) classification.Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival, and other endpoints were assessed with respect to pretreatment VeriStrat status; OS was the primary efficacy variable.Outcomes with other efficacy endpoints were similar.RESULTS: Of 795 patients randomized in LUX-Lung 8, 675 were classified (VS-G: 412; VS-P: 263).In the VS-G group, OS was significantly longer with afatinib versus erlotinib (HR 0.79 [95% CI: 0.63-0.98]).In the VS-P group, there was no significant difference in OS between afatinib and erlotinib (HR 0.90 [0.70-1.16]).However, there was no interaction between VeriStrat classification and treatment group for OS (pinteraction=0.5303).OS was significantly longer in VS-G versus VS-P patients, both in the overall VeriStrat-classified population (HR 0.41 [0.35-0.49]) and afatinib-treated patients (HR 0.40 [0.31-0.51]).Multivariate analysis showed that VeriStrat was an independent predictor of OS in afatinib-treated patients, regardless of ECOG PS or best response to first-line chemotherapy.CONCLUSION: VS-G classification is strongly associated with favorable survival outcomes with either afatinib or erlotinib compared with VS-P classification.In VS-G patients, survival outcomes with afatinib are superior to those with erlotinib.VeriStrat classification may guide treatment decisions in patients with SCC of the lung.ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT01523587.",1,1,1,1
23924790,"Evaluation of ipilimumab in combination with allogeneic pancreatic tumor cells transfected with a GM-CSF gene in previously treated pancreatic cancer.Preclinical reports support the concept of synergy between cancer vaccines and immune checkpoint blockade in nonimmunogenic tumors.In particular, cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) antibodies have been successfully combined with GM-CSF cell-based vaccines (GVAX).Ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4) has been tested as a single agent in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) resulting in a delayed response at a dose of 3 mg/kg.Our study evaluated ipilimumab 10 mg/kg (arm 1) and ipilimumab 10 mg/kg + GVAX (arm 2).A total of 30 patients with previously treated advanced PDA were randomized (1:1).Induction doses were administered every 3 weeks for a total of 4 doses followed by maintenance dosing every 12 weeks.Two patients in arm 1 showed evidence of stable disease (7 and 22 wk) but none demonstrated CA19-9 biochemical responses.In contrast, 3 patients in arm 2 had evidence of prolonged disease stabilization (31, 71, and 81 wk) and 7 patients experienced CA19-9 declines.In 2 of these patients, disease stabilization occurred after an initial period of progression.The median overall survival (OS) (3.6 vs. 5.7 mo, hazards ratio: 0.51, P = 0.072) and 1 year OS (7 vs. 27%) favored arm 2.Similar to prior ipilimumab studies, 20% of patients in each arm had grade 3/4 immune-related adverse events.Among patients with OS > 4.3 months, there was an increase in the peak mesothelin-specific T cells (P = 0.014) and enhancement of the T-cell repertoire (P = 0.031).In conclusion, checkpoint blockade in combination with GVAX has the potential for clinical benefit and should be evaluated in a larger study.",0,0,0,0
22526159,"A prospective multicenter study of treosulfan in elderly patients with recurrent ovarian cancer: results of a planned safety analysis.BACKGROUND: Treosulfan, an alkylating agent, has demonstrated activity in recurrent ovarian carcinoma.It is equieffective as oral (p.o.) and intravenous (i.v.) formulation.To explore the preference and compliance of elderly patients regarding p.o. or i.v. treosulfan for the treatment of relapsed ovarian carcinoma, women aged 65 years or older were included in this prospective multicenter study.Since elderly patients usually have several concomitant diseases and experience more treatment toxicity, an interim safety analysis was planned and performed after 25 patients finished therapy to assess the tolerability of the treatment regimens.METHODS: Patients had a free choice of treosulfan i.v.(7,000 mg/m(2) day 1 of a 28-day cycle) or p.o. (600 mg/m(2) day 1-28 of a 56-day cycle) for a maximum of 12 cycles (i.v.) or 12 months (p.o.).Indecisive patients were randomized.Toxicity was evaluated according to the NCI-CTC version 2.0.RESULTS: Twenty-five of 51 recruited patients completed therapy at the time of the planned interim analysis (median age, 75 years; range, 70-82).Median ECOG was 1, and median number of prior chemotherapy regimens was 2.A median number of 4 cycles (range, 1-12) were administered per patient.Anemia was the most common hematological toxicity (88 % of patients).Most frequent non-hematological toxicities were nausea (76 %), constipation (68 %), and fatigue (64 %).CONCLUSION: Treatment was generally well tolerated despite the fact that most patients suffered from multiple comorbidities and were heavily pretreated.There were no unexpected hematological or non-hematological toxicities.Based on this safety analysis, the next step of study recruitment was continued.",0,0,0,0
25788492,"A Phase I/II Trial of BNC105P with Everolimus in Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma.PURPOSE: BNC105P inhibits tubulin polymerization, and preclinical studies suggest possible synergy with everolimus.In this phase I/II study, efficacy and safety of the combination were explored in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC).EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A phase I study in patients with clear cell mRCC and any prior number of therapies was conducted using a classical 3 + 3 design to evaluate standard doses of everolimus with increasing doses of BNC105P.At the recommended phase II dose (RP2D), patients with clear cell mRCC and one to two prior therapies (including >/= 1 VEGF-TKI) were randomized to BNC105P with everolimus (arm A) or everolimus alone (arm B).The primary endpoint of the study was 6-month progression-free survival (6MPFS).Secondary endpoints included response rate, PFS, overall survival, and exploratory biomarker analyses.RESULTS: In the phase I study (N = 15), a dose of BNC105P at 16 mg/m(2) with everolimus at 10 mg daily was identified as the RP2D.In the phase II study, 139 patients were randomized, with 69 and 67 evaluable patients in arms A and B, respectively.6MPFS was similar in the treatment arms (arm A: 33.82% vs. arm B: 30.30%, P = 0.66) and no difference in median PFS was observed (arm A: 4.7 mos vs. arm B: 4.1 mos; P = 0.49).Changes in matrix metalloproteinase-9, stem cell factor, sex hormone-binding globulin, and serum amyloid A protein were associated with clinical outcome with BNC105P.CONCLUSIONS: Although the primary endpoint was not met in an unselected population, correlative studies suggest several biomarkers that warrant further prospective evaluation.",1,1,1,1

22610153,"Extended benefit from sequential administration of docetaxel after standard fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide regimen for node-positive breast cancer: the 8-year follow-up results of the UNICANCER-PACS01 trial.PURPOSE: The initial report from the Programme Action Concertee Sein (PACS) PACS01 trial demonstrated a benefit at 5 years for disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) rates with the sequential administration of docetaxel after FEC100 (fluorouracil 500 mg/m(2), epirubicin 100 mg/m(2), and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m(2)) for patients with node-positive, operable breast cancer.We evaluate here the impact of this regimen at 8 years.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between June 1997 and March 2000, a total of 1,999 patients (age <65) with localized, resectable, non-pretreated, unilateral breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive either standard FEC100 for 6 cycles or 3 cycles of FEC100 followed by 3 cycles of 100 mg/m(2) docetaxel (FEC-D), both given every 21 days.Radiotherapy was mandatory after conservative surgery and tamoxifen was given for 5 years to hormone receptor (HR)-positive patients.Five-year DFS was the trial's main endpoint.Updated 8-year survival data are presented.RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 92.8 months, 639 patients experienced at least one event.A total number of 383 deaths were registered.Eight-year DFS rates were 65.8% with FEC alone and 70.2% with FEC-D. OS rates at 8 years were 78% with FEC alone and 83.2% with FEC-D. Cox regression analysis adjusted for age and number of positive nodes showed a 15% reduction in the relative risk of relapse and a 25% reduction in the relative risk of death in favor of FEC-D. Significant relative risk reductions were observed in the HR-positive, HER2-positive, and Ki67 >/=20% subpopulations.CONCLUSION: Benefits for DFS and OS rates with the sequential FEC-D regimen are fully confirmed at 8 years.",1,1,1,1

27589688,"Primary analysis of a prospective, randomized, single-blinded phase II trial evaluating the HER2 peptide GP2 vaccine in breast cancer patients to prevent recurrence.GP2 is a HER2-derived, HLA-A2+ restricted peptide.Phase I studies showed GP2 administered with GM-CSF to be safe and immunogenic.Here we report the primary analysis of a prospective, randomized, multicenter phase II adjuvant trial conducted to determine the vaccine's efficacy.The trial enrolled HLA-A2+, clinically disease-free, node-positive and high-risk node-negative breast cancer patients with tumors expressing HER2 (immunohistochemistry[IHC] 1+-3+).Patients were randomized to GP2+GM-CSF versus GM-CSF alone.Disease-free survival (DFS) was analyzed in intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-treatment cohorts; pre-specified subgroup analyses were performed for patients with IHC 3+ or FISH+ disease.The trial enrolled 180 patients; 89 received GP2+GM-CSF and 91 received GM-CSF alone.The groups were well-matched for clinicopathologic characteristics.Toxicities have been minimal.The Kaplan-Meier estimated 5-year DFS rate in the ITT analyses was 88% (95% CI:78-94%) in vaccinated vs. 81% (95% CI:69-89%) (P = 0.43) in control patients after a 34 month median follow-up.In the per-treatment analysis, the estimated 5-year DFS rates were 94% (95% CI:83-98%) and 85% (73-92%) (P = 0.17).In IHC 3+/FISH+ patients, the estimated 5-year DFS rate was 94% (82-98%) in vaccinated patients (n = 51) vs. 89% (71-96%) in control patients (n = 50), (P = 0.86) in the ITT analyses and 100% vs. 89% (71-96%) in vaccinated vs. control patients in the per-treatment analyses (P = 0.08).While the overall ITT analysis did not demonstrate benefit to vaccination, this trial confirmed that the GP2 vaccine is safe and suggests that vaccination may have clinical activity, particularly in patients with HER2 overexpression who received the full vaccine series (ie per-treatment group).",1,1,1,1
23850170,"Which patients benefit most from primary surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy in stage IIIC or IV ovarian cancer? An exploratory analysis of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer 55971 randomised trial.BACKGROUND: To investigate whether biomarkers consisting of baseline characteristics of advanced stage ovarian cancer patients can help in identifying subgroups of patients who would benefit more from primary surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy.METHODS: We used data of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 55971 trial in which 670 patients were randomly assigned to primary surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy.The primary outcome was overall survival.Ten baseline clinical and pathological characteristics were selected as potential biomarkers.Using Subpopulation Treatment Effect Pattern Plots (STEPP), biomarkers with a statistically significant qualitative additive interaction with treatment were considered as potentially informative for treatment selection.We also combined selected biomarkers to form a multimarker treatment selection rule.FINDINGS: The size of the largest metastatic tumour and clinical stage were significantly associated with the magnitude of the benefit from treatment, in terms of five-year survival (p for interaction: 0.008 and 0.016, respectively).Stage IIIC patients with metastatic tumours 45 mm benefited more from primary surgery while stage IV patients with metastatic tumours >45 mm benefited more from neoadjuvant chemotherapy.In stage IIIC patients with larger metastatic tumours and in stage IV patients with less extensive metastatic tumours both treatments were equally effective.We estimated that by selecting treatments for patients based on largest metastatic tumour and clinical stage, the potential five-year survival rate in the population of treated patients would be 27.3% (95% confidence interval (CI) 21.9-33.0), 7.8% higher than if all were treated with primary surgery, and 5.6% higher if all were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.INTERPRETATION: Although survival was comparable after primary surgery and neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the overall group of patients with ovarian cancer in the EORTC 55971 trial, we found in this exploratory analysis that patients with stage IIIC and less extensive metastatic tumours had higher survival with primary surgery, while patients with stage IV disease and large metastatic tumours had higher survival with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.For patients who did not meet these criteria, both treatment options led to comparable survival rates.",1,1,1,1
24081946,"Randomized multicenter phase II trial comparing two schedules of etirinotecan pegol (NKTR-102) in women with recurrent platinum-resistant/refractory epithelial ovarian cancer.PURPOSE: Etirinotecan pegol (NKTR-102) is a unique, long-acting topoisomerase-I inhibitor with prolonged systemic exposure to SN38 (7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin), the active metabolite of irinotecan.This randomized phase II trial investigated two dosing schedules of etirinotecan pegol in patients with platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian carcinoma.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 71 eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive etirinotecan pegol 145 mg/m(2) every 14 or 21 days until progression or unacceptable adverse events (AEs).The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR) by RECIST (version 1.0).Secondary end points included response by Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup criteria, duration of ORR, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).RESULTS: The overall confirmed ORR was 20% (95% CI, 10% to 30%): 20% for once every 14 days, and 19% for once every 21 days.Median response duration was 4.1 months for once every 14 days and 4.0 months for once every 21 days.Median PFS for every 14 and every 21 days was 4.1 and 5.3 months, respectively, and median OS was 10.0 and 11.7 months, respectively.Etirinotecan pegol was well tolerated, with the most common grade 3 to 4 AEs being dehydration (24%) and diarrhea (23%).Diarrhea, dehydration, nausea, and neutropenia were less frequent with the schedule of once every 21 days than with that of once every 14 days.CONCLUSION: Both schedules of etirinotecan pegol showed activity in patients with heavily pretreated ovarian cancer, with encouraging ORR and PFS rates.The schedule of once every 21 days was better tolerated and had slightly longer PFS and OS rates.The treatment schedule of etirinotecan pegol 145 mg/m(2) once every 21 days was selected for the expanded phase II study and is preferred for future phase III studies.These findings provide support to directly compare etirinotecan pegol versus one of the approved drugs (eg, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or topotecan) in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.",1,1,1,1

We found no differences in DFS between trastuzumab-treated patients who had the FCGR3A 158 V/V and/or FCGR2A 131 H/H high-affinity genotypes and patients without those genotypes.Furthermore, there was no significant interaction between FCGR3A and FCGR2A and treatment.However, there was a difference in DFS for FCGR2B I232T, with I/I patients deriving benefit from trastuzumab (P < 0.001), compared with the T carriers who did not (P = 0.81).The interaction between FCGR2B genotype and treatment was statistically significant (P = 0.03).Our analysis did not reveal an association between FcgammaR high-affinity genotypes and outcomes.However, it seems that the FCGR2B inhibitory gene may be predictive of adjuvant trastuzumab benefit.",0,0,0,0
27557302,"Daratumumab, Bortezomib, and Dexamethasone for Multiple Myeloma.BACKGROUND: Daratumumab, a human IgGkappa monoclonal antibody that targets CD38, induces direct and indirect antimyeloma activity and has shown substantial efficacy as monotherapy in heavily pretreated patients with multiple myeloma, as well as in combination with bortezomib in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.METHODS: In this phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 498 patients with relapsed or relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma to receive bortezomib (1.3 mg per square meter of body-surface area) and dexamethasone (20 mg) alone (control group) or in combination with daratumumab (16 mg per kilogram of body weight) (daratumumab group).The primary end point was progression-free survival.RESULTS: A prespecified interim analysis showed that the rate of progression-free survival was significantly higher in the daratumumab group than in the control group; the 12-month rate of progression-free survival was 60.7% in the daratumumab group versus 26.9% in the control group.After a median follow-up period of 7.4 months, the median progression-free survival was not reached in the daratumumab group and was 7.2 months in the control group (hazard ratio for progression or death with daratumumab vs. control, 0.39; 95% confidence interval, 0.28 to 0.53; P<0.001).The rate of overall response was higher in the daratumumab group than in the control group (82.9% vs. 63.2%, P<0.001), as were the rates of very good partial response or better (59.2% vs. 29.1%, P<0.001) and complete response or better (19.2% vs. 9.0%, P=0.001).Three of the most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events reported in the daratumumab group and the control group were thrombocytopenia (45.3% and 32.9%, respectively), anemia (14.4% and 16.0%, respectively), and neutropenia (12.8% and 4.2%, respectively).Infusion-related reactions that were associated with daratumumab treatment were reported in 45.3% of the patients in the daratumumab group; these reactions were mostly grade 1 or 2 (grade 3 in 8.6% of the patients), and in 98.2% of these patients, they occurred during the first infusion.CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with relapsed or relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, daratumumab in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone resulted in significantly longer progression-free survival than bortezomib and dexamethasone alone and was associated with infusion-related reactions and higher rates of thrombocytopenia and neutropenia than bortezomib and dexamethasone alone.(Funded by Janssen Research and Development; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02136134.).",1,1,1,1

24881631,"Ibrutinib versus ofatumumab in previously treated chronic lymphoid leukemia.BACKGROUND: In patients with chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), a short duration of response to therapy or adverse cytogenetic abnormalities are associated with a poor outcome.We evaluated the efficacy of ibrutinib, a covalent inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase, in patients at risk for a poor outcome.METHODS: In this multicenter, open-label, phase 3 study, we randomly assigned 391 patients with relapsed or refractory CLL or SLL to receive daily ibrutinib or the anti-CD20 antibody ofatumumab.The primary end point was the duration of progression-free survival, with the duration of overall survival and the overall response rate as secondary end points.RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 9.4 months, ibrutinib significantly improved progression-free survival; the median duration was not reached in the ibrutinib group (with a rate of progression-free survival of 88% at 6 months), as compared with a median of 8.1 months in the ofatumumab group (hazard ratio for progression or death in the ibrutinib group, 0.22; P<0.001).Ibrutinib also significantly improved overall survival (hazard ratio for death, 0.43; P=0.005).At 12 months, the overall survival rate was 90% in the ibrutinib group and 81% in the ofatumumab group.The overall response rate was significantly higher in the ibrutinib group than in the ofatumumab group (42.6% vs. 4.1%, P<0.001).An additional 20% of ibrutinib-treated patients had a partial response with lymphocytosis.Similar effects were observed regardless of whether patients had a chromosome 17p13.1 deletion or resistance to purine analogues.The most frequent nonhematologic adverse events were diarrhea, fatigue, pyrexia, and nausea in the ibrutinib group and fatigue, infusion-related reactions, and cough in the ofatumumab group.CONCLUSIONS: Ibrutinib, as compared with ofatumumab, significantly improved progression-free survival, overall survival, and response rate among patients with previously treated CLL or SLL.(Funded by Pharmacyclics and Janssen; RESONATE ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01578707.).",1,1,1,1
23053638,"A randomized phase II trial of platinum salts in basal-like breast cancer patients in the neoadjuvant setting. Results from the GEICAM/2006-03, multicenter study.Chemotherapy remains as the only systemic treatment option available for basal-like breast cancer (BC) patients.Preclinical models and several phase II studies suggested that platinum salts are active drugs in this BC subtype though there is no randomized study supporting this hypothesis.This study investigates if the addition of carboplatin to a combination of an alkylating agent together with anthracyclines and taxanes is able to increase the efficacy in the neoadjuvant treatment context.Patients with operable breast cancer and immunophenotypically defined basal-like disease (ER-/PR-/HER2- and cytokeratin 5/6+ or EGFR+) were recruited.Patients were randomized to receive EC (epirubicin 90 mg/m(2) plus cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2) for 4 cycles) followed either by D (docetaxel 100 mg/m(2) x 4 cycles; EC-D) or DCb (docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) plus carboplatin AUC 6 x 4 cycles; EC-DCb).The primary end point was pathological complete response (pCR) in the breast following the Miller and Payne criteria.Ninety-four patients were randomized (46 EC-D, 48 EC-DCb).pCR rate in the breast was seen in 16 patients (35 %) with EC-D and 14 patients (30 %) with EC-DCb (P value = 0.61).pCR in the breast and axilla was seen in 30 % of patients in both arms.The overall clinical response rate was 70 % (95 % CI 56-83) in the EC-D arm and 77 % (95 % CI 65-87) in the EC-DCb arm.Grade 3/4 toxicity was similar in both arms.The addition of carboplatin to conventional chemotherapy with EC-D in basal-like breast cancer patients did not improve the efficacy probably because they had already received an alkylating agent.These findings should be taken into consideration when developing new agents for this disease.",1,1,1,1
26603056,"Rationale and Design for the LUME-Colon 1 Study: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Phase III Trial of Nintedanib Plus Best Supportive Care Versus Placebo Plus Best Supportive Care in Patients With Advanced Colorectal Cancer Refractory to Standard Treatment.BACKGROUND: Clinical studies of antivascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents have demonstrated that angiogenesis is critical to colorectal cancer (CRC) tumor growth and metastasis.Nintedanib is a triple angiokinase inhibitor of VEGF, platelet-derived growth factor, and fibroblast growth factor signaling.Nintedanib, combined with docetaxel, has been approved in the European Union for the treatment of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer with adenocarcinoma tumor histologic type after first-line chemotherapy.The objective of the present study (1199.52; clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT02149108; LUME-Colon 1) is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of nintedanib plus best supportive care (BSC) in patients with advanced colorectal cancer refractory to standard chemotherapy regimens and biologic agents.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 764 patients worldwide will be randomized 1:1 to receive either nintedanib 200 mg twice daily plus BSC or placebo plus BSC in 21-day courses until disease progression, undue toxicity, or withdrawal of informed consent.The primary endpoints are progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).The secondary endpoints are the objective tumor response and disease control.PFS and OS will be evaluated using a log-rank test to determine the effect of nintedanib independently at the 2-sided alpha-level of 0.05.Other assessments will include the frequency and severity of adverse events and changes in laboratory parameters to measure the safety, health-related quality of life, and pharmacogenomic analyses, focusing on exploring the predictive biomarkers and drug-resistance mechanisms.The results are expected in 2016.",1,1,1,1

27041692,"Blood graft cellular composition and posttransplant outcomes in myeloma patients mobilized with or without low-dose cyclophosphamide: a randomized comparison.BACKGROUND: Autologous stem cell transplantation is a standard treatment in multiple myeloma (MM).Blood grafts are usually collected after mobilization with granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) alone or in a combination with cyclophosphamide (CY).There is limited knowledge of the possible effects of different mobilization regimens on blood graft characteristics and posttransplant outcomes.STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Thirty-eight patients with MM were included in this study.The patients were randomly assigned at registration to mobilization with either low-dose CY plus G-CSF (Arm A) or G-CSF alone (Arm B) and received three cycles of lenalidomide, bortetzomib, and dexamethasone induction.Flow cytometry analysis of lymphocyte subsets in the blood grafts after cryopreservation was performed.Hematologic and immune recovery were evaluated up to 12 months posttransplant.RESULTS: The blood grafts in Arm A contained significantly more CD34+ cells but in Arm B there was a greater proportion of CD34+CD38- cells and higher numbers of T and B lymphocytes as well as natural killer (NK) cells.The engraftment was comparable but lymphocyte count at 15 days posttransplant was higher in Arm B (0.8 x 10(9) /L vs. 0.5 x 10(9) /L, p = 0.033).At 3 and 6 months posttransplant the total number of NK cells was also higher in G-CSF-mobilized patients.There was no difference in progression-free survival between the study arms.CONCLUSION: CY plus G-GSF yields more CD34+ cells but seems to diminish lymphocyte and NK cell counts in the grafts and hampers immune recovery after transplantation.Thus G-CSF alone might be a preferred mobilization method due to more rapid immune recovery posttransplant.",0,0,0,0

23835819,"Telephone outreach to increase colon cancer screening in medicaid managed care organizations: a randomized controlled trial.PURPOSE: Health Plans are uniquely positioned to deliver outreach to members.We explored whether telephone outreach, delivered by Medicaid managed care organization (MMCO) staff, could increase colorectal cancer (CRC) screening among publicly insured urban women, potentially reducing disparities.METHODS: We conducted an 18-month randomized clinical trial in 3 MMCOs in New York City in 2008-2010, randomizing 2,240 MMCO-insured women, aged 50 to 63 years, who received care at a participating practice and were overdue for CRC screening.MMCO outreach staff provided cancer screening telephone support, educating patients and helping overcome barriers.The primary outcome was the number of women screened for CRC during the 18-month intervention, assessed using claims.RESULTS: MMCO staff reached 60% of women in the intervention arm by telephone.Although significantly more women in the intervention (36.7%) than in the usual care (30.6%) arm received CRC screening (odds ratio [OR] = 1.32; 95% CI, 1.08-1.62), increases varied from 1.1% to 13.7% across the participating MMCOs, and the overall increase was driven by increases at 1 MMCO.In an as-treated comparison, 41.8% of women in the intervention arm who were reached by telephone received CRC screening compared with 26.8% of women in the usual care arm who were not contacted during the study (OR = 1.84; 95% CI, 1.38, 2.44); 7 women needed to be reached by telephone for 1 to become screened.CONCLUSIONS: The telephone outreach intervention delivered by MMCO staff increased CRC screening by 6% more than usual care among randomized women, and by 15.1% more than usual care among previously overdue women reached by the intervention.Our research-based intervention was successfully translated to the health plan arena, with variable effects in the participating MMCOs.",0,0,0,0
26474517,"Cediranib combined with carboplatin and paclitaxel in patients with metastatic or recurrent cervical cancer (CIRCCa): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial.BACKGROUND: Patients treated with standard chemotherapy for metastatic or relapsed cervical cancer respond poorly to conventional chemotherapy (response achieved in 20-30% of patients) with an overall survival of less than 1 year.High tumour angiogenesis and high concentrations of intratumoural VEGF are adverse prognostic features.Cediranib is a potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor of VEGFR1, 2, and 3.In this trial, we aimed to assess the effect of the addition of cediranib to carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy in patients with metastatic or recurrent cervical cancer.METHODS: In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial, which was done in 17 UK cancer treatment centres, patients aged 18 years or older initially diagnosed with metastatic carcinoma or who subsequently developed metastatic disease or local pelvic recurrence after radical treatment that was not amenable to exenterative surgery were recruited.Eligible patients received carboplatin AUC of 5 plus paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2) by infusion every 3 weeks for a maximum of six cycles and were randomised centrally (1:1) through a minimisation approach to receive cediranib 20 mg or placebo orally once daily until disease progression.The stratification factors were disease site, disease-free survival after primary therapy or primary stage IVb disease, number of lines of previous treatment, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, and investigational site.All patients, investigators, and trial personnel were masked to study drug allocation.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival.Efficacy analysis was by intention to treat, and the safety analysis included all patients who received at least one dose of study drug.This trial is registered with the ISCRTN registry, number ISRCTN23516549, and has been completed.FINDINGS: Between Aug 19, 2010, and July 27, 2012, 69 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to cediranib (n=34) or placebo (n=35).After a median follow-up of 24.2 months (IQR 21.9-29.5), progression-free survival was longer in the cediranib group (median 8.1 months [80% CI 7.4-8.8]) than in the placebo group (6.7 months [6.2-7.2]), with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.58 (80% CI 0.40-0.85; one-sided p=0.032).Grade 3 or worse adverse events that occurred in the concurrent chemotherapy and trial drug period in more than 10% of patients were diarrhoea (five [16%] of 32 patients in the cediranib group vs one [3%] of 35 patients in the placebo group), fatigue (four [13%] vs two [6%]), leucopenia (five [16%] vs three [9%]), neutropenia (10 [31%] vs four [11%]), and febrile neutropenia (five [16%] vs none).The incidence of grade 2-3 hypertension was higher in the cediranib group than in the control group (11 [34%] vs four [11%]).Serious adverse events occurred in 18 patients in the placebo group and 19 patients in the cediranib group.INTERPRETATION: Cediranib has significant efficacy when added to carboplatin and paclitaxel in the treatment of metastatic or recurrent cervical cancer.This finding was accompanied by an increase in toxic effects (mainly diarrhoea, hypertension, and febrile neutropenia).FUNDING: Cancer Research UK and AstraZeneca.",0,0,0,0
27869649,"Randomized trial of calcipotriol combined with 5-fluorouracil for skin cancer precursor immunotherapy.BACKGROUND: Actinic keratosis is a precursor to cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.Long treatment durations and severe side effects have limited the efficacy of current actinic keratosis treatments.Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is an epithelium-derived cytokine that induces a robust antitumor immunity in barrier-defective skin.Here, we investigated the efficacy of calcipotriol, a topical TSLP inducer, in combination with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) as an immunotherapy for actinic keratosis.METHODS: The mechanism of calcipotriol action against skin carcinogenesis was examined in genetically engineered mouse models.The efficacy and safety of 0.005% calcipotriol ointment combined with 5% 5-FU cream were compared with Vaseline plus 5-FU for the field treatment of actinic keratosis in a randomized, double-blind clinical trial involving 131 participants.The assigned treatment was self-applied to the entirety of the qualified anatomical sites (face, scalp, and upper extremities) twice daily for 4 consecutive days.The percentage of reduction in the number of actinic keratoses (primary outcome), local skin reactions, and immune activation parameters were assessed.RESULTS: Calcipotriol suppressed skin cancer development in mice in a TSLP-dependent manner.Four-day application of calcipotriol plus 5-FU versus Vaseline plus 5-FU led to an 87.8% versus 26.3% mean reduction in the number of actinic keratoses in participants (P < 0.0001).Importantly, calcipotriol plus 5-FU treatment induced TSLP, HLA class II, and natural killer cell group 2D (NKG2D) ligand expression in the lesional keratinocytes associated with a marked CD4+ T cell infiltration, which peaked on days 10-11 after treatment, without pain, crusting, or ulceration.CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate the synergistic effects of calcipotriol and 5-FU treatment in optimally activating a CD4+ T cell-mediated immunity against actinic keratoses and, potentially, cancers of the skin and other organs.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02019355.FUNDING: Not applicable (investigator-initiated clinical trial).",1,1,1,1

23233657,"High cereblon expression is associated with better survival in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma treated with thalidomide maintenance.Recently, cereblon (CRBN) expression was found to be essential for the activity of thalidomide and lenalidomide.In the present study, we investigated whether the clinical efficacy of thalidomide in multiple myeloma is associated with CRBN expression in myeloma cells.Patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma were included in the HOVON-65/GMMG-HD4 trial, in which postintensification treatment in 1 arm consisted of daily thalidomide (50 mg) for 2 years.Gene-expression profiling, determined at the start of the trial, was available for 96 patients who started thalidomide maintenance.In this patient set, increase of CRBN gene expression was significantly associated with longerprogression-free survival (P = .005).In contrast, no association between CRBN expression and survival was observed in the arm with bortezomib maintenance.We conclude that CRBN expression may be associated with the clinical efficacy of thalidomide.This trial has been registered at the Nederlands Trial Register (www.trialregister.nl) as NTR213; at the European Union Drug Regulating Authorities Clinical Trials (EudraCT) as 2004-000944-26; and at the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) as 64455289.",1,1,1,1

22511495,"High-dose imatinib induction followed by standard-dose maintenance in pre-treated chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia patients--final analysis of a randomized, multicenter, phase III trial.BACKGROUND: Previous data suggest that the response of chronic myeloid leukemia cells to imatinib is dose-dependent.The potential benefit of initial dose intensification of imatinib in pre-treated patients with chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia remains unknown.DESIGN AND METHODS: Two hundred and twenty-seven pre-treated patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase were randomly assigned to continuous treatment with a standard dose of imatinib (400 mg/day; n=113) or to 6 months of high-dose induction with imatinib (800 mg/day) followed by a standard dose of imatinib as maintenance therapy (n=114).RESULTS: The rates of major and complete cytogenetic responses were significantly higher in the high-dose arm than in the standard-dose arm at both 3 and 6 months (major cytogenetic responses: 36.8% versus 21.2%, P=0.01 and 50.0% versus 34.5%, P=0.018; complete cytogenetic responses: 22.8% versus 6.2%, P<0.001 and 40.4% versus 16.8%, P<0.001) on the basis of an intention-to-treat analysis.At 12 months, the difference between treatment arms remained statistically significant for complete cytogenetic responses (40.4% versus 24.8%, P=0.012) but not for major cytogenetic responses (49.1% versus 44.2%, P=0.462).The rate of major molecular responses was also significantly better at 3 and 6 months in the high-dose arm (month 3: 14.9% versus 3.5%, P=0.003; month 6: 32.5% versus 8.8%, P<0.001).Overall and progression-free survival rates were comparable between arms, but event-free survival was significantly worse in the high-dose arm (P=0.014).CONCLUSIONS: Standard-dose imatinib remains the standard of care for pre-treated patients with chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT00327262).",1,1,1,1
25403578,"FOLFOX4 versus sequential dose-dense FOLFOX7 followed by FOLFIRI in patients with resectable metastatic colorectal cancer (MIROX): a pragmatic approach to chemotherapy timing with perioperative or postoperative chemotherapy from an open-label, randomized phase III trial.BACKGROUND: Perioperative FOLFOX4 (oxaliplatin plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin) chemotherapy is the current standard in patients with resectable metastases from colorectal cancer (CRC).We aimed to determine whether a sequential chemotherapy with dose-dense oxaliplatin (FOLFOX7) and irinotecan (FOLFIRI; irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin) is superior to FOLFOX4.The chemotherapy timing was not imposed, and was perioperative or postoperative.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this open-label, phase III trial, patients with resectable or resected metastases were randomly assigned either to 12 cycles of FOLFOX4 (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m(2)) or 6 cycles of FOLFOX7 (oxaliplatin 130 mg/m(2)) followed by 6 cycles of FOLFIRI (irinotecan 180 mg/m(2)).Randomization was done centrally, with stratification by chemotherapy timing, type of local treatment (surgery versus radiofrequency ablation with/without surgery), and Fong's prognostic score.The primary end point was 2-year disease-free survival (DFS).RESULTS: A total of 284 patients were randomized, 142 in each treatment group.Chemotherapy was perioperative in 168 (59.2%) patients and postoperative in 116 (40.8%) patients.Perioperative chemotherapy was preferentially proposed for synchronous metastases, whereas postoperative chemotherapy was more frequently used for metachronous metastases.Two-year DFS was 48.5% in the FOLFOX4 group and 50.0% in the FOLFOX7-FOLFIRI group.In the multivariable analysis, more than one metastasis [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.15] and synchronous metastases (HR = 1.63) were independent prognostic factors for shorter DFS.Five-year overall survival (OS) rate was 69.5% with FOLFOX4 versus 66.6% with FOLFOX7-FOLFIRI.CONCLUSIONS: FOLFOX7-FOLFIRI is not superior to FOLFOX4 in patients with resectable metastatic CRC.Five-year OS rates observed in both groups are the highest ever reported in this setting, possibly reflecting the pragmatic approach to chemotherapy timing.CLINICAL TRIALS NUMBER: NCT00268398.",1,1,1,1
28049139,"A randomized phase 2 study of MK-2206 versus everolimus in refractory renal cell carcinoma.Background: Activation of the phosphoinisitide-3 kinase (PI3K) pathway through mutation and constitutive upregulation has been described in renal cell carcinoma (RCC), making it an attractive target for therapeutic intervention.We performed a randomized phase II study in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy refractory patients to determine whether MK-2206, an allosteric inhibitor of AKT, was more efficacious than the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor everolimus.Patients and methods: A total of 43 patients were randomized in a 2:1 distribution, with 29 patients assigned to the MK-2206 arm and 14 to the everolimus arm.Progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary endpoint.Results: The trial was closed at the first futility analysis with an observed PFS of 3.68 months in the MK-2206 arm and 5.98 months in the everolimus arm.Dichotomous response rate profiles were seen in the MK-2206 arm with one complete response and three partial responses in the MK-2206 arm versus none in the everolimus arm.On the other hand, progressive disease was best response in 44.8% of MK2206 versus 14.3% of everolimus-treated patients.MK-2206 induced significantly more rash and pruritis than everolimus, and dose reduction occurred in 37.9% of MK-2206 versus 21.4% of everolimus-treated patients.Genomic analysis revealed that 57.1% of the patients in the PD group had either deleterious TP53 mutations or ATM mutations or deletions.In contrast, none of the patients in the non-PD group had TP53 or ATM defects.No predictive marker for response was observed in this small dataset.Conclusions: Dichotomous outcomes are observed when VEGF therapy refractory patients are treated with MK-2206, and MK-2206 does not demonstrate superiority to everolimus.Additionally, mutations in DNA repair genes are associated with early disease progression, indicating that dysregulation of DNA repair is associated with a more aggressive tumor phenotype in RCC.",1,1,1,1
28111430,"Incorporating Erlotinib or Irinotecan Plus Cisplatin into Chemoradiotherapy for Stage III Non-small Cell Lung Cancer According to EGFR Mutation Status.PURPOSE: Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) is the standard care for stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients; however, a more effective regimen is needed to improve the outcome by better controlling occult metastases.We conducted two parallel randomized phase II studies to incorporate erlotinib or irinotecan-cisplatin (IP) into CCRT for stage III NSCLC depending on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation status.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with EGFR-mutant tumors were randomized to receive three cycles of erlotinib first and then either CCRT with erlotinib followed by erlotinib (arm A) or CCRT with IP only (arm B).Patients with EGFR unknown or wild-type tumors were randomized to receive either three cycles of IP before (arm C) or after CCRT with IP (arm D).RESULTS: Seventy-three patients were screened and the study was closed early because of slow accrual after 59 patients were randomized.Overall, there were seven patients in arm A, five in arm B, 22 in arm C, and 25 in arm D. The response rate was 71.4% and 80.0% for arm A and B, and 70.0% and 73.9% for arm C and D. The median overall survival (OS) was 39.3 months versus 31.2 months for arm A and B (p=0.442), and 16.3 months versus 25.3 months for arm C and D (p=0.050).Patients with sensitive EGFR mutations had significantly longer OS than EGFR-wild patients (74.8 months vs. 25.3 months, p=0.034).There were no unexpected toxicities.CONCLUSION: Combined-modality treatment by molecular diagnostics is feasible in stage III NSCLC.EGFR-mutant patients appear to be a distinct subset with longer survival.",1,1,1,1
23233657,"High cereblon expression is associated with better survival in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma treated with thalidomide maintenance.Recently, cereblon (CRBN) expression was found to be essential for the activity of thalidomide and lenalidomide.In the present study, we investigated whether the clinical efficacy of thalidomide in multiple myeloma is associated with CRBN expression in myeloma cells.Patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma were included in the HOVON-65/GMMG-HD4 trial, in which postintensification treatment in 1 arm consisted of daily thalidomide (50 mg) for 2 years.Gene-expression profiling, determined at the start of the trial, was available for 96 patients who started thalidomide maintenance.In this patient set, increase of CRBN gene expression was significantly associated with longerprogression-free survival (P = .005).In contrast, no association between CRBN expression and survival was observed in the arm with bortezomib maintenance.We conclude that CRBN expression may be associated with the clinical efficacy of thalidomide.This trial has been registered at the Nederlands Trial Register (www.trialregister.nl) as NTR213; at the European Union Drug Regulating Authorities Clinical Trials (EudraCT) as 2004-000944-26; and at the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) as 64455289.",1,1,1,1
25449185,"Effects of yoga on cancer-related fatigue and global side-effect burden in older cancer survivors.BACKGROUND: Sixty percent of cancer survivors are 65years of age or older.Cancer and its treatments lead to cancer-related fatigue and many other side effects, in turn, creating substantial global side-effect burden (total burden from all side effects) which, ultimately, compromises functional independence and quality of life.Various modes of exercise, such as yoga, reduce cancer-related fatigue and global side-effect burden in younger cancer survivors, but no studies have specifically examined the effects of yoga on older cancer survivors.OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of a 4-week yoga intervention (Yoga for Cancer Survivors: YOCAS(c)(R)) on overall cancer-related fatigue, and due to its multidimensional nature, the subdomains of cancer-related fatigue (general, physical, emotional, and mental) and global side-effect burden in older cancer survivors.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis on data from a multicenter phase III randomized controlled clinical trial with 2 arms (standard care and standard care plus a 4-week YOCAS(c)(R) intervention).The sample for this secondary analysis was 97 older cancer survivors (>/=60years of age), between 2months and 2years post-treatment, who participated in the original trial.RESULTS: Participants in the YOCAS(c)(R) intervention arm reported significantly lower cancer-related fatigue, physical fatigue, mental fatigue, and global side-effect burden than participants in the standard care arm following the 4-week intervention period (p<0.05).CONCLUSIONS: YOCAS(c)(R) is an effective standardized yoga intervention for reducing cancer-related fatigue, physical fatigue, mental fatigue, and global side-effect burden among older cancer survivors.",0,0,0,0
23117476,"Frequent alterations of MCPH1 and ATM are associated with primary breast carcinoma: clinical and prognostic implications.BACKGROUND: MCPH1 is a proximal regulator of DNA damage response pathway that is involved in recruitment of phosphorylated ATM to double-stranded DNA breaks.METHODS: To understand the importance of MCPH1 and ATM in deregulation of DNA damage response pathway in breast carcinoma, we studied m-RNA expression and genetic/epigenetic alterations of these genes in primary breast carcinoma samples.RESULTS: Our study revealed reduced expression (mRNA/protein) and high alterations (deletion/methylation) (96 %, 121 of 126) of MCPH1 and ATM.Mutation was, however, rare in inactivation of MCPH1.In immunohistochemical analysis, reduced protein expression of MCPH1, ATM and p-ATM were concordant with their molecular alterations (P = 0.03-0.01).Alterations of MCPH1 and deletion of ATM were significantly high in estrogen/progesterone receptor-negative than estrogen/progesterone receptor-positive breast carcinoma samples compared to early or late age of onset tumors, indicating differences in pathogenesis of the molecular subtypes (P = 0.004-0.01).These genes also showed differential association with tumor stage, grade and lymph node status in different subtypes of breast carcinoma (P = 0.00001-0.01).Their coalterations showed significant association with tumor progression and prognosis (P = 0.003-0.05).Interestingly, patients with alterations of these genes or MCPH1 alone had poor outcome after treatment with DNA-interacting drugs and/or radiation (P = 0.01-0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Inactivation of MCPH1-ATM-associated DNA damage response pathway might have an important role in the development of breast carcinoma with diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic implications.",0,0,0,0
23850170,"Which patients benefit most from primary surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy in stage IIIC or IV ovarian cancer? An exploratory analysis of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer 55971 randomised trial.BACKGROUND: To investigate whether biomarkers consisting of baseline characteristics of advanced stage ovarian cancer patients can help in identifying subgroups of patients who would benefit more from primary surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy.METHODS: We used data of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 55971 trial in which 670 patients were randomly assigned to primary surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy.The primary outcome was overall survival.Ten baseline clinical and pathological characteristics were selected as potential biomarkers.Using Subpopulation Treatment Effect Pattern Plots (STEPP), biomarkers with a statistically significant qualitative additive interaction with treatment were considered as potentially informative for treatment selection.We also combined selected biomarkers to form a multimarker treatment selection rule.FINDINGS: The size of the largest metastatic tumour and clinical stage were significantly associated with the magnitude of the benefit from treatment, in terms of five-year survival (p for interaction: 0.008 and 0.016, respectively).Stage IIIC patients with metastatic tumours 45 mm benefited more from primary surgery while stage IV patients with metastatic tumours >45 mm benefited more from neoadjuvant chemotherapy.In stage IIIC patients with larger metastatic tumours and in stage IV patients with less extensive metastatic tumours both treatments were equally effective.We estimated that by selecting treatments for patients based on largest metastatic tumour and clinical stage, the potential five-year survival rate in the population of treated patients would be 27.3% (95% confidence interval (CI) 21.9-33.0), 7.8% higher than if all were treated with primary surgery, and 5.6% higher if all were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.INTERPRETATION: Although survival was comparable after primary surgery and neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the overall group of patients with ovarian cancer in the EORTC 55971 trial, we found in this exploratory analysis that patients with stage IIIC and less extensive metastatic tumours had higher survival with primary surgery, while patients with stage IV disease and large metastatic tumours had higher survival with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.For patients who did not meet these criteria, both treatment options led to comparable survival rates.",1,1,1,1
24245838,"CHESS improves cancer caregivers' burden and mood: results of an eHealth RCT.OBJECTIVE: Informal caregivers (family and friends) of people with cancer are often unprepared for their caregiving role, leading to increased burden or distress.Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System (CHESS) is a Web-based lung cancer information, communication, and coaching system for caregivers.This randomized trial reports the impact on caregiver burden, disruptiveness, and mood of providing caregivers access to CHESS versus the Internet with a list of recommended lung cancer websites.METHODS: A total of 285 informal caregivers of patients with advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer were randomly assigned to a comparison group that received Internet or a treatment group that received Internet and CHESS.Caregivers were provided a computer and Internet service if needed.Written surveys were completed at pretest and during the intervention period bimonthly for up to 24 months.Analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) compared the intervention's effect on caregivers' disruptiveness and burden (CQOLI-C), and negative mood (combined Anxiety, Depression, and Anger scales of the POMS) at 6 months, controlling for blocking variables (site, caregiver's race, and relationship to patient) and the given outcome at pretest.RESULTS: Caregivers randomized to CHESS reported lower burden, t(84) = 2.36, p = .021, d = .39, and negative mood, t(86) = 2.82, p = .006, d = .44, than those in the Internet group.The effect on disruptiveness was not significant.CONCLUSIONS: Although caring for someone with a terminal illness will always exact a toll on caregivers, eHealth interventions like CHESS may improve caregivers' understanding and coping skills and, as a result, ease their burden and mood.",0,0,0,0
22855579,"Thalidomide in total therapy 2 overcomes inferior prognosis of myeloma with low expression of the glucocorticoid receptor gene NR3C1.PURPOSE: Because dexamethasone remains a key component of myeloma therapy, we wished to examine the impact of baseline and relapse expression levels of the glucocorticoid receptor gene NR3C1 on survival outcomes in the context of treatment with or without thalidomide.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We investigated the clinical impact of gene expression profiling (GEP)-derived expression levels of NR3C1 in 351 patients with GEP data available at baseline and in 130 with data available at relapse, among 668 subjects accrued to total therapy 2 (TT2).RESULTS: Low NR3C1 expression levels had a negative impact on progression-free survival (PFS; HR, 1.47; P = 0.030) and overall survival (OS; HR, 1.90; P = 0.002) in the no-thalidomide arm.Conversely, there was a significant clinical benefit of thalidomide for patients with low receptor levels (OS: HR, 0.54; P = 0.015; PFS: HR, 0.54; P = 0.004), mediated most likely by thalidomide's upregulation of NR3C1.In the context of both baseline and relapse parameters, post-relapse survival (PRS) was adversely affected by low NR3C1 levels at relapse in a multivariate analysis (HR, 2.61; P = 0.012).CONCLUSION: These findings justify the inclusion of NR3C1 expression data in the work-up of patients with myeloma as it can significantly influence the choice of therapy and, ultimately, OS.The identification of an interaction term between thalidomide and NR3C1 underscores the importance of pharmacogenomic studies in the systematic study of new drugs.",0,0,0,0
22552048,"Efficacy of docetaxel-based chemotherapy following ketoconazole in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: implications for prior therapy in clinical trials.OBJECTIVES: Abiraterone acetate (AA) is a CYP17 inhibitor of androgen synthesis approved for use following docetaxel for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC); evaluation in the pre-docetaxel setting is ongoing.Given that the reported efficacy of AA is lower following docetaxel vs. pre-docetaxel, the potential exists for cross resistance given docetaxel's partly androgen receptor targeting activity.The efficacy of docetaxel following ketoconazole (KC), a weaker and nonspecific inhibitor of CYP17, may provide some insights into this potential interaction.We retrospectively evaluated the efficacy of every 3-week docetaxel with prednisone (DP) in mCRPC previously exposed to KC compared to KC-naive patients.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A randomized phase II trial of men with mCRPC treated with DP + AT-101 (bcl-2 inhibitor) vs. DP plus placebo was analyzed.Both arms were combined for analysis as no significant differences were seen.Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective response (ORR), pain, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rates were estimated with and without prior KC.Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate the effect of covariates on OS.RESULTS: Of 220 evaluable men, 40 (18.2%) received prior KC.The median OS with DP-based therapy of KC-naive patients (18.3 months, 95% CI: 15.0, 24.5) and post-KC patients (17.0 months, 95% CI: 9.9, 20.4) was not statistically different (P = 0.20).After controlling for prognostic classifications, analyses demonstrated consistent trends for worsening of OS after KC, with (hazard ratios (HRs) 1.33-1.46.Similar unfavorable trends were observed for ORR, PSA declines, and PFS.CONCLUSIONS: In this hypothesis-generating analysis, patients treated with docetaxel-based chemotherapy following prior KC had numerically and consistently worse outcomes than patients not exposed to prior KC.Although the estimated differences did not attain statistical significance, evaluation of outcomes with docetaxel in particular, and all classes of novel and emerging agents following AA, is of clinical importance, given its more potent androgen synthesis inhibition compared with KC.Drug development should take into account the potential impact of previous therapy.",0,0,0,0

24903230,"Effect of inspiration on airway dimensions measured in maximal inspiration CT images of subjects without airflow limitation.OBJECTIVES: To study the effect of inspiration on airway dimensions measured in voluntary inspiration breath-hold examinations.METHODS: 961 subjects with normal spirometry were selected from the Danish Lung Cancer Screening Trial.Subjects were examined annually for five years with low-dose CT.Automated software was utilized to segment lungs and airways, identify segmental bronchi, and match airway branches in all images of the same subject.Inspiration level was defined as segmented total lung volume (TLV) divided by predicted total lung capacity (pTLC).Mixed-effects models were used to predict relative change in lumen diameter (ALD) and wall thickness (AWT) in airways of generation 0 (trachea) to 7 and segmental bronchi (R1-R10 and L1-L10) from relative changes in inspiration level.RESULTS: Relative changes in ALD were related to relative changes in TLV/pTLC, and this distensibility increased with generation (p < 0.001).Relative changes in AWT were inversely related to relative changes in TLV/pTLC in generation 3--7 (p < 0.001).Segmental bronchi were widely dispersed in terms of ALD (5.7 +/- 0.7 mm), AWT (0.86 +/- 0.07 mm), and distensibility (23.5 +/- 7.7%).CONCLUSIONS: Subjects who inspire more deeply prior to imaging have larger ALD and smaller AWT.This effect is more pronounced in higher-generation airways.Therefore, adjustment of inspiration level is necessary to accurately assess airway dimensions.KEY POINTS: Airway lumen diameter increases and wall thickness decreases with inspiration.The effect of inspiration is greater in higher-generation (more peripheral) airways.Airways of generation 5 and beyond are as distensible as lung parenchyma.Airway dimensions measured from CT should be adjusted for inspiration level.",0,0,0,0

26715229,"Long-Term Effects of Two Formats of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia Comorbid with Breast Cancer.STUDY OBJECTIVES: The goal of this randomized controlled trial, conducted in breast cancer patients, was to assess the long-term efficacy of a video-based cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (VCBT-I), as compared to a professionally administered intervention (PCBT-I) and to a no-treatment group (CTL).An earlier report revealed that, at posttreatment, VCBT-I patients showed significantly greater sleep improvements than CTL, but that PCBT-I produced superior effects than VCBT-I on some sleep and secondary outcomes.In this report, long-term effects are compared.METHODS: Two hundred forty-two women with breast cancer and with insomnia symptoms or using hypnotic medications participated to this three-arm randomized controlled trial: (1) PCBT-I (n = 81); (2) VCBT-I (n = 80); or (3) no treatment (CTL; n = 81) group.PCBT-I was composed of six weekly, individual sessions of approximately 50 min, whereas VCBT-I comprised a 60-min animated video and six booklets.RESULTS: Study measures (sleep and secondary variables) were administered at pretreatment and posttreatment, and at a 3-, 6-, and 12-mo follow-up.Treatment gains were well sustained at follow-up in both PCBT-I and VCBT-I. As at posttreatment, the remission rate of insomnia at follow-up was greater in PCBT-I than in VCBT-I, which was greater than in CTL.CONCLUSIONS: Although face-to-face therapy remains the optimal format to efficaciously administer CBT for insomnia in cancer patients, a minimal intervention, such as the video-based intervention tested in this study, produces significant and sustainable treatment effects.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00674830.",1,1,0,0

22306907,"Autologous cytokine-induced killer cell transfusion in combination with gemcitabine plus cisplatin regimen chemotherapy for metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma.In this study, we evaluate the efficacy of autologous cytokine-induced killer cells (CIK) transfusion used in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin (GC) chemotherapy to treat nasopharyngeal carcinoma in patients with distant metastasis after radiotherapy.From September 2007 to August 2008, 60 patients with distant metastasis after radiotherapy were followed up and were randomly divided into 2 groups.The 30 patients in the GC+CIK group were treated with adoptive autologous CIK cell transfusion in combination with GC chemotherapy; the 30 patients in the GC group were treated with chemotherapy alone.Short-term efficacy evaluation revealed that in the GC+CIK group, there were 3 cases of complete remission, 18 cases of partial remission, 2 cases of stabilization of disease, and 7 cases of progression of disease and the total effective rate was 70% (21/30).In the GC group, there were 0 cases of complete remission, 14 cases of partial remission, 3 case of stable disease, and 13 cases of progressive disease and the total effective rate was 46.7% (14/21).Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that the overall survival of the GC+CIK group was higher than that of the GC group, but the difference was not significant (P=0.1374, log-rank test).However, the progression-free survival of the GC+CIK group was significantly higher than that of the GC group (P=0.0234, log-rank test).Thus, our study indicated that CIK cell transfusion therapy used in combination with GC chemotherapy may be a more effective treatment for postradiotherapy distant metastasis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients.",1,1,1,1
22918392,"Face-to-face vs telephone pre-colonoscopy consultation in colorectal cancer screening; a randomised trial.BACKGROUND: A pre-colonoscopy consultation in colorectal cancer (CRC) screening is necessary to assess a screenee's general health status and to explain benefits and risks of screening.The first option allows for personal attention, whereas a telephone consultation does not require travelling.We hypothesised that a telephone consultation would lead to higher response and participation in CRC screening compared with a face-to-face consultation.METHODS: A total of 6600 persons (50-75 years) were 1:1 randomised for primary colonoscopy screening with a pre-colonoscopy consultation either face-to-face or by telephone.In both arms, we counted the number of invitees who attended a pre-colonoscopy consultation (response) and the number of those who subsequently attended colonoscopy (participation), relative to the number invited for screening.A questionnaire regarding satisfaction with the consultation and expected burden of the colonoscopy (scored on five-point rating scales) was sent to invitees.Besides, a questionnaire to assess the perceived burden of colonoscopy was sent to participants, 14 days after the procedure.RESULTS: In all, 3302 invitees were allocated to the telephone group and 3298 to the face-to-face group, of which 794 (24%) attended a telephone consultation and 822 (25%) a face-to-face consultation (P=0.41).Subsequently, 674 (20%) participants in the telephone group and 752 (23%) in the face-to-face group attended colonoscopy (P=0.018).Invitees and responders in the telephone group expected the bowel preparation to be more painful than those in the face-to-face group while perceived burden scores for the full screening procedure were comparable.More subjects in the face-to-face group than in the telephone group were satisfied by the consultation in general: (99.8% vs 98.5%, P=0.014).CONCLUSION: Using a telephone rather than a face-to-face consultation in a population-based CRC colonoscopy screening programme leads to similar response rates but significantly lower colonoscopy participation.",0,0,0,0
22565002,"Randomized phase II trial of everolimus in combination with tamoxifen in patients with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative metastatic breast cancer with prior exposure to aromatase inhibitors: a GINECO study.PURPOSE: Cross-talk between signal transduction pathways likely contributes to hormone resistance in metastatic breast cancer (mBC).Everolimus, an oral inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin, has restored sensitivity in endocrine-resistance models and shown anticancer activity in early-phase mBC clinical trials.This analysis evaluated efficacy and safety of everolimus in combination with tamoxifen in patients with mBC resistant to aromatase inhibitors (AIs).PATIENTS AND METHODS: This open-label, phase II study randomly assigned postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative, AI-resistant mBC to tamoxifen 20 mg/d plus everolimus 10 mg/d (n = 54) or tamoxifen 20 mg/d alone (n = 57).Randomization was stratified by primary and secondary hormone resistance.Primary end point was clinical benefit rate (CBR), defined as the percentage of all patients with a complete or partial response or stable disease at 6 months.No formal statistical comparison between groups was planned.RESULTS: The 6-month CBR was 61% (95% CI, 47 to 74) with tamoxifen plus everolimus and 42% (95% CI, 29 to 56) with tamoxifen alone.Time to progression (TTP) increased from 4.5 months with tamoxifen alone to 8.6 months with tamoxifen plus everolimus, corresponding to a 46% reduction in risk of progression with the combination (hazard ratio [HR], 0.54; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.81).Risk of death was reduced by 55% with tamoxifen plus everolimus versus tamoxifen alone (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.24 to 0.81).The main toxicities associated with tamoxifen plus everolimus were fatigue (72% v 53% with tamoxifen alone), stomatitis (56% v 7%), rash (44% v 7%), anorexia (43% v 18%), and diarrhea (39% v 11%).CONCLUSION: This study suggests that tamoxifen plus everolimus increased CBR, TTP, and overall survival compared with tamoxifen alone in postmenopausal women with AI-resistant mBC.",1,1,1,1
24881631,"Ibrutinib versus ofatumumab in previously treated chronic lymphoid leukemia.BACKGROUND: In patients with chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), a short duration of response to therapy or adverse cytogenetic abnormalities are associated with a poor outcome.We evaluated the efficacy of ibrutinib, a covalent inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase, in patients at risk for a poor outcome.METHODS: In this multicenter, open-label, phase 3 study, we randomly assigned 391 patients with relapsed or refractory CLL or SLL to receive daily ibrutinib or the anti-CD20 antibody ofatumumab.The primary end point was the duration of progression-free survival, with the duration of overall survival and the overall response rate as secondary end points.RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 9.4 months, ibrutinib significantly improved progression-free survival; the median duration was not reached in the ibrutinib group (with a rate of progression-free survival of 88% at 6 months), as compared with a median of 8.1 months in the ofatumumab group (hazard ratio for progression or death in the ibrutinib group, 0.22; P<0.001).Ibrutinib also significantly improved overall survival (hazard ratio for death, 0.43; P=0.005).At 12 months, the overall survival rate was 90% in the ibrutinib group and 81% in the ofatumumab group.The overall response rate was significantly higher in the ibrutinib group than in the ofatumumab group (42.6% vs. 4.1%, P<0.001).An additional 20% of ibrutinib-treated patients had a partial response with lymphocytosis.Similar effects were observed regardless of whether patients had a chromosome 17p13.1 deletion or resistance to purine analogues.The most frequent nonhematologic adverse events were diarrhea, fatigue, pyrexia, and nausea in the ibrutinib group and fatigue, infusion-related reactions, and cough in the ofatumumab group.CONCLUSIONS: Ibrutinib, as compared with ofatumumab, significantly improved progression-free survival, overall survival, and response rate among patients with previously treated CLL or SLL.(Funded by Pharmacyclics and Janssen; RESONATE ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01578707.).",1,1,1,1
26272237,"A Single-centre Early Phase Randomised Controlled Three-arm Trial of Open, Robotic, and Laparoscopic Radical Cystectomy (CORAL).BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic radical cystectomy (LRC) and robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) are increasingly popular, but high-level evidence for these techniques remains lacking.OBJECTIVE: To compare the outcomes of patients undergoing open radical cystectomy (ORC), RARC, and LRC.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: From March 2009 to July 2012, 164 patients requiring radical cystectomy for muscle-invasive bladder cancer or high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer were invited to participate, with an aim of recruiting 47 patients into each arm.Overall, 93 were suitable for trial inclusion; 60 (65%) agreed and 33 (35%) declined.INTERVENTION: ORC, RARC, or LRC with extracorporeal urinary diversion.OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Primary end points were 30- and 90-d complication rates.Secondary end points were perioperative clinical, pathologic, and oncologic outcomes, and quality of life (QoL).The Fisher exact test and analysis of variance were used for statistical analyses.RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: The 30-d complication rates (classified by the Clavien-Dindo system) varied significantly between the three arms (ORC: 70%; RARC: 55%; LRC: 26%; p=0.024).ORC complication rates were significantly higher than LRC (p<0.01).The 90-d complication rates did not differ significantly between the three arms (ORC: 70%; RARC: 55%; LRC 32%; p=0.068).Mean operative time was significantly longer in RARC compared with ORC or LRC.ORC resulted in a slower return to oral solids than RARC or LRC.There were no significant differences in QoL measures.Major limitations are the small sample size and potential surgeon bias.CONCLUSIONS: The 30-d complication rates varied by type of surgery and were significantly higher in the ORC arm than the LRC arm.There was no significant difference in 90-d Clavien-graded complication rates between the three arms.PATIENT SUMMARY: We compared patients having open, robotic, or laparoscopic bladder removal surgery for bladder cancer and found no difference in Clavien-graded complication rates at 90 d.",0,0,0,0
25813447,"A Phase II Study of Pazopanib in Patients with Localized Renal Cell Carcinoma to Optimize Preservation of Renal Parenchyma.PURPOSE: Preservation of renal function is prioritized during surgical management of localized renal cell carcinoma.VEGF targeted agents can downsize tumors in metastatic renal cell carcinoma and may do the same in localized renal cell carcinoma, allowing for optimal preservation of renal parenchyma associated with partial nephrectomy.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Localized clear cell renal cell carcinoma patients meeting 1 or both of the following criteria were enrolled in a prospective phase II trial, including radical or partial nephrectomy likely to yield a glomerular filtration rate of less than 30 ml/minute/1.73 m(2), or partial nephrectomy high risk due to high complexity (R.E.N.A.L. 10 to 12) or tumor adjacent to hilar vessels.Pazopanib (800 mg once daily) was administered for 8 to 16 weeks with repeat imaging at completion of therapy, followed by surgery.RESULTS: A total of 25 patients enrolled with a median tumor size of 7.3 cm and a median R.E.N.A.L. score of 11.Of index lesions 80% were high complexity and 56% of patients had a solitary kidney.Patients received a median of 8 weeks of pazopanib.The median interval from treatment start to surgery was 10.6 weeks.R.E.N.A.L. score decreased in 71% of tumors and 92% of patients experienced a reduction in tumor volume.Six of 13 patients for whom partial nephrectomy was not possible at baseline were able to undergo partial nephrectomy after treatment.The mean parenchymal volume that could be saved with surgery increased from an estimated 107 to 173 cc (p = 0.0015).In 5 patients a urine leak developed, which was managed conservatively, and 7 received a transfusion, of whom 1 required embolization.CONCLUSIONS: Neoadjuvant pazopanib resulted in downsizing localized renal cell carcinoma, allowing for improved preservation of renal parenchyma and enabling partial nephrectomy in a select subset of patients who would otherwise require radical nephrectomy.",0,0,0,0

27869649,"Randomized trial of calcipotriol combined with 5-fluorouracil for skin cancer precursor immunotherapy.BACKGROUND: Actinic keratosis is a precursor to cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.Long treatment durations and severe side effects have limited the efficacy of current actinic keratosis treatments.Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is an epithelium-derived cytokine that induces a robust antitumor immunity in barrier-defective skin.Here, we investigated the efficacy of calcipotriol, a topical TSLP inducer, in combination with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) as an immunotherapy for actinic keratosis.METHODS: The mechanism of calcipotriol action against skin carcinogenesis was examined in genetically engineered mouse models.The efficacy and safety of 0.005% calcipotriol ointment combined with 5% 5-FU cream were compared with Vaseline plus 5-FU for the field treatment of actinic keratosis in a randomized, double-blind clinical trial involving 131 participants.The assigned treatment was self-applied to the entirety of the qualified anatomical sites (face, scalp, and upper extremities) twice daily for 4 consecutive days.The percentage of reduction in the number of actinic keratoses (primary outcome), local skin reactions, and immune activation parameters were assessed.RESULTS: Calcipotriol suppressed skin cancer development in mice in a TSLP-dependent manner.Four-day application of calcipotriol plus 5-FU versus Vaseline plus 5-FU led to an 87.8% versus 26.3% mean reduction in the number of actinic keratoses in participants (P < 0.0001).Importantly, calcipotriol plus 5-FU treatment induced TSLP, HLA class II, and natural killer cell group 2D (NKG2D) ligand expression in the lesional keratinocytes associated with a marked CD4+ T cell infiltration, which peaked on days 10-11 after treatment, without pain, crusting, or ulceration.CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate the synergistic effects of calcipotriol and 5-FU treatment in optimally activating a CD4+ T cell-mediated immunity against actinic keratoses and, potentially, cancers of the skin and other organs.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02019355.FUNDING: Not applicable (investigator-initiated clinical trial).",1,1,1,1
22101228,"The Family Health Promotion Project (FHPP): design and baseline data from a randomized trial to increase colonoscopy screening in high risk families.Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a significant cause of mortality and morbidity in the United States, much of which could be prevented through adequate screening.Consensus guidelines recommend that high-risk groups initiate screening earlier with colonoscopy and more frequently than average risk persons.However, a large proportion of high risk individuals do not receive regular colonoscopic screening.The Family Health Promotion Project (FHPP) is a randomized-controlled trial to test the effectiveness of a telephone-based counseling intervention to increase adherence to risk-appropriate colonoscopy screening in high risk individuals.Unaffected members of CRC families from two national cancer family registries were enrolled (n=632) and randomized to receive either a single session telephone counseling intervention using Motivational Interviewing techniques or a minimal mail-out intervention.The primary endpoint, rate of colonoscopy screening, was assessed at 6, 12 and 24 months post-enrollment.In this paper, we describe the research design and telephone counseling intervention of the FHPP trial, and report baseline data obtained from the two high risk cohorts recruited into this trial.Results obtained at baseline confirm the need for interventions to promote colonoscopy screening among these high risk individuals, as well as highlighting several key opportunities for intervention, including increasing knowledge about risk-appropriate screening guidelines, and providing both tailored risk information and barriers counseling.",0,0,0,0

27130929,"Comparing Breast Cancer Multiparameter Tests in the OPTIMA Prelim Trial: No Test Is More Equal Than the Others.BACKGROUND: Previous reports identifying discordance between multiparameter tests at the individual patient level have been largely attributed to methodological shortcomings of multiple in silico studies.Comparisons between tests, when performed using actual diagnostic assays, have been predicted to demonstrate high degrees of concordance.OPTIMA prelim compared predicted risk stratification and subtype classification of different multiparameter tests performed directly on the same population.METHODS: Three hundred thirteen women with early breast cancer were randomized to standard (chemotherapy and endocrine therapy) or test-directed (chemotherapy if Oncotype DX recurrence score >25) treatment.Risk stratification was also determined with Prosigna (PAM50), MammaPrint, MammaTyper, NexCourse Breast (IHC4-AQUA), and conventional IHC4 (IHC4).Subtype classification was provided by Blueprint, MammaTyper, and Prosigna.RESULTS: Oncotype DX predicted a higher proportion of tumors as low risk (82.1%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 77.8% to 86.4%) than were predicted low/intermediate risk using Prosigna (65.5%, 95% CI = 60.1% to 70.9%), IHC4 (72.0%, 95% CI = 66.5% to 77.5%), MammaPrint (61.4%, 95% CI = 55.9% to 66.9%), or NexCourse Breast (61.6%, 95% CI = 55.8% to 67.4%).Strikingly, the five tests showed only modest agreement when dichotomizing results between high vs low/intermediate risk.Only 119 (39.4%) tumors were classified uniformly as either low/intermediate risk or high risk, and 183 (60.6%) were assigned to different risk categories by different tests, although 94 (31.1%) showed agreement between four of five tests.All three subtype tests assigned 59.5% to 62.4% of tumors to luminal A subtype, but only 121 (40.1%) were classified as luminal A by all three tests and only 58 (19.2%) were uniformly assigned as nonluminal A. Discordant subtyping was observed in 123 (40.7%) tumors.CONCLUSIONS: Existing evidence on the comparative prognostic information provided by different tests suggests that current multiparameter tests provide broadly equivalent risk information for the population of women with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancers.However, for the individual patient, tests may provide differing risk categorization and subtype information.",0,0,0,0

25688512,"Rationale and protocol of the MetNET-1 trial, a prospective, single center, phase II study to evaluate the activity and safety of everolimus in combination with octreotide LAR and metformin in patients with advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.Abnormal PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway signalling and autocrine activation of the mTOR pathway, mediated through insulin-like growth factor-1, have been implicated in the proliferation of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (pNET) cells.Everolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, has shown antitumor benefit in pNETs alone and in combination with octreotide LAR in RADIANT-1 and RADIANT-3 studies.Although everolimus-based phase II/III trials have improved progression-free survival for pNET, its use has not impacted on prolonging overall survival.Metformin has recently shown some anti-cancer activity in both in vitro and in vivo studies by its indirect properties to decrease insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels and by its antitumour effect to promote AMPK activation and consequently inhibition to TSC1-2/mTOR complex.In light of even more retrospective evidence of metformin's anticancer activity, a prospective evaluation is required to either confirm or discard these preliminary findings.With the aim to evaluate the antiproliferative effect of metformin in combination with everolimus and octreotide LAR in pancreatic well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor patients, a single arm, prospective, single center phase II study was designed (MetNET-1 trial, NCT 02294006).Forty-three patients are expected to be evaluated.The study is ongoing, and recruitment is estimated to be completed in August 2016.The results will be anticipated in 2017.",0,0,0,0
25722381,"A randomized phase II study of the MEK1/MEK2 inhibitor trametinib (GSK1120212) compared with docetaxel in KRAS-mutant advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)dagger.BACKGROUND: KRAS mutations are detected in 25% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and no targeted therapies are approved for this subset population.Trametinib, a selective allosteric inhibitor of MEK1/MEK2, demonstrated preclinical and clinical activity in KRAS-mutant NSCLC.We report a phase II trial comparing trametinib with docetaxel in patients with advanced KRAS-mutant NSCLC.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients with histologically confirmed KRAS-mutant NSCLC previously treated with one prior platinum-based chemotherapy were randomly assigned in a ratio of 2 : 1 to trametinib (2 mg orally once daily) or docetaxel (75 mg/m(2) i.v.every 3 weeks).Crossover to the other arm after disease progression was allowed.Primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS).The study was prematurely terminated after the interim analysis of 92 PFS events, which showed the comparison of trametinib versus docetaxel for PFS crossed the futility boundary.RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-nine patients with KRAS-mutant NSCLC were randomized; of which, 86 patients received trametinib and 43 received docetaxel.Median PFS was 12 weeks in the trametinib arm and 11 weeks in the docetaxel arm (hazard ratio [HR] 1.14; 95% CI 0.75-1.75; P = 0.5197).Median overall survival, while the data are immature, was 8 months in the trametinib arm and was not reached in the docetaxel arm (HR 0.97; 95% CI 0.52-1.83; P = 0.934).There were 10 (12%) partial responses (PRs) in the trametinib arm and 5 (12%) PRs in the docetaxel arm (P = 1.0000).The most frequent adverse events (AEs) in >/=20% of trametinib patients were rash, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue.The most frequent grade 3 treatment-related AEs in the trametinib arm were hypertension, rash, diarrhea, and asthenia.CONCLUSION: Trametinib showed similar PFS and a response rate as docetaxel in patients with previously treated KRAS-mutant-positive NSCLC.CLINICALTRIALSGOV REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT01362296.",1,1,1,1

Post hoc analysis of safety data (adverse events [AEs]) was performed in a subgroup of patients aged <3 years at everolimus initiation.RESULTS: Eighteen patients (median age 1.82 years) were included; 16 were still receiving everolimus at the analysis cut-off date of January 11, 2013.Median everolimus exposure was 31.1 months (range, 11.5-39 months).One patient discontinued treatment because of AEs (ie, Acinetobacter bacteremia, increased blood alkaline phosphatase, and viral infection).AEs were reported in all patients, but events were mostly grade 1/2 in severity; 12 patients (66.7%) experienced grade 3 events, and 2 patients (11.1%) reported grade 4 events.The most common AEs were stomatitis, cough, pharyngitis, and pyrexia; no new safety issues were identified in this population.Serious AEs were reported in 50% of patients; these were suspected to be medication related in 4 patients (22.2%).CONCLUSIONS: Everolimus appears to be a safe therapeutic option for patients aged <3 years with TSC-associated SEGA.The small sample size in this subpopulation limits interpretation of the results; additional studies in the pediatric population are needed and are underway.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00789828.",0,0,0,0
23850170,"Which patients benefit most from primary surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy in stage IIIC or IV ovarian cancer? An exploratory analysis of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer 55971 randomised trial.BACKGROUND: To investigate whether biomarkers consisting of baseline characteristics of advanced stage ovarian cancer patients can help in identifying subgroups of patients who would benefit more from primary surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy.METHODS: We used data of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 55971 trial in which 670 patients were randomly assigned to primary surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy.The primary outcome was overall survival.Ten baseline clinical and pathological characteristics were selected as potential biomarkers.Using Subpopulation Treatment Effect Pattern Plots (STEPP), biomarkers with a statistically significant qualitative additive interaction with treatment were considered as potentially informative for treatment selection.We also combined selected biomarkers to form a multimarker treatment selection rule.FINDINGS: The size of the largest metastatic tumour and clinical stage were significantly associated with the magnitude of the benefit from treatment, in terms of five-year survival (p for interaction: 0.008 and 0.016, respectively).Stage IIIC patients with metastatic tumours 45 mm benefited more from primary surgery while stage IV patients with metastatic tumours >45 mm benefited more from neoadjuvant chemotherapy.In stage IIIC patients with larger metastatic tumours and in stage IV patients with less extensive metastatic tumours both treatments were equally effective.We estimated that by selecting treatments for patients based on largest metastatic tumour and clinical stage, the potential five-year survival rate in the population of treated patients would be 27.3% (95% confidence interval (CI) 21.9-33.0), 7.8% higher than if all were treated with primary surgery, and 5.6% higher if all were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.INTERPRETATION: Although survival was comparable after primary surgery and neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the overall group of patients with ovarian cancer in the EORTC 55971 trial, we found in this exploratory analysis that patients with stage IIIC and less extensive metastatic tumours had higher survival with primary surgery, while patients with stage IV disease and large metastatic tumours had higher survival with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.For patients who did not meet these criteria, both treatment options led to comparable survival rates.",1,1,1,1

23093232,"Is transnasal endoscope-assisted endoscopic submucosal dissection for gastric neoplasm useful in training beginners? A prospective randomized trial.BACKGROUND: The main problem in performing endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) of gastric neoplasms is that it is technically difficult, especially for beginners.METHODS: A total of 51 patients were randomly assigned to undergo transnasal endoscope-assisted or routine ESD performed by two endoscopists inexperienced in ESD while supervised by one expert.RESULTS: Total procedure time (p = 0.330), complete resection rate (p = 0.977), and complication rate (p = 0.157) were similar for the patients who underwent transnasal endoscope-assisted and routine ESD, but bleeding control time was significantly longer in the transnasal endoscope-assisted ESD group (p = 0.002).Three and six patients in the transnasal endoscope-assisted and routine ESD groups, respectively, were ""dropped out"" during the procedures (p = 0.291).The endoscopists tended to regard the traction with the transnasal endoscopeas more useful for large tumors (p = 0.062).Bleeding control in patients who underwent the transnasal endoscope-assisted ESD was significantly longer for patients with tumors located in the anterior wall, posterior wall, and lesser curvature of the stomach (p = 0.001).CONCLUSION: Transnasal endoscope-assisted ESD does not result in improved outcomes when performed by beginners, except for some large tumors.The traction method used by beginners was not superior to proper supervision and advice by an expert during ESD and allowing the expert to perform the procedure when the risk of complications is high or the procedure is delayed.",1,1,0,0
22306907,"Autologous cytokine-induced killer cell transfusion in combination with gemcitabine plus cisplatin regimen chemotherapy for metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma.In this study, we evaluate the efficacy of autologous cytokine-induced killer cells (CIK) transfusion used in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin (GC) chemotherapy to treat nasopharyngeal carcinoma in patients with distant metastasis after radiotherapy.From September 2007 to August 2008, 60 patients with distant metastasis after radiotherapy were followed up and were randomly divided into 2 groups.The 30 patients in the GC+CIK group were treated with adoptive autologous CIK cell transfusion in combination with GC chemotherapy; the 30 patients in the GC group were treated with chemotherapy alone.Short-term efficacy evaluation revealed that in the GC+CIK group, there were 3 cases of complete remission, 18 cases of partial remission, 2 cases of stabilization of disease, and 7 cases of progression of disease and the total effective rate was 70% (21/30).In the GC group, there were 0 cases of complete remission, 14 cases of partial remission, 3 case of stable disease, and 13 cases of progressive disease and the total effective rate was 46.7% (14/21).Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that the overall survival of the GC+CIK group was higher than that of the GC group, but the difference was not significant (P=0.1374, log-rank test).However, the progression-free survival of the GC+CIK group was significantly higher than that of the GC group (P=0.0234, log-rank test).Thus, our study indicated that CIK cell transfusion therapy used in combination with GC chemotherapy may be a more effective treatment for postradiotherapy distant metastasis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients.",1,1,1,1
26706665,"Recruitment strategies, design, and participant characteristics in a trial of weight-loss and metformin in breast cancer survivors.Weight loss and metformin are hypothesized to improve breast cancer outcomes; however the joint impacts of these treatments have not been investigated.Reach for Health is a randomized trial using a 2 x 2 factorial design to investigate the effects of weight loss and metformin on biomarkers associated with breast cancer prognosis among overweight/obese postmenopausal breast cancer survivors.This paper describes the trial recruitment strategies, design, and baseline sample characteristics.Participants were randomized in equal numbers to (1) placebo, (2) metformin, (3) weight loss intervention and placebo, or (4) weight-loss intervention and metformin.The lifestyle intervention was a personalized, telephone-based program targeting a 7% weight-loss in the intervention arm.The metformin dose was 1500 mg/day.The duration of the intervention was 6 months.Main outcomes were biomarkers representing 3 metabolic systems putatively related to breast cancer mortality: glucoregulation, inflammation, and sex hormones.Between August 2011 and May 2015, we randomized 333 breast cancer survivors.Mass mailings from the California Cancer Registry were the most successful recruitment strategy with over 25,000 letters sent at a cost of $191 per randomized participant.At baseline, higher levels of obesity were significantly associated with worse sleep disturbance and impairment scores, lower levels of physical activity and higher levels of sedentary behavior, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and lower quality of life (p<0.05 for all).These results illustrate the health burden of obesity.Results of this trial will provide mechanistic data on biological pathways and circulating biomarkers associated with lifestyle and pharmacologic interventions to improve breast cancer prognosis.",0,0,0,0
22494567,"Efficacy and safety of maintenance erlotinib in Asian patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer: a subanalysis of the phase III, randomized SATURN study.Maintenance therapy, commenced immediately after the completion of first-line chemotherapy, is a promising strategy for improving treatment outcomes in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).The global phase III SequentiAl Tarceva in UnResectable NSCLC (SATURN) study evaluated the efficacy and safety of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine-kinase inhibitor erlotinib as maintenance treatment in NSCLC patients without progression after first-line chemotherapy.We report a retrospective subanalysis of Asian patients enrolled in SATURN.Patients with advanced NSCLC with no evidence of progression after four cycles of chemotherapy were randomized to receive erlotinib 150 mg/day or placebo, until progressive disease or limiting toxicity.The co-primary endpoints of SATURN were progression-free survival (PFS) in all patients and in those with positive EGFR immunohistochemistry (IHC) status.Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), disease control rate, safety, quality of life (QoL) and biomarker analyses.In total, 126 patients from East and South-East Asian centers were randomized (14% of the intent-to-treat population): 88 from Korea, 28 from China and 10 from Malaysia; one patient was excluded from this analysis due to Indian ethnicity.PFS was significantly prolonged in the erlotinib treatment arm, both overall (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.57; p=0.0067) and in patients with EGFR IHC-positive disease (HR=0.50; p=0.0057).There was a trend towards an increase in OS, which reached statistical significance in the EGFR IHC-positive subgroup (p=0.0233).The overall response rate was significantly higher with erlotinib compared with placebo (24% versus 5%; p=0.0025).Erlotinib was generally well tolerated and had no negative impact on QoL in this subpopulation.The most common treatment-related adverse events were rash, diarrhea and pruritus.Erlotinib was effective and well tolerated in Asian patients, producing benefits consistent with those observed in the overall SATURN population.Maintenance treatment with erlotinib appears to be a useful option for the management of Asian patients with advanced NSCLC without progression after first-line chemotherapy.",1,1,1,1
28159846,"Standardised versus individualised multiherb Chinese herbal medicine for oligomenorrhoea and amenorrhoea in polycystic ovary syndrome: a randomised feasibility and pilot study in the UK.OBJECTIVES: To explore feasibility of a randomised study using standardised or individualised multiherb Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) for oligomenorrhoea and amenorrhoea in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), to pilot study methods and to obtain clinical data to support sample size calculations.DESIGN: Prospective, pragmatic, randomised feasibility and pilot study with participant and practitioner blinding.SETTING: 2 private herbal practices in the UK.PARTICIPANTS: 40 women diagnosed with PCOS and oligomenorrhoea or amenorrhoea following Rotterdam criteria.INTERVENTION: 6 months of either standardised CHM or individualised CHM, 16 g daily taken orally as a tea.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Our primary objective was to determine whether oligomenorrhoea and amenorrhoea were appropriate as the primary outcome measures for the main study.Estimates of treatment effects were obtained for menstrual rate, body mass index (BMI), weight and hirsutism.Data were collected regarding safety, feasibility and acceptability.RESULTS: Of the 40 participants recruited, 29 (72.5%) completed the study.The most frequently cited symptoms of concern were hirsutism, weight and menstrual irregularity.Statistically significant improvements in menstrual rates were found at 6 months within group for both standardised CHM (mean difference (MD) 0.18+/-0.06, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.29; p=0.0027) and individualised CHM (MD 0.27+/-0.06, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.39; p<0.001), though not between group (p=0.26).No improvements were observed for BMI nor for weight in either group.Improvements in hirsutism scores found within group for both groups were not statistically significant between group (p=0.09).Liver and kidney function and adverse events data were largely normal.Participant feedback suggests changing to tablet administration could facilitate adherence.CONCLUSIONS: A CHM randomised controlled trial for PCOS is feasible and preliminary data suggest that both individualised and standardised multiherb CHMs have similar safety profiles and clinical effects on promoting menstrual regularity.These data will inform the design of a study in primary care that will incorporate an appropriate control.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN 31072075; Results.",1,0,0,0
27061082,"Randomized phase III trial of amrubicin/cisplatin versus etoposide/cisplatin as first-line treatment for extensive small-cell lung cancer.BACKGROUND: Extensive-disease small-cell lung cancer (ED-SCLC) is characterized by rapid progression and relapse, despite high initial response rates to chemotherapy.The primary objective of this trial was to demonstrate the non-inferiority of amrubicin and cisplatin (AP) combination therapy compared with the standard first-line regimen of etoposide and cisplatin (EP) for previously untreated ED-SCLC in a Chinese population.When non-inferiority was verified, the objective was switched from non-inferiority to superiority.METHODS: From June 2008 to July 2010, 300 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio to AP and EP groups.AP-treated patients received cisplatin (60 mg/m(2), day 1) and amrubicin (40 mg/m(2), days 1-3) once every 21 days.EP-treated patients received cisplatin (80 mg/m(2), day 1) and etoposide (100 mg/m(2), days 1-3) once every 21 days.Treatment was continued for four to six cycles, except in cases of progressive disease or toxicity, and patient refusal.RESULTS: Median overall survival (OS) for AP vs. EP treatment was 11.8 vs. 10.3 months (p = 0.08), respectively, demonstrating non-inferiority of AP to EP (AP group: 95% confidence interval for hazard ratio 0.63-1.03 months).Median progression-free survival and overall response rates for AP vs. EP groups were 6.8 vs. 5.7 months (p = 0.35) and 69.8% vs. 57.3%, respectively.Drug-related adverse events in both groups were similar, with neutropenia being the most frequent (AP 54.4%; EP 44.0%).Leukopenia, pyrexia, and fatigue were more prevalent in the AP group, but all were clinically reversible and manageable.CONCLUSIONS: AP therapy demonstrated non-inferiority to EP therapy, prolonging OS for 1.5 months, but this difference was not statistically significant; thus we propose AP as a promising treatment option for ED-SCLC in China.TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was registered on 10 April 2008 (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00660504).",1,1,1,1
22965507,"Sclerotherapy of simple hepatic cysts by repeated aspiration and alcohol instillation.BACKGROUND/AIMS: The efficacy and safety of traditional alcohol sclerotherapy procedures are controversial in the management of large simple hepatic cysts.In this study, we aimed to develop and evaluate a novel alcohol sclerotherapy procedure, termed repeated aspiration and alcohol instillation sclerotherapy, for the treatment of simple hepatic cysts.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective, double-blind, randomized study was performed.Sixty-seven patients with large simple hepatic cysts were randomized into two groups to receive either single-session alcohol retention sclerotherapy (alcohol was instilled into the cyst cavity, kept for 20 minutes and aspirated) or repeated aspiration and alcohol instillation sclerotherapy (instillation of 30-70 ml of alcohol and immediate aspiration with repetition 3 to 6 times until the estimated alcohol concentration exceeded 80%).The cyst volume reduction was calculated to compare the efficacy of the two procedures.We evaluated the safety of the procedure by monitoring side effects and assaying blood alcohol concentrations at 0, 0.5, 1, 2 and 3 hours after sclerotherapy.RESULTS: The cyst volume reduction in patients undergoing repeated aspiration and alcohol instillation sclerotherapy was significantly higher than that in those receiving alcohol-retention sclerotherapy.The concentration of alcohol in the last aspirated cyst fluid was correlated with the mean volume reduction in patients undergoing repeated aspiration and alcohol instillation sclerotherapy but not in the alcohol-retention group.Only minor side effects occurred in both groups.Although elevated blood alcohol concentration was noted in all patients, it declined to normal levels within 2-3 hours after treatment.There were no significant differences in blood alcohol concentration between the two groups.CONCLUSIONS: Repeated aspiration and alcohol instillation sclerotherapy is superior to single-session alcohol-retention sclerotherapy in the management of large simple hepatic cysts.",0,0,0,0

27498129,"Toxicity of dual HER2-blockade with pertuzumab added to anthracycline versus non-anthracycline containing chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment in HER2-positive breast cancer: The TRAIN-2 study.BACKGROUND: The addition of pertuzumab to neoadjuvant trastuzumab-based chemotherapy improves pathologic complete response rates in HER2-positive breast cancer.However, increased toxicity has been reported with the addition of pertuzumab, and this may differ between various chemotherapy backbone regimens.We evaluated toxicities of pertuzumab when added to either FEC-T (5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide, trastuzumab) or weekly paclitaxel, trastuzumab, carboplatin (PTC).METHODS: The TRAIN-2 study is a neoadjuvant randomized controlled trial in stage II and III HER2-positive breast cancer (NCT01996267).Patients are randomly assigned to receive either three cycles of FEC-T plus pertuzumab or three cycles of PTC plus pertuzumab, followed by six cycles of PTC plus pertuzumab in both arms.Toxicities are described per treatment arm according to the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03.RESULTS: This analysis includes 110 patients balanced over both treatment arms.Neutropenia was the most common hematologic toxicity, with grade 3-4 occurring in 53% in the FEC-T-arm and in 51% in the PTC-arm.Febrile neutropenia occurred in 9% in the FEC-T arm and did not occur in the PTC-arm.Secondary G-CSF prophylaxis was used in 35-40% of patients.Asymptomatic ejection fraction decrease grade 2 was observed in 24% in the FEC-T-arm and 11% in the PTC-arm.The most common grade 3-4 non-hematologic toxicity was diarrhea (5% in the FEC-T-arm and 18% in the PTC-arm).CONCLUSIONS: Pertuzumab in combination with FEC-T mostly causes neutropenia, and when added to PTC mostly causes diarrhea.Significant cardiac toxicity is rare with both regimens, and toxicity is overall well manageable.",1,1,1,1
22488488,"The impact of PLCO control arm contamination on perceived PSA screening efficacy.PURPOSE: To quantify the extent to which a clinically significant prostate cancer mortality reduction due to screening could have been masked by control arm screening (contamination) in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) trial.METHODS: We used three independently developed models of prostate cancer natural history to conduct a virtual PLCO trial.Simulated participants underwent pre-trial screening based on population patterns.The intervention arm followed observed compliance during the trial then resumed population screening.A contaminated control arm followed observed contamination during the trial then resumed population screening, while an uncontaminated control arm discontinued screening upon entry.We assumed a clinically significant screening benefit, applied population treatments and survival patterns, and calculated mortality rate ratios relative to the contaminated and uncontaminated control arms.RESULTS: The virtual trial reproduced observed incidence, including stage and grade distributions, and control arm mortality after 10 years of complete follow-up.Under the assumed screening benefit, the three models found that contamination increased the mortality rate ratio from 0.68-0.77 to 0.86-0.91, increased the chance of excess mortality in the intervention arm from 0-4 % to 15-28 %, and decreased the power of the trial to detect a mortality difference from 40-70 % to 9-25 %.CONCLUSIONS: Our computer simulation models indicate that contamination substantially limited the ability of the PLCO to identify a clinically significant screening benefit.While the trial shows annual screening does not reduce mortality relative to population screening, contamination prevents concluding whether screening reduces mortality relative to no screening.",0,0,0,0
23650416,"Randomized phase II, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of exemestane with or without entinostat in postmenopausal women with locally recurrent or metastatic estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer progressing on treatment with a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor.PURPOSE: Entinostat is an oral isoform selective histone deacetylase inhibitor that targets resistance to hormonal therapies in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer.This randomized, placebo-controlled, phase II study evaluated entinostat combined with the aromatase inhibitor exemestane versus exemestane alone.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Postmenopausal women with ER+ advanced breast cancer progressing on a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor were randomly assigned to exemestane 25 mg daily plus entinostat 5 mg once per week (EE) or exemestane plus placebo (EP).The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS).Blood was collected in a subset of patients for evaluation of protein lysine acetylation as a biomarker of entinostat activity.RESULTS: One hundred thirty patients were randomly assigned (EE group, n = 64; EP group, n = 66).Based on intent-to-treat analysis, treatment with EE improved median PFS to 4.3 months versus 2.3 months with EP (hazard ratio [HR], 0.73; 95% CI, 0.50 to 1.07; one-sided P = .055; two-sided P = .11 [predefined significance level of .10, one-sided]).Median overall survival was an exploratory end point and improved to 28.1 months with EE versus 19.8 months with EP (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.97; P = .036).Fatigue and neutropenia were the most frequent grade 3/4 toxicities.Treatment discontinuation because of adverse events was higher in the EE group versus the EP group (11% v 2%).Protein lysine hyperacetylation in the EE biomarker subset was associated with prolonged PFS.CONCLUSION: Entinostat added to exemestane is generally well tolerated and demonstrated activity in patients with ER+ advanced breast cancer in this signal-finding phase II study.Acetylation changes may provide an opportunity to maximize clinical benefit with entinostat.Plans for a confirmatory study are underway.",1,1,1,1
22237467,"Randomized clinical trial of omega-3 fatty acid-supplemented enteral nutrition versus standard enteral nutrition in patients undergoing oesophagogastric cancer surgery.BACKGROUND: Oesophagogastric cancer surgery is immunosuppressive.This may be modulated by omega-3 fatty acids (O-3FAs).The aim of this study was to assess the effect of perioperative O-3FAs on clinical outcome and immune function after oesophagogastric cancer surgery.METHODS: Patients undergoing subtotal oesophagectomy and total gastrectomy were recruited and allocated randomly to an O-3FA enteral immunoenhancing diet (IED) or standard enteral nutrition (SEN) for 7 days before and after surgery, or to postoperative supplementation alone (control group).Clinical outcome, fatty acid concentrations, and HLA-DR expression on monocytes and activated T lymphocytes were determined before and after operation.RESULTS: Of 221 patients recruited, 26 were excluded.Groups (IED, 66; SEN, 63; control, 66) were matched for age, malnutrition and co-morbidity.There were no differences in morbidity (P = 0.646), mortality (P = 1.000) or hospital stay (P = 0.701) between the groups.O-3FA concentrations were higher in the IED group after supplementation (P < 0.001).The ratio of omega-6 fatty acid to O-3FA was 1.9:1, 4.1:1 and 4.8:1 on the day before surgery in the IED, SEN and control groups (P < 0.001).There were no differences between the groups in HLA-DR expression in either monocytes (P = 0.538) or activated T lymphocytes (P = 0.204).CONCLUSION: Despite a significant increase in plasma concentrations of O-3FA, immunonutrition with O-3FA did not affect overall HLA-DR expression on leucocytes or clinical outcome following oesophagogastric cancer surgery.REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN43730758 (http://www.controlled-trials.com).",1,1,0,0

23233657,"High cereblon expression is associated with better survival in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma treated with thalidomide maintenance.Recently, cereblon (CRBN) expression was found to be essential for the activity of thalidomide and lenalidomide.In the present study, we investigated whether the clinical efficacy of thalidomide in multiple myeloma is associated with CRBN expression in myeloma cells.Patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma were included in the HOVON-65/GMMG-HD4 trial, in which postintensification treatment in 1 arm consisted of daily thalidomide (50 mg) for 2 years.Gene-expression profiling, determined at the start of the trial, was available for 96 patients who started thalidomide maintenance.In this patient set, increase of CRBN gene expression was significantly associated with longerprogression-free survival (P = .005).In contrast, no association between CRBN expression and survival was observed in the arm with bortezomib maintenance.We conclude that CRBN expression may be associated with the clinical efficacy of thalidomide.This trial has been registered at the Nederlands Trial Register (www.trialregister.nl) as NTR213; at the European Union Drug Regulating Authorities Clinical Trials (EudraCT) as 2004-000944-26; and at the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) as 64455289.",1,1,1,1
27129176,"Thalidomide enhanced the efficacy of CHOP chemotherapy in the treatment of diffuse large B cell lymphoma: A phase II study.Cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone plus rituximab (R-CHOP) is the standard treatment for patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL).However, rituximab cannot be popularly applied in a considerable number of patients with DLBCL because of economic reasons.To develop a new regimen to improve the outcome of these patients is extremely important.In our study, sixty five patients with DLBCL were randomly assigned to thalidomide plus CHOP group (n=32) or to CHOP alone group (n=33).Objective response rates (ORR) and complete remission rates (CRR) were 96.7% and 80.6% in T-CHOP group versus 78.9 % and 57.8 % in CHOP group, respectively (P <0.05).At a median follow-up of 96 months, median PFS for T-CHOP group was still not reached yet, and in CHOP group it was 22.9 months (95% CI [0-50.4]).(P=0.163).Median overall survival (OS) for T-CHOP group was also not reached, and the estimated median OS for CHOP group was 83.5 months, the difference of OS between the two groups is not significant (p=0.263). But, in patients with Bcl-2 positive and Bcl-6 negative, the median PFS in T-CHOP group was longer than that in CHOP group (111.0 vs 8.5 months (P=0.017).In addition, thalidomide did not significantly increase the grade 3/4 toxicity of CHOP.We concluded that the addition of thalidomide to the CHOP regimen significantly improved the CRR and showed a trend of improving clinical outcome in patients with DLBCL, especially for patients with Bcl-2 positive and Bcl-6 negative B-cell phenotype, without increased toxicity.",1,1,1,1
28188670,"A randomized phase II trial of personalized peptide vaccine with low dose cyclophosphamide in biliary tract cancer.Since the prognosis of advanced biliary tract cancer (aBTC) still remains very poor, new therapeutic approaches, including immunotherapies, need to be developed.In the current study, we conducted an open-label randomized phase II study to test whether low dose cyclophosphamide (CPA) could improve antigen-specific immune responses and clinical efficacy of personalized peptide vaccination (PPV) in 49 previously treated aBTC patients.Patients with aBTC refractory to at least one regimen of chemotherapies were randomly assigned to receive PPV with low dose CPA (100 mg/day for 7 days before vaccination) (PPV/CPA, n = 24) or PPV alone (n = 25).A maximum of four HLA-matched peptides were selected based on the pre-existing peptide-specific IgG responses, followed by subcutaneous administration.T cell responses to the vaccinated peptides in the PPV/CPA arm tended to be greater than those in the PPV alone arm.The PPV/CPA arm showed significantly better progression-free survival (median time: 6.1 vs 2.9 months; hazard ratio (HR): 0.427; P = 0.008) and overall survival (median time: 12.1 vs 5.9 months; HR: 0.376; P = 0.004), compared to the PPV alone arm.The PPV alone arm, but not the PPV/CPA arm, showed significant increase in plasma IL-6 after vaccinations, which might be associated with inhibition of antigen-specific T cell responses.These results suggested that combined treatment with low dose CPA could provide clinical benefits in aBTC patients under PPV, possibly through prevention of IL-6-mediated immune suppression.Further clinical studies would be recommended to clarify the clinical efficacy of PPV/CPA in aBTC patients.",1,1,1,1
28412590,"Baseline carcinoembryonic antigen as a predictive factor of ramucirumab efficacy in RAISE, a second-line metastatic colorectal carcinoma phase III trial.BACKGROUND: The RAISE phase III clinical trial demonstrated that ramucirumab + (folinic acid plus 5-fluorouracil plus irinotecan) FOLFIRI significantly improved overall survival (OS) versus placebo + FOLFIRI for second-line metastatic colorectal carcinoma (mCRC) patients failing bevacizumab- and oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.73-0.98, P = 0.022).Post hoc analyses of RAISE patient data examined the association of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) subgroups with efficacy parameters.METHODS: CEA subgroups (</=10 versus >10 ng/ml) were based on 2X upper limit of normal (ULN) (5 ng/ml).The Kaplan-Meier method estimated the median OS and the progression-free survival (PFS).Log-rank test compared the survival distributions within the subgroups.Hazard ratio (HR) (95% confidence interval [CI]) and treatment-by-subgroup interaction p-values were calculated by Cox proportional hazards model.RESULTS: Ramucirumab treatment prolonged survival for the CEA </=10 subgroup (HR = 0.68; 95% CI = 0.50-0.92; P = 0.013) and CEA >10 subgroup (HR = 0.90; 95% CI = 0.76-1.07; P = 0.233).However, the ramucirumab OS benefit over placebo was greater for the CEA </=10 subgroup than for the CEA >10 subgroup (median OS: 3.6 versus 0.8 months greater, respectively).The interaction P-value between CEA level and treatment effect on OS was 0.088.This trend was observed across randomisation strata and to a lesser extent for PFS (P = 0.594).CONCLUSIONS: Although patients in both high- and low-CEA subgroups derive OS and PFS benefits from ramucirumab treatment, the low baseline CEA level may identify a subgroup of patients with mCRC who obtain greater benefit from ramucirumab.",1,1,1,1

OS rates at 8 years were 78% with FEC alone and 83.2% with FEC-D. Cox regression analysis adjusted for age and number of positive nodes showed a 15% reduction in the relative risk of relapse and a 25% reduction in the relative risk of death in favor of FEC-D. Significant relative risk reductions were observed in the HR-positive, HER2-positive, and Ki67 >/=20% subpopulations.CONCLUSION: Benefits for DFS and OS rates with the sequential FEC-D regimen are fully confirmed at 8 years.",1,1,1,1
24573743,"A phase II open-label randomized multicenter trial of TSU-68 in combination with S-1 and oxaliplatin versus S-1 in combination with oxaliplatin in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide.The combination of oxaliplatin-based treatments (oxaliplatin plus infusional 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin [FOLFOX] or oxaliplatin plus capecitabine [CapeOX]) and bevacizumab is a standard chemotherapy regimen for metastatic CRC (mCRC).However, several clinical studies that tested S-1 plus oxaliplatin (SOX) indicate that SOX is also a treatment option for mCRC.TSU-68 is an oral compound that inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptor and platelet-derived growth factor receptor.The recommended dose of TSU-68 + SOX was previously determined in a phase I study of mCRC patients.The goal of this trial was to evaluate the efficacy of TSU-68 in combination with SOX.METHODS: This open-label multicenter randomized phase II trial was performed in Korea.Treatment-naive mCRC patients with a performance status of 0 or 1 were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either TSU-68 + SOX or SOX alone.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS).RESULTS: A total of 105 patients (TSU-68 + SOX, 52 patients; SOX alone, 53 patients) were randomized.The median PFS was 7.0 months in the TSU-68 + SOX group (hazard ratio [HR], 1.057) and 7.2 months in the SOX group (p = 0.8401).The most frequent grade 3 and 4 adverse events were thrombocytopenia (9.6 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 26.4 % [SOX]), neutropenia (13.5 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 15.1 % [SOX]), and anemia (3.8 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 13.2 % [SOX]).We observed a difference between the 2 groups for all grades of anemia (15.4 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 32.1 % [SOX]), diarrhea (30.8 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 47.2 % [SOX]), vomiting (50.0 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 26.4 % [SOX]), and chromaturia (23.1 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 0.0 % [SOX]).Analysis using a Cox proportional hazard model showed that baseline interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels were associated with a survival benefit of TSU-68 (p = 0.012).CONCLUSION: TSU-68 + SOX had a favorable safety profile.However, TSU-68 did not have a synergistic effect on the efficacy of SOX.The baseline serum IL-6 level could be a prognostic factor for TSU-68 efficacy.",1,1,1,1

28577938,"Evaluation of the VeriStrat((R)) serum protein test in patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the lung treated with second-line afatinib or erlotinib in the phase III LUX-Lung 8 study.OBJECTIVES: Identification of biomarkers associated with clinical benefit may be crucial in establishing optimal treatment choice for patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the lung after first-line chemotherapy.In this study, the ability of the VeriStrat serum protein test to predict differential clinical benefit with afatinib versus erlotinib, and the association of VeriStrat status with clinical outcomes irrespective of EGFR-TKI used, was assessed in a retrospective analysis of the phase III LUX-Lung 8 trial.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pretreatment plasma samples were analyzed using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.Spectra were evaluated to assign a VeriStrat 'Good' (VS-G) or VeriStrat 'Poor' (VS-P) classification.Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival, and other endpoints were assessed with respect to pretreatment VeriStrat status; OS was the primary efficacy variable.Outcomes with other efficacy endpoints were similar.RESULTS: Of 795 patients randomized in LUX-Lung 8, 675 were classified (VS-G: 412; VS-P: 263).In the VS-G group, OS was significantly longer with afatinib versus erlotinib (HR 0.79 [95% CI: 0.63-0.98]).In the VS-P group, there was no significant difference in OS between afatinib and erlotinib (HR 0.90 [0.70-1.16]).However, there was no interaction between VeriStrat classification and treatment group for OS (pinteraction=0.5303).OS was significantly longer in VS-G versus VS-P patients, both in the overall VeriStrat-classified population (HR 0.41 [0.35-0.49]) and afatinib-treated patients (HR 0.40 [0.31-0.51]).Multivariate analysis showed that VeriStrat was an independent predictor of OS in afatinib-treated patients, regardless of ECOG PS or best response to first-line chemotherapy.CONCLUSION: VS-G classification is strongly associated with favorable survival outcomes with either afatinib or erlotinib compared with VS-P classification.In VS-G patients, survival outcomes with afatinib are superior to those with erlotinib.VeriStrat classification may guide treatment decisions in patients with SCC of the lung.ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT01523587.",1,1,1,1

Investigator-assessed median progression-free survival was 9.2 months (95% CI, 7.4 to 15.6) and 12.9 months (95% CI, 11.1 to not reached) in arms A and B, respectively.Independent review committee-assessed intracranial ORR in patients with measurable brain metastases at baseline was 42% (11 of 26 patients) in arm A and 67% (12 of 18 patients) in arm B. Common treatment-emergent adverse events were nausea (arm A/B, 33%/40%), diarrhea (arm A/B, 19%/38%), headache (arm A/B, 28%/27%), and cough (arm A/B, 18%/34%), and were mainly grades 1 to 2.A subset of pulmonary adverse events with early onset (median onset: day 2) occurred in 14 of 219 treated patients (all grades, 6%; grade >/= 3, 3%); none occurred after escalation to 180 mg in arm B. Seven of 14 patients were successfully retreated with brigatinib.Conclusion Brigatinib yielded substantial whole-body and intracranial responses as well as robust progression-free survival; 180 mg (with lead-in) showed consistently better efficacy than 90 mg, with acceptable safety.",1,1,1,1
23494582,"Transient swelling versus lymphoedema in the first year following surgery for breast cancer.PURPOSE: The aim was to better understand the incidence, time course and risk factors for swelling in the arm on the side of surgery over the first year following surgery for breast cancer.METHOD: Women (n = 160) were assessed 1 month following surgery and then randomised to the exercise or control group.Reassessment occurred 3, 9 and 15 months following surgery.Potential risk factors for swelling included age, body mass index, side of surgery and surgical and medical treatments for their breast cancer, physical measures of shoulder range of motion and strength, inter-limb arm circumference difference and the group to which they were randomised.Swelling was determined using bioimpedance spectroscopy with reference to previously established cut-offs for lymphoedema.RESULTS: The number of women with swelling at 3, 9 and 15 months was 15, 15 and 13, respectively; however, at 15 months only 5/13 presented with swelling in either of the preceding assessments.The risk of swelling increased at 3, 9 and 15 months for each centimetre increase in the baseline inter-limb difference in sum of arm circumferences by 1.30, 1.17 and 1.14.In addition, risk of swelling at 3 months was 2.6 times greater for women in the control group; at 9 months, 7 times greater for women who had taxane-based chemotherapy; and at 15 months, the risk increased 1.16 times for each day the drain was in situ.CONCLUSION: Swelling in the first year is likely to be transient, and factors including exercise and taxane chemotherapy affect the risk of developing swelling.",0,0,0,0

Part 2 assessed efficacy and safety of siltuximab plus M/P versus M/P alone.The primary end-point was progression-free survival (PFS).Progression was defined as progressive disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST), or >/= 3 new skeletal lesions with clinical deterioration or without deterioration confirmed by repeated bone scan.Rising prostate-specific antigen was not considered progression.RESULTS: Siltuximab plus M/P was well tolerated in Part 1 (n=9).In Part 2, 48 and 49 patients received siltuximab plus M/P or M/P alone, respectively.Enrolment was prematurely terminated by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee since an apparent imbalance in patient baseline characteristics (favoring the M/P only arm) made it unlikely that the study could achieve its primary efficacy end-point.Median PFS was 97 days with siltuximab combination and 228 days with M/P alone (hazard ratio, 1.72; P=0.043).Use of a novel non-validated PFS definition may have contributed to this result.Abnormal laboratory assessments were more frequent with the combination.Infection and febrile neutropenia rates were similar between groups.Greater C-reactive protein suppression was achieved during siltuximab combination treatment compared with M/P alone (P=0.0003).CONCLUSION: While siltuximab plus M/P appeared well tolerated, improvement in outcomes was not demonstrated.",0,0,0,0
28111430,"Incorporating Erlotinib or Irinotecan Plus Cisplatin into Chemoradiotherapy for Stage III Non-small Cell Lung Cancer According to EGFR Mutation Status.PURPOSE: Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) is the standard care for stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients; however, a more effective regimen is needed to improve the outcome by better controlling occult metastases.We conducted two parallel randomized phase II studies to incorporate erlotinib or irinotecan-cisplatin (IP) into CCRT for stage III NSCLC depending on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation status.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with EGFR-mutant tumors were randomized to receive three cycles of erlotinib first and then either CCRT with erlotinib followed by erlotinib (arm A) or CCRT with IP only (arm B).Patients with EGFR unknown or wild-type tumors were randomized to receive either three cycles of IP before (arm C) or after CCRT with IP (arm D).RESULTS: Seventy-three patients were screened and the study was closed early because of slow accrual after 59 patients were randomized.Overall, there were seven patients in arm A, five in arm B, 22 in arm C, and 25 in arm D. The response rate was 71.4% and 80.0% for arm A and B, and 70.0% and 73.9% for arm C and D.

28188670,"A randomized phase II trial of personalized peptide vaccine with low dose cyclophosphamide in biliary tract cancer.Since the prognosis of advanced biliary tract cancer (aBTC) still remains very poor, new therapeutic approaches, including immunotherapies, need to be developed.In the current study, we conducted an open-label randomized phase II study to test whether low dose cyclophosphamide (CPA) could improve antigen-specific immune responses and clinical efficacy of personalized peptide vaccination (PPV) in 49 previously treated aBTC patients.Patients with aBTC refractory to at least one regimen of chemotherapies were randomly assigned to receive PPV with low dose CPA (100 mg/day for 7 days before vaccination) (PPV/CPA, n = 24) or PPV alone (n = 25).A maximum of four HLA-matched peptides were selected based on the pre-existing peptide-specific IgG responses, followed by subcutaneous administration.T cell responses to the vaccinated peptides in the PPV/CPA arm tended to be greater than those in the PPV alone arm.The PPV/CPA arm showed significantly better progression-free survival (median time: 6.1 vs 2.9 months; hazard ratio (HR): 0.427; P = 0.008) and overall survival (median time: 12.1 vs 5.9 months; HR: 0.376; P = 0.004), compared to the PPV alone arm.The PPV alone arm, but not the PPV/CPA arm, showed significant increase in plasma IL-6 after vaccinations, which might be associated with inhibition of antigen-specific T cell responses.These results suggested that combined treatment with low dose CPA could provide clinical benefits in aBTC patients under PPV, possibly through prevention of IL-6-mediated immune suppression.Further clinical studies would be recommended to clarify the clinical efficacy of PPV/CPA in aBTC patients.",1,1,1,1

26481741,"Does Early Postsurgical Temozolomide Plus Concomitant Radiochemotherapy Regimen Have Any Benefit in Newly-diagnosed Glioblastoma Patients? A Multi-center, Randomized, Parallel, Open-label, Phase II Clinical Trial.BACKGROUND: The radiochemotherapy regimen concomitantly employing temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy and radiotherapy (RT) 4 weeks after surgery, followed by 6 cycles of TMZ is a common treatment for glioblastoma (GBM).However, its median overall survival (OS) is only 14.6 months.This study was to explore the effectiveness and safety of early TMZ chemotherapy between surgery and chemoradiotherapy plus the standard concomitant radiochemotherapy regimen.METHODS: A randomized, parallel group, open-label study of 99 newly diagnosed GBM patients was conducted at 10 independent Chinese neurosurgical departments from June 2008 to June 2012.Patients were treated with concomitant radiochemotherapy regimen plus early postsurgical temozolomide (early TMZ group) or standard concomitant radiochemotherapy regimen (control group).Overall response was assessed based on objective tumor assessments, administration of corticosteroid and neurological status test.Hematological, biochemical, laboratory, adverse event (AE), and neurological condition were measured for 24 months of follow-up.The primary efficacy endpoint of this study was overall survival (OS).The secondary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS).RESULTS: The median OS time in the early TMZ group was 17.6 months, compared with 13.2 months in the control group (log-rank test P = 0.021).In addition, the OS rate in the early TMZ group was higher at 6, 12, and 18 months than in the control group, respectively (P < 0.05).The median PFS time was 8.7 months in the early TMZ group and 10.4 months in the control group (log-rank test P = 0.695).AEs occurred in 29 (55.8%) and 31(73.8%) patients respectively in early and control groups, including nausea (15.4% vs. 33.3%), vomiting (7.7% vs. 28.6%), fever (7.7% vs. 11.9%), and headache (3.8% vs. 23.8%).Only 30.8% and 33.3% were drug-related, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Addition of TMZ chemotherapy in the early break of the standard concomitant radiochemotherapy regimen was well tolerated and significantly improved the OS of the GBM patients, compared with standard concomitant radiochemotherapy regimen.However, a larger randomized trial is warranted to verify these results.",1,1,1,0

27339115,"Conventional versus hypofractionated high-dose intensity-modulated radiotherapy for prostate cancer: 5-year outcomes of the randomised, non-inferiority, phase 3 CHHiP trial.BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer might have high radiation-fraction sensitivity that would give a therapeutic advantage to hypofractionated treatment.We present a pre-planned analysis of the efficacy and side-effects of a randomised trial comparing conventional and hypofractionated radiotherapy after 5 years follow-up.METHODS: CHHiP is a randomised, phase 3, non-inferiority trial that recruited men with localised prostate cancer (pT1b-T3aN0M0).Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to conventional (74 Gy delivered in 37 fractions over 7.4 weeks) or one of two hypofractionated schedules (60 Gy in 20 fractions over 4 weeks or 57 Gy in 19 fractions over 3.8 weeks)all delivered with intensity-modulated techniques.Most patients were given radiotherapy with 3-6 months of neoadjuvant and concurrent androgen suppression.Randomisation was by computer-generated random permuted blocks, stratified by National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk group and radiotherapy treatment centre, and treatment allocation was not masked.The primary endpoint was time to biochemical or clinical failure; the critical hazard ratio (HR) for non-inferiority was 1.208.Analysis was by intention to treat.Long-term follow-up continues.The CHHiP trial is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN97182923.FINDINGS: Between Oct 18, 2002, and June 17, 2011, 3216 men were enrolled from 71 centres and randomly assigned (74 Gy group, 1065 patients; 60 Gy group, 1074 patients; 57 Gy group, 1077 patients).Median follow-up was 62.4 months (IQR 53.9-77.0).The proportion of patients who were biochemical or clinical failure free at 5 years was 88.3% (95% CI 86.0-90.2) in the 74 Gy group, 90.6% (88.5-92.3) in the 60 Gy group, and 85.9% (83.4-88.0) in the 57 Gy group.60 Gy was non-inferior to 74 Gy (HR 0.84 [90% CI 0.68-1.03], pNI=0.0018) but non-inferiority could not be claimed for 57 Gy compared with 74 Gy (HR 1.20 [0.99-1.46], pNI=0.48).Long-term side-effects were similar in the hypofractionated groups compared with the conventional group.There were no significant differences in either the proportion or cumulative incidence of side-effects 5 years after treatment using three clinician-reported as well as patient-reported outcome measures.The estimated cumulative 5 year incidence of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) grade 2 or worse bowel and bladder adverse events was 13.7% (111 events) and 9.1% (66 events) in the 74 Gy group, 11.9% (105 events) and 11.7% (88 events) in the 60 Gy group, 11.3% (95 events) and 6.6% (57 events) in the 57 Gy group, respectively.No treatment-related deaths were reported.INTERPRETATION: Hypofractionated radiotherapy using 60 Gy in 20 fractions is non-inferior to conventional fractionation using 74 Gy in 37 fractions and is recommended as a new standard of care for external-beam radiotherapy of localised prostate cancer.FUNDING: Cancer Research UK, Department of Health, and the National Institute for Health Research Cancer Research Network.",1,1,1,1
27098427,"Disease progression in recurrent glioblastoma patients treated with the VEGFR inhibitor axitinib is associated with increased regulatory T cell numbers and T cell exhaustion.BACKGROUND: Recurrent glioblastoma is associated with a poor overall survival.Antiangiogenic therapy results in a high tumor response rate but has limited impact on survival.Immunotherapy has emerged as an efficient treatment modality for some cancers, and preclinical evidence indicates that anti-VEGF(R) therapy can counterbalance the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment.METHODS: We collected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of patients with recurrent glioblastoma treated in a randomized phase II clinical trial comparing the effect of axitinib with axitinib plus lomustine and analyzed the immunophenotype of PBMC, the production of cytokines and expression of inhibitory molecules by circulating T cells.RESULTS: PBMC of 18 patients were collected at baseline and at 6 weeks after initiation of study treatment.Axitinib increased the number of naive CD8(+) T cells and central memory CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells and reduced the TIM3 expression on CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells.Patients diagnosed with progressive disease on axitinib had a significantly increased number of regulatory T cells and an increased level of PD-1 expression on CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells.In addition, reduced numbers of cytokine-producing T cells were found in progressive patients as compared to patients responding to treatment.CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that axitinib treatment in patients with recurrent glioblastoma has a favorable impact on immune function.At the time of acquired resistance to axitinib, we documented further enhancement of a preexisting immunosuppression.Further investigations on the role of axitinib as potential combination partner with immunotherapy are necessary.",0,0,0,0
23957945,"Initial biopsy Gleason score as a predictive marker for survival benefit in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with docetaxel: data from the TAX327 study.BACKGROUND: Since 2004, docetaxel has been the standard first-line systemic therapy for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).With abiraterone recently becoming available in the predocetaxel setting, it is warranted to identify subgroups of patients who may obtain the greatest benefit from docetaxel and particularly qualify for receiving docetaxel as first-line treatment for mCRPC.OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify factors that could characterize subgroups of patients who obtain the greatest benefit from the use of docetaxel.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: TAX327 was multinational, randomized, phase 3 study that was conducted from 2000 to 2002 in 1006 men with mCRPC.INTERVENTION: Patients were randomized to receive docetaxel every 3 wk (D3), weekly docetaxel (D1), or mitoxantrone every 3 wk (M3), each with prednisone.OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: We investigated whether patients with poorly differentiated tumors (Gleason score >/=7) at diagnosis had greater benefit from D3 compared with M3 than patients with better differentiated tumors (Gleason score </=6).Using a Cox model, we compared overall survival (OS) between the treatment groups within each subgroup of Gleason score.RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: The TAX 327 data showed that the OS benefit of D3 versus M3 was greater in patients with high-grade tumors (median OS: 18.9 vs 14.5 mo; p=0.009) than in patients with low-grade tumors (median OS: 21.6 vs 20.7 mo; p=0.674).Limitations of a retrospective analysis apply.CONCLUSIONS: The survival benefit obtained with docetaxel is most pronounced in patients with high-Gleason-score tumors (Gleason >/=7).In a time of shifting paradigms in mCRPC, with abiraterone becoming available prior to docetaxel chemotherapy, Gleason score may help in selecting patients who obtain the greatest benefit from docetaxel as first-line treatment for mCRPC.Prospective validation of these findings is warranted.",1,1,1,1

27124410,"Exploratory Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Response-Guided Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy for Hormone Positive Breast Cancer Patients.PURPOSE: Guiding response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (guided-NACT) allows for an adaptative treatment approach likely to improve breast cancer survival.In this study, our primary aim is to explore the expected cost-effectiveness of guided-NACT using as a case study the first randomized controlled trial that demonstrated effectiveness (GeparTrio trial).MATERIALS AND METHODS: As effectiveness was shown in hormone-receptor positive (HR+) early breast cancers (EBC), our decision model compared the health-economic outcomes of treating a cohort of such women with guided-NACT to conventional-NACT using clinical input data from the GeparTrio trial.The expected cost-effectiveness and the uncertainty around this estimate were estimated via probabilistic cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA), from a Dutch societal perspective over a 5-year time-horizon.RESULTS: Our exploratory CEA predicted that guided-NACT as proposed by the GeparTrio, costs additional euro110, but results in 0.014 QALYs gained per patient.This scenario of guided-NACT was considered cost-effective at any willingness to pay per additional QALY.At the prevailing Dutch willingness to pay threshold (euro80.000/QALY) cost-effectiveness was expected with 78% certainty.CONCLUSION: This exploratory CEA indicated that guided-NACT (as proposed by the GeparTrio trial) is likely cost-effective in treating HR+ EBC women.While prospective validation of the GeparTrio findings is advisable from a clinical perspective, early CEAs can be used to prioritize further research from a broader health economic perspective, by identifying which parameters contribute most to current decision uncertainty.Furthermore, their use can be extended to explore the expected cost-effectiveness of alternative guided-NACT scenarios that combine the use of promising imaging techniques together with personalized treatments.",0,0,0,0
24528179,"Arsenic trioxide during consolidation for patients with previously untreated low/intermediate risk acute promyelocytic leukaemia may eliminate the need for maintenance therapy.Aa total of 105 patients (age >/=18 years) with newly diagnosed low or intermediate risk acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) were treated with a standard induction and consolidation regimen including arsenic trioxide (ATO).Sixty-eight patients who were polymerase chain reaction (PCR) negative for PML-RARA post-consolidation were randomized to either 1 year of maintenance with tretinoin, mercaptopurine and methotrexate, or observation.Enrollment in this non-inferiority trial was stopped prematurely due to slow accrual.With a median follow up of 36.1 months, the overall survival of the 105 patients was 93%, and there have been no relapses in the patients randomized to maintenance or observation.These results demonstrate that cures can be expected in >90% of patients with low and intermediate risk APL and suggest that maintenance therapy may not be needed if patients are treated with an intensive post-remission regimen including ATO.This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00492856.",1,1,1,1

24214881,"Vitamin D-binding protein, circulating vitamin D and risk of renal cell carcinoma.Cell culture experiments suggest that vitamin D may inhibit renal carcinogenesis, but human studies of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], the accepted measure of vitamin D status, and kidney cancer have been null.Limited research has examined the role of circulating vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) in the association between 25(OH)D and disease risk, and it is unclear whether free 25(OH)D in circulation is a better measure of effective exposure, or if DBP may independently impact outcomes.We conducted a nested case-control analysis within the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention (ATBC) Study to examine whether circulating DBP concentration was prospectively associated with risk of renal cell carcinoma, and whether it modified the association with 25(OH)D. Renal cell carcinoma cases (n = 262) were matched 1:1 to controls on age (+/-1 year) and date of blood collection (+/- 30 days).We estimated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of renal cell carcinoma risk by quartiles of 25(OH)D, DBP and the molar ratio of 25(OH)D:DBP, a proxy for free circulating 25(OH)D. Men with higher DBP concentrations were at significantly decreased risk of kidney cancer (Q4 vs. Q1: OR = 0.17, 95% CI = 0.08-0.33; p-trend < 0.0001), a finding unchanged by adjustment for 25(OH)D. Although we observed no association with total 25(OH)D, we found slightly increased risk with higher levels of estimated free 25(OH)D [Q4 vs. Q1 of the 25(OH)D:DBP ratio, OR = 1.61, 95% CI = 0.95-2.73; p-trend = 0.09].The strong protective association observed between higher circulating DBP concentration and kidney cancer risk requires replication but suggests a vitamin D-independent influence of DBP.",0,0,0,0

27387325,"A phase II trial comparing pazopanib with doxorubicin as first-line treatment in elderly patients with metastatic or advanced soft tissue sarcoma (EPAZ): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Anthracycline-based treatment remains the backbone of chemotherapy for nonresectable soft tissue sarcomas (STS).More than 30 % of patients with STS are aged 60 years or older, limiting the choice of treatment to single-agent approaches for this elderly population.Hematological toxicity is frequent during doxorubicin monotherapy, grade 4 neutropenia is reported in 34 %, with a febrile neutropenia rate of 9 % in STS.We assume that comorbidities in the elderly population may limit tolerability of doxorubicin, and novel agents may improve tolerability and health-related quality of life while maintaining efficacy.We therefore investigated whether the tyrosine kinase inhibitor pazopanib exerts such a clinical benefit in elderly patients with STS (pazopanib for elderly [the EPAZ study]).METHODS/DESIGN: This study is a randomized, controlled, open-label, multicenter, phase II noninferiority trial in which pazopanib 800 mg once daily is being compared six cycles of intravenous doxorubicin 75 mg/m(2) as first-line treatment in elderly patients (>/=60 years) with metastatic or advanced STS.A total of 120 patients will be randomized 1:2 to receive doxorubicin or pazopanib, stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (0-1 vs. 2) and liposarcoma histology (yes vs. no).The primary endpoint is progression-free survival based on local tumor assessment according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria.Secondary endpoints include grade 4 neutropenia and febrile neutropenia in hierarchical order, as well as overall survival, objective response rate, health-related quality of life, and geriatric assessments.DISCUSSION: Pazopanib is associated with promising tolerability according to previous studies and may offer a significant clinical advantage in first-line treatment of STS compared with doxorubicin.The elderly population seems especially appealing for such an approach, since these patients are not suitable for aggressive combination therapy.The EPAZ study will confirm whether pazopanib may be an alternative to toxic chemotherapy for elderly patients with STS.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01861951 ; registered on 11 April 2013.EudraCT 2011-004168-30; registered on 4 June 2012.",0,0,0,0

Investigator-assessed median progression-free survival was 9.2 months (95% CI, 7.4 to 15.6) and 12.9 months (95% CI, 11.1 to not reached) in arms A and B, respectively.Independent review committee-assessed intracranial ORR in patients with measurable brain metastases at baseline was 42% (11 of 26 patients) in arm A and 67% (12 of 18 patients) in arm B. Common treatment-emergent adverse events were nausea (arm A/B, 33%/40%), diarrhea (arm A/B, 19%/38%), headache (arm A/B, 28%/27%), and cough (arm A/B, 18%/34%), and were mainly grades 1 to 2.A subset of pulmonary adverse events with early onset (median onset: day 2) occurred in 14 of 219 treated patients (all grades, 6%; grade >/= 3, 3%); none occurred after escalation to 180 mg in arm B. Seven of 14 patients were successfully retreated with brigatinib.Conclusion Brigatinib yielded substantial whole-body and intracranial responses as well as robust progression-free survival; 180 mg (with lead-in) showed consistently better efficacy than 90 mg, with acceptable safety.",1,1,1,1
23053638,"A randomized phase II trial of platinum salts in basal-like breast cancer patients in the neoadjuvant setting. Results from the GEICAM/2006-03, multicenter study.Chemotherapy remains as the only systemic treatment option available for basal-like breast cancer (BC) patients.Preclinical models and several phase II studies suggested that platinum salts are active drugs in this BC subtype though there is no randomized study supporting this hypothesis.This study investigates if the addition of carboplatin to a combination of an alkylating agent together with anthracyclines and taxanes is able to increase the efficacy in the neoadjuvant treatment context.Patients with operable breast cancer and immunophenotypically defined basal-like disease (ER-/PR-/HER2- and cytokeratin 5/6+ or EGFR+) were recruited.Patients were randomized to receive EC (epirubicin 90 mg/m(2) plus cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2) for 4 cycles) followed either by D (docetaxel 100 mg/m(2) x 4 cycles; EC-D) or DCb (docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) plus carboplatin AUC 6 x 4 cycles; EC-DCb).The primary end point was pathological complete response (pCR) in the breast following the Miller and Payne criteria.Ninety-four patients were randomized (46 EC-D, 48 EC-DCb).pCR rate in the breast was seen in 16 patients (35 %) with EC-D and 14 patients (30 %) with EC-DCb (P value = 0.61).pCR in the breast and axilla was seen in 30 % of patients in both arms.The overall clinical response rate was 70 % (95 % CI 56-83) in the EC-D arm and 77 % (95 % CI 65-87) in the EC-DCb arm.Grade 3/4 toxicity was similar in both arms.The addition of carboplatin to conventional chemotherapy with EC-D in basal-like breast cancer patients did not improve the efficacy probably because they had already received an alkylating agent.These findings should be taken into consideration when developing new agents for this disease.",1,1,1,1
24528179,"Arsenic trioxide during consolidation for patients with previously untreated low/intermediate risk acute promyelocytic leukaemia may eliminate the need for maintenance therapy.Aa total of 105 patients (age >/=18 years) with newly diagnosed low or intermediate risk acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) were treated with a standard induction and consolidation regimen including arsenic trioxide (ATO).Sixty-eight patients who were polymerase chain reaction (PCR) negative for PML-RARA post-consolidation were randomized to either 1 year of maintenance with tretinoin, mercaptopurine and methotrexate, or observation.Enrollment in this non-inferiority trial was stopped prematurely due to slow accrual.With a median follow up of 36.1 months, the overall survival of the 105 patients was 93%, and there have been no relapses in the patients randomized to maintenance or observation.These results demonstrate that cures can be expected in >90% of patients with low and intermediate risk APL and suggest that maintenance therapy may not be needed if patients are treated with an intensive post-remission regimen including ATO.This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00492856.",1,1,1,1
23281805,"Randomized Phase II trial of paclitaxel and carboplatin followed by gemcitabine switch-maintenance therapy versus gemcitabine and carboplatin followed by gemcitabine continuation-maintenance therapy in previously untreated advanced non-small cell lung cancer.BACKGROUND: In recent years, maintenance chemotherapy is increasingly being recognized as a new treatment strategy to improve the outcome of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).However, the optimal maintenance strategy is still controversial.Gemcitabine is a promising candidate for single-agent maintenance therapy because of little toxicity and good tolerability.We have conducted a randomized phase II study to evaluate the validity of single-agent maintenance chemotherapy of gemcitabine and to compare continuation- and switch-maintenance.METHODS: Chemonaive patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC were randomly assigned 1:1 to either arm A or B. Patients received paclitaxel (200 mg/m2, day 1) plus carboplatin (AUC 6 mg/mL/min, day 1) every 3 weeks in arm A, or gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2, days 1 and 8) plus carboplatin (AUC 5 mg/mL/min, day1) every 3 weeks in arm B. Non-progressive patients following 3 cycles of induction chemotherapy received maintenance gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2, days 1 and 8) every 3 weeks.( TRIAL REGISTRATION: UMIN000008252)RESULTS: The study was stopped because of delayed accrual at interim analysis.Of the randomly assigned 50 patients, 49 except for one in arm B were evaluable.Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 4.6 months for arm A vs. 3.5 months for arm B (HR = 1.03; 95% CI, 0.45-2.27; p = 0.95) and median overall survival (OS) was 15.0 months for arm A vs. 14.8 months for arm B (HR = 0.79; 95% CI, 0.40-1.51; p = 0.60), showing no difference between the two arms.The response rate, disease control rate, and the transit rate to maintenance phase were 36.0% (9/25), 64.0% (16/25), and 48% (12/25) for arm A vs. 16.7% (4/24), 50.0% (12/24), and 33% (8/24) for arm B, which were also statistically similar between the two arms (p = 0.13, p = 0.32, and p = 0.30, respectively).Both induction regimens were tolerable, except that more patients experienced peripheral neuropathy in arm A. Toxicities during the maintenance phase were also minimal.CONCLUSION: Survival and overall response were not significantly different between the two arms.Gemcitabine may be well-tolerable and feasible for maintenance therapy.",1,1,1,1
24220254,"Bone marrow edema pattern identification in patients with lytic bone lesions using digital subtraction angiography-like bone subtraction on large-area detector computed tomography.OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of digital subtraction angiography (DSA)-like bone subtraction with 2 different registration methods for the identification of bone marrow edema pattern (BMEP) in patients with lytic bone lesions, using magnetic resonance imaging as the criterion standard.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-five patients with a lytic bone lesion were included in this prospective study with approval from the ethics committee.All patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging and low-dose computed tomographic (CT) perfusion after signing an informed consent.Two CT volumes were used for bone subtraction, which was performed with 2 different algorithms (rigid and nonrigid).Enhancement at the nonlytic bone marrow was considered as a sign of BMEP.Two readers evaluated the images blindly.The presence of BMEP on bone-subtracted CT images was evaluated subjectively and quantitatively.Image quality was assessed.Magnetic resonance imaging was used as the criterion standard.RESULTS: Using a rigid registration method, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of CT with DSA-like bone subtraction BMEP was 77%, 100%, 100%, 68%, and 85%, respectively.The interobserver agreement was good (kappa, 0.782).Image quality was better using a nonrigid registration.With this algorithm, artifacts interfered with image interpretation in only 5% of cases.However, there was a noticeable drop in sensitivity and negative predictive value when a nonrigid algorithm was used: 56% and 52%, respectively.The interobserver agreement was average with a nonrigid subtraction algorithm.CONCLUSIONS: Computed tomography with DSA-like bone subtraction is sensitive and highly specific for the identification of BMEP associated with lytic bone lesions.Rigid registering should be preferred, but nonrigid algorithms can be used as a second option when artifacts interfere with image interpretation.",0,0,0,0
22674529,"A phase 3 study of induction treatment with concurrent chemoradiotherapy versus chemotherapy before surgery in patients with pathologically confirmed N2 stage IIIA nonsmall cell lung cancer (WJTOG9903).BACKGROUND: This study sought to ascertain whether induction-concurrent radiotherapy added to chemotherapy could improve the survival of patients undergoing surgery for stage IIIA N2 nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC).METHODS: Patients with pathologically proven N2 disease were randomized to receive either induction chemotherapy (docetaxel 60 mg/m(2) and carboplatin AUC [area under the receiver operating characteristic curve] = 5 for 2 cycles) plus concurrent radiation therapy (40 Gy) followed by surgery (CRS arm) or induction chemotherapy followed by surgery (CS arm).They subsequently underwent pulmonary resection when possible.RESULTS: Sixty patients were randomly assigned between December 2000 and August 2005.The study was prematurely terminated in January 2006 because of slow accrual.The most common toxicity was grade 3 or 4 leukopenia in 92.9% of patients in the CRS arm and 46.4% in the CS arm.Induction therapy was generally well tolerated, and there were no treatment-related deaths in either arm.Downstaging in the CS arm and CRS arm was 21% and 40%, respectively.The progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in the CS arm were 9.7 months and 29.9 months (PFS, hazard ratio [HR] = 0.68, P = .187), and those in the CRS arm were 12.4 months and 39.6 months (OS, HR = 0.77, P = .397), respectively.The PFS with and without downstaging was 55.0 and 9.4 months, respectively (HR = 3.39, P = .001).The OS with and without downstaging was 63.3 and 29.5 months, respectively (HR = 2.62, P = .021).CONCLUSIONS: The addition of radiotherapy to induction chemotherapy conferred better local control without significant adverse events.Tumor downstaging is important for prolonging the OS in patients with stage IIIA (N2) NSCLC.",1,1,1,1

28421294,"A prospective comparison of intra-arterial chemotherapy combined with intravesical chemotherapy and intravesical chemotherapy alone after transurethral resection with a thulium laser in high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer.Objective To compare intra-arterial chemotherapy combined with intravesical chemotherapy with intravesical chemotherapy alone in the treatment of high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (HRBC) after thulium laser resection of a bladder tumor (TmLRBT).MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 2009 to December 2013, 283 patients with HRBC were randomly assigned to the combined group (group A, n = 141) or intravesical chemotherapy-alone group (group B, n = 142) after TmLRBT.Intra-arterial chemotherapy was administered after initial TmLRBT, with 3 courses at 4-week intervals.Each course consisted of cisplatin (50 mg/m(2)) and epirubicin (30 mg/m(2)).Intravesical chemotherapy was administered in both groups, including an immediate 50 mg of epirubicin instillation after TmLRBT and weekly maintenance for 8 weeks, followed by monthly maintenance for 1 year.RESULTS: The recurrence rate was 29.1% (41/141) in group A and 42.9% (61/142) in group B, with a significant difference (p = 0.01).The progression rate was 15.6% (22/141) in group A and 25.3% (36/142) in group B, with a significant difference (p = 0.039).Patients with concomitant carcinoma in situ (CIS) also had a lower recurrence rate and progression rate in group A compared to those in group B (p = 0.006 and p = 0.03, respectively).On univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses, patients with low-grade histology had a higher reccurrence-free rate.Multivariate COX analysis of tumor-related factors suggested that concomitant CIS was the only significant prognostic factor associated with poorer recurrence-free survival and progression-free survival.CONCLUSIONS: Intra-arterial chemotherapy combined with intravesical chemotherapy could reduce the risk of recurrence and progression compared to intravesical chemotherapy alone in HRBC.",1,1,1,0
26681677,"Association between PSA kinetics and cancer-specific mortality in patients with localised prostate cancer: analysis of the placebo arm of the SPCG-6 study.BACKGROUND: The prognostic value of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) kinetics in untreated prostate cancer (PCa) patients is debatable.We investigated the association between PSA doubling time (PSAdt), PSA velocity (PSAvel) and PSAvel risk count (PSAvRC) and PCa mortality in a cohort of patients with localised PCa managed on watchful waiting.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with clinically localised PCa managed observationally, who were randomised to and remained on placebo for minimum 18 months in the SPCG-6 study, were included.All patients survived at least 2 years and had a minimum of three PSA determinations available.The prognostic value of PSA kinetics was analysed and patients were stratified according to their PSA at consent: </=10, 10.1-25, and >25 ng/ml.Cumulative incidences of PCa-specific mortality were estimated with the Aalen-Johansen method.RESULTS: Two hundred and sixty-three patients were included of which 116, 76 and 71 had a PSA at consent </=10, 10.1-25, and >25 ng/ml, respectively.Median follow-up was 13.6 years.For patients with PSA at consent between 10.1 and 25 ng/ml, the 13-year risks of PCa mortality were associated with PSA kinetics: PSAdt </=3 years: 62.0% versus PSAdt >3 years: 16.3% (Gray's test: P < 0.0001), PSAvel >/=2 ng/ml/year: 48.0% versus PSAvel <2 ng/ml/year: 11.0% (Gray's test: P = 0.0008), and PSAvRC 2: 45.0% versus 0-1: 3.8% (Gray's test: P = 0.001).In contrast, none of the PSA kinetics were significantly associated with changes of 13-year risks of PCa mortality in patients with PSA at consent </=10 or >25 ng/ml.CONCLUSION: We found that magnitude changes in 13-year risks of PCa mortality that can be indicated by PSA kinetics depend on PSA level in patients with localised PCa who were managed observationally.Our results question PSA kinetics as surrogate marker for PCa mortality in patients with low and high PSA values.CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: NCT00672282.",0,0,0,0
21699645,"Usefulness of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) rise as a marker of prostate cancer in men treated with dutasteride: lessons from the REDUCE study.OBJECTIVES: To determine if dutasteride-treated men can be monitored safely and adequately for prostate cancer based on data from the Reduction by Dutasteride in Prostate Cancer Events (REDUCE) study.To analyse whether the use of treatment-specific criteria for repeat biopsy maintains the usefulness of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level for detecting high grade cancers.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The REDUCE study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled investigation of whether dutasteride (0.5 mg/day) reduced the risk of biopsy-detectable prostate cancer in men with a previous negative biopsy.The usefulness of PSA was evaluated using biopsy thresholds defined by National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines in the placebo group and any rise in PSA from nadir (the lowest PSA level achieved while in the study) in the dutasteride group.The number of cancers detected on biopsy in the absence of increased/suspicious PSA level as well as sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for high grade prostate cancer detection were analysed by treatment group.Prostate cancer pathological characteristics were compared between men who did and did not meet biopsy thresholds.RESULTS: Of 8231 men randomized, 3305 (dutasteride) and 3424 (placebo) underwent at least one prostate biopsy during the study and were included in the analysis.If only men meeting biopsy thresholds underwent biopsy, 25% (47/191) of Gleason 7 and 24% (7/29) of Gleason 8-10 cancers would have been missed in the dutasteride group, and 37% (78/209) of Gleason 7 and 22% (4/18) Gleason 8-10 cancers would have been missed in the placebo group.In both groups, the incidence of Gleason 7 and Gleason 8-10 cancers generally increased with greater rises in PSA.Sensitivity of PSA kinetics was higher and specificity was lower for the detection of Gleason 7-10 cancers in men treated with dutasteride vs placebo.Men with Gleason 7 and Gleason 8-10 cancer meeting biopsy thresholds had greater numbers of positive cores, percent core involvement, and biopsy cancer volume vs men not meeting thresholds.CONCLUSION: Using treatment-specific biopsy thresholds, the present study shows that the ability of PSA kinetics to detect high grade prostate cancer is maintained with dutasteride compared with placebo in men with a previous negative biopsy.The sensitivity of PSA kinetics with dutasteride was similar to (Gleason 8-10) or higher than (Gleason 7-10) the placebo group; however, biopsy decisions based on a single increased PSA measurement from nadir in the dutasteride group resulted in a lower specificity compared with using a comparable biopsy threshold in the placebo group, indicating the importance of confirmation of PSA measurements.",0,0,0,0

22146893,"An immune-active tumor microenvironment favors clinical response to ipilimumab.PURPOSE: Ipilimumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody specific to CTLA-4, has been shown to improve overall survival in metastatic melanoma patients.As a consequence of CTLA-4 blockade, ipilimumab treatment is associated with proliferation and activation of peripheral T cells.To better understand various tumor-associated components that may influence the clinical outcome of ipilimumab treatment, gene expression profiles of tumors from patients treated with ipilimumab were characterized.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Gene expression profiling was performed on tumor biopsies collected from 45 melanoma patients before and 3 weeks after the start of treatment in a phase II clinical trial.RESULTS: Analysis of pre-treatment tumors indicated that patients with high baseline expression levels of immune-related genes were more likely to respond favorably to ipilimumab.Furthermore, ipilimumab appeared to induce two major changes in tumors from patients who exhibited clinical activity: genes involved in immune response showed increased expression, whereas expression of genes for melanoma-specific antigens and genes involved in cell proliferation decreased.These changes were associated with the total lymphocyte infiltrate in tumors, and there was a suggestion of association with prolonged overall survival in these patients.Many IFN-gamma-inducible genes and Th1-associated markers showed increased expression after ipilimumab treatment, suggesting an accumulation of this particular type of T cell at the tumor sites, which might play an important role in mediating the antitumor activity of ipilimumab.CONCLUSIONS: These results support the proposed mechanism of action of ipilimumab, suggesting that cell-mediated immune responses play an important role in the antitumor activity of ipilimumab.",0,0,0,0
27220897,"Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography May Improve the Diagnostic Accuracy of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Localized Prostate Cancer.PURPOSE: Positron emission tomography using ligands targeting prostate specific membrane antigen has recently been introduced.Positron emission tomography imaging with (68)Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC has been shown to detect metastatic prostate cancer lesions at a high rate.In this study we compare multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and prostate specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography of the prostate with whole mount ex vivo prostate histopathology to determine the true sensitivity and specificity of these imaging modalities for detecting and locating tumor foci within the prostate.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a prospective clinical trial setting 20 patients with localized prostate cancer and a planned radical prostatectomy were recruited.All patients underwent multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography before surgery, and whole mount histopathology slides were directly compared to the images.European Society of Urogenital Radiology guidelines for reporting magnetic resonance imaging were used as a template for regional units of analysis.The uropathologist and radiologists were blinded to individual components of the study, and the final correlation was performed by visual and deformable registration analysis.RESULTS: A total of 50 clinically significant lesions were identified from the whole mount histopathological analysis.Based on regional analysis the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging were 44%, 94%, 81% and 76%, respectively.With prostate specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 49%, 95%, 85% and 88%, respectively.Prostate specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography yielded a higher specificity and positive predictive value.CONCLUSIONS: A significant proportion of cancers are potentially missed and underestimated by both imaging modalities.Prostate specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography may be used in addition to multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging to help improve local staging in those patients undergoing retropubic radical prostatectomy.",0,0,0,0
24435414,"Long term duration of protective effect for HPV negative women: follow-up of primary HPV screening randomised controlled trial.OBJECTIVES: To assess whether the increased sensitivity of screening for human papillomavirus (HPV) may represent overdiagnosis and to compare the long term duration of protective effect against cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CIN2+) in HPV based and cytology based screening.DESIGN: 13 year follow-up of the Swedescreen randomised controlled trial of primary HPV screening.SETTING: Organised cervical screening programme in Sweden.PARTICIPANTS: 12,527 women aged 32-38 attending organised screening were enrolled and randomised to HPV and cytology double testing (intervention arm, n=6257) or to cytology only, with samples frozen for future HPV testing (control arm, n=6270).MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cumulative incidence of CIN2+ and CIN3+ (Kaplan Meier curves).Longitudinal test characteristics were calculated for cytology only, HPV testing only, and cytology and HPV testing combined, adjusting for censoring.RESULTS: The increased detection of CIN2+ in the intervention arm decreased over time.After six years, the cumulative incidence of CIN3+ was similar in both trial arms, and after 11 years the cumulative incidence of CIN2+ became similar in both arms.The longitudinal sensitivity of cytology for CIN2+ in the control arm at three years was similar to the sensitivity of HPV testing in the intervention arm at five years of follow-up: 85.94% (95% confidence interval 76.85% to 91.84%) v 86.40% (79.21% to 91.37%).The sensitivity of HPV screening for CIN3+after five years was 89.34% (80.10% to 94.58%) and for cytology after three years was 92.02% (80.59% to 96.97%).CONCLUSIONS: Over long term follow-up, the cumulative incidence of CIN2+ was the same for HPV screening and for cytology, implying that the increased sensitivity of HPV screening for CIN2+ reflects earlier detection rather than overdiagnosis.The low long term risks of CIN3+ among women who tested negative in HPV screening, support screening intervals of five years for such women.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00479375.",0,0,0,0

24670844,"Comparative effectiveness of sphincter-sparing surgery versus abdominoperineal resection in rectal cancer: patient-reported outcomes in National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project randomized trial R-04.OBJECTIVE: National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) R-04 was a randomized controlled trial of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in patients with resectable stage II-III rectal cancer.We hypothesized that patients who underwent abdominoperineal resection (APR) would have a poorer quality of life than those who underwent sphincter-sparing surgery (SSS).METHODS: To obtain patient-reported outcomes (PROs) we administered two symptom scales at baseline and 1 year postoperatively: the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Colorectal (FACT-C) and the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer module for patients with Colorectal Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-CR38).Scoring was stratified by nonrandomly assigned definitive surgery (APR vs SSS).Analyses controlled for baseline scores and stratification factors: age, sex, stage, intended surgery, and randomly assigned chemoradiotherapy.RESULTS: Of 1,608 randomly assigned patients, 987 had data for planned analyses; 62% underwent SSS; 38% underwent APR.FACT-C total and subscale scores were not statistically different by surgery at 1 year.For the EORTC QLQ-CR38 functional scales, APR patients reported worse body image (70.3 vs 77.0, P = 0.0005) at 1 year than did SSS patients.Males undergoing APR reported worse sexual enjoyment (43.7 vs 54.7, P = 0.02) at 1 year than did those undergoing SSS.For the EORTC QLQ-CR38 symptom scale scores, APR patients reported worse micturition symptoms than the SSS group at 1 year (26.9 vs 21.5, P = 0.03).SSS patients reported worse gastrointestinal tract symptoms than did the APR patients (18.9 vs 15.2, P < 0.0001), as well as weight loss (10.1 vs 6.0, P = 0.002).CONCLUSIONS: Symptoms and functional problems were detected at 1 year by EORTC QLQ-CR38, reflecting different symptom profiles in patients who underwent APR than those who underwent SSS.Information from these PROs may be useful in counseling patients anticipating surgery for rectal cancer.",0,0,0,0
24044803,"Hypofractionated whole breast irradiation for patients with large breasts: a randomized trial comparing prone and supine positions.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Comparison of acute toxicity of whole-breast irradiation (WBI) in prone and supine positions.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This non-blinded, randomized, prospective, mono-centric trial was undertaken between December 29, 2010, and December 12, 2012.One hundred patients with large breasts were randomized between supine multi beam (MB) and prone tangential field (TF) intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT).Dose-volume parameters were assessed for the breast, heart, left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD), ipsilateral lung and contralateral breast.The primary endpoint was acute moist skin desquamation.Secondary endpoints were dermatitis, edema, pruritus and pain.RESULTS: Prone treatment resulted in: improved dose coverage (p<0.001); better homogeneity (p<0.001); less volumes of over-dosage (p=0.001); reduced acute skin desquamation (p<0.001); a 3-fold decrease of moist desquamation p=0.04 (chi-square), p=0.07 (Fisher's exact test)); lower incidence of dermatitis (p<0.001), edema (p=0.005), pruritus (p=0.06) and pain (p=0.06); 2- to 4-fold reduction of grades 2-3 toxicity; lower ipsilateral lung (p<0.001) and mean LAD (p=0.007) dose; lower, though statistically non-significant heart and maximum LAD.CONCLUSIONS: This study provides level I evidence for replacing the supine standard treatment by prone IMRT for whole-breast irradiation in patients with large breasts.A confirmatory trial in a multi-institutional setting is warranted.",0,0,0,0
24296288,"Development of a new biochemical test to diagnose and monitor neuroblastoma in Vietnam: homovanillic and vanillylmandelic acid by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to develop an accurate robust testing method to simultaneously measure urine levels of HVA and VMA using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS) and to establish age-specific reference intervals of HVA and VMA in random urines for Vietnamese children.DESIGN AND METHODS: The assay for urinary HVA and VMA was developed based on a classical urinary organic acid profiling method.Briefly, this incorporated 3-phenyl butyric acid as the internal standard and liquid-liquid extraction with ethyl acetate followed by derivatization with BSTFA.The Agilent 7890A GC and 5975C Mass Selective Detector in single ion monitoring mode was used for analysis.Reference intervals were developed from random urine samples collected from 634 disease free Vietnamese children and compared to 50 known neuroblastoma patient samples.Results were reported relative to creatinine concentration.Age related 95% reference intervals for urinary HVA and VMA were estimated from sample quantiles.The analytes (expressed as analyte/creatinine ratios) diagnostic values were determined by calculating the related sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratios.RESULTS: HVA and VMA were linear to at least 193 and 221mumol/L, respectively.The limit of quantitation for both analytes was 0.9mumol/L. Using the bi-level control (n=15), the within-batch coefficients of variations (CVs) were less than 3% for both analytes across the assay range.The between-batch CVs (n=20 over three months), were 3.6% at 11mumol/L and 2.1% at 88mumol/L for HVA, 6.6% at 18.2mumol/L and 2.6% at 90.6mumol/L for VMA.Vietnamese age related reference intervals were established for urinary HVA and VMA per creatinine.HVA for children <6months (n=91) was 5.3-37.0mumol/mmol; 6months to <1year (n=141) was 2.7-27.7mumol/mmol; 1 to 5years (n=139) was 3.4-17.9mumol/mmol; 6 to 10years (n=136) was 2.7-8.8mumol/mmol; and 11 to 15years (n=127) was 1.1-9.4mumol/mmol.VMA for children <6months was 1.8-12.2mumol/mmol; 6months to <1year was 1.5-9.3mumol/mmol; 1 to 5years was 1.9-7.8mumol/mmol; 6 to 10years was 1.6-5.1mumol/mmol; and 11 to 15years was <0.9-6.3mumol/mmol.CONCLUSIONS: A robust testing method for simultaneous quantitation of urinary HVA and VMA by GCMS was developed.This method is accurate, precise and fit for its clinical purpose and suitable for developing countries.Age-related reference intervals of urinary HVA and VMA were established for Vietnamese children and the intervals declined progressively with increasing age for each analyte.",0,0,0,0

27114605,"Response to Cetuximab With or Without Irinotecan in Patients With Refractory Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Harboring the KRAS G13D Mutation: Australasian Gastro-Intestinal Trials Group ICECREAM Study.PURPOSE: RAS mutations predict lack of response to epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody therapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), but preclinical studies and retrospective clinical data suggest that patients with tumors harboring the exon 2 KRAS G13D mutation may benefit from cetuximab.We aimed to assess cetuximab monotherapy and cetuximab plus irinotecan in patients with molecularly selected (G13D mutation) chemotherapy-refractory mCRC in a randomized phase II trial of this rare molecular subtype.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with chemotherapy-refractory KRAS G13D mutation-positive mCRC who had progressed within 6 months of irinotecan therapy were randomly assigned to cetuximab 400 mg/m(2) loading dose and then 250 mg/m(2) once per week with or without irinotecan 180 mg/m(2) once every 2 weeks.The primary end point was 6-month progression-free survival; secondary end points were response rate, overall survival, quality of life, and toxicity.RESULTS: Fifty-one of 53 patients recruited over 2 years were eligible.The 6-month progression-free survival rate was 10% (95% CI, 2% to 26%) for cetuximab versus 23% (95% CI, 9% to 40%) for cetuximab plus irinotecan with a hazard ratio of 0.74 (95% CI, 0.42 to 1.32).Response and stable disease rates were 0% and 58% for monotherapy versus 9% and 70% for combination treatment, respectively.Overall survival and quality of life were similar; toxicities were higher with combination therapy.CONCLUSION: In patients with G13D-mutated chemotherapy-refractory mCRC, there was no statistically significant improvement in disease control at 6 months with either cetuximab monotherapy or cetuximab plus irinotecan.No responses were seen with single-agent cetuximab.The responses observed with the combination of cetuximab and irinotecan may reflect true drug synergy or persistent irinotecan sensitivity.The ICECREAM (Irinotecan Cetuximab Evaluation and Cetuximab Response Evaluation Among Patients with a G13D Mutation) study demonstrates the need to prospectively evaluate hypotheses that were previously supported by retrospective analyses and exemplifies the value of international collaboration in trials of rare molecular subtypes.",1,1,1,1

27981431,"Adjusting Overall Survival Estimates after Treatment Switching: a Case Study in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.BACKGROUND: If patients in oncology trials receive subsequent therapy, standard intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses may inaccurately estimate the overall survival (OS) effect of the investigational product.In this context, a post-hoc analysis of the phase 3 PREVAIL study was performed with the aim to compare enzalutamide with placebo in terms of OS, adjusting for potential confounding from switching to antineoplastic therapies that are not part of standard metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) treatment pathways in some jurisdictions.METHODS: The PREVAIL study, which included 1717 chemotherapy-naive men with mCRPC randomized to treatment with enzalutamide 160 mg/day or placebo, was stopped after a planned interim survival analysis revealed a benefit in favor of enzalutamide.Data from this cutoff point were confounded by switching from both arms and so were evaluated in terms of OS using two switching adjustment methods: the two-stage accelerated failure time model (two-stage method) and inverse probability of censoring weights (IPCW).RESULTS: Following adjustment for switching to nonstandard antineoplastic therapies by 14.8 (129/872 patients) and 21.3% (180/845 patients) of patients initially randomized to enzalutamide and placebo, respectively, the two-stage and IPCW methods both resulted in numerical reductions in the hazard ratio (HR) for OS [HR 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57-0.81 and HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.52-0.75, respectively] for enzalutamide compared to placebo versus the unadjusted ITT analysis (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.60-0.84).These results suggest a slightly greater effect of enzalutamide on OS than originally reported.CONCLUSION: In the PREVAIL study, switching to nonstandard antineoplastic mCRPC therapies resulted in the ITT analysis of primary data underestimating the benefit of enzalutamide on OS.",1,1,1,1
28166812,"Efficacy of high-intensity focused ultrasound-assisted hepatic resection (HIFU-AR) on blood loss reduction in patients with liver metastases requiring hepatectomy: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Liver resection is the only potentially curative treatment for colorectal liver metastases (LM).It is considered a safe procedure, but is often associated with blood loss during liver transection.Blood transfusions are frequently needed, but they are associated with increased morbidity and risk of recurrence.Many surgical devices have been developed to decrease blood loss.However, none of them has proven superior to the standard crushing technique.We developed a new, powerful intra-operative high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) transducer which destroys tissue by coagulative necrosis.We aim to evaluate whether HIFU-assisted liver resection (HIFU-AR) results in reduced blood loss.METHODS: This is a prospective, single-centre, randomized (1:1 ratio), comparative, open-label phase II study.Patients with LM requiring a hepatectomy for >/= 2 segments will be included.Patients with cirrhosis or sinusoidal obstruction syndrome with portal hypertension will be excluded.The primary endpoint is normalized blood loss in millilitres per square centimetre of liver section plane.Secondary endpoints are: total blood loss, transection time, transection time per square centimetre of liver area, haemostasis time, clip density on the liver section area, rate and duration of the Pringle manoeuvre, rate of patients needing a blood transfusion, length of hospital stay, morbidity, patients with positive resection margin, and local recurrence.Assuming a blood loss of 7.6 +/- 3.7 mL/cm(2) among controls, the study will have 85% power to detect a twofold decrease of blood loss in the experimental arm, using a Wilcoxon (Mann-Whitney) rank-sum test with a 0.05 two-sided significance level.Twenty-one randomized patients per arm are required.Considering the risk of contraindications at surgery, up to eight patients may be enrolled in addition to the 42 planned, with an enrolment period of 24 months.Randomization will be stratified by surgeon.DISCUSSION: We previously demonstrated the safety and efficacy of intra-operative HIFU in patients operated on for LM.We also demonstrated the efficacy of HIFU-AR in a preclinical study.Participants in the HIFU-AR group of this randomized trial can expect to benefit from reduced blood loss and decreased ischemia of liver parenchyma.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrial.gov, NCT02728167 .Registered on 22 March 2016.",0,0,0,0
25403578,"FOLFOX4 versus sequential dose-dense FOLFOX7 followed by FOLFIRI in patients with resectable metastatic colorectal cancer (MIROX): a pragmatic approach to chemotherapy timing with perioperative or postoperative chemotherapy from an open-label, randomized phase III trial.BACKGROUND: Perioperative FOLFOX4 (oxaliplatin plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin) chemotherapy is the current standard in patients with resectable metastases from colorectal cancer (CRC).We aimed to determine whether a sequential chemotherapy with dose-dense oxaliplatin (FOLFOX7) and irinotecan (FOLFIRI; irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin) is superior to FOLFOX4.The chemotherapy timing was not imposed, and was perioperative or postoperative.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this open-label, phase III trial, patients with resectable or resected metastases were randomly assigned either to 12 cycles of FOLFOX4 (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m(2)) or 6 cycles of FOLFOX7 (oxaliplatin 130 mg/m(2)) followed by 6 cycles of FOLFIRI (irinotecan 180 mg/m(2)).Randomization was done centrally, with stratification by chemotherapy timing, type of local treatment (surgery versus radiofrequency ablation with/without surgery), and Fong's prognostic score.The primary end point was 2-year disease-free survival (DFS).RESULTS: A total of 284 patients were randomized, 142 in each treatment group.Chemotherapy was perioperative in 168 (59.2%) patients and postoperative in 116 (40.8%) patients.Perioperative chemotherapy was preferentially proposed for synchronous metastases, whereas postoperative chemotherapy was more frequently used for metachronous metastases.Two-year DFS was 48.5% in the FOLFOX4 group and 50.0% in the FOLFOX7-FOLFIRI group.In the multivariable analysis, more than one metastasis [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.15] and synchronous metastases (HR = 1.63) were independent prognostic factors for shorter DFS.Five-year overall survival (OS) rate was 69.5% with FOLFOX4 versus 66.6% with FOLFOX7-FOLFIRI.CONCLUSIONS: FOLFOX7-FOLFIRI is not superior to FOLFOX4 in patients with resectable metastatic CRC.Five-year OS rates observed in both groups are the highest ever reported in this setting, possibly reflecting the pragmatic approach to chemotherapy timing.CLINICAL TRIALS NUMBER: NCT00268398.",1,1,1,1

28111430,"Incorporating Erlotinib or Irinotecan Plus Cisplatin into Chemoradiotherapy for Stage III Non-small Cell Lung Cancer According to EGFR Mutation Status.PURPOSE: Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) is the standard care for stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients; however, a more effective regimen is needed to improve the outcome by better controlling occult metastases.We conducted two parallel randomized phase II studies to incorporate erlotinib or irinotecan-cisplatin (IP) into CCRT for stage III NSCLC depending on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation status.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with EGFR-mutant tumors were randomized to receive three cycles of erlotinib first and then either CCRT with erlotinib followed by erlotinib (arm A) or CCRT with IP only (arm B).Patients with EGFR unknown or wild-type tumors were randomized to receive either three cycles of IP before (arm C) or after CCRT with IP (arm D).RESULTS: Seventy-three patients were screened and the study was closed early because of slow accrual after 59 patients were randomized.Overall, there were seven patients in arm A, five in arm B, 22 in arm C, and 25 in arm D. The response rate was 71.4% and 80.0% for arm A and B, and 70.0% and 73.9% for arm C and D. The median overall survival (OS) was 39.3 months versus 31.2 months for arm A and B (p=0.442), and 16.3 months versus 25.3 months for arm C and D (p=0.050).Patients with sensitive EGFR mutations had significantly longer OS than EGFR-wild patients (74.8 months vs. 25.3 months, p=0.034).There were no unexpected toxicities.CONCLUSION: Combined-modality treatment by molecular diagnostics is feasible in stage III NSCLC.EGFR-mutant patients appear to be a distinct subset with longer survival.",1,1,1,1
24314223,"[Evaluation of induction chemotherapy with vinorelbine plus cisplatin (NP) or docetaxel plus cisplatin (TP) combined with concurrent chemoradiotherapy for patients with locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma].OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and side effects of induction chemotherapy with vinorelbine plus cisplatin (NP) or docetaxel plus cisplatin (TP) combined with concurrent chemoradiotherapy in treating locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).METHODS: From January 2005 to December 2009, 146 patients with locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma treated in our department were randomized into NP group (76 patients) or TP group (70 patients).Both groups received two cycles of induction chemotherapy and concurrent chemoradiotherapy.After three weeks of induction chemotherapy, the patients received concurrent chemoradiotherapy.The chemotherapy was recycled every three weeks.Two groups were treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy.RESULTS: The short-term efficacy of NP group was similar to that of TP group.The 3-year overall survival rates, disease-free-survival rates, locoregional relapse-free survival rates and distant metastasis-free survival rates in the NP and TP groups were 84.2% and 82.9%, 71.1% and 74.3%, 89.5% and 91.4%, 81.6% and 77.1%, respectively (P > 0.05).The occurrence rates of leucopenia, anemia and acute mucositis were significantly higher in the TP group than those in the NP group (P < 0.05).The gastrointestinal toxicity, dermatitis and liver toxicity were similar in the two groups.CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of NP regimen induction chemotherapy plus concurrent chemordiotherapy for advanced NPC is similar to that of TP regimen.The toxicity of the NP regimen is lower than that of NP regimen, tolerable, and with a good compliance.",1,1,1,1
23957945,"Initial biopsy Gleason score as a predictive marker for survival benefit in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with docetaxel: data from the TAX327 study.BACKGROUND: Since 2004, docetaxel has been the standard first-line systemic therapy for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).With abiraterone recently becoming available in the predocetaxel setting, it is warranted to identify subgroups of patients who may obtain the greatest benefit from docetaxel and particularly qualify for receiving docetaxel as first-line treatment for mCRPC.OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify factors that could characterize subgroups of patients who obtain the greatest benefit from the use of docetaxel.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: TAX327 was multinational, randomized, phase 3 study that was conducted from 2000 to 2002 in 1006 men with mCRPC.INTERVENTION: Patients were randomized to receive docetaxel every 3 wk (D3), weekly docetaxel (D1), or mitoxantrone every 3 wk (M3), each with prednisone.OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: We investigated whether patients with poorly differentiated tumors (Gleason score >/=7) at diagnosis had greater benefit from D3 compared with M3 than patients with better differentiated tumors (Gleason score </=6).Using a Cox model, we compared overall survival (OS) between the treatment groups within each subgroup of Gleason score.RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: The TAX 327 data showed that the OS benefit of D3 versus M3 was greater in patients with high-grade tumors (median OS: 18.9 vs 14.5 mo; p=0.009) than in patients with low-grade tumors (median OS: 21.6 vs 20.7 mo; p=0.674).Limitations of a retrospective analysis apply.CONCLUSIONS: The survival benefit obtained with docetaxel is most pronounced in patients with high-Gleason-score tumors (Gleason >/=7).In a time of shifting paradigms in mCRPC, with abiraterone becoming available prior to docetaxel chemotherapy, Gleason score may help in selecting patients who obtain the greatest benefit from docetaxel as first-line treatment for mCRPC.Prospective validation of these findings is warranted.",1,1,1,1
26686313,"Anastrozole versus tamoxifen for the prevention of locoregional and contralateral breast cancer in postmenopausal women with locally excised ductal carcinoma in situ (IBIS-II DCIS): a double-blind, randomised controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Third-generation aromatase inhibitors are more effective than tamoxifen for preventing recurrence in postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive invasive breast cancer.However, it is not known whether anastrozole is more effective than tamoxifen for women with hormone-receptor-positive ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).Here, we compare the efficacy of anastrozole with that of tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive DCIS.METHODS: In a double-blind, multicentre, randomised placebo-controlled trial, we recruited women who had been diagnosed with locally excised, hormone-receptor-positive DCIS.Eligible women were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio by central computer allocation to receive 1 mg oral anastrozole or 20 mg oral tamoxifen every day for 5 years.Randomisation was stratified by major centre or hub and was done in blocks (six, eight, or ten).All trial personnel, participants, and clinicians were masked to treatment allocation and only the trial statistician had access to treatment allocation.The primary endpoint was all recurrence, including recurrent DCIS and new contralateral tumours.All analyses were done on a modified intention-to-treat basis (in all women who were randomised and did not revoke consent for their data to be included) and proportional hazard models were used to compute hazard ratios and corresponding confidence intervals.This trial is registered at the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN37546358.RESULTS: Between March 3, 2003, and Feb 8, 2012, we enrolled 2980 postmenopausal women from 236 centres in 14 countries and randomly assigned them to receive anastrozole (1449 analysed) or tamoxifen (1489 analysed).Median follow-up was 7.2 years (IQR 5.6-8.9), and 144 breast cancer recurrences were recorded.We noted no statistically significant difference in overall recurrence (67 recurrences for anastrozole vs 77 for tamoxifen; HR 0.89 [95% CI 0.64-1.23]).The non-inferiority of anastrozole was established (upper 95% CI <1.25), but its superiority to tamoxifen was not (p=0.49).A total of 69 deaths were recorded (33 for anastrozole vs 36 for tamoxifen; HR 0.93 [95% CI 0.58-1.50], p=0.78), and no specific cause was more common in one group than the other.The number of women reporting any adverse event was similar between anastrozole (1323 women, 91%) and tamoxifen (1379 women, 93%); the side-effect profiles of the two drugs differed, with more fractures, musculoskeletal events, hypercholesterolaemia, and strokes with anastrozole and more muscle spasm, gynaecological cancers and symptoms, vasomotor symptoms, and deep vein thromboses with tamoxifen.CONCLUSIONS: No clear efficacy differences were seen between the two treatments.Anastrozole offers another treatment option for postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive DCIS, which may be be more appropriate for some women with contraindications for tamoxifen.Longer follow-up will be necessary to fully evaluate treatment differences.FUNDING: Cancer Research UK, National Health and Medical Research Council Australia, Breast Cancer Research Fund, AstraZeneca, Sanofi Aventis.",1,1,1,1
26822398,"Afatinib plus vinorelbine versus trastuzumab plus vinorelbine in patients with HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer who had progressed on one previous trastuzumab treatment (LUX-Breast 1): an open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Trastuzumab resistance is a key therapeutic challenge in metastatic breast cancer.We postulated that broader inhibition of ErbB receptors with afatinib would improve clinical outcomes compared with HER2 inhibition alone in patients who had progressed on previous trastuzumab treatment.LUX-Breast 1 compared afatinib plus vinorelbine with trastuzumab plus vinorelbine for such patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.METHODS: We did this open-label trial at 350 hospitals in 41 countries worldwide.We enrolled female patients with HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer who had progressed on or following adjuvant trastuzumab or first-line treatment of metastatic disease with trastuzumab.Participants were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive oral afatinib (40 mg/day) plus intravenous vinorelbine (25 mg/m(2) per week) or intravenous trastuzumab (2 mg/kg per week after 4 mg/kg loading dose) plus vinorelbine.Randomisation was done centrally and stratified by previous trastuzumab treatment (adjuvant vs first-line treatment), hormone receptor status (oestrogen receptor and progesterone receptor positive vs others), and region.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, assessed in the intention-to-treat population.This trial is closed to enrolment and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01125566.FINDINGS: Between Aug 26, 2010, and April 26, 2013, we enrolled 508 patients: 339 assigned to the afatinib group and 169 assigned to the trastuzumab group.Recruitment was stopped on April 26, 2013, after a benefit-risk assessment by the independent data monitoring committee was unfavourable for the afatinib group.Patients on afatinib plus vinorelbine had to switch to trastuzumab plus vinorelbine, afatinib monotherapy, vinorelbine monotherapy, or receive treatment outside of the trial.Median follow-up was 9.3 months (IQR 3.7-16.0).Median progression-free survival was 5.5 months (95% CI 5.4-5.6) in the afatinib group and 5.6 months (5.3-7.3) in the trastuzumab group (hazard ratio 1.10 95% CI 0.86-1.41; p=0.43).The most common drug-related adverse events of grade 3 or higher were neutropenia (190 [56%] of 337 patients in the afatinib group vs 102 [60%] of 169 patients in the trastuzumab group), leucopenia (64 [19%] vs 34 [20%]), and diarrhoea (60 [18%] vs none).INTERPRETATION: Trastuzumab-based therapy remains the treatment of choice for patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who had progressed on trastuzumab.FUNDING: Boehringer Ingelheim.",1,1,1,1
28578704,"Dietary supplementation with n-3-fatty acids in patients with pancreatic cancer and cachexia: marine phospholipids versus fish oil - a randomized controlled double-blind trial.BACKGROUND: Like many other cancer patients, most pancreatic carcinoma patients suffer from severe weight loss.As shown in numerous studies with fish oil (FO) supplementation, a minimum daily intake of 1.5 g n-3-fatty acids (n-3-FA) contributes to weight stabilization and improvement of quality of life (QoL) of cancer patients.Given n-3-FA not as triglycerides (FO), but mainly bound to marine phospholipids (MPL), weight stabilization and improvement of QoL has already been seen at much lower doses of n-3-FA (0,3 g), and MPL were much better tolerated.The objective of this double-blind randomized controlled trial was to compare low dose MPL and FO formulations, which had the same n-3-FA amount and composition, on weight and appetite stabilization, global health enhancement (QoL), and plasma FA-profiles in patients suffering from pancreatic cancer.METHODS: Sixty pancreatic cancer patients were included into the study and randomized to take either FO- or MPL supplementation.Patients were treated with 0.3 g of n-3-fatty acids per day over six weeks.Since the n-3-FA content of FO is usually higher than that of MPL, FO was diluted with 40% of medium chain triglycerides (MCT) to achieve the same capsule size in both intervention groups and therefore assure blinding.Routine blood parameters, lipid profiles, body weight, and appetite were measured before and after intervention.Patient compliance was assessed through a patient diary.Quality of life and nutritional habits were assessed with validated questionnaires (EORTC-QLQ-C30, PAN26).Thirty one patients finalized the study protocol and were analyzed (per-protocol-analysis).RESULTS: Intervention with low dose n-3-FAs, either as FO or MPL supplementation, resulted in similar and promising weight and appetite stabilization in pancreatic cancer patients.MPL capsules were slightly better tolerated and showed fewer side effects, when compared to FO supplementation.CONCLUSION: The similar effects between both interventions were unexpected but reliable, since the MPL and FO formulations caused identical increases of n-3-FAs in plasma lipids of included patients after supplementation.The effects of FO with very low n-3-FA content might be explained by the addition of MCT.The results of this study suggest the need for further investigations of marine phospholipids for the improvement of QoL of cancer patients, optionally in combination with MCT.",0,0,0,0
25683204,"Prostate cancer screening using risk stratification based on a multi-state model of genetic variants.BACKGROUND: Risk-stratified screening for prostate cancer (PCa) with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing incorporating genetic variants has received some attention but has been scarcely investigated.We developed a model to stratify the Finnish population by different risk profiles related to genetic variants to optimize the screening policy.METHODS: Data from the Finnish randomized controlled trial on screening for PCa with PSA testing were used to estimate a six-state Markov model of disease progression.Blood samples from Finnish men were used to assess the risk of PCa related to three genetic variants (rs4242382, rs138213197, and rs200331695).A risk score-based approach combined with a series of computer simulation models was applied to optimize individual screening policies.RESULTS: The 10-year risk of having progressive prostate cancer detected ranged from 43% in the top 5% risk group to approximately 11% in the bottom half of the population.Using the median group, with screening every four years beginning at 55 years-old, as the reference group, the recommended age beginning screening was approximately 47 years-old for the top 5% risk group and 55 years-old for those in the lower 60% risk group.The recommended interscreening interval has been shortened for individuals in the high risk group.The increased availability of genomic information allows the proposed multistate model to be more discriminating with respect to risk stratification and the suggested screening policy, particularly for the lowest risk groups-. -- CONCLUSIONS: A multi-state genetic variant-based model was developed for further application to population risk stratification to optimize the interscreening interval and the age at which to begin screening for PSA.A small sub-group of the population is likely to benefit from more intensive screening with early start and short interval, while half of the population is unlikely to benefit from such protocol (compared with four-year interval after age 55 years).",0,0,0,0
28240635,"Comparison of the Timing of Hepatic Arterial Phase and Image Quality Using Test-Bolus and Bolus-Tracking Techniques in Gadolinium-Ethoxybenzyl-Diethylenetriamine Pentaacetic Acid-Enhanced Hepatic Dynamic Magnetic Resonance Imaging.OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare the image quality, the degree of artifacts and the percentage of timing of the optimal hepatic arterial phase (HAP) between test-bolus and bolus-tracking methods on gadolinium-ethoxybenzyl-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA)-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).METHODS: In this prospective study, 60 patients who underwent 3-dimensional dynamic Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced hepatic 3-T MRI were enrolled in this study.We randomly assigned the 30 patients to the bolus-tracking method, and another 30 patients to the test-bolus method.Signal-to-noise ratios of the liver and spleen in HAP were compared in the 2 groups.Two radiologists independently assessed the ratio of optimal timing of HAP and the degree of ringing and motion artifacts of the 2 protocols.RESULTS: The signal-to-noise ratios of the liver (24.0 [SD, 6.4] vs 20.4 [SD, 4.0]) and spleen (30.0 [SD, 13.3] vs 23.6 [SD, 9.9]) were significantly higher in the test-bolus protocol than in the bolus-tracking protocol.The ratio of optimal timing was also significantly higher with the test-bolus protocol than with the bolus-tracking protocol (76.7% vs 40.0%).The degree of ringing and motion artifacts of test-bolus protocol was significantly lower than that of the bolus-tracking protocol (P < 0.01).CONCLUSIONS: The test-bolus protocol in dynamic 3-T MRI can yield better qualitative image quality and more optimal timing of HAP images, while reducing the degree of artifacts compared with the bolus-tracking protocol.",1,0,0,0

PgR and Ki67 expression were significantly reduced with all treatments (means were -34% to -45%, and -75% to -85%, respectively; all P = 0.0001), with no differences between groups.CONCLUSIONS: In this short-term study, all treatments reduced ER expression, although F and F + A showed greater reductions than A. No significant differences were detected between the treatment groups in terms of PgR and Ki67 expression.No additional reduction in tumor biomarkers with combination treatment was observed, suggesting that F + A is unlikely to have further clinical benefit over F alone.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00259090.",1,1,1,1

23281805,"Randomized Phase II trial of paclitaxel and carboplatin followed by gemcitabine switch-maintenance therapy versus gemcitabine and carboplatin followed by gemcitabine continuation-maintenance therapy in previously untreated advanced non-small cell lung cancer.BACKGROUND: In recent years, maintenance chemotherapy is increasingly being recognized as a new treatment strategy to improve the outcome of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).However, the optimal maintenance strategy is still controversial.Gemcitabine is a promising candidate for single-agent maintenance therapy because of little toxicity and good tolerability.We have conducted a randomized phase II study to evaluate the validity of single-agent maintenance chemotherapy of gemcitabine and to compare continuation- and switch-maintenance.METHODS: Chemonaive patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC were randomly assigned 1:1 to either arm A or B. Patients received paclitaxel (200 mg/m2, day 1) plus carboplatin (AUC 6 mg/mL/min, day 1) every 3 weeks in arm A, or gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2, days 1 and 8) plus carboplatin (AUC 5 mg/mL/min, day1) every 3 weeks in arm B. Non-progressive patients following 3 cycles of induction chemotherapy received maintenance gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2, days 1 and 8) every 3 weeks.( TRIAL REGISTRATION: UMIN000008252)RESULTS: The study was stopped because of delayed accrual at interim analysis.Of the randomly assigned 50 patients, 49 except for one in arm B were evaluable.Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 4.6 months for arm A vs. 3.5 months for arm B (HR = 1.03; 95% CI, 0.45-2.27; p = 0.95) and median overall survival (OS) was 15.0 months for arm A vs. 14.8 months for arm B (HR = 0.79; 95% CI, 0.40-1.51; p = 0.60), showing no difference between the two arms.The response rate, disease control rate, and the transit rate to maintenance phase were 36.0% (9/25), 64.0% (16/25), and 48% (12/25) for arm A vs. 16.7% (4/24), 50.0% (12/24), and 33% (8/24) for arm B, which were also statistically similar between the two arms (p = 0.13, p = 0.32, and p = 0.30, respectively).Both induction regimens were tolerable, except that more patients experienced peripheral neuropathy in arm A. Toxicities during the maintenance phase were also minimal.CONCLUSION: Survival and overall response were not significantly different between the two arms.Gemcitabine may be well-tolerable and feasible for maintenance therapy.",1,1,1,1
25907945,"[Perioperative immunomodulatory therapy does not decrease postoperative recurrence rate of rectal cancer].OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of perioperative immunomodulatory therapy on postoperative recurrence of rectal cancer.METHODS: This prospective study was conducted among 238 rectal/anal cancer patients undergoing intersphincteric resection at our center between January, 2010 and January, 2011, among whom 150 were eligible to be included and completed the study.The 150 patients were randomized in a double-blinded fashion into 3 equal groups to receive immunomodulatory therapy with 8 mg/kg celecoxib (group A), 0.4 mg/kg Sou-Medrol (group B), or placebo (group C), given daily from 5 days before surgery to 5 days after surgery, and the postoperative cancer recurrence were compared.RESULTS: At 3 days after the operation, the 3 groups showed significantly different C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, which decreased obviously in all the 3 groups compared with those at 1 day following the operation (P=0.022), especially in group B. The levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) at 3 days after the operation also differed significantly between the 3 groups but were lower in all the 3 groups than those at 1 day after the operation (P=0.046), and this reduction was the most obvious in group A. COX-2 expression differed significantly between the 3 groups (P=0.017), among which group A showed the most obvious suppression of COX-2 expression.During the follow-up for a mean of 45 months, no significant difference in the recurrence rate was found between the 3 groups (P=0.549).CONCLUSION: With a lower efficacy than Sou-Medrol in decreasing postoperative inflammation, celecoxib produces a better effect in inhibiting COX-2 expression, but it does not lower postoperative recurrence rate of rectal cancer.",0,0,0,0
27884679,"Risk-stratified staging in paediatric hepatoblastoma: a unified analysis from the Children's Hepatic tumors International Collaboration.BACKGROUND: Comparative assessment of treatment results in paediatric hepatoblastoma trials has been hampered by small patient numbers and the use of multiple disparate staging systems by the four major trial groups.To address this challenge, we formed a global coalition, the Children's Hepatic tumors International Collaboration (CHIC), with the aim of creating a common approach to staging and risk stratification in this rare cancer.METHODS: The CHIC steering committee-consisting of leadership from the four major cooperative trial groups (the International Childhood Liver Tumours Strategy Group, Children's Oncology Group, the German Society for Paediatric Oncology and Haematology, and the Japanese Study Group for Paediatric Liver Tumours)-created a shared international database that includes comprehensive data from 1605 children treated in eight multicentre hepatoblastoma trials over 25 years.Diagnostic factors found to be most prognostic on initial analysis were PRETreatment EXTent of disease (PRETEXT) group; age younger than 3 years, 3-7 years, and 8 years or older; alpha fetoprotein (AFP) concentration of 100 ng/mL or lower and 101-1000 ng/mL; and the PRETEXT annotation factors metastatic disease (M), macrovascular involvement of all hepatic veins (V) or portal bifurcation (P), contiguous extrahepatic tumour (E), multifocal tumour (F), and spontaneous rupture (R).We defined five clinically relevant backbone groups on the basis of established prognostic factors: PRETEXT I/II, PRETEXT III, PRETEXT IV, metastatic disease, and AFP concentration of 100 ng/mL or lower at diagnosis.We then carried the additional factors into a hierarchical backwards elimination multivariable analysis and used the results to create a new international staging system.RESULTS: Within each backbone group, we identified constellations of factors that were most predictive of outcome in that group.The robustness of candidate models was then interrogated using the bootstrapping procedure.Using the clinically established PRETEXT groups I, II, III, and IV as our stems, we created risk stratification trees based on 5 year event-free survival and clinical applicability.We defined and adopted four risk groups: very low, low, intermediate, and high.INTERPRETATION: We have created a unified global approach to risk stratification in children with hepatoblastoma on the basis of rigorous statistical interrogation of what is, to the best of our knowledge, the largest dataset ever assembled for this rare paediatric tumour.This achievement provides the structural framework for further collaboration and prospective international cooperative study, such as the Paediatric Hepatic International Tumour Trial (PHITT).FUNDING: European Network for Cancer Research in Children and Adolescents, funded through the Framework Program 7 of the European Commission (grant number 261474); Children's Oncology Group CureSearch grant contributed by the Hepatoblastoma Foundation; Practical Research for Innovative Cancer Control and Project Promoting Clinical Trials for Development of New Drugs and Medical Devices, Japan Agency for Medical Research; and Swiss Cancer Research grant.",0,0,0,0

CONCLUSION: We observed significantly less BCF and LF in the high-dose arm.This suggests improvement of the therapeutic ratio.However, we observed similar rates of CF and PCD at the current update.More follow-up is needed to investigate which patients benefit in terms of prolonged OS.",0,0,0,0
24975432,"Morphine or oxycodone for cancer-related pain? A randomized, open-label, controlled trial.CONTEXT: There is wide interindividual variation in response to morphine for cancer-related pain; 30% of patients do not have a good therapeutic outcome.Alternative opioids such as oxycodone are increasingly being used, and opioid switching has become common clinical practice.OBJECTIVES: To compare clinical response to oral morphine vs. oral oxycodone when used as first-line or second-line (after switching) treatment in patients with cancer-related pain.METHODS: In this prospective, open-label, randomized, controlled trial (ISRCTN65155201) with a selected crossover phase, patients with cancer-related pain were randomized to receive either oral morphine or oxycodone as first-line treatment.Dose was individually titrated until the patient reported adequate pain control.Patients who did not respond to the first-line opioid (either because of inadequate analgesia or unacceptable adverse effects) were switched to the alternative opioid.RESULTS: Two hundred patients were recruited.On intention-to-treat analysis (n = 198, morphine 98, oxycodone 100), there was no significant difference between the numbers of patients responding to morphine (61/98 = 62%) or oxycodone (67/100 = 67%) when used as a first-line opioid.Similarly, there was no significant difference in subsequent response when patients were switched to either morphine (8/12 = 67%) or oxycodone (11/21 = 52%).Per-protocol analysis demonstrated a 95% response rate when both opioids were available.There was no difference in adverse reaction scores between morphine and oxycodone either in first-line responders or nonresponders.CONCLUSION: In this population, there was no difference between analgesic response or adverse reactions to oral morphine and oxycodone when used as a first- or second-line opioid.These data provide evidence to support opioid switching to improve outcomes.",0,0,0,0
24383843,"Imatinib 800 mg daily induces deeper molecular responses than imatinib 400 mg daily: results of SWOG S0325, an intergroup randomized PHASE II trial in newly diagnosed chronic phase chronic myeloid leukaemia.The standard dose of imatinib for newly diagnosed patients with chronic phase chronic myeloid leukaemia (CP-CML) is 400 mg daily (IM400), but the optimal dose is unknown.This randomized phase II study compared the rates of molecular, haematological and cytogenetic response to IM400 vs. imatinib 400 mg twice daily (IM800) in 153 adult patients with CP-CML.Dose adjustments for toxicity were flexible to maximize retention on study.Molecular response (MR) at 12 months was deeper in the IM800 arm (4-log reduction of BCR-ABL1 mRNA: 25% vs. 10% of patients, P = 0.038; 3-log reduction: 53% vs. 35%, P = 0.049).During the first 12 months BCR-ABL1 levels in the IM800 arm were an average 2.9-fold lower than in the IM400 arm (P = 0.010).Complete haematological response was similar, but complete cytogenetic response was higher with IM800 (85% vs. 67%, P = 0.040).Grade 3-4 toxicities were more common for IM800 (58% vs. 31%, P = 0.0007), and were most commonly haematological.Few patients have relapsed, progressed or died, but both progression-free (P = 0.048) and relapse-free (P = 0.031) survival were superior for IM800.In newly diagnosed CP-CML patients, IM800 induced deeper MRs than IM400, with a trend for improved progression-free and overall survival, but was associated with more severe toxicity.",1,1,1,1

27381209,"Protocol of the Australasian Malignant Pleural Effusion-2 (AMPLE-2) trial: a multicentre randomised study of aggressive versus symptom-guided drainage via indwelling pleural catheters.INTRODUCTION: Malignant pleural effusions (MPEs) can complicate most cancers, causing dyspnoea and impairing quality of life (QoL).Indwelling pleural catheters (IPCs) are a novel management approach allowing ambulatory fluid drainage and are increasingly used as an alternative to pleurodesis.IPC drainage approaches vary greatly between centres.Some advocate aggressive (usually daily) removal of fluid to provide best symptom control and chance of spontaneous pleurodesis.Daily drainages however demand considerably more resources and may increase risks of complications.Others believe that MPE care is palliative and drainage should be performed only when patients become symptomatic (often weekly to monthly).Identifying the best drainage approach will optimise patient care and healthcare resource utilisation.METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A multicentre, open-label randomised trial.Patients with MPE will be randomised 1:1 to daily or symptom-guided drainage regimes after IPC insertion.Patient allocation to groups will be stratified for the cancer type (mesothelioma vs others), performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group status 0-1 vs >/=2), presence of trapped lung (vs not) and prior pleurodesis (vs not).The primary outcome is the mean daily dyspnoea score, measured by a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS) over the first 60 days.Secondary outcomes include benefits on physical activity levels, rate of spontaneous pleurodesis, complications, hospital admission days, healthcare costs and QoL measures.Enrolment of 86 participants will detect a mean difference of VAS score of 14 mm between the treatment arms (5% significance, 90% power) assuming a common between-group SD of 18.9 mm and a 10% lost to follow-up rate.ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Sir Charles Gairdner Group Human Research Ethics Committee has approved the study (number 2015-043).Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at scientific meetings.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ACTRN12615000963527; Pre-results.",0,0,0,0

26110667,"MR Imaging as an Additional Screening Modality for the Detection of Breast Cancer in Women Aged 50-75 Years with Extremely Dense Breasts: The DENSE Trial Study Design.Women with extremely dense breasts have an increased risk of breast cancer and lower mammographic tumor detectability.Nevertheless, in most countries, these women are currently screened with mammography only.Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has the potential to improve breast cancer detection at an early stage because of its higher sensitivity.However, MR imaging is more expensive and is expected to be accompanied by an increase in the number of false-positive results and, possibly, an increase in overdiagnosis.To study the additional value of MR imaging, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design is needed in which one group undergoes mammography and the other group undergoes mammography and MR imaging.With this design, it is possible to determine the proportion of interval cancers within each study arm.For this to be an effective screening strategy, the additional cancers detected at MR imaging screening must be accompanied by a subsequent reduction in interval cancers.The Dense Tissue and Early Breast Neoplasm Screening, or DENSE, trial is a multicenter RCT performed in the Dutch biennial population-based screening program (subject age range, 50-75 years).The study was approved by the Dutch Minister of Health, Welfare and Sport.In this study, mammographic density is measured by using a fully automated volumetric method.Participants with extremely dense breasts (American College of Radiology breast density category 4) and a negative result at mammography (Breast Imaging Recording and Data System category 1 or 2) are randomly assigned to undergo additional MR imaging (n = 7237) or to be treated according to current practice (n = 28 948).Participants provide written informed consent before the MR imaging examination, which consists of dynamic breast MR imaging with gadolinium-based contrast medium and is intended to be performed for three consecutive screening rounds.The primary outcome is the difference in the proportions of interval cancers between the study arms.Secondary outcomes are the number of MR imaging screening-detected cancers, proportions of false-positive results, diagnostic yield of MR imaging, tumor characteristics, quality of life, and cost effectiveness.",0,0,0,0
22493375,"Intra-arterial infusion of irinotecan-loaded drug-eluting beads (DEBIRI) versus intravenous therapy (FOLFIRI) for hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer: final results of a phase III study.BACKGROUND: Metastases to the liver receive most of their blood supply from the arterial route, therefore for patients with hepatic metastases from large bowel cancer, hepatic arterial infusion adopting drug-eluting beads preloaded with irinotecan (DEBIRI) may offer a chance of cure.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a multi-institutional study, 74 patients were randomly assigned to receive DEBIRI (36) versus systemic irinotecan, fluorouracil and leucovorin (FOLFIRI, 38).The primary end-point was survival; secondary end points were response, recurrence, toxicity, quality of life, cost and influence of molecular markers.RESULTS: At 50 months, overall survival was significantly longer for patients treated with DEBIRI than for those treated with FOLFIRI (p=0.031, log-rank).Median survival was 22 (95% Confidence Interval CI=21-23) months, for DEBIRI and 15 (95% CI=12-18) months for FOLFIRI.Progression-free survival was 7 (95% CI=3-11) months in the DEBIRI group compared to 4 (95% CI=3-5) months in the FOLFIRI group and the difference between groups was statistically significant (p=0.006, log-rank).Extrahepatic progression had occurred in all patients by the end of the study, at a median time of 13 (95% CI=10-16) months in the DEBIRI group compared to 9 (95% CI 5-13) months in the FOLFIRI group.A statistically significant difference between groups was not observed (p=0.064, log-rank).The median time for duration of improvement to quality of life was 8 (95% CI=3-13) months in the DEBIRI group and 3 (95% CI=2-4) months in the FOLFIRI group.The difference in duration of improvement was statistically significant (p=0.00002, log-rank).CONCLUSION: This study showed a statistically significant difference between DEBIRI and FOLFIRI for overall survival (7 months), progression-free survival (3 months) and quality of life (5 months).In addition, a clinically significant improvement in time to extrahepatic progression (4 months) was observed for DEBIRI, a reversal of the expectation for a regional treatment.This suggests a benefit of DEBIRI treatment over standard chemotherapy and serves to establish the expected difference between these two treatment options for planning future large randomized studies.",1,1,1,1
23562353,"Influence of DNA copy number and mRNA levels on the expression of breast cancer related proteins.For a panel of cancer related proteins, the aim was to shed light on which molecular level the expression of each protein was mainly regulated in breast tumors, and to investigate whether differences in regulation were reflected in different molecular subtypes.DNA, mRNA and protein lysates from 251 breast tumor specimens were analyzed using appropriate microarray technologies.Data from all three levels were available for 52 proteins selected for their known involvement in cancer, primarily through the PI3K/Akt pathway.For every protein, in cis Spearman rank correlations between the three molecular levels were calculated across all samples and within each intrinsic gene expression subtype, enabling 63 comparisons altogether due to multiple gene probes matching to single proteins.Subtype-specific relationships between the three molecular levels were studied by calculating the variance of subtype-specific correlation and differences between overall and average subtype-specific correlation.The findings were validated in an external dataset comprising 703 breast tumor specimens.The proteins were sorted into four groups based on the calculated rank correlation values between the three molecular levels.Group A consisted of eight proteins with significant correlation between DNA copy number levels and mRNA expression, and between mRNA expression and protein expression (Bonferroni adjusted p < 0.05).Group B consisted of 14 proteins with significant correlation between mRNA expression and protein expression.Group C consisted of 15 proteins with significant correlation between copy number levels and mRNA expression.For the remaining 25 proteins (group D), no significant correlations was observed.Stratification of tumors according to intrinsic subtype enabled identification of positive correlations between copy number levels, mRNA and protein expression that were undetectable when considering the entire sample set.Protein pairings that either demonstrated high variance in correlation values between subtypes, or between subtypes and the total dataset were studied in particular.The protein expression of cleaved caspase 7 was most highly expressed, and correlated highest to CASP7 gene expression within the basal-like subtype, accompanied by the lowest amounts of hsa-miR-29c.Luminal A-like subtype demonstrated highest amounts of hsa-miR-29c (a miRNA with a putative target sequence in CASP7 mRNA), low expression of cleaved caspase 7 and low correlation to CASP7 gene expression.Such pattern might be an indication of hsa-miR-29c miRNA functioning as a repressor of translation of CASP7 within the luminal-A subtype.Across the entire cohort no correlation was found between CCNB1 copy number and gene expression.However, within most gene intrinsic subtypes, mRNA and protein expression of cyclin B1 was found positively correlated to copy number data, suggesting that copy number can affect the overall expression of this protein.Aberrations of cyclin B1 copy number also identified patients with reduced overall survival within each subtype.Based on correlation between the three molecular levels, genes and their products could be sorted into four groups for which the expression was likely to be regulated at different molecular levels.Further stratification suggested subtype-specific regulation that was not evident across the entire sample set.",0,0,0,0
25057173,"EGFR biomarkers predict benefit from vandetanib in combination with docetaxel in a randomized phase III study of second-line treatment of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.BACKGROUND: ZODIAC was a randomized phase III study of second-line treatment in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that evaluated the addition of vandetanib to docetaxel.The study showed a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival and objective response rate, but not in overall survival for unselected patients.This study evaluated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutation, copy number gain, and protein expression, and KRAS gene mutation, in pretreatment tumor samples as potential biomarkers predicting benefit from vandetanib as second-line treatment of NSCLC.PATIENTS AND METHODS: After progression following first-line chemotherapy, 1391 patients with locally advanced or metastatic (stage IIIB/IV) NSCLC were randomized 1 : 1 to receive vandetanib (100 mg/day) plus docetaxel (75 mg/m(2) every 21 days) or placebo plus docetaxel in the ZODIAC study.Archival tumor samples (n = 570) were collected from consenting patients (n = 958) for predefined, prospective biomarker analyses.RESULTS: Of evaluable samples, 14% were EGFR mutation positive, 35% were EGFR FISH positive, 88% were EGFR protein expression positive, and 13% were KRAS mutation positive.Compared with the overall study population, in which progression-free survival (PFS) [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.79] but not OS (HR = 0.91) were significantly improved with vandetanib, there was greater relative clinical benefit for patients with EGFR mutation-positive tumors [PFS HR 0.51, confidence interval (CI) 0.25-1.06 and OS HR 0.46, CI 0.14-1.57] and EGFR FISH-positive tumors (PFS HR 0.61, CI 0.39-0.94 and OS HR 0.48, CI 0.28-0.84).Similarly, patients with EGFR mutation or FISH-positive tumor samples who received vandetanib had an increased chance of objective tumor response (odds ratios 3.34, CI 0.8-13.89, and 3.90, CI 1.02-14.82, respectively).There did not appear to be benefit for vandetanib in patients with KRAS mutation-positive tumors.CONCLUSIONS: High EGFR gene copy number or activating EGFR mutations may identify patient subgroups who receive increased clinical benefit from vandetanib in combination with docetaxel in second-line NSCLC.CLINICALTRIALSGOV: NCT00312377.",1,1,1,1

27589688,"Primary analysis of a prospective, randomized, single-blinded phase II trial evaluating the HER2 peptide GP2 vaccine in breast cancer patients to prevent recurrence.GP2 is a HER2-derived, HLA-A2+ restricted peptide.Phase I studies showed GP2 administered with GM-CSF to be safe and immunogenic.Here we report the primary analysis of a prospective, randomized, multicenter phase II adjuvant trial conducted to determine the vaccine's efficacy.The trial enrolled HLA-A2+, clinically disease-free, node-positive and high-risk node-negative breast cancer patients with tumors expressing HER2 (immunohistochemistry[IHC] 1+-3+).Patients were randomized to GP2+GM-CSF versus GM-CSF alone.Disease-free survival (DFS) was analyzed in intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-treatment cohorts; pre-specified subgroup analyses were performed for patients with IHC 3+ or FISH+ disease.The trial enrolled 180 patients; 89 received GP2+GM-CSF and 91 received GM-CSF alone.The groups were well-matched for clinicopathologic characteristics.Toxicities have been minimal.The Kaplan-Meier estimated 5-year DFS rate in the ITT analyses was 88% (95% CI:78-94%) in vaccinated vs. 81% (95% CI:69-89%) (P = 0.43) in control patients after a 34 month median follow-up.In the per-treatment analysis, the estimated 5-year DFS rates were 94% (95% CI:83-98%) and 85% (73-92%) (P = 0.17).In IHC 3+/FISH+ patients, the estimated 5-year DFS rate was 94% (82-98%) in vaccinated patients (n = 51) vs. 89% (71-96%) in control patients (n = 50), (P = 0.86) in the ITT analyses and 100% vs. 89% (71-96%) in vaccinated vs. control patients in the per-treatment analyses (P = 0.08).While the overall ITT analysis did not demonstrate benefit to vaccination, this trial confirmed that the GP2 vaccine is safe and suggests that vaccination may have clinical activity, particularly in patients with HER2 overexpression who received the full vaccine series (ie per-treatment group).",1,1,1,1
24923533,"Impact of comprehensive geriatric assessment on survival, function, and nutritional status in elderly patients with head and neck cancer: protocol for a multicentre randomised controlled trial (EGeSOR).BACKGROUND: Survival is poorer in elderly patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinomas [HNSCCs] than in younger patients.Possible explanations include a contribution of co-morbidities to mortality, frequent refusal of standard therapy, and the use of suboptimal treatments due to concern about toxicities.The Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment [CGA] is a multidimensional assessment of general health that can help to customise treatment and follow-up plans.The CGA has been proven effective in several health settings but has not been evaluated in randomised studies of patients with cancer.Our aim here was to assess the impact of the CGA on overall survival, function, and nutritional status of elderly patients with HNSCC.METHODS/DESIGN: EGeSOR is an open-label, multicentre, randomised, controlled, parallel-group trial in patients aged 70 years or older and receiving standard care for HNSCC.The intervention includes four components: the CGA conducted by a geriatrician before cancer treatment, participation of the same geriatrician in cancer treatment selection, a standardised geriatric therapeutic intervention designed by the same geriatrician; and geriatric follow-up for 24 months.The primary endpoint, assessed after 6 months, is a composite criterion including death, functional impairment [Activities of Daily Living score decrease >/= 2], and weight loss >/= 10%.Secondary endpoints include progression-free survival, unscheduled admissions, quality of life, treatment toxicities, costs, and completion of the planned cancer treatment.A centralised online system is used to perform 1:1 randomisation with a minimisation algorithm for centre, age, T and N stages, and tumour site [oral, oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal, or laryngeal].The estimated sample size is 704 patients, who are being recruited by 14 centres in 9 French cities.DISCUSSION: EGeSOR is the first randomised trial of the CGA in elderly cancer patients.We expect the CGA to have direct clinical benefits on the management of elderly patients with HNSCC.If this expectation is fulfilled, the trial may lead to modifications of the management model for elderly patients with cancer.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Trial registration: NCT02025062.",0,0,0,0

23850170,"Which patients benefit most from primary surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy in stage IIIC or IV ovarian cancer? An exploratory analysis of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer 55971 randomised trial.BACKGROUND: To investigate whether biomarkers consisting of baseline characteristics of advanced stage ovarian cancer patients can help in identifying subgroups of patients who would benefit more from primary surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy.METHODS: We used data of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 55971 trial in which 670 patients were randomly assigned to primary surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy.The primary outcome was overall survival.Ten baseline clinical and pathological characteristics were selected as potential biomarkers.Using Subpopulation Treatment Effect Pattern Plots (STEPP), biomarkers with a statistically significant qualitative additive interaction with treatment were considered as potentially informative for treatment selection.We also combined selected biomarkers to form a multimarker treatment selection rule.FINDINGS: The size of the largest metastatic tumour and clinical stage were significantly associated with the magnitude of the benefit from treatment, in terms of five-year survival (p for interaction: 0.008 and 0.016, respectively).Stage IIIC patients with metastatic tumours 45 mm benefited more from primary surgery while stage IV patients with metastatic tumours >45 mm benefited more from neoadjuvant chemotherapy.In stage IIIC patients with larger metastatic tumours and in stage IV patients with less extensive metastatic tumours both treatments were equally effective.We estimated that by selecting treatments for patients based on largest metastatic tumour and clinical stage, the potential five-year survival rate in the population of treated patients would be 27.3% (95% confidence interval (CI) 21.9-33.0), 7.8% higher than if all were treated with primary surgery, and 5.6% higher if all were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.INTERPRETATION: Although survival was comparable after primary surgery and neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the overall group of patients with ovarian cancer in the EORTC 55971 trial, we found in this exploratory analysis that patients with stage IIIC and less extensive metastatic tumours had higher survival with primary surgery, while patients with stage IV disease and large metastatic tumours had higher survival with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.For patients who did not meet these criteria, both treatment options led to comparable survival rates.",1,1,1,1

27498129,"Toxicity of dual HER2-blockade with pertuzumab added to anthracycline versus non-anthracycline containing chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment in HER2-positive breast cancer: The TRAIN-2 study.BACKGROUND: The addition of pertuzumab to neoadjuvant trastuzumab-based chemotherapy improves pathologic complete response rates in HER2-positive breast cancer.However, increased toxicity has been reported with the addition of pertuzumab, and this may differ between various chemotherapy backbone regimens.We evaluated toxicities of pertuzumab when added to either FEC-T (5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide, trastuzumab) or weekly paclitaxel, trastuzumab, carboplatin (PTC).METHODS: The TRAIN-2 study is a neoadjuvant randomized controlled trial in stage II and III HER2-positive breast cancer (NCT01996267).Patients are randomly assigned to receive either three cycles of FEC-T plus pertuzumab or three cycles of PTC plus pertuzumab, followed by six cycles of PTC plus pertuzumab in both arms.Toxicities are described per treatment arm according to the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03.RESULTS: This analysis includes 110 patients balanced over both treatment arms.Neutropenia was the most common hematologic toxicity, with grade 3-4 occurring in 53% in the FEC-T-arm and in 51% in the PTC-arm.Febrile neutropenia occurred in 9% in the FEC-T arm and did not occur in the PTC-arm.Secondary G-CSF prophylaxis was used in 35-40% of patients.Asymptomatic ejection fraction decrease grade 2 was observed in 24% in the FEC-T-arm and 11% in the PTC-arm.The most common grade 3-4 non-hematologic toxicity was diarrhea (5% in the FEC-T-arm and 18% in the PTC-arm).CONCLUSIONS: Pertuzumab in combination with FEC-T mostly causes neutropenia, and when added to PTC mostly causes diarrhea.Significant cardiac toxicity is rare with both regimens, and toxicity is overall well manageable.",1,1,1,1
28412590,"Baseline carcinoembryonic antigen as a predictive factor of ramucirumab efficacy in RAISE, a second-line metastatic colorectal carcinoma phase III trial.BACKGROUND: The RAISE phase III clinical trial demonstrated that ramucirumab + (folinic acid plus 5-fluorouracil plus irinotecan) FOLFIRI significantly improved overall survival (OS) versus placebo + FOLFIRI for second-line metastatic colorectal carcinoma (mCRC) patients failing bevacizumab- and oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.73-0.98, P = 0.022).Post hoc analyses of RAISE patient data examined the association of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) subgroups with efficacy parameters.METHODS: CEA subgroups (</=10 versus >10 ng/ml) were based on 2X upper limit of normal (ULN) (5 ng/ml).The Kaplan-Meier method estimated the median OS and the progression-free survival (PFS).Log-rank test compared the survival distributions within the subgroups.Hazard ratio (HR) (95% confidence interval [CI]) and treatment-by-subgroup interaction p-values were calculated by Cox proportional hazards model.RESULTS: Ramucirumab treatment prolonged survival for the CEA </=10 subgroup (HR = 0.68; 95% CI = 0.50-0.92; P = 0.013) and CEA >10 subgroup (HR = 0.90; 95% CI = 0.76-1.07; P = 0.233).However, the ramucirumab OS benefit over placebo was greater for the CEA </=10 subgroup than for the CEA >10 subgroup (median OS: 3.6 versus 0.8 months greater, respectively).The interaction P-value between CEA level and treatment effect on OS was 0.088.This trend was observed across randomisation strata and to a lesser extent for PFS (P = 0.594).CONCLUSIONS: Although patients in both high- and low-CEA subgroups derive OS and PFS benefits from ramucirumab treatment, the low baseline CEA level may identify a subgroup of patients with mCRC who obtain greater benefit from ramucirumab.",1,1,1,1
25057173,"EGFR biomarkers predict benefit from vandetanib in combination with docetaxel in a randomized phase III study of second-line treatment of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.BACKGROUND: ZODIAC was a randomized phase III study of second-line treatment in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that evaluated the addition of vandetanib to docetaxel.The study showed a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival and objective response rate, but not in overall survival for unselected patients.This study evaluated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutation, copy number gain, and protein expression, and KRAS gene mutation, in pretreatment tumor samples as potential biomarkers predicting benefit from vandetanib as second-line treatment of NSCLC.PATIENTS AND METHODS: After progression following first-line chemotherapy, 1391 patients with locally advanced or metastatic (stage IIIB/IV) NSCLC were randomized 1 : 1 to receive vandetanib (100 mg/day) plus docetaxel (75 mg/m(2) every 21 days) or placebo plus docetaxel in the ZODIAC study.Archival tumor samples (n = 570) were collected from consenting patients (n = 958) for predefined, prospective biomarker analyses.RESULTS: Of evaluable samples, 14% were EGFR mutation positive, 35% were EGFR FISH positive, 88% were EGFR protein expression positive, and 13% were KRAS mutation positive.Compared with the overall study population, in which progression-free survival (PFS) [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.79] but not OS (HR = 0.91) were significantly improved with vandetanib, there was greater relative clinical benefit for patients with EGFR mutation-positive tumors [PFS HR 0.51, confidence interval (CI) 0.25-1.06 and OS HR 0.46, CI 0.14-1.57] and EGFR FISH-positive tumors (PFS HR 0.61, CI 0.39-0.94 and OS HR 0.48, CI 0.28-0.84).Similarly, patients with EGFR mutation or FISH-positive tumor samples who received vandetanib had an increased chance of objective tumor response (odds ratios 3.34, CI 0.8-13.89, and 3.90, CI 1.02-14.82, respectively).There did not appear to be benefit for vandetanib in patients with KRAS mutation-positive tumors.CONCLUSIONS: High EGFR gene copy number or activating EGFR mutations may identify patient subgroups who receive increased clinical benefit from vandetanib in combination with docetaxel in second-line NSCLC.CLINICALTRIALSGOV: NCT00312377.",1,1,1,1

27504605,"Inflammatory biomarkers, aspirin, and risk of colorectal cancer: Findings from the physicians' health study.BACKGROUND: Chronic inflammation has been implicated in colorectal carcinogenesis.However, the associations between plasma inflammatory markers and risk of colorectal cancer have been inconsistent.METHODS: In a nested case-control study in the Physicians' Health Study, we prospectively investigated the associations of plasma C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR-2) with risk of colorectal cancer, and whether aspirin modified these associations among 268 colorectal cancer patients and 446 age- and smoking-matched controls.RESULTS: In multivariate-adjusted models, plasma levels of CRP, IL-6 and TNFR-2 were not significantly associated with risk of colorectal cancer, although a positive trend was observed for TNFR-2 (RRhighestvs.lowestquartile=1.55; 95% CI=0.95-2.54; Ptrend=0.05).We observed a statistically significant association between elevated TNFR-2 levels and colorectal cancer risk in the placebo arm (RRhighestvs.lowesttertile=1.77; 95% CI=1.02-3.06; Ptrend=0.02), but not in the aspirin arm (Ptrend=0.72).However, the interaction between TNFR-2 and aspirin was not statistically significant (Pinteraction=0.34).CONCLUSION: Plasma inflammatory markers were not significantly associated with colorectal cancer risk among men, though there was a statistically non-significant positive trend between TNFR-2 and colorectal cancer risk.More studies are required to understand the relationship between the role of TNFalpha pathway, aspirin, and colorectal cancer risk.",0,0,0,0

24447190,"Trait and state disgust: an experimental investigation of disgust and avoidance in colorectal cancer decision scenarios.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether trait and experimentally manipulated state disgust independently and/or interactively predict immediate and anticipated avoidance in decision scenarios related to colorectal cancer (CRC).METHOD: Eighty participants, aged 18 to 66 years, completed questionnaires assessing trait disgust prior to a laboratory session.Participants were gender block randomized to disgust or control conditions before completing tasks assessing immediate avoidance of a CRC disgust elicitor (stoma bag) and anticipated avoidance in hypothetical CRC scenarios.RESULTS: Manipulation checks confirmed the elicitation of disgust in the experimental condition.Persons in the experimental condition were more likely to exhibit immediate avoidance behaviors in response to a commonly used bowel disease device (stoma bag), and trait disgust predicted time to touch the device.Trait disgust also moderated the influence of state disgust on anticipated avoidance, namely delay in help seeking for bowel symptoms and predicted rating disgusting side effects as more deterring to adherence.CONCLUSIONS: The current report suggests the importance of examining disgust in CRC contexts and provides the first empirical demonstration that state and trait aspects of disgust may interactively operate to deter certain types of decisions.It thus furthers understanding of emotions and avoidance in a health context that has had surprisingly little focus to date.",0,0,0,0

22795435,"American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z4099/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 1021: a randomized study of sublobar resection compared with stereotactic body radiotherapy for high-risk stage I non-small cell lung cancer.During the past decade, tremendous interest has arisen in the use of nonoperative therapies for patients with non-small cell lung cancer.Of these therapies, stereotactic body radiotherapy has become established as an effective modality for treating peripheral cancer in medically inoperable patients.Toxicity is low, and the treatment is effective, with excellent local control rates.Several investigators have suggested that stereotactic body radiotherapy could be effective for high-risk operable patients (usually treated with sublobar resection) and even perhaps for standard-risk operable patients (usually treated with lobectomy); however, this is less accepted.A direct comparison of stereotactic body radiotherapy and sublobar resection is difficult for a number of reasons.These include different definitions of recurrence, different populations of patients in these studies (with those undergoing stereotactic body radiotherapy tending to be the medically inoperable group), and different methods of classifying morbidity in the surgical and radiation oncology studies.Imaging follow-up has also not been standardized among the studies.Thus, a randomized study is necessary and timely.Investigators from the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group and the Radiation Therapy and Oncology Group have collaborated to develop a phase III randomized study comparing stereotactic body radiotherapy and sublobar resection (with or without brachytherapy) for high-risk operable patients with non-small cell lung cancer.This study (American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z4099/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 1021) has recently opened for accrual.It is hoped that this will help to better define the role of these therapies for patients with non-small cell lung cancer.",0,0,0,0

26364885,"The influence of gastric filling instructions on dose delivery in patients with oesophageal cancer: A prospective study.PURPOSE: To evaluate whether adaptive radiotherapy for unaccounted stomach changes in patients with adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) is necessary and whether dose differences could be prevented by giving patients food and fluid instructions before treatment simulation and radiotherapy.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty patients were randomly assigned into two groups: patients with and without instructions about restricting food and fluid intake prior to radiotherapy simulation and treatment.Redelineation and offline recalculation of dose distributions based on cone-beam computed tomography (n=100) were performed.Dose-volume parameters were analysed for the clinical target volume extending into the stomach.RESULTS: Four patients who did not receive instructions had a geometric miss (0.7-12 cm(3)) in only one fraction.With instructions, 3 out of 10 patients had a geometric miss (0.1-1.9 cm(3)) in one (n=2) or two (n=1) fractions.The V95% was reduced by more than 5% for one patient, but this underdosage was in an in-air region without further clinical importance.CONCLUSIONS: Giving patients food and fluid instructions for the treatment of GEJ cancer offers no clinical benefit.Using a planning target volume margin of 1cm implies that there is no need for adaptive radiotherapy for GEJ tumours.",0,0,0,0
27634489,"Hughes Abdominal Repair Trial (HART) - Abdominal wall closure techniques to reduce the incidence of incisional hernias: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Incisional hernias are common complications of midline closure following abdominal surgery and cause significant morbidity, impaired quality of life and increased health care costs.The 'Hughes Repair' combines a standard mass closure with a series of horizontal and two vertical mattress sutures within a single suture.This theoretically distributes the load along the incision length as well as across it.There is evidence to suggest that this technique is as effective as mesh repair for the operative management of incisional hernias; however, no trials have compared the Hughes Repair with standard mass closure for the prevention of incisional hernia formation following a midline incision.METHODS/DESIGN: This is a 1:1 randomised controlled trial comparing two suture techniques for the closure of the midline abdominal wound following surgery for colorectal cancer.Full ethical approval has been gained (Wales REC 3, MREC 12/WA/0374).Eight hundred patients will be randomised from approximately 20 general surgical units within the United Kingdom.Patients undergoing open or laparoscopic (more than a 5-cm midline incision) surgery for colorectal cancer, elective or emergency, are eligible.Patients under the age of 18 years, those having mesh inserted or undergoing musculofascial flap closure of the perineal defect in abdominoperineal wound closure, and those unable to give informed consent will be excluded.Patients will be randomised intraoperatively to either the Hughes Repair or standard mass closure.The primary outcome measure is the incidence of incisional hernias at 1 year as assessed by standardised clinical examination.The secondary outcomes include quality of life patient-reported outcome measures, cost-utility analysis, incidence of complete abdominal wound dehiscence and C-POSSUM scores.The incidence of incisional hernia at 1 year, assessed by computerised tomography, will form a tertiary outcome.DISCUSSION: A feasibility phase has been completed.The results of the study will be used to inform current and future practice and potentially reduce the risk of incisional hernia formation following midline incisions.TRIAL REGISTRATION: TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN 25616490 .Registered on 1 January 2012.",0,0,0,0
23136318,"Association of speculum lubrication with pain and Papanicolaou test accuracy.PURPOSE: To determine the effects of lubrication of the vaginal speculum before insertion during a Papanicolaou test on perceived pain and quality of the cytology specimen.METHODS: Four hundred eligible women participating in cervical cancer screening and an early detection program were randomized with respect to lubricant gel use before speculum insertion.Perceived pain during speculum insertion and cytology results were assessed in study groups.RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 45.7 years (range, 23-77 years).Pain score of the NO GEL group was significantly higher than that of the GEL group (2.3 and 1.6, respectively; P < .05).For premenopausal women, lubricant gel use significantly reduced the pain scores of the participants (P < .05).Cytological interpretations of the Papanicolaou test specimens were comparable among all groups.CONCLUSIONS: During the collection of Papanicolaou test specimens, lubrication of the vaginal speculum with a small amount of K-Y Jelly (a water-soluble lubricant gel) decreases the pain associated with insertion of the vaginal speculum among postmenopausal women without obscuring the cytological interpretation of conventional or liquid-based cytology.In women of reproductive age, lubrication of the speculum with K-Y Jelly does not cause a meaningful effect with respect to perceived pain.",0,0,0,0
27383814,"Effect of Triclosan-Coated Suture and Antibiotic Prophylaxis on Infection and Recurrence after Karydakis Flap Repair for Pilonidal Disease: A Randomized Parallel-Arm Double-Blinded Clinical Trial.BACKGROUND: Pilonidal sinus disease was first described by Mayo in 1833 as ""a cyst that contains hair."" Although surgical treatment of the lesions can have successful outcomes, it also can be associated with relatively high rates of post-operative infectioins and recurrence.Many studies have demonstrated that triclosan-coated sutures (TCS) decrease surgical site infections.OBJECTIVE: The goal of this randomized parallel-arm double-blind clinical trial was to investigate the ability of antibiotic prophylaxis, and secondarily of antibiotic-coated sutures, to prevent post-operative infections in the surgical management of pilonidal sinus disease.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The initial trial protocol aimed to compare early infections in patients who did and did not undergo antibiotic prophylaxis (AP(+) vs. AP(-)).A secondary goal was to compare the effects of TCS and conventional sutures (CS) on early infectious complication rates in the two groups.The AP(-) arm had to be terminated prematurely because of an unacceptably high rate of infectious complications.RESULTS: A total of 80 micro-organisms were recovered from 74 patients (69.8%).Methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most common isolates (30%).The most frequently detected anaerobic micro-organism was Actinomyces israelii (7.5%).The TCS and CS groups had similar rates of micro-organism growth (65.8% vs. 75.0%).There was no significant difference in the occurrence of wound dehiscence.Over the six-month follow-up, there were two recurrences, both in the TCS group.The difference was not significant.CONCLUSIONS: We believe that antibiotic prophylaxis is necessary in patients scheduled for Karydakis flap repair.In our study, TCS tended to be associated with a lower rate of infection, but this trend did not achieve statistical significance.Anaerobic micro-organisms dominated the infective isolates.",0,0,0,0

23146280,"The prognostic and predictive value of mRNA expression of vascular endothelial growth factor family members in breast cancer: a study in primary tumors of high-risk early breast cancer patients participating in a randomized Hellenic Cooperative Oncology Group trial.INTRODUCTION: The main prognostic variables in early breast cancer are tumor size, histological grade, estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor (ER/PgR) status, number of positive nodes and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status.The present study evaluated the prognostic and/or predictive value of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family members in high-risk early breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant chemo-hormonotherapy.METHODS: RNA was isolated from 308 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded primary tumor samples from breast cancer patients enrolled in the HE10/97 trial, evaluating adjuvant dose-dense sequential chemotherapy with epirubicin followed by cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil (CMF) with or without paclitaxel (E-T-CMF versus E-CMF).A fully automated method based on magnetic beads was applied for RNA extraction, followed by one-step quantitative RT-PCR for mRNA analysis of VEGF-A, -B, -C and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) 1, 2, 3.RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 8 years, 109 patients (35%) developed a relapse and 80 patients (26%) died.In high VEGF-C and VEGFR1 mRNA expressing tumors, ER/PgR-negative tumors (Fisher's exact test, P = 0.001 and P = 0.021, respectively) and HER2-positive tumors (P <0.001 and P = 0.028, respectively) were more frequent than in low VEGF-C and VEGFR1 expressing tumors, respectively.From the VEGF family members evaluated, high VEGFR1 mRNA expression (above the 75th percentile) emerged as a significant negative prognostic factor for overall survival (OS; hazard ratio (HR) = 1.60, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01 to 2.55, Wald's P = 0.047) and disease-free survival (DFS; HR = 1.67, 95% CI: 1.13 to 2.48, P = 0.010), when adjusting for treatment group.High VEGF-C mRNA expression was predictive for benefit from adjuvant treatment with paclitaxel (E-T-CMF arm) for OS (test for interaction, Wald's P = 0.038), while in multivariate analysis the interaction of VEGF-C with taxane treatment was significant for both OS (Wald's P = 0.019) and DFS (P = 0.041) and continuous VEGF-B mRNA expression values for OS (P = 0.019).CONCLUSIONS: The present study reports, for the first time, that VEGF-C mRNA overexpression, as assessed by qRT-PCR, has a strong predictive value in high-risk early breast cancer patients undergoing adjuvant paclitaxel-containing treatment.Further studies are warranted to validate the prognostic and/or predictive value of VEGF-B, VEGF-C and VEGFR1 in patients treated with adjuvant therapies and to reveal which members of the VEGF family could possibly be useful markers in identifying patients who will benefit most from anti-VEGF strategies.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR) ACTRN12611000506998.",0,0,0,0

24081946,"Randomized multicenter phase II trial comparing two schedules of etirinotecan pegol (NKTR-102) in women with recurrent platinum-resistant/refractory epithelial ovarian cancer.PURPOSE: Etirinotecan pegol (NKTR-102) is a unique, long-acting topoisomerase-I inhibitor with prolonged systemic exposure to SN38 (7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin), the active metabolite of irinotecan.This randomized phase II trial investigated two dosing schedules of etirinotecan pegol in patients with platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian carcinoma.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 71 eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive etirinotecan pegol 145 mg/m(2) every 14 or 21 days until progression or unacceptable adverse events (AEs).The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR) by RECIST (version 1.0).Secondary end points included response by Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup criteria, duration of ORR, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).RESULTS: The overall confirmed ORR was 20% (95% CI, 10% to 30%): 20% for once every 14 days, and 19% for once every 21 days.Median response duration was 4.1 months for once every 14 days and 4.0 months for once every 21 days.Median PFS for every 14 and every 21 days was 4.1 and 5.3 months, respectively, and median OS was 10.0 and 11.7 months, respectively.Etirinotecan pegol was well tolerated, with the most common grade 3 to 4 AEs being dehydration (24%) and diarrhea (23%).Diarrhea, dehydration, nausea, and neutropenia were less frequent with the schedule of once every 21 days than with that of once every 14 days.CONCLUSION: Both schedules of etirinotecan pegol showed activity in patients with heavily pretreated ovarian cancer, with encouraging ORR and PFS rates.The schedule of once every 21 days was better tolerated and had slightly longer PFS and OS rates.The treatment schedule of etirinotecan pegol 145 mg/m(2) once every 21 days was selected for the expanded phase II study and is preferred for future phase III studies.These findings provide support to directly compare etirinotecan pegol versus one of the approved drugs (eg, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or topotecan) in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.",1,1,1,1
28188670,"A randomized phase II trial of personalized peptide vaccine with low dose cyclophosphamide in biliary tract cancer.Since the prognosis of advanced biliary tract cancer (aBTC) still remains very poor, new therapeutic approaches, including immunotherapies, need to be developed.In the current study, we conducted an open-label randomized phase II study to test whether low dose cyclophosphamide (CPA) could improve antigen-specific immune responses and clinical efficacy of personalized peptide vaccination (PPV) in 49 previously treated aBTC patients.Patients with aBTC refractory to at least one regimen of chemotherapies were randomly assigned to receive PPV with low dose CPA (100 mg/day for 7 days before vaccination) (PPV/CPA, n = 24) or PPV alone (n = 25).A maximum of four HLA-matched peptides were selected based on the pre-existing peptide-specific IgG responses, followed by subcutaneous administration.T cell responses to the vaccinated peptides in the PPV/CPA arm tended to be greater than those in the PPV alone arm.The PPV/CPA arm showed significantly better progression-free survival (median time: 6.1 vs 2.9 months; hazard ratio (HR): 0.427; P = 0.008) and overall survival (median time: 12.1 vs 5.9 months; HR: 0.376; P = 0.004), compared to the PPV alone arm.The PPV alone arm, but not the PPV/CPA arm, showed significant increase in plasma IL-6 after vaccinations, which might be associated with inhibition of antigen-specific T cell responses.These results suggested that combined treatment with low dose CPA could provide clinical benefits in aBTC patients under PPV, possibly through prevention of IL-6-mediated immune suppression.Further clinical studies would be recommended to clarify the clinical efficacy of PPV/CPA in aBTC patients.",1,1,1,1

23234763,"Adjuvant lapatinib for women with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer: a randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Worldwide, many patients with HER2-positive early stage breast cancer do not receive trastuzumab-the standard adjuvant treatment.We investigated the efficacy and safety of adjuvant lapatinib for patients with trastuzumab-naive HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer, started at any time after diagnosis.METHODS: This study was a placebo-controlled, multicentre, randomised phase 3 trial.Women outpatients from 405 [corrected] centres in 33 countries [corrected] with HER2-positive early-breast cancer who had previously received adjuvant chemotherapy but not trastuzumab were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive daily lapatinib (1500 mg) or daily placebo for 12 months.Randomisation was done with a computer-generated sequence, stratified by time since diagnosis, lymph node involvement at diagnosis, and tumour hormone-receptor status.Investigators, site staff, and patients were masked to treatment assignment.The primary endpoint was disease-free survival in the intention-to-treat population.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00374322.FINDINGS: Between August, 2006, and May, 2008, 3161 women were enrolled and 3147 were assigned to lapatinib (n=1571) or placebo (n=1576).After a median follow-up of 47.4 months (range 0.4-60.0) in the lapatinib group and 48.3 (0.7-61.3) in the placebo group, 210 (13%) disease-free survival events had occurred in the lapatinib group versus 264 (17%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.83, 95% CI 0.70-1.00; p=0.053).Central review of HER2 status showed that only 2490 (79%) of the randomised women were HER2-positive.157 (13%) of 1230 confirmed HER2-positive patients in the lapatinib group and in 208 (17%) of 1260 in the placebo group had a disease-free survival event (HR 0.82, 95% 0.67-1.00; p=0.04).Serious adverse events occurred in 99 (6%) of 1573 patients taking lapatinib and 77 (5%) of 1574 patients taking placebo, with higher incidences of grade 3-4 diarrhoea (97 [6%] vs nine [<1%]), rash (72 [5%] vs three [<1%]), and hepatobiliary disorders (36 [2%] vs one [<1%]).INTERPRETATION: Our data show that there was no significant difference in disease-free survival between groups when analysed in the intention-to-treat population.However, exploratory analyses restricted to patients who had HER2-positive disease confirmed by central fluorescence in-situ hybridisation review suggested marginal benefit with lapatinib in terms of disease-free survival.Thus lapatinib might be an option for women with HER2-positive breast cancer who do not or cannot receive adjuvant trastuzumab.FUNDING: GlaxoSmithKline.",1,1,1,1
27339115,"Conventional versus hypofractionated high-dose intensity-modulated radiotherapy for prostate cancer: 5-year outcomes of the randomised, non-inferiority, phase 3 CHHiP trial.BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer might have high radiation-fraction sensitivity that would give a therapeutic advantage to hypofractionated treatment.We present a pre-planned analysis of the efficacy and side-effects of a randomised trial comparing conventional and hypofractionated radiotherapy after 5 years follow-up.METHODS: CHHiP is a randomised, phase 3, non-inferiority trial that recruited men with localised prostate cancer (pT1b-T3aN0M0).Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to conventional (74 Gy delivered in 37 fractions over 7.4 weeks) or one of two hypofractionated schedules (60 Gy in 20 fractions over 4 weeks or 57 Gy in 19 fractions over 3.8 weeks)all delivered with intensity-modulated techniques.Most patients were given radiotherapy with 3-6 months of neoadjuvant and concurrent androgen suppression.Randomisation was by computer-generated random permuted blocks, stratified by National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk group and radiotherapy treatment centre, and treatment allocation was not masked.The primary endpoint was time to biochemical or clinical failure; the critical hazard ratio (HR) for non-inferiority was 1.208.Analysis was by intention to treat.Long-term follow-up continues.The CHHiP trial is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN97182923.FINDINGS: Between Oct 18, 2002, and June 17, 2011, 3216 men were enrolled from 71 centres and randomly assigned (74 Gy group, 1065 patients; 60 Gy group, 1074 patients; 57 Gy group, 1077 patients).Median follow-up was 62.4 months (IQR 53.9-77.0).The proportion of patients who were biochemical or clinical failure free at 5 years was 88.3% (95% CI 86.0-90.2) in the 74 Gy group, 90.6% (88.5-92.3) in the 60 Gy group, and 85.9% (83.4-88.0) in the 57 Gy group.60 Gy was non-inferior to 74 Gy (HR 0.84 [90% CI 0.68-1.03], pNI=0.0018) but non-inferiority could not be claimed for 57 Gy compared with 74 Gy (HR 1.20 [0.99-1.46], pNI=0.48).Long-term side-effects were similar in the hypofractionated groups compared with the conventional group.There were no significant differences in either the proportion or cumulative incidence of side-effects 5 years after treatment using three clinician-reported as well as patient-reported outcome measures.The estimated cumulative 5 year incidence of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) grade 2 or worse bowel and bladder adverse events was 13.7% (111 events) and 9.1% (66 events) in the 74 Gy group, 11.9% (105 events) and 11.7% (88 events) in the 60 Gy group, 11.3% (95 events) and 6.6% (57 events) in the 57 Gy group, respectively.No treatment-related deaths were reported.INTERPRETATION: Hypofractionated radiotherapy using 60 Gy in 20 fractions is non-inferior to conventional fractionation using 74 Gy in 37 fractions and is recommended as a new standard of care for external-beam radiotherapy of localised prostate cancer.FUNDING: Cancer Research UK, Department of Health, and the National Institute for Health Research Cancer Research Network.",1,1,1,1
23918953,"Randomized controlled trial of Mindfulness-based cancer recovery versus supportive expressive group therapy for distressed survivors of breast cancer.PURPOSE: To compare the efficacy of the following two empirically supported group interventions to help distressed survivors of breast cancer cope: mindfulness-based cancer recovery (MBCR) and supportive-expressive group therapy (SET).PATIENTS AND METHODS: This multisite, randomized controlled trial assigned 271 distressed survivors of stage I to III breast cancer to MBCR, SET, or a 1-day stress management control condition.MBCR focused on training in mindfulness meditation and gentle yoga, whereas SET focused on emotional expression and group support.Both intervention groups included 18 hours of professional contact.Measures were collected at baseline and after intervention by assessors blind to study condition.Primary outcome measures were mood and diurnal salivary cortisol slopes.Secondary outcomes were stress symptoms, quality of life, and social support.RESULTS: Using linear mixed-effects models, in intent-to-treat analyses, cortisol slopes were maintained over time in both SET (P = .002) and MBCR (P = .011) groups relative to the control group, whose cortisol slopes became flatter.Women in MBCR improved more over time on stress symptoms compared with women in both the SET (P = .009) and control (P = .024) groups.Per-protocol analyses showed greater improvements in the MBCR group in quality of life compared with the control group (P = .005) and in social support compared with the SET group (P = .012).CONCLUSION: In the largest trial to date, MBCR was superior for improving stress levels, quality of life and social support [CORRECTED] for distressed survivors of breast cancer.Both SET and MBCR also resulted in more normative diurnal cortisol profiles than the control condition.The clinical implications of this finding require further investigation.",0,0,0,0
27589688,"Primary analysis of a prospective, randomized, single-blinded phase II trial evaluating the HER2 peptide GP2 vaccine in breast cancer patients to prevent recurrence.GP2 is a HER2-derived, HLA-A2+ restricted peptide.Phase I studies showed GP2 administered with GM-CSF to be safe and immunogenic.Here we report the primary analysis of a prospective, randomized, multicenter phase II adjuvant trial conducted to determine the vaccine's efficacy.The trial enrolled HLA-A2+, clinically disease-free, node-positive and high-risk node-negative breast cancer patients with tumors expressing HER2 (immunohistochemistry[IHC] 1+-3+).Patients were randomized to GP2+GM-CSF versus GM-CSF alone.Disease-free survival (DFS) was analyzed in intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-treatment cohorts; pre-specified subgroup analyses were performed for patients with IHC 3+ or FISH+ disease.The trial enrolled 180 patients; 89 received GP2+GM-CSF and 91 received GM-CSF alone.The groups were well-matched for clinicopathologic characteristics.Toxicities have been minimal.The Kaplan-Meier estimated 5-year DFS rate in the ITT analyses was 88% (95% CI:78-94%) in vaccinated vs. 81% (95% CI:69-89%) (P = 0.43) in control patients after a 34 month median follow-up.In the per-treatment analysis, the estimated 5-year DFS rates were 94% (95% CI:83-98%) and 85% (73-92%) (P = 0.17).In IHC 3+/FISH+ patients, the estimated 5-year DFS rate was 94% (82-98%) in vaccinated patients (n = 51) vs. 89% (71-96%) in control patients (n = 50), (P = 0.86) in the ITT analyses and 100% vs. 89% (71-96%) in vaccinated vs. control patients in the per-treatment analyses (P = 0.08).While the overall ITT analysis did not demonstrate benefit to vaccination, this trial confirmed that the GP2 vaccine is safe and suggests that vaccination may have clinical activity, particularly in patients with HER2 overexpression who received the full vaccine series (ie per-treatment group).",1,1,1,1
23871490,"2 years versus 1 year of adjuvant trastuzumab for HER2-positive breast cancer (HERA): an open-label, randomised controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Trastuzumab has established efficacy against breast cancer with overexpression or amplification of the HER2 oncogene.The standard of care is 1 year of adjuvant trastuzumab, but the optimum duration of treatment is unknown.We compared 2 years of treatment with trastuzumab with 1 year of treatment, and updated the comparison of 1 year of trastuzumab versus observation at a median follow-up of 8 years, for patients enrolled in the HERceptin Adjuvant (HERA) trial.METHODS: The HERA trial is an international, multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial comparing treatment with trastuzumab for 1 and 2 years with observation after standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy, adjuvant chemotherapy, or both in 5102 patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer.The primary endpoint was disease-free survival.The comparison of 2 years versus 1 year of trastuzumab treatment involved a landmark analysis of 3105 patients who were disease-free 12 months after randomisation to one of the trastuzumab groups, and was planned after observing at least 725 disease-free survival events.The updated intention-to-treat comparison of 1 year trastuzumab treatment versus observation alone in 3399 patients at a median follow-up of 8 years (range 0-10) is also reported.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00045032.FINDINGS: We recorded 367 events of disease-free survival in 1552 patients in the 1 year group and 367 events in 1553 patients in the 2 year group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.99, 95% CI 0.85-1.14, p=0.86).Grade 3-4 adverse events and decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction during treatment were reported more frequently in the 2 year treatment group than in the 1 year group (342 [20.4%] vs 275 [16.3%] grade 3-4 adverse events, and 120 [7.2%] vs 69 [4.1%] decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction, respectively).HRs for a comparison of 1 year of trastuzumab treatment versus observation were 0.76 (95% CI 0.67-0.86, p<0.0001) for disease-free survival and 0.76 (0.65-0.88, p=0.0005) for overall survival, despite crossover of 884 (52%) patients from the observation group to trastuzumab therapy.INTERPRETATION: 2 years of adjuvant trastuzumab is not more effective than is 1 year of treatment for patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer.1 year of treatment provides a significant disease-free and overall survival benefit compared with observation and remains the standard of care.FUNDING: F Hoffmann-La Roche (Roche).",1,1,1,1
24150234,"Abiraterone acetate in combination with prednisone for the treatment of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: U.S. Food and Drug Administration drug approval summary.On December 10, 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted full approval for a modified indication for abiraterone acetate (Zytiga tablets; Janssen Biotech, Inc.) in combination with prednisone for the treatment of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).The approval was based on clinical trial COU-AA-302, which randomly allocated asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients with chemotherapy-naive mCRPC and no visceral metastases to either abiraterone acetate plus prednisone (N = 546) or placebo plus prednisone (N = 542).The coprimary endpoints were radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) and overall survival (OS).The median rPFS was 8.3 months in the placebo arm and had not yet been reached in the abiraterone acetate arm {HR, 0.43 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.35-0.52]; P < 0.0001}. A prespecified interim analysis demonstrated an improvement in OS favoring the abiraterone acetate arm [HR, 0.79 (95% CI, 0.66-0.96)] but did not cross the O'Brien-Fleming boundary for statistical significance.Safety data confirmed the known adverse reaction profile of abiraterone acetate.Full approval was granted on the basis of a large magnitude of effect on rPFS, a favorable trend in OS, and internal consistency across multiple secondary endpoints and exploratory patient-reported pain data.This is the first drug approval for mCRPC to use rPFS as the primary endpoint.Importantly, this approval was granted in the context of a prior statistically significant OS benefit that formed the basis of the original April 28, 2011, approval of abiraterone acetate for patients with mCRPC who had received prior chemotherapy containing docetaxel.",0,0,0,0

22086774,"[Stem cell-induced liver regeneration].BACKGROUND: The liver has an excellent regenerative capacity after resection.However, below a critical level of future liver remnant volume (FLRV), partial hepatectomy is accompanied by a significant increase of postoperative liver failure.There is accumulating evidence for the contribution of bone marrow stem cells (BMSC) to participate in liver regeneration.Here we report our experience with portal vein embolisation (PVE) and CD133+ BMSC administration to the liver, compared with PVE alone, to augment hepatic regeneration in patients with critically low FLRV or impaired liver function.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eleven patients underwent PVE of liver segments I and IV-VIII to stimulate hepatic regeneration prior to extended right hepatectomy.In these 11 patients with a FLRV below 25% and/or limited quality of hepatic parenchyma, PVE alone did not promise adequate proliferation.These patients underwent additional BMSC administration to segments II and III.Two radiologists blinded to patients' identity and each other's results measured liver and tumour volumes with helical computed tomography.Absolute, relative and daily FLRV gains were compared with a group of patients that underwent PVE alone.RESULTS: The increase of the mean absolute FLRV after PVE with BMSC application from 239.3 mL+/-103.5 (standard deviation) to 417.1 mL+/-150.4 was significantly higher than that from 286.3 mL+/-77.1 to 395.9 mL+/-94.1 after PVE alone (p<0.05).Also the relative gain of FLRV in this group (77.3%+/-38.2%) was significantly higher than that after PVE alone (39.1%+/-20.4%) (P=0.039).In addition, the daily hepatic growth rate after PVE and BMSC application (9.5+/-4.3 mL/d) was significantly superior to that after PVE alone (4.1+/-1.9 mL/d) (p=0.03).Time to surgery was 27 days+/-11 in this group and 45 days+/-21 after PVE alone (p=0.02).Short- and long-term survival were not negatively influenced by the shorter waiting period.CONCLUSION: In patients with malignant liver lesions, the combination of PVE with CD133+ BMSC administration substantially increased hepatic regeneration compared with PVE alone.This procedure bears the potential to allow the safe resection of patients with a curative intention that would otherwise carry the risk post-operative liver failure.",0,0,0,0

27498129,"Toxicity of dual HER2-blockade with pertuzumab added to anthracycline versus non-anthracycline containing chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment in HER2-positive breast cancer: The TRAIN-2 study.BACKGROUND: The addition of pertuzumab to neoadjuvant trastuzumab-based chemotherapy improves pathologic complete response rates in HER2-positive breast cancer.However, increased toxicity has been reported with the addition of pertuzumab, and this may differ between various chemotherapy backbone regimens.We evaluated toxicities of pertuzumab when added to either FEC-T (5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide, trastuzumab) or weekly paclitaxel, trastuzumab, carboplatin (PTC).METHODS: The TRAIN-2 study is a neoadjuvant randomized controlled trial in stage II and III HER2-positive breast cancer (NCT01996267).Patients are randomly assigned to receive either three cycles of FEC-T plus pertuzumab or three cycles of PTC plus pertuzumab, followed by six cycles of PTC plus pertuzumab in both arms.Toxicities are described per treatment arm according to the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03.RESULTS: This analysis includes 110 patients balanced over both treatment arms.Neutropenia was the most common hematologic toxicity, with grade 3-4 occurring in 53% in the FEC-T-arm and in 51% in the PTC-arm.Febrile neutropenia occurred in 9% in the FEC-T arm and did not occur in the PTC-arm.Secondary G-CSF prophylaxis was used in 35-40% of patients.Asymptomatic ejection fraction decrease grade 2 was observed in 24% in the FEC-T-arm and 11% in the PTC-arm.The most common grade 3-4 non-hematologic toxicity was diarrhea (5% in the FEC-T-arm and 18% in the PTC-arm).CONCLUSIONS: Pertuzumab in combination with FEC-T mostly causes neutropenia, and when added to PTC mostly causes diarrhea.Significant cardiac toxicity is rare with both regimens, and toxicity is overall well manageable.",1,1,1,1
25605841,"Anxiety and health-related quality of life among patients with low-tumor burden non-Hodgkin lymphoma randomly assigned to two different rituximab dosing regimens: results from ECOG trial E4402 (RESORT).PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare illness-related anxiety among participants in the Rituximab Extended Schedule or Retreatment Trial (RESORT) randomly assigned to maintenance rituximab (MR) versus rituximab re-treatment (RR).A secondary objective was to examine whether the superiority of MR versus RR on anxiety depended on illness-related coping style.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients (N = 253) completed patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures at random assignment to MR or RR (baseline); at 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 months after random assignment; and at rituximab failure.PRO measures assessed illness-related anxiety and coping style, and secondary end points including general anxiety, worry and interference with emotional well-being, depression, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL).Patients were classified as using an active or avoidant illness-related coping style.Independent sample t tests and linear mixed-effects models were used to identify treatment arm differences on PRO end points and differences based on coping style.RESULTS: Illness-related anxiety was comparable between treatment arms at all time points (P > .05), regardless of coping style (active or avoidant).Illness-related anxiety and general anxiety significantly decreased over time on both arms.HRQoL scores were relatively stable and did not change significantly from baseline for both arms.An avoidant coping style was associated with significantly higher anxiety (18% and 13% exceeded clinical cutoff points at baseline and 6 months, respectively) and poorer HRQoL compared with an active coping style (P < .001), regardless of treatment arm assignment.CONCLUSION: Surveillance until RR at progression was not associated with increased anxiety compared with MR, regardless of coping style.Avoidant coping was associated with higher anxiety and poorer HRQoL.",0,0,0,0
23497452,"A randomized trial to assess the biological activity of short-term (pre-surgical) fulvestrant 500 mg plus anastrozole versus fulvestrant 500 mg alone or anastrozole alone on primary breast cancer.INTRODUCTION: Fulvestrant shows dose-dependent biological activity.Greater estrogen-receptor (ER) blockade may feasibly be achieved by combining fulvestrant with anastrozole.This pre-surgical study compared fulvestrant plus anastrozole versus either agent alone in patients with ER-positive breast cancer.METHODS: In this double-blind, multicenter trial, 121 patients received fulvestrant 500 mg on Day 1 plus anastrozole 1 mg/day for 14 to 21 days (F + A); fulvestrant plus anastrozole placebo (F); or fulvestrant placebo plus anastrozole (A), 2 to 3 weeks before surgery.ER, progesterone-receptor (PgR) and Ki67 expression were determined from tumor biopsies before treatment and at surgery.RESULTS: A total of 103 paired samples were available (F, n = 35; F+A, n = 31; A, n = 37).All treatments significantly reduced mean ER expression from baseline (F: -41%, P = 0.0001; F + A: -39%, P = 0.0001; A: -13%, P = 0.0034).F and F + A led to greater reductions in ER versus A (both P = 0.0001); F + A did not lead to additional reductions versus F. PgR and Ki67 expression were significantly reduced with all treatments (means were -34% to -45%, and -75% to -85%, respectively; all P = 0.0001), with no differences between groups.CONCLUSIONS: In this short-term study, all treatments reduced ER expression, although F and F + A showed greater reductions than A. No significant differences were detected between the treatment groups in terms of PgR and Ki67 expression.No additional reduction in tumor biomarkers with combination treatment was observed, suggesting that F + A is unlikely to have further clinical benefit over F alone.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00259090.",1,1,1,1

28049139,"A randomized phase 2 study of MK-2206 versus everolimus in refractory renal cell carcinoma.Background: Activation of the phosphoinisitide-3 kinase (PI3K) pathway through mutation and constitutive upregulation has been described in renal cell carcinoma (RCC), making it an attractive target for therapeutic intervention.We performed a randomized phase II study in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy refractory patients to determine whether MK-2206, an allosteric inhibitor of AKT, was more efficacious than the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor everolimus.Patients and methods: A total of 43 patients were randomized in a 2:1 distribution, with 29 patients assigned to the MK-2206 arm and 14 to the everolimus arm.Progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary endpoint.Results: The trial was closed at the first futility analysis with an observed PFS of 3.68 months in the MK-2206 arm and 5.98 months in the everolimus arm.Dichotomous response rate profiles were seen in the MK-2206 arm with one complete response and three partial responses in the MK-2206 arm versus none in the everolimus arm.On the other hand, progressive disease was best response in 44.8% of MK2206 versus 14.3% of everolimus-treated patients.MK-2206 induced significantly more rash and pruritis than everolimus, and dose reduction occurred in 37.9% of MK-2206 versus 21.4% of everolimus-treated patients.Genomic analysis revealed that 57.1% of the patients in the PD group had either deleterious TP53 mutations or ATM mutations or deletions.In contrast, none of the patients in the non-PD group had TP53 or ATM defects.No predictive marker for response was observed in this small dataset.Conclusions: Dichotomous outcomes are observed when VEGF therapy refractory patients are treated with MK-2206, and MK-2206 does not demonstrate superiority to everolimus.Additionally, mutations in DNA repair genes are associated with early disease progression, indicating that dysregulation of DNA repair is associated with a more aggressive tumor phenotype in RCC.",1,1,1,1
22474202,"Effect of oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and leucovorin with or without cetuximab on survival among patients with resected stage III colon cancer: a randomized trial.CONTEXT: Leucovorin, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) is the standard adjuvant therapy for resected stage III colon cancer.Adding cetuximab to FOLFOX benefits patients with metastatic wild-type KRAS but not mutated KRAS colon cancer.OBJECTIVE: To assess the potential benefit of cetuximab added to the modified sixth version of the FOLFOX regimen (mFOLFOX6) in patients with resected stage III wild-type KRAS colon cancer.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A randomized trial of 2686 patients aged 18 years or older at multiple institutions across North America enrolled following resection and informed consent between February 10, 2004, and November 25, 2009.The primary randomized comparison was 12 biweekly cycles of mFOLFOX6 with and without cetuximab.KRAS mutation status was centrally determined.The trial was halted after a planned interim analysis of 48% of predicted events (246/515) occurring in 1863 (of 2070 planned) patients with tumors having wild-type KRAS.A total of 717 patients with mutated KRAS and 106 with indeterminate KRAS were accrued.The 2070 patients with wild-type KRAS provided 90% power to detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.33 (2-sided alpha = .05), with planned interim efficacy analyses after 25%, 50%, and 75% of expected relapses.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Disease-free survival in patients with wild-type KRAS mutations.Secondary end points included overall survival and toxicity.RESULTS: Median (range) follow-up was 28 (0-68) months.The trial demonstrated no benefit when adding cetuximab.Three-year disease-free survival for mFOLFOX6 alone was 74.6% vs 71.5% with the addition of cetuximab (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.98-1.49; P = .08) in patients with wild-type KRAS, and 67.1% vs 65.0% (HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.86-1.46; P = .38) in patients with mutated KRAS, with no significant benefit in any subgroups assessed.Among all patients, grade 3 or higher adverse events (72.5% vs 52.3%; odds ratio [OR], 2.4; 95% CI, 2.1-2.8; P < .001) and failure to complete 12 cycles (33% vs 23%; OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.4-1.9; P < .001) were significantly higher with cetuximab.Increased toxicity and greater detrimental differences in all outcomes were observed in patients aged 70 years or older.CONCLUSION: Among patients with stage III resected colon cancer, the use of cetuximab with adjuvant mFOLFOX6 compared with mFOLFOX6 alone did not result in improved disease-free survival.TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00079274.",1,1,1,1
26324738,"Clinical and Translational Results of a Phase II, Randomized Trial of an Anti-IGF-1R (Cixutumumab) in Women with Breast Cancer That Progressed on Endocrine Therapy.PURPOSE: This phase II trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of cixutumumab, a human anti-insulin-like growth factor receptor 1 (IGF-1R) monoclonal IgG1 antibody, and explored potential biomarkers in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer that progressed on antiestrogen therapy received (2:1 randomization) cixutumumab 10 mg/kg and the same antiestrogen (arm A) or cixutumumab alone (arm B) every 2 weeks (q2w).Primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS); secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS) and safety.Correlative analyses of IGF-1R, total insulin receptor (IR), and IR isoforms A (IR-A) and B (IR-B) expression in tumor tissue were explored.RESULTS: Ninety-three patients were randomized (arm A, n = 62; arm B, n = 31).Median PFS was 2.0 and 3.1 months for arm A and arm B, respectively.Secondary efficacy measures were similar between the arms.Overall, cixutumumab was well tolerated.IGF-1R expression was not associated with clinical outcomes.Regardless of the treatment, lower IR-A, IR-B, and total IR mRNA expression in tumor tissue was significantly associated with longer PFS [IR-A: HR, 2.62 (P = 0.0062); IR-B: HR, 2.21 (P = 0.0202); and total IR: HR, 2.18 (P = 0.0230)] and OS [IR-A: HR, 2.94 (P = 0.0156); IR-B: HR, 2.69 (P = 0.0245); and total IR: HR, 2.72 (P = 0.0231)].CONCLUSIONS: Cixutumumab (10 mg/kg) with or without antiestrogen q2w had an acceptable safety profile, but no significant clinical efficacy.Patients with low total IR, IR-A, and IR-B mRNA expression levels had significantly longer PFS and OS, independent of the treatment.The prognostic or predictive value of IR as a biomarker for IGF-1R-targeted therapies requires further validation.",1,1,1,1
27428073,"Phase II randomised trial of autologous tumour lysate dendritic cell plus best supportive care compared with best supportive care in pre-treated advanced colorectal cancer patients.BACKGROUND: Autologous tumour lysate dendritic cell vaccine (ADC) has T-cell stimulatory capacity and, therefore, potential antitumour activity.We designed a phase II randomised trial of ADC + best supportive care (BSC) (experimental arm [EA]) compared with BSC (control arm [CA]), in pre-treated metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with progressive mCRC, at least to two chemotherapy regimens and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) 0-2, were randomised to EA versus CA.Stratification criteria: ECOG PS (0-1 versus 2) and lactate dehydrogenase (<Upper Limit of Normal [ULN] versus >ULN).EA was administered subcutaneously till progressive disease.Primary end-point was progression-free survival (PFS) at 4 months.RESULTS: Fifty-two patients were included (28 EA/24 CA).An interim analysis recommended early termination for futility.No objective radiological response was observed in EA.Median PFS in EA was 2.7 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.3-3.2 months) versus 2.3 months (95% CI, 2.1-2.5 months) in CA (p = 0.628).Median overall survival (OS) was 6.2 months (95% CI, 4.4-7.9 months) in EA versus 4.7 months (95% CI, 2.3-7 months) in CA (p = 0.41).No ADC-related adverse events were reported.Immunization induces tumour-specific T-cell response in 21 of 25 (84%) patients.Responder patients have an OS of 7.3 months (95% CI, 5.2-9.4 months) versus 3.8 months (95% CI, 0.6-6.9 months) in non-responders; p = 0.026).CONCLUSION: Our randomised clinical trial comparing ADC + BSC versus BSC in mCRC demonstrates that ADC generates a tumour-specific immune response but not benefit on PFS and OS.Our results do not support the use of ADC alone, in a phase III trial.",1,1,1,1
24158787,"Everolimus plus exemestane in postmenopausal patients with HR(+) breast cancer: BOLERO-2 final progression-free survival analysis.INTRODUCTION: Effective treatments for hormone-receptor-positive (HR(+)) breast cancer (BC) following relapse/progression on nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI) therapy are needed.Initial Breast Cancer Trials of OraL EveROlimus-2 (BOLERO-2) trial data demonstrated that everolimus and exemestane significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) versus placebo plus exemestane alone in this patient population.METHODS: BOLERO-2 is a phase 3, double-blind, randomized, international trial comparing everolimus (10 mg/day) plus exemestane (25 mg/day) versus placebo plus exemestane in postmenopausal women with HR(+) advanced BC with recurrence/progression during or after NSAIs.The primary endpoint was PFS by local investigator review, and was confirmed by independent central radiology review.Overall survival, response rate, and clinical benefit rate were secondary endpoints.RESULTS: Final study results with median 18-month follow-up show that median PFS remained significantly longer with everolimus plus exemestane versus placebo plus exemestane [investigator review: 7.8 versus 3.2 months, respectively; hazard ratio = 0.45 (95% confidence interval 0.38-0.54); log-rank P < 0.0001; central review: 11.0 versus 4.1 months, respectively; hazard ratio = 0.38 (95% confidence interval 0.31-0.48); log-rank P < 0.0001] in the overall population and in all prospectively defined subgroups, including patients with visceral metastases, [corrected] and irrespective of age.The incidence and severity of adverse events were consistent with those reported at the interim analysis and in other everolimus trials.CONCLUSION: The addition of everolimus to exemestane markedly prolonged PFS in patients with HR(+) advanced BC with disease recurrence/progression following prior NSAIs.These results further support the use of everolimus plus exemestane in this patient population.ClinicalTrials.gov #NCT00863655.",1,1,1,1
22149921,"ABVD alone versus radiation-based therapy in limited-stage Hodgkin's lymphoma.BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy plus radiation treatment is effective in controlling stage IA or IIA nonbulky Hodgkin's lymphoma in 90% of patients but is associated with late treatment-related deaths.Chemotherapy alone may improve survival because it is associated with fewer late deaths.METHODS: We randomly assigned 405 patients with previously untreated stage IA or IIA nonbulky Hodgkin's lymphoma to treatment with doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD) alone or to treatment with subtotal nodal radiation therapy, with or without ABVD therapy.Patients in the ABVD-only group, both those with a favorable risk profile and those with an unfavorable risk profile, received four to six cycles of ABVD.Among those assigned to subtotal nodal radiation therapy, patients who had a favorable risk profile received subtotal nodal radiation therapy alone and patients with an unfavorable risk profile received two cycles of ABVD plus subtotal nodal radiation therapy.The primary end point was 12-year overall survival.RESULTS: The median length of follow-up was 11.3 years.At 12 years, the rate of overall survival was 94% among those receiving ABVD alone, as compared with 87% among those receiving subtotal nodal radiation therapy (hazard ratio for death with ABVD alone, 0.50; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.25 to 0.99; P=0.04); the rates of freedom from disease progression were 87% and 92% in the two groups, respectively (hazard ratio for disease progression, 1.91; 95% CI, 0.99 to 3.69; P=0.05); and the rates of event-free survival were 85% and 80%, respectively (hazard ratio for event, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.54 to 1.43; P=0.60).Among the patients randomly assigned to ABVD alone, 6 patients died from Hodgkin's lymphoma or an early treatment complication and 6 died from another cause; among those receiving radiation therapy, 4 deaths were related to Hodgkin's lymphoma or early toxic effects from the treatment and 20 were related to another cause.CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma, ABVD therapy alone, as compared with treatment that included subtotal nodal radiation therapy, was associated with a higher rate of overall survival owing to a lower rate of death from other causes.(Funded by the Canadian Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute; HD.6 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00002561.).",1,1,1,1
26209642,"Value of KRAS as prognostic or predictive marker in NSCLC: results from the TAILOR trial.BACKGROUND: The prognostic and predictive role of KRAS mutations in advanced nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is still unclear.TAILOR prospectively assessed the prognostic and predictive value of KRAS mutations in NSCLC patients treated with erlotinib or docetaxel in second line.PATIENTS AND METHODS: NSCLC patients from 52 Italian hospitals were genotyped for KRAS and EGFR mutational status in two independent laboratories.Wild-type EGFR patients (N = 218) received first-line platinum-based chemotherapy and were randomly allocated at progression to erlotinib or docetaxel.Overall survival (OS) according to KRAS mutational status was the primary end point.RESULTS: KRAS mutations were present in 23% of TAILOR randomized cases.The presence of a KRAS mutation did not adversely affect progression-free (PFS) or overall (OS) survival [hazard ratio (HR) PFS = 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71-1.41, P = 0.977; OS = 1.24, 95% CI 0.87-1.77, P = 0.233], nor influenced treatment outcome (test for interaction: OS P = 0.965; PFS P = 0.417).Patients randomized to docetaxel treatment experienced longer survival independently from the KRAS mutational status of their tumors (HR: mutated KRAS 0.81, 95% CI 0.45-1.47; wild-type KRAS 0.79, 95% CI 0.57-1.10).CONCLUSION: In TAILOR, KRAS was neither prognostic nor predictive of benefit for either docetaxel or erlotinib.Docetaxel remains superior independently from KRAS status for second-line treatment in EGFR wild-type advanced NSCLC patients.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT00637910.",0,0,0,0

Results from the GEICAM/2006-03, multicenter study.Chemotherapy remains as the only systemic treatment option available for basal-like breast cancer (BC) patients.Preclinical models and several phase II studies suggested that platinum salts are active drugs in this BC subtype though there is no randomized study supporting this hypothesis.This study investigates if the addition of carboplatin to a combination of an alkylating agent together with anthracyclines and taxanes is able to increase the efficacy in the neoadjuvant treatment context.Patients with operable breast cancer and immunophenotypically defined basal-like disease (ER-/PR-/HER2- and cytokeratin 5/6+ or EGFR+) were recruited.Patients were randomized to receive EC (epirubicin 90 mg/m(2) plus cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2) for 4 cycles) followed either by D (docetaxel 100 mg/m(2) x 4 cycles; EC-D) or DCb (docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) plus carboplatin AUC 6 x 4 cycles; EC-DCb).The primary end point was pathological complete response (pCR) in the breast following the Miller and Payne criteria.Ninety-four patients were randomized (46 EC-D, 48 EC-DCb).pCR rate in the breast was seen in 16 patients (35 %) with EC-D and 14 patients (30 %) with EC-DCb (P value = 0.61).pCR in the breast and axilla was seen in 30 % of patients in both arms.The overall clinical response rate was 70 % (95 % CI 56-83) in the EC-D arm and 77 % (95 % CI 65-87) in the EC-DCb arm.Grade 3/4 toxicity was similar in both arms.The addition of carboplatin to conventional chemotherapy with EC-D in basal-like breast cancer patients did not improve the efficacy probably because they had already received an alkylating agent.These findings should be taken into consideration when developing new agents for this disease.",1,1,1,1

Non-progressive patients following 3 cycles of induction chemotherapy received maintenance gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2, days 1 and 8) every 3 weeks.( TRIAL REGISTRATION: UMIN000008252)RESULTS: The study was stopped because of delayed accrual at interim analysis.Of the randomly assigned 50 patients, 49 except for one in arm B were evaluable.Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 4.6 months for arm A vs. 3.5 months for arm B (HR = 1.03; 95% CI, 0.45-2.27; p = 0.95) and median overall survival (OS) was 15.0 months for arm A vs. 14.8 months for arm B (HR = 0.79; 95% CI, 0.40-1.51; p = 0.60), showing no difference between the two arms.The response rate, disease control rate, and the transit rate to maintenance phase were 36.0% (9/25), 64.0% (16/25), and 48% (12/25) for arm A vs. 16.7% (4/24), 50.0% (12/24), and 33% (8/24) for arm B, which were also statistically similar between the two arms (p = 0.13, p = 0.32, and p = 0.30, respectively).Both induction regimens were tolerable, except that more patients experienced peripheral neuropathy in arm A. Toxicities during the maintenance phase were also minimal.CONCLUSION: Survival and overall response were not significantly different between the two arms.Gemcitabine may be well-tolerable and feasible for maintenance therapy.",1,1,1,1

24076063,"Neoadjuvant treatment of endometrial cancer using anastrozole: a randomised pilot study.OBJECTIVE: Excessive oestrogenic stimulation is a well-known risk factor for the development and progression of endometrial cancer.Aromatase is the key enzyme which catalyses the conversion of androgens to oestrogens in postmenopausal women.Inhibition of aromatase may therefore be a useful strategy in the management of endometrial cancer.A pilot study was designed to assess the feasibility of a neoadjuvant model and understand the biological effects of anastrozole, an aromatase inhibitor, in the treatment of endometrial cancer.METHODS: Patients with endometrial cancer who consented to participate in the study were randomised to receive anastrozole or placebo for a minimum of 14 days prior to definitive surgery.Endometrial samples were obtained before and after treatment.Immunohistochemistry was performed to ascertain the expression of oestrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha), progesterone receptor (PR), androgen receptor (AR), ki-67 and Bcl2 before and after treatment in glands and stroma of the endometrium.RESULTS: A total of 16 patients were randomised to the anastrozole arm and 8 to the placebo arm (2:1 randomisation).A significant decrease in the glandular expression of ERalpha and AR was observed in the anastrozole arm.There was no significant change in the expression of PR or Bcl2.Expression of ki-67, a proliferation marker, also decreased significantly following treatment with anastrozole.CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with anastrozole caused a significant decrease in proliferation as demonstrated by decreased ki-67 expression.A large randomised controlled trial is warranted to fully assess the role of anastrozole in the neoadjuvant treatment of endometrial cancer.",1,1,1,1
27846903,"PRONTOX - proton therapy to reduce acute normal tissue toxicity in locally advanced non-small-cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC): study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Primary radiochemotherapy with photons is the standard treatment for locally advanced-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.Acute radiation-induced side effects such as oesophagitis and radiation pneumonitis limit patients' quality of life, and the latter can be potentially life-threatening.Due to its distinct physical characteristics, proton therapy enables better sparing of normal tissues, which is supposed to translate into a reduction of radiation-induced side effects.METHODS/DESIGN: This is a single-centre, prospective, randomised controlled, phase II clinical trial to compare photon to proton radiotherapy up to 66 Gy (RBE) with concomitant standard chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced-stage NSCLC.Patients will be allocated in a 1:1 ratio to photon or proton therapy, and treatment will be delivered slightly accelerated with six fractions of 2 Gy (RBE) per week.DISCUSSION: The overall aim of the study is to show a decrease of early and intermediate radiation-induced toxicity using proton therapy.For the primary endpoint of the study we postulate a decrease of radiation-induced side effects (oesophagitis and pneumonitis grade II or higher) from 39 to 12%.Secondary endpoints are locoregional and distant failure, overall survival and late side effects.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Registered at ClinicalTrials.gov with Identifier NCT02731001 on 1 April 2016.",0,0,0,0

27557302,"Daratumumab, Bortezomib, and Dexamethasone for Multiple Myeloma.BACKGROUND: Daratumumab, a human IgGkappa monoclonal antibody that targets CD38, induces direct and indirect antimyeloma activity and has shown substantial efficacy as monotherapy in heavily pretreated patients with multiple myeloma, as well as in combination with bortezomib in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.METHODS: In this phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 498 patients with relapsed or relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma to receive bortezomib (1.3 mg per square meter of body-surface area) and dexamethasone (20 mg) alone (control group) or in combination with daratumumab (16 mg per kilogram of body weight) (daratumumab group).The primary end point was progression-free survival.RESULTS: A prespecified interim analysis showed that the rate of progression-free survival was significantly higher in the daratumumab group than in the control group; the 12-month rate of progression-free survival was 60.7% in the daratumumab group versus 26.9% in the control group.After a median follow-up period of 7.4 months, the median progression-free survival was not reached in the daratumumab group and was 7.2 months in the control group (hazard ratio for progression or death with daratumumab vs. control, 0.39; 95% confidence interval, 0.28 to 0.53; P<0.001).The rate of overall response was higher in the daratumumab group than in the control group (82.9% vs. 63.2%, P<0.001), as were the rates of very good partial response or better (59.2% vs. 29.1%, P<0.001) and complete response or better (19.2% vs. 9.0%, P=0.001).Three of the most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events reported in the daratumumab group and the control group were thrombocytopenia (45.3% and 32.9%, respectively), anemia (14.4% and 16.0%, respectively), and neutropenia (12.8% and 4.2%, respectively).Infusion-related reactions that were associated with daratumumab treatment were reported in 45.3% of the patients in the daratumumab group; these reactions were mostly grade 1 or 2 (grade 3 in 8.6% of the patients), and in 98.2% of these patients, they occurred during the first infusion.CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with relapsed or relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, daratumumab in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone resulted in significantly longer progression-free survival than bortezomib and dexamethasone alone and was associated with infusion-related reactions and higher rates of thrombocytopenia and neutropenia than bortezomib and dexamethasone alone.(Funded by Janssen Research and Development; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02136134.).",1,1,1,1
23706168,"Difference in overall and age-specific prevalence of high-risk human papillomavirus infection in Italy: evidence from NTCC trial.BACKGROUND: Although among women a decreasing prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection with increasing age has been consistently observed in high-resource countries, different age profiles have been reported elsewhere.METHODS: We compared the age profile of high-risk (HR)-HPV prevalence in nine different areas of Northern and Central Italy by studying the women recruited in the intervention arm of the New Technologies in Cervical Cancer study and tested by Hybrid Capture 2.Differences in the age-distribution of HPV infection were investigated in each centre by the joinpoint approach in a logistic model.46,900 women aged 25 to 60 years were included in the analysis.RESULTS: The HR-HPV age-standardised (on Italian population) prevalence ranged from 5.7% (Trento) to 10.3% (Ravenna).HR-HPV prevalence decreased as a logistic function of increasing age in 6 of 9 centres (Trento, Verona, Florence, Bologna, Imola, and Viterbo).The effect of age on HR-HPV prevalence slopes did not differ significantly among these 6 centres, whereas significant heterogeneity in intercepts (p < 0.001) was found, reflecting different overall HR-HPV prevalence between centres.One significant joinpoint was observed in 2 centres (Padua and Ravenna), indicating that the decrease in HR-HPV prevalence by age was better described using a function composed with two logistic segments.In Padua HR-HPV prevalence decreased only slightly up to 39 years but showed a steep downturn thereafter.In Ravenna HR-HPV prevalence decreased steeply down to 45 years of age and then showed a plateau.Finally, in Turin two significant joinpoints were observed: prevalence decreased only after age 29 and showed a plateau after age 39.CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed substantial differences in overall and age-specific HR-HPV prevalence across Italian areas.These findings may be related to different timing of changes in sexual behaviours across regions.Age-specific HR-HPV prevalence in Italy does not support an influence of age per se.",0,0,0,0
22493375,"Intra-arterial infusion of irinotecan-loaded drug-eluting beads (DEBIRI) versus intravenous therapy (FOLFIRI) for hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer: final results of a phase III study.BACKGROUND: Metastases to the liver receive most of their blood supply from the arterial route, therefore for patients with hepatic metastases from large bowel cancer, hepatic arterial infusion adopting drug-eluting beads preloaded with irinotecan (DEBIRI) may offer a chance of cure.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a multi-institutional study, 74 patients were randomly assigned to receive DEBIRI (36) versus systemic irinotecan, fluorouracil and leucovorin (FOLFIRI, 38).The primary end-point was survival; secondary end points were response, recurrence, toxicity, quality of life, cost and influence of molecular markers.RESULTS: At 50 months, overall survival was significantly longer for patients treated with DEBIRI than for those treated with FOLFIRI (p=0.031, log-rank).Median survival was 22 (95% Confidence Interval CI=21-23) months, for DEBIRI and 15 (95% CI=12-18) months for FOLFIRI.Progression-free survival was 7 (95% CI=3-11) months in the DEBIRI group compared to 4 (95% CI=3-5) months in the FOLFIRI group and the difference between groups was statistically significant (p=0.006, log-rank).Extrahepatic progression had occurred in all patients by the end of the study, at a median time of 13 (95% CI=10-16) months in the DEBIRI group compared to 9 (95% CI 5-13) months in the FOLFIRI group.A statistically significant difference between groups was not observed (p=0.064, log-rank).The median time for duration of improvement to quality of life was 8 (95% CI=3-13) months in the DEBIRI group and 3 (95% CI=2-4) months in the FOLFIRI group.The difference in duration of improvement was statistically significant (p=0.00002, log-rank).CONCLUSION: This study showed a statistically significant difference between DEBIRI and FOLFIRI for overall survival (7 months), progression-free survival (3 months) and quality of life (5 months).In addition, a clinically significant improvement in time to extrahepatic progression (4 months) was observed for DEBIRI, a reversal of the expectation for a regional treatment.This suggests a benefit of DEBIRI treatment over standard chemotherapy and serves to establish the expected difference between these two treatment options for planning future large randomized studies.",1,1,1,1
26438237,"The effects of short-term fasting on tolerance to (neo) adjuvant chemotherapy in HER2-negative breast cancer patients: a randomized pilot study.BACKGROUND: Preclinical evidence shows that short-term fasting (STF) protects healthy cells against side effects of chemotherapy and makes cancer cells more vulnerable to it.This pilot study examines the feasibility of STF and its effects on tolerance of chemotherapy in a homogeneous patient group with early breast cancer (BC).METHODS: Eligible patients had HER2-negative, stage II/III BC.Women receiving (neo)-adjuvant TAC (docetaxel/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide) were randomized to fast 24 h before and after commencing chemotherapy, or to eat according to the guidelines for healthy nutrition.Toxicity in the two groups was compared.Chemotherapy-induced DNA damage in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was quantified by the level of gamma-H2AX analyzed by flow cytometry.RESULTS: Thirteen patients were included of whom seven were randomized to the STF arm.STF was well tolerated.Mean erythrocyte- and thrombocyte counts 7 days post-chemotherapy were significantly higher (P = 0.007, 95 % CI 0.106-0.638 and P = 0.00007, 95 % CI 38.7-104, respectively) in the STF group compared to the non-STF group.Non-hematological toxicity did not differ between the groups.Levels of gamma-H2AX were significantly increased 30 min post-chemotherapy in CD45 + CD3- cells in non-STF, but not in STF patients.CONCLUSIONS: STF during chemotherapy was well tolerated and reduced hematological toxicity of TAC in HER2-negative BC patients.Moreover, STF may reduce a transient increase in, and/or induce a faster recovery of DNA damage in PBMCs after chemotherapy.Larger studies, investigating a longer fasting period, are required to generate more insight into the possible benefits of STF during chemotherapy.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01304251 , March 2011.",1,1,1,1

26761561,"Physical exercise for functional capacity, blood immune function, fatigue, and quality of life in high-risk prostate cancer patients during radiotherapy: a prospective, randomized clinical study.BACKGROUND: During radiotherapy (RT), prostate cancer (PCa) patients may report cancer related fatigue (CRF), which impairs functional capacity, psychological status, and quality of life (QoL).RT can induce cytokine responses that could play a role in mediating radiation toxicity by increasing inflammation.While it is known that physical exercise plays an important anti-inflammatory role in healthy adults, its specific anti-inflammatory effects in PCa patients with CRF have not yet been determined.AIM: Previous studies have shown that physical exercise in cancer patients undergoing RT improves cardiac fitness, muscle strength, and QoL, however it is still unknown how physical exercise affects inflammation and its specific consequences in PCa patients.Therefore, the purpose of this trial was to examine the effect of supervised physical exercise on inflammatory blood markers, as well as the relationship of these parameters with functional capacity, fatigue, and QoL in high-risk PCa patients undergoing RT.DESIGN: This was a prospective, two-arm randomized controlled clinical trial.SETTING: The study was performed in our outpatients center.POPULATION: Fifty-four high-risk PCa men were randomly allocated to two groups prior to undergoing RT.METHODS: Twenty-seven patients performed supervised, moderate-intensity physical exercise (exercise group; EG) and the other 27 formed a control group that carried out normal daily physical activity (usual group; UG).The following parameters were assessed before and after RT: functional capacity, changes in blood count variables and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL]-1beta, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha), fatigue, and QoL (using FACT-F score and EORTC questionnaires).RESULTS: No significant differences existed between the study groups at baseline assessment.After RT, there was a significant improvement in functional capacity (P<0.05) and a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokine levels (P>0.05) and fatigue (P<0.05) in the EG compared to the UG.Fatigue level was significantly higher in the UG (F[2.126]; P<0.05) after RT than before.Physical exercise had no effect on the correlation between inflammatory blood markers and functional capacity and fatigue scores provided by study participants.CONCLUSIONS: Regular, moderate-intensity physical exercise improves functional capacity, decreases the production of inflammatory markers and fatigue, and has a positive influence on QoL in high-risk PCa patients during RT.CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: This is one of the first studies to examine the effects of supervised exercise training on pro-inflammatory cytokine levels during RT in PCa patients by measuring functional capacity, fatigue, and QoL.",0,0,0,0

24315404,"A phase III randomized study comparing neoadjuvant chemotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy for locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma: updated long-term survival outcomes.OBJECTIVE: To determine whether concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) can improve survival rates compared to the neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) regimen in locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 338 patients with biopsy-proven NPC were randomly assigned to receive NACT followed by radical radiotherapy (RT) then adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) or CCRT followed by AC.RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 60 months, the 5-year overall survival (OS) rate did not differ significantly between two groups (75.5% vs 79.4% in CCRT and NACT group respectively, P=0.47, HR=0.84, 95%CI 0.53-1.33).Metastasis-free survival (MFS) rate was significantly improved by the CCRT (79.0% vs 86.9%, P=0.05, HR=0.59, 95%CI 0.35-1.00).Subgroup analysis indicated that the benefit of CCRT was derived from N0/N1 tumors (78.0% vs 93.5%, P=0.05, HR=0.35, 95%CI 0.12-0.99).Higher rates of mucositis (52.4% vs. 35.9% P=0.02) and vomiting (13.7% vs. 4.7% P=0.00) were noted in the CCRT arm.Late toxicities were similar in two groups.CONCLUSIONS: The updated results demonstrated no significant survival benefit of CCRT over NACT in patients with locoregionally advanced NPC.CCRT only showed significant MFS efficacy in T3-4N0-1 populations.",1,1,1,1
23233657,"High cereblon expression is associated with better survival in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma treated with thalidomide maintenance.Recently, cereblon (CRBN) expression was found to be essential for the activity of thalidomide and lenalidomide.In the present study, we investigated whether the clinical efficacy of thalidomide in multiple myeloma is associated with CRBN expression in myeloma cells.Patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma were included in the HOVON-65/GMMG-HD4 trial, in which postintensification treatment in 1 arm consisted of daily thalidomide (50 mg) for 2 years.Gene-expression profiling, determined at the start of the trial, was available for 96 patients who started thalidomide maintenance.In this patient set, increase of CRBN gene expression was significantly associated with longerprogression-free survival (P = .005).In contrast, no association between CRBN expression and survival was observed in the arm with bortezomib maintenance.We conclude that CRBN expression may be associated with the clinical efficacy of thalidomide.This trial has been registered at the Nederlands Trial Register (www.trialregister.nl) as NTR213; at the European Union Drug Regulating Authorities Clinical Trials (EudraCT) as 2004-000944-26; and at the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) as 64455289.",1,1,1,1

24881631,"Ibrutinib versus ofatumumab in previously treated chronic lymphoid leukemia.BACKGROUND: In patients with chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), a short duration of response to therapy or adverse cytogenetic abnormalities are associated with a poor outcome.We evaluated the efficacy of ibrutinib, a covalent inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase, in patients at risk for a poor outcome.METHODS: In this multicenter, open-label, phase 3 study, we randomly assigned 391 patients with relapsed or refractory CLL or SLL to receive daily ibrutinib or the anti-CD20 antibody ofatumumab.The primary end point was the duration of progression-free survival, with the duration of overall survival and the overall response rate as secondary end points.RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 9.4 months, ibrutinib significantly improved progression-free survival; the median duration was not reached in the ibrutinib group (with a rate of progression-free survival of 88% at 6 months), as compared with a median of 8.1 months in the ofatumumab group (hazard ratio for progression or death in the ibrutinib group, 0.22; P<0.001).Ibrutinib also significantly improved overall survival (hazard ratio for death, 0.43; P=0.005).At 12 months, the overall survival rate was 90% in the ibrutinib group and 81% in the ofatumumab group.The overall response rate was significantly higher in the ibrutinib group than in the ofatumumab group (42.6% vs. 4.1%, P<0.001).An additional 20% of ibrutinib-treated patients had a partial response with lymphocytosis.Similar effects were observed regardless of whether patients had a chromosome 17p13.1 deletion or resistance to purine analogues.The most frequent nonhematologic adverse events were diarrhea, fatigue, pyrexia, and nausea in the ibrutinib group and fatigue, infusion-related reactions, and cough in the ofatumumab group.CONCLUSIONS: Ibrutinib, as compared with ofatumumab, significantly improved progression-free survival, overall survival, and response rate among patients with previously treated CLL or SLL.(Funded by Pharmacyclics and Janssen; RESONATE ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01578707.).",1,1,1,1
24503408,"In vivo intraocular distribution and safety of periocular nanoparticle carboplatin for treatment of advanced retinoblastoma in humans.PURPOSE: To study the intraocular distribution and safety of polymethylmethacrylate nanoparticles loaded with carboplatin after posterior subtenon injection in humans.DESIGN: Prospective, interventional, comparative case series.METHODS: Six patients (mean age: 26.83 +/- 7.5 years), scheduled to undergo planned uniocular enucleation in an institutional setting, were randomly divided into 3 groups.Each group received a 10 mg/mL posterior subtenon injection of nanoparticle carboplatin in the eye to be enucleated.Two eyes were enucleated 6, 24 and 72 hours post injection.Intravenous blood was collected during enucleation.The concentration of carboplatin reaching various intraocular tissues was determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy.The drug toxicity in the ocular tissues was assessed by histopathology and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy.RESULTS: The highest level of carboplatin was detected in retinas (8.33 +/- 1.69 mg/g), up to 24 hours post treatment.The intravitreal concentration continued to increase gradually until 72 hours (3.46 +/- 0.26 mg/g).The choroids and lenses showed very low levels of carboplatin after 6 hours, with negligible amounts at 72 hours.No signs of tissue damage were observed on histopathology or electron microscopy.Intravenous concentration of carboplatin was undetectable in all patients.CONCLUSION: Results may indicate an increased facilitated trans-scleral transport of nanoparticle carboplatin, with a sustained-release behavior but without any associated short-term ocular or systemic side effects in humans.The very high concentrations achieved in vitreous and retina after a single posterior subtenon injection may be clinically useful for adjunctive treatment of advanced intraocular retinoblastoma with vitreous seeds.However, further studies are needed to assess long-term toxicity and clinical efficacy.",0,0,0,0
22104618,"Does health-related quality of life improve for advanced pancreatic cancer patients who respond to gemcitabine? Analysis of a randomized phase III trial of the cancer and leukemia group B (CALGB 80303).CONTEXT: Gemcitabine for advanced pancreatic cancer (APC) is palliative and the prognosis is poor, making health-related quality of life (HRQOL) particularly important.OBJECTIVES: We evaluated HRQOL with the EuroQol (EQ-5D) in patients with APC participating in Cancer and Leukemia Group B 80303, a multicenter, double-blind, randomized trial comparing overall survival (OS) between two treatment arms: gemcitabine with bevacizumab or gemcitabine with placebo.METHODS: A consecutive subsample of patients was invited to complete the EQ-5D surveys.Because neither clinical nor HRQOL outcomes differed based on the study arm, analyses were pooled.Changes in mean scores from baseline to eight weeks and the prognostic value of the EQ-5D were evaluated.RESULTS: Mean index scores remained stable (0.78 at baseline [n=267], 0.79 at eight weeks [n=186], P=0.34, Wilcoxon signed rank test), attributable to a modest deterioration of physical function domain scores coincident with small improvements in pain and anxiety/depression scores.A small decline in visual analogue scale scores was observed (70.7 vs. 68.2, P=0.026).HRQOL changes within chemotherapy response strata revealed stable index scores but a trend of worsened physical function among patients with disease progression compared with those with stable or improved disease.Visual analogue scale scores trended downward over time irrespective of chemotherapy response status, with a statistically meaningful deterioration in patients who progressed (68.9 vs. 64.4, P=0.029).Baseline scores from both EQ-5D scales were significant predictors of OS in Cox proportional hazard models.CONCLUSION: Response to gemcitabine treatment in APC is not associated with appreciable improvement of global HRQOL.Small improvements in pain and mood are observed despite progressive functional decline.Those who respond to gemcitabine may experience a slight slowing of functional deterioration.",0,0,0,0

The SI also met with a nurse/nutritionist to receive a treatment summary, surveillance, and lifestyle recommendations.Both groups completed questionnaires on the impact of cancer (IOC), patient satisfaction (FACIT-TS-PS), and assessment of survivor concerns (ASC) at baseline, 3 and 6 months.Within and between group t tests and linear regression analyses were performed.Among 126 women (60 CG, 66 SI), mean age was 54 years, 48 % were Hispanic, and the groups were well-balanced by baseline characteristics.No significant differences between the CG and SI on the FACIT-TS-PS or IOC at 3 and 6 months were seen.The ASC health worry subscale was lower (less worry) in the SI compared to CG (p = 0.02).At all time-points, Hispanic women had higher (worse) health worry (p = 0.0008), social-life interference (p = 0.009), and meaning of cancer scales (p = 0.0004), and more trust in medical professionals (p = 0.03) compared to non-Hispanic women.While the SI did not lead to significant improvements in most patient-reported outcomes, it was associated with decreased health worry.Future interventions should determine the most efficient and effective method for delivering survivorship care plans.",0,0,0,0
22493375,"Intra-arterial infusion of irinotecan-loaded drug-eluting beads (DEBIRI) versus intravenous therapy (FOLFIRI) for hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer: final results of a phase III study.BACKGROUND: Metastases to the liver receive most of their blood supply from the arterial route, therefore for patients with hepatic metastases from large bowel cancer, hepatic arterial infusion adopting drug-eluting beads preloaded with irinotecan (DEBIRI) may offer a chance of cure.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a multi-institutional study, 74 patients were randomly assigned to receive DEBIRI (36) versus systemic irinotecan, fluorouracil and leucovorin (FOLFIRI, 38).The primary end-point was survival; secondary end points were response, recurrence, toxicity, quality of life, cost and influence of molecular markers.RESULTS: At 50 months, overall survival was significantly longer for patients treated with DEBIRI than for those treated with FOLFIRI (p=0.031, log-rank).Median survival was 22 (95% Confidence Interval CI=21-23) months, for DEBIRI and 15 (95% CI=12-18) months for FOLFIRI.Progression-free survival was 7 (95% CI=3-11) months in the DEBIRI group compared to 4 (95% CI=3-5) months in the FOLFIRI group and the difference between groups was statistically significant (p=0.006, log-rank).Extrahepatic progression had occurred in all patients by the end of the study, at a median time of 13 (95% CI=10-16) months in the DEBIRI group compared to 9 (95% CI 5-13) months in the FOLFIRI group.A statistically significant difference between groups was not observed (p=0.064, log-rank).The median time for duration of improvement to quality of life was 8 (95% CI=3-13) months in the DEBIRI group and 3 (95% CI=2-4) months in the FOLFIRI group.The difference in duration of improvement was statistically significant (p=0.00002, log-rank).CONCLUSION: This study showed a statistically significant difference between DEBIRI and FOLFIRI for overall survival (7 months), progression-free survival (3 months) and quality of life (5 months).In addition, a clinically significant improvement in time to extrahepatic progression (4 months) was observed for DEBIRI, a reversal of the expectation for a regional treatment.This suggests a benefit of DEBIRI treatment over standard chemotherapy and serves to establish the expected difference between these two treatment options for planning future large randomized studies.",1,1,1,1

27433356,"Race or Resource? BMI, Race, and Other Social Factors as Risk Factors for Interlimb Differences among Overweight Breast Cancer Survivors with Lymphedema.Introduction.High BMI is a risk factor for upper body breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) onset.Black cancer survivors are more likely to have high BMI than White cancer survivors.While observational analyses suggest up to 2.2 times increased risk of BCRL onset for Black breast cancer survivors, no studies have explored race or other social factors that may affect BCRL severity, operationalized by interlimb volume difference (ILD).Materials and Methods.ILD was measured by perometry for 296 overweight (25 > BMI < 50) Black (n = 102) or White (n = 194) breast cancer survivors (>6 months from treatment) in the WISER Survivor trial.Multivariable linear regression examined associations between social and physical factors and ILD.Results.Neither Black race (-0.26, p = 0.89) nor BMI (0.22, p = 0.10) was associated with ILD.Attending college (-4.89, p = 0.03) was the strongest factor associated with ILD, followed by having more lymph nodes removed (4.75, p = 0.01), >25% BCRL care adherence (4.10, p = 0.01), and years since treatment (0.55, p < 0.001).Discussion.Neither race nor BMI was associated with ILD among overweight cancer survivors.Education, a proxy for resource level, was the strongest factor associated with greater ILD.Tailoring physical activity and weight loss interventions designed to address BCRL severity by resource rather than race should be considered.",0,0,0,0
22840231,"Influence of perioperative oxygen fraction on pulmonary function after abdominal surgery: a randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: A high perioperative inspiratory oxygen fraction (FiO2) may reduce the frequency of surgical site infection.Perioperative atelectasis is caused by absorption, compression and reduced function of surfactant.It is well accepted, that ventilation with 100% oxygen for only a few minutes is associated with significant formation of atelectasis.However, it is still not clear if a longer period of 80% oxygen results in more atelectasis compared to a low FiO2.Our aim was to assess if a high FiO2 is associated with impaired oxygenation and decreased pulmonary functional residual capacity (FRC).METHODS: Thirty-five patients scheduled for laparotomy for ovarian cancer were randomized to receive either 30% oxygen (n = 15) or 80% oxygen (n = 20) during and for 2 h after surgery.The oxygenation index (PaO2/FiO2) was measured every 30 min during anesthesia and 90 min after extubation.FRC was measured the day before surgery and 2 h after extubation by a rebreathing method using the inert gas SF6.RESULTS: Five min after intubation, the median PaO2/FiO2 was 69 kPa [53-71] in the 30%-group vs. 60 kPa [47-69] in the 80%-group (P = 0.25).At the end of anesthesia, the PaO2/FiO2 was 58 kPa [40-70] vs. 57 kPa [46-67] in the 30%- and 80%-group, respectively (P = 0.10).The median FRC was 1993 mL [1610-2240] vs. 1875 mL [1545-2048] at baseline and 1615 mL [1375-2318] vs. 1633 mL [1343-1948] postoperatively in the 30%- and 80%-group, respectively (P = 0.70).CONCLUSION: We found no significant difference in oxygenation index or functional residual capacity between patients given 80% and 30% oxygen for a period of approximately 5 hours.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00637936.",0,0,0,0

24081946,"Randomized multicenter phase II trial comparing two schedules of etirinotecan pegol (NKTR-102) in women with recurrent platinum-resistant/refractory epithelial ovarian cancer.PURPOSE: Etirinotecan pegol (NKTR-102) is a unique, long-acting topoisomerase-I inhibitor with prolonged systemic exposure to SN38 (7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin), the active metabolite of irinotecan.This randomized phase II trial investigated two dosing schedules of etirinotecan pegol in patients with platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian carcinoma.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 71 eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive etirinotecan pegol 145 mg/m(2) every 14 or 21 days until progression or unacceptable adverse events (AEs).The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR) by RECIST (version 1.0).Secondary end points included response by Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup criteria, duration of ORR, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).RESULTS: The overall confirmed ORR was 20% (95% CI, 10% to 30%): 20% for once every 14 days, and 19% for once every 21 days.Median response duration was 4.1 months for once every 14 days and 4.0 months for once every 21 days.Median PFS for every 14 and every 21 days was 4.1 and 5.3 months, respectively, and median OS was 10.0 and 11.7 months, respectively.Etirinotecan pegol was well tolerated, with the most common grade 3 to 4 AEs being dehydration (24%) and diarrhea (23%).Diarrhea, dehydration, nausea, and neutropenia were less frequent with the schedule of once every 21 days than with that of once every 14 days.CONCLUSION: Both schedules of etirinotecan pegol showed activity in patients with heavily pretreated ovarian cancer, with encouraging ORR and PFS rates.The schedule of once every 21 days was better tolerated and had slightly longer PFS and OS rates.The treatment schedule of etirinotecan pegol 145 mg/m(2) once every 21 days was selected for the expanded phase II study and is preferred for future phase III studies.These findings provide support to directly compare etirinotecan pegol versus one of the approved drugs (eg, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or topotecan) in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.",1,1,1,1
26250474,"Prospective study of DNA methylation at LINE-1 and Alu in peripheral blood and the risk of prostate cancer.BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that global blood DNA methylation levels may be associated with the risk of various cancers, but no studies have evaluated this relationship for prostate cancer.METHODS: We used pyrosequencing to quantify DNA methylation levels at the long interspersed nuclear element 1 (LINE-1) and Alu repetitive elements in pre-diagnostic blood samples from 694 prostate cancer cases and 703 controls from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial.We evaluated prostate cancer risk associated with the mean methylation level for each element using logistic regression, adjusting for potential confounders.RESULTS: We did not observe a significant association with prostate cancer for LINE-1 [odds ratio (OR) for the highest compared to the lowest quartile = 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.73-1.39, Ptrend = 0.99] or Alu (OR = 0.94, 95% CI: 0.68-1.29, Ptrend = 0.69) methylation levels overall.However, for Alu, we observed that higher DNA methylation levels were associated with a significant increased risk for those diagnosed 4 or more years after blood draw (OR = 2.26, 95% CI: 1.27-4.00, Ptrend = 4.4 x 10(-3) ).In contrast, there was no association for those diagnosed 2 (OR = 1.13, 95% CI: 0.67-1.90, Ptrend = 0.64) or 3 years after draw (OR = 1.22, 95% CI: 0.71-2.07, Ptrend = 0.32), and a decreased risk for those diagnosed less than 2 years after draw (OR = 0.40, 95% CI: 0.25-0.65, Ptrend = 3.8 x 10(-5) ; Pheterogeneity = 5.3 x 10(-6) ).CONCLUSIONS: Although LINE-1 DNA methylation levels were not associated with prostate cancer, we observed an association for Alu that varied by time from blood draw to diagnosis.Our study suggests that elevated Alu blood DNA methylation levels several years before diagnosis may be associated with an increased prostate cancer risk.",0,0,0,0
28209746,"A Phase II Randomized Trial (GO27827) of First-Line FOLFOX Plus Bevacizumab with or Without the MET Inhibitor Onartuzumab in Patients with Metastatic Colorectal Cancer.BACKGROUND: Dysregulated hepatocyte growth factor/mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) signaling is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to vascular endothelial growth factor inhibition in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).We report outcomes from a double-blind, multicenter phase II trial of the MET inhibitor onartuzumab in combination with mFOLFOX-6 and bevacizumab for mCRC (GO27827; NCT01418222).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive onartuzumab (10 mg/kg intravenously [IV]) or placebo plus mFOLFOX-6 and bevacizumab (5 mg/kg IV).Oxaliplatin was given for 8-12 cycles; other agents were continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or death.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) in the intent-to-treat (ITT) and MET immunohistochemistry (IHC) expression-positive populations.RESULTS: Between September 2011 and November 2012, 194 patients were enrolled.In September 2013, an interim analysis recommended stopping onartuzumab treatment due to lack of efficacy.At the time of the final analysis in February 2014, no significant improvement in PFS was seen with onartuzumab versus placebo in either the ITT or MET IHC-positive populations.An improvement in PFS was noted in the MET IHC-negative population.Neither overall survival nor response rate was improved with onartuzumab.The incidence of fatigue, peripheral edema, and deep vein thrombosis was increased with onartuzumab relative to placebo.CONCLUSION: Onartuzumab combined with mFOLFOX-6 and bevacizumab did not significantly improve efficacy outcomes in either the ITT or MET IHC-positive populations.MET expression by IHC was not a predictive biomarker in this setting.The Oncologist 2017;22:264-271 IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The addition of onartuzumab to mFOLFOX-6 plus bevacizumab did not improve outcomes in patients with previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer in this randomized, phase II study.Although initial results with onartuzumab were promising, a number of phase II/III clinical trials have reported a lack of improvement in efficacy with onartuzumab combined with standard-of-care therapies in several tumor types.Furthermore, negative study data have been published for rilotumumab and ficlatuzumab, both of which block hepatocyte growth factor binding to the mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) receptor.MET immunohistochemistry was not a predictive biomarker.It remains to be seen if other biomarkers or small molecule inhibitors may be more appropriate for inhibiting this oncogenic pathway.",1,1,1,1

25887253,"3D vs 2D laparoscopic radical prostatectomy in organ-confined prostate cancer: comparison of operative data and pentafecta rates: a single cohort study.BACKGROUND: Currently, men are younger at the time of diagnosis of prostate cancer and more interested in less invasive surgical approaches (traditional laparoscopy, 3D-laparoscopy, robotics).Outcomes of continence, erectile function, cancer cure, positive surgical margins and complication are well collected in the pentafecta rate.However, no comparative studies between 4th generation 3D-HD vision system laparoscopy and standard bi-dimensional laparoscopy have been reported.This study aimed to compare the operative, perioperative data and pentafecta rates between 2D and 3D laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP) and to identify the actual role of 3D LRP in urology.METHODS: From October 2012 to July 2013, 86 patients with clinically localized prostate cancer [PCa: age </= 70 years, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) </= 10 ng/ml, biopsy Gleason score </= 7] underwent laparoscopic extraperitoneal radical prostatectomy (LERP) and were followed for approximately 14 months (range 12-25).Patients were selected for inclusion via hospital record data, and divided into two groups.Their patient records were then analyzed.Patients were randomized into two groups: the former 2D-LERP (43 pts) operated with the use of 2D-HD camera; the latter 3D-LERP (43 pts) operated with the use of a 3D-HD 4th generation view system.The operative and perioperative data and the pentafecta rates between 2D-LERP and 3D-LERP were compared.RESULTS: The overall pentafecta rates at 3 months were 47.4% and 49.6% in the 2D- and 3D-LERP group respectively.The pentafecta rate at 12 months was 62.7% and 67% for each group respectively.4th generation 3D-HD vision system provides advantages over standard bi-dimensional view with regard to intraoperative steps.Our data suggest a trend of improvement in intraoperative blood loss and postoperative recovery of continence with the respect of the oncological safety.CONCLUSIONS: Use of the 3D technology by a single surgeon significantly enhances the possibility of achieving better intraoperative results and pentafecta in all patients undergoing LERP.Potency was the most difficult outcome to reach after surgery, and it was the main factor leading to pentafecta failure.Nevertheless, further studies are necessary to better comprehend the role of 3D-LERP in modern urology.",0,0,0,0
26518352,"The Effect of Using an Electric Fan on Dyspnea in Chinese Patients With Terminal Cancer.BACKGROUND: Fan therapy is often suggested for relieving the symptom of dyspnea in patients with advanced cancer, but relevant literature among Asians is limited.OBJECTIVE: Phase 2 clinical trial to assess the clinical feasibility and outcome of using an electric fan to alleviate the symptom of dyspnea in Chinese patients with advanced cancer.METHODS: Thirty patients with advanced cancer having unresolved breathlessness were recruited from Hospice and Palliative Care Centre of Kiang Wu Hospital in Macau.Participants were randomly and equally allocated to the experimental group and the control group, respectively.OUTCOME MEASURES: Verbal numerical rating scale (NRS) of breathlessness, respiratory rate (RR), and saturation of peripheral oxygen (SpO2) was collected before and after the intervention.RESULTS: T test was used to analyze the data collected.There was a significant difference in the NRS scores of the experimental group ( P < .01), indicating a significant reduction in the patients' sensation of breathlessness after fan therapy, whereas no significant difference was found in the objective statistic results of RR and SpO2.No significant difference ( P > .05) was found in the control group for all the 3 variables before and after routine treatment.CONCLUSION: The results of the study suggested that fan therapy could be effective in alleviating dyspnea in Chinese patients with advanced cancer.It should be considered as one of the nonpharmacological treatment option.Future large-scale phase 3 clinical trials are warranted.",0,0,0,0
27197293,"Exercise-Induced Dose-Response Alterations in Adiponectin and Leptin Levels Are Dependent on Body Fat Changes in Women at Risk for Breast Cancer.BACKGROUND: Dysregulation of adipokines, such as adiponectin and leptin, is associated with a variety of chronic diseases, including cancer.Physical activity protects against breast cancer and one of the mechanisms which may underlie this association is exercise-induced changes in adipokine levels.The WISER Sister Trial was a three-armed randomized controlled trial in premenopausal women (n = 137) with an elevated risk for breast cancer.METHODS: A 5-menstrual-cycle-long dosed aerobic exercise intervention compared low-dose exercise (150 min/wk; n = 44) or high-dose exercise (300 min/wk; n = 48) with a control group asked to maintain usual activity levels (n = 45).Exercise intensity progressed to and was maintained at 70% to 80% of age predicted heart rate max.Body composition and adipokine levels were measured at baseline and follow-up.RESULTS: We observed significant linear trends for increased fitness capacity (Delta%: -2.0% control, 10.1% low dose, 13.1% high dose), decreased fat tissue-to-total tissue mass (Delta%: 0.7% control, -2.9% low dose, -3.7% high dose), increased body fat adjusted adiponectin (Delta%: -0.6% control, 0.6% low dose, 0.9% high dose), and decreased body fat adjusted leptin (Delta%: 0.7% control, -8.2% low dose, -10.2% high dose).CONCLUSIONS: In this randomized clinical trial of premenopausal women at risk for breast cancer, we demonstrate a dose-response effect of exercise on adiponectin and leptin and that dose response is dependent on changes in body fat.IMPACT: Improved adipokine levels, achieved by aerobic exercise training-induced decreases in body fat, may decrease breast cancer risk for high-risk premenopausal women.Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 25(8); 1195-200.(c)2016 AACR.",1,0,0,0
24080607,"New harmonic scalpel versus conventional hemostasis in right colon surgery: a prospective randomized controlled clinical trial.BACKGROUND: The Harmonic Scalpel (HS) is a device that uses vibrations to coagulate and cut tissues simultaneously.Its advantages are represented by minimal lateral thermal tissue damage, less smoke formation, no neuromuscular stimulation and no transmission of electricity to the patient.METHODS: A total of 211 consecutive patients (113 men, 98 women; mean age 64 years) undergoing hemicolectomy for cancer of the right colon were divided into two groups, namely those in whom the operation was performed using a new HS handpiece (NHS; 108 patients) and those assigned to conventional hemostasis (CH; 103 patients).The two surgical groups were compared regarding patients' age and sex, tumor size, location, histotype and local invasiveness assessed by American Joint Cancer Committee stage, operative time, fluid content in the suction balloon (drainage volume) during the first 1-3 days after surgery, hospital stay and complications.RESULTS: Ultrasonic energy delivered through an HS has been shown to be safe and to produce minimal damage to the surrounding tissues because of its minimal heat production.Electrical devices allow hemostatic control in vessels up to 3 mm in diameter, while HS can coagulate vessels up to 5 mm in diameter; thus, HS allows not only better control of bleeding but also of lymphorrhea.In fact, the amount of fluid collected in the drainage was significantly lower in the NHS group compared to the CH group.Protein depletion influences the patient's regenerative capacity and thus also the occurrence of complications and recovery time.CONCLUSION: NHS is a useful device in colon surgery; it facilitates surgical maneuvers and reduces operative times and blood and lymphatic losses, allowing satisfactory maintenance of protein storage.This results in a lower incidence of complications and faster recovery by patients.",0,0,0,0
22149921,"ABVD alone versus radiation-based therapy in limited-stage Hodgkin's lymphoma.BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy plus radiation treatment is effective in controlling stage IA or IIA nonbulky Hodgkin's lymphoma in 90% of patients but is associated with late treatment-related deaths.Chemotherapy alone may improve survival because it is associated with fewer late deaths.METHODS: We randomly assigned 405 patients with previously untreated stage IA or IIA nonbulky Hodgkin's lymphoma to treatment with doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD) alone or to treatment with subtotal nodal radiation therapy, with or without ABVD therapy.Patients in the ABVD-only group, both those with a favorable risk profile and those with an unfavorable risk profile, received four to six cycles of ABVD.Among those assigned to subtotal nodal radiation therapy, patients who had a favorable risk profile received subtotal nodal radiation therapy alone and patients with an unfavorable risk profile received two cycles of ABVD plus subtotal nodal radiation therapy.The primary end point was 12-year overall survival.RESULTS: The median length of follow-up was 11.3 years.At 12 years, the rate of overall survival was 94% among those receiving ABVD alone, as compared with 87% among those receiving subtotal nodal radiation therapy (hazard ratio for death with ABVD alone, 0.50; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.25 to 0.99; P=0.04); the rates of freedom from disease progression were 87% and 92% in the two groups, respectively (hazard ratio for disease progression, 1.91; 95% CI, 0.99 to 3.69; P=0.05); and the rates of event-free survival were 85% and 80%, respectively (hazard ratio for event, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.54 to 1.43; P=0.60).Among the patients randomly assigned to ABVD alone, 6 patients died from Hodgkin's lymphoma or an early treatment complication and 6 died from another cause; among those receiving radiation therapy, 4 deaths were related to Hodgkin's lymphoma or early toxic effects from the treatment and 20 were related to another cause.CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma, ABVD therapy alone, as compared with treatment that included subtotal nodal radiation therapy, was associated with a higher rate of overall survival owing to a lower rate of death from other causes.(Funded by the Canadian Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute; HD.6 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00002561.).",1,1,1,1
24613543,"Nimotuzumab provides survival benefit to patients with inoperable advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck: a randomized, open-label, phase IIb, 5-year study in Indian patients.OBJECTIVE: Overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in many cancers makes it an attractive therapeutic target.This study evaluated the clinical utility of nimotuzumab, a monoclonal anti-EGFR antibody, used concurrently with radiotherapy (RT) and chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN).METHODS: This open-label study randomized 92 treatment-naive patients (1:1) with advanced SCCHN into chemoradiation (CRT +/- nimotuzumab) or radiation (RT +/- nimotuzumab) group by investigator's discretion; these were further randomized into CRT + nimotuzumab or CRT and RT + nimotuzumab or RT groups, respectively.Treatment included 6 cycles each of cisplatin (50 mg/week), nimotuzumab (200 mg/week), and RT (total dose, 60-66 Gy).Response (tumor size reduction) was assessed at Month 6 post-treatment and survival, at Month 60.RESULTS: Forty and 36 patients in the chemoradiation and radiation groups, respectively (intent-to-treat population) were evaluated.Overall response at Month 6 post-treatment was 100% with CRT + nimotuzumab, 70% with CRT, 76% with RT + nimotuzumab, and 37% with RT.At Month 60, overall survival was 57% with CRT + nimotuzumab, 26% with CRT (P = 0.03), 39% with RT + nimotuzumab, and 26% with RT (P > 0.05).Median overall survival was not reached for CRT + nimotuzumab; it was 21.94 months for CRT (P = 0.0078), 14.36 months for RT + nimotuzumab, and 12.78 months for RT (P = 0.45).Risk of death was 64% lower with CRT + nimotuzumab than with CRT (95%CI: 0.37, 1.56), and 24% lower with RT + nimotuzumab than with RT (95%CI: 0.16, 0.79).Thus nimotuzumab was safe and well tolerated with few mild to moderate self-limiting adverse events.CONCLUSION: Concurrent use of nimotuzumab with CRT/RT is safe and provides long-term survival benefit.",1,1,1,0
28341958,"Randomized phase II study comparing weekly docetaxel-cisplatin vs. gemcitabine-cisplatin in elderly or poor performance status patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.BACKGROUND: Docetaxel/cisplatin (DP) and gemcitabine/cisplatin (GP) are standard treatment regimens for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).In spite of potent efficacy, the conventional 1-day DP is regarded as having more toxicity as compared with GP.There is increasing interest in a biweekly split administration of DP to reduce its toxicity.Hypothesis was that first-line biweekly DP is as safe as GP in the elderly or poor performance status (PS) patients.METHODS: Chemotherapy-naive patients with advanced NSCLC (IIIB/IV) who were elderly (65<) or PS (ECOG 2) were randomized to DP or GP arm by balancing for ECOG (0-1 vs. 2) and stage (IIIB vs. IV).DP comprised docetaxel (35 mg/m(2))/cisplatin (30 mg/m(2)) iv on days 1 and 8, every 3 weeks.GP comprised gemcitabine (1000 mg/m(2))/cisplatin (30 mg/m(2)) iv on days 1 and 8, every 3 weeks.Chemotherapy lasted up to 4-6 cycles or until progression.Primary endpoint was safety (proportion of grade 3/4 toxicities).Planned sample size was 49 patients in each arm.RESULTS: From November 2009 to August 2012, a total of 99 patients were randomized (DP 50/GP 49) from nine institutions.Adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma were observed in 62% and 33% of patients, respectively.Toxicity profiles were comparable for both arms and the differences were not statistically significant except for anemia and leucocytopenia.Any grade of anemia (86 vs. 98%) and of leucocytopenia (18 vs. 43%) was more common in the GP arm with statistical significance.Oral mucositis tended to be predominant in the DP arm.Patients in the DP arm (51%) suffered grade 3 or higher toxicities as did 47% in the GP arm (47%).The most common grade 3 or higher toxicities were as follows: In the DP arm, neutropenia (8%), leucopenia (8%), anemia (4%), pneumonia with normal ANC (4%) and febrile neutropenia (2%) were observed.In the GP arm, anemia (15%), neutropenia (15%), pneumonia with normal ANC (4%), thrombocytopenia (4%) and leucopenia (2%) were observed.The best overall response rates (CR + PR) for the DP and GP arms were 20.0 and 21% with no CR, respectively, and disease control rates (CR + PR + SD) were 70.0 and 76%, respectively.Median progression-free survival and median overall survival were 3.7 and 14.9 months in the DP arm and 5.6 and 20.8 months in the GP arm, respectively.CONCLUSION: This study showed that DP is similar to GP in terms of efficacy and toxicity in treatment of elderly or poor performance patients.Both regimens showed similar grade 3/4 toxicities with different profiles.",1,1,1,0
24076063,"Neoadjuvant treatment of endometrial cancer using anastrozole: a randomised pilot study.OBJECTIVE: Excessive oestrogenic stimulation is a well-known risk factor for the development and progression of endometrial cancer.Aromatase is the key enzyme which catalyses the conversion of androgens to oestrogens in postmenopausal women.Inhibition of aromatase may therefore be a useful strategy in the management of endometrial cancer.A pilot study was designed to assess the feasibility of a neoadjuvant model and understand the biological effects of anastrozole, an aromatase inhibitor, in the treatment of endometrial cancer.METHODS: Patients with endometrial cancer who consented to participate in the study were randomised to receive anastrozole or placebo for a minimum of 14 days prior to definitive surgery.Endometrial samples were obtained before and after treatment.Immunohistochemistry was performed to ascertain the expression of oestrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha), progesterone receptor (PR), androgen receptor (AR), ki-67 and Bcl2 before and after treatment in glands and stroma of the endometrium.RESULTS: A total of 16 patients were randomised to the anastrozole arm and 8 to the placebo arm (2:1 randomisation).A significant decrease in the glandular expression of ERalpha and AR was observed in the anastrozole arm.There was no significant change in the expression of PR or Bcl2.Expression of ki-67, a proliferation marker, also decreased significantly following treatment with anastrozole.CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with anastrozole caused a significant decrease in proliferation as demonstrated by decreased ki-67 expression.A large randomised controlled trial is warranted to fully assess the role of anastrozole in the neoadjuvant treatment of endometrial cancer.",1,1,1,1
23045542,"Patient navigation for breast and colorectal cancer treatment: a randomized trial.BACKGROUND: There is limited high-quality evidence about the impact of patient navigation (PN) on outcomes for patients with diagnosed cancer.METHODS: We pooled data from two sites from the national Patient Navigation Research Program.Patients (n = 438) with newly diagnosed breast (n = 353) or colorectal cancer (n = 85) were randomized to PN or usual care.Trained lay navigators met with patients randomized to PN to help them assess treatment barriers and identify resources to overcome barriers.We used intent-to-treat analysis to assess time to completion of primary treatment, psychologic distress (impact of events scale), and satisfaction (patient satisfaction with cancer-related care) within 3 months after initiation of cancer treatment.RESULTS: The sample was predominantly middle-aged (mean age = 57) and female (90%); 44% were race-ethnic minorities (44%), 46% reported lower education levels, 18% were uninsured, and 9% reported a non-English primary language.The randomized groups were comparable in baseline characteristics.Primary analysis showed no statistically significant group differences in time to completion of primary cancer treatment, satisfaction with cancer-related care, or psychologic distress.Subgroup analysis showed that socially disadvantaged patients (i.e., uninsured, low English proficiency, and non-English primary language) who received PN reported higher satisfaction than those receiving usual care (all P < 0.05).Navigated patients living alone reported greater distress than those receiving usual care.CONCLUSIONS: Although the primary analysis showed no overall benefit, the subgroup analysis suggests that PN may improve satisfaction with care for certain disadvantaged individuals.IMPACT: PN for cancer patients may not necessarily reduce treatment time nor distress.",0,0,0,0

23650416,"Randomized phase II, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of exemestane with or without entinostat in postmenopausal women with locally recurrent or metastatic estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer progressing on treatment with a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor.PURPOSE: Entinostat is an oral isoform selective histone deacetylase inhibitor that targets resistance to hormonal therapies in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer.This randomized, placebo-controlled, phase II study evaluated entinostat combined with the aromatase inhibitor exemestane versus exemestane alone.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Postmenopausal women with ER+ advanced breast cancer progressing on a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor were randomly assigned to exemestane 25 mg daily plus entinostat 5 mg once per week (EE) or exemestane plus placebo (EP).The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS).Blood was collected in a subset of patients for evaluation of protein lysine acetylation as a biomarker of entinostat activity.RESULTS: One hundred thirty patients were randomly assigned (EE group, n = 64; EP group, n = 66).Based on intent-to-treat analysis, treatment with EE improved median PFS to 4.3 months versus 2.3 months with EP (hazard ratio [HR], 0.73; 95% CI, 0.50 to 1.07; one-sided P = .055; two-sided P = .11 [predefined significance level of .10, one-sided]).Median overall survival was an exploratory end point and improved to 28.1 months with EE versus 19.8 months with EP (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.97; P = .036).Fatigue and neutropenia were the most frequent grade 3/4 toxicities.Treatment discontinuation because of adverse events was higher in the EE group versus the EP group (11% v 2%).Protein lysine hyperacetylation in the EE biomarker subset was associated with prolonged PFS.CONCLUSION: Entinostat added to exemestane is generally well tolerated and demonstrated activity in patients with ER+ advanced breast cancer in this signal-finding phase II study.Acetylation changes may provide an opportunity to maximize clinical benefit with entinostat.Plans for a confirmatory study are underway.",1,1,1,1
27498129,"Toxicity of dual HER2-blockade with pertuzumab added to anthracycline versus non-anthracycline containing chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment in HER2-positive breast cancer: The TRAIN-2 study.BACKGROUND: The addition of pertuzumab to neoadjuvant trastuzumab-based chemotherapy improves pathologic complete response rates in HER2-positive breast cancer.However, increased toxicity has been reported with the addition of pertuzumab, and this may differ between various chemotherapy backbone regimens.We evaluated toxicities of pertuzumab when added to either FEC-T (5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide, trastuzumab) or weekly paclitaxel, trastuzumab, carboplatin (PTC).METHODS: The TRAIN-2 study is a neoadjuvant randomized controlled trial in stage II and III HER2-positive breast cancer (NCT01996267).Patients are randomly assigned to receive either three cycles of FEC-T plus pertuzumab or three cycles of PTC plus pertuzumab, followed by six cycles of PTC plus pertuzumab in both arms.Toxicities are described per treatment arm according to the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03.RESULTS: This analysis includes 110 patients balanced over both treatment arms.Neutropenia was the most common hematologic toxicity, with grade 3-4 occurring in 53% in the FEC-T-arm and in 51% in the PTC-arm.Febrile neutropenia occurred in 9% in the FEC-T arm and did not occur in the PTC-arm.Secondary G-CSF prophylaxis was used in 35-40% of patients.Asymptomatic ejection fraction decrease grade 2 was observed in 24% in the FEC-T-arm and 11% in the PTC-arm.The most common grade 3-4 non-hematologic toxicity was diarrhea (5% in the FEC-T-arm and 18% in the PTC-arm).CONCLUSIONS: Pertuzumab in combination with FEC-T mostly causes neutropenia, and when added to PTC mostly causes diarrhea.Significant cardiac toxicity is rare with both regimens, and toxicity is overall well manageable.",1,1,1,1
23981402,"Self-reported use of complementary and alternative medicine therapies in a reflexology randomized clinical trial.BACKGROUND: According to the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), about one-third of American cancer patients have used complementary and alternative medicine (CAM).OBJECTIVE: The objective of this secondary analysis was an assessment of the use of other CAM by women with advanced breast cancer who were undergoing chemotherapy and who participated in a randomized clinical trial (RCT) studying the safety and efficacy of reflexology.For this secondary analysis, the research team hypothesized an increased CAM use due to exposure to the reflexology trial.METHODS/DESIGN: For this secondary analysis, the team conducted telephone interviews at baseline, wk 5, and wk 11 to assess the use of 23 common CAM therapies.SETTING: The study took place at 14 medical oncology clinics across the Midwestern United States.PARTICIPANTS: Participants included women with advanced breast cancer who were undergoing chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy.INTERVENTION: In the study related to this secondary analysis, the research team randomly assigned the women to one of three primary groups: (1) reflexology; (2) lay foot manipulation (LFM); and (3) control.In addition, the research team used two test groups to establish the study's protocol: (1) test reflexology and (2) test LFM.For this secondary analysis, the research team considered the two reflexology groups (test and intervention) and the two LFM groups (test and intervention) to be the active groups, comparing their use of CAM to the control group's use at the selected time points.PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The research team used a linear, mixed-effects model to analyze the number of therapies used at the three time points.The team performed t tests to compare therapy use at baseline for those women who completed the study vs those who dropped out.The team used the CAM-use instrument.RESULTS: In total, 385 women participated.The research team found no differences in CAM use for the active groups vs the control group over time or in those women who stayed in the study vs those who dropped out.The team found an increase in CAM use at wk 5 compared to baseline, followed by a decrease at wk 11; however, the time trends were the same in the active groups and the control group CONCLUSIONS: In women with advanced breast cancer, researchers can rely upon one assessment of CAM use during an RCT of a CAM therapy.",0,0,0,0
25556937,"Opportunistic testing versus organized prostate-specific antigen screening: outcome after 18 years in the Goteborg randomized population-based prostate cancer screening trial.BACKGROUND: It has been shown that organized screening decreases prostate cancer (PC) mortality, but the effect of opportunistic screening is largely unknown.OBJECTIVE: To compare the ability to reduce PC mortality and the risk of overdiagnosis between organized and opportunistic screening.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Goteborg screening study invited 10 000 randomly selected men for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing every 2 yr since 1995, with a prostate biopsy recommended for men with PSA >/=2.5 ng/ml.The control group of 10 000 men not invited has been exposed to a previously reported increased rate of opportunistic PSA testing.Both groups were followed until December 31, 2012.OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Observed cumulative PC incidence and mortality rates in both groups were calculated using the actuarial method.Using historical data from 1990-1994 (pre-PSA era), we calculated expected PC incidence and mortality rates in the absence of any PSA testing.The number needed to invite (NNI) and the number needed to diagnose (NND) were calculated by comparing the expected versus observed incidence and mortality rates.RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: At 18 yr, 1396 men were diagnosed with PC and 79 men died of PC in the screening group, compared to 962 and 122, respectively, in the control group.In the screening group, the observed cumulative PC incidence/mortality was 16%/0.98% compared to expected values of 6.8%/1.7%.The corresponding values for the control group were 11%/1.5% and 6.9%/1.7%.Organized screening was associated with an absolute PC-specific mortality reduction of 0.72% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.50-0.94%) and relative risk reduction of 42% (95% CI 28-54%).There was an absolute reduction in PC deaths of 0.20% (95% CI -0.06% to 0.47%) and a relative risk reduction of 12% (95% CI -5 to 26%) associated with opportunistic PSA testing.NNI and NND were 139 (95% CI 107-200) and 13 for organized biennial screening and 493 (95% CI 213- -1563) and 23 for opportunistic screening.The extent of opportunistic screening could not be measured; incidence trends were used as a proxy.CONCLUSIONS: Organized screening reduces PC mortality but is associated with overdiagnosis.Opportunistic PSA testing had little if any effect on PC mortality and resulted in more overdiagnosis, with almost twice the number of men needed to be diagnosed to save one man from dying from PC compared to men offered an organized biennial screening program.PATIENT SUMMARY: Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening within the framework of an organized program seems more effective than unorganized screening.",0,0,0,0

24948586,"High-dose chemotherapy plus autologous stem-cell transplantation as consolidation therapy in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma after previous autologous stem-cell transplantation (NCRI Myeloma X Relapse [Intensive trial]): a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Relapsed multiple myeloma has no standard treatment, and the role of autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) has not been fully defined.We aimed to compare high-dose melphalan plus salvage ASCT with cyclophosphamide in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma who had previously undergone ASCT.METHODS: This multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3 study recruited patients aged at least 18 years with multiple myeloma who needed treatment for first progressive or relapsed disease at least 18 months after a previous ASCT from 51 centres across the UK.Before randomisation, eligible patients received bortezomib, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone (PAD) induction therapy and then underwent peripheral blood stem-cell mobilisation and harvesting if applicable.Eligible patients (with adequate stem-cell harvest) were randomly assigned (1:1), using an automated telephone randomisation line, to either high-dose melphalan 200 mg/m(2) plus salvage ASCT or oral cyclophosphamide (400mg/m(2) per week for 12 weeks).Randomisation was stratified by length of first remission or plateau and response to PAD re-induction therapy.The primary endpoint was time to disease progression, analysed by intention to treat.This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00747877, and EudraCT, number 2006-005890-24.FINDINGS: Between April 16, 2008, and Nov 19, 2012, 297 patients were registered, of whom 293 received PAD re-induction therapy.Between Aug 26, 2008, and Nov 16, 2012, 174 patients with sufficient PBSCs were randomised to salvage ASCT (n=89) or cyclophosphamide (n=85).After a median follow-up of 31 months (IQR 19-42), median time to progression was significantly longer in the salvage ASCT than in the cyclophosphamide group (19 months [95% CI 16-25] vs 11 months [9-12]; hazard ratio 0.36 [95% CI 0.25-0.53]; p<0.0001).Frequently reported (in >10% of patients) grade 3-4 adverse events with PAD induction, salvage ASCT, and cyclophosphamide were: neutropenia (125 [43%] of 293 patients after PAD, and 63 [76%] of 83 patients in the salvage ASCT group vs 11 [13%] of 84 patients in the cyclophosphamide group), thrombocytopenia (150 [51%] after PAD, and 60 [72%] vs four [5%], respectively), and peripheral neuropathy (35 [12%] after PAD, and none vs none, respectively).INTERPRETATION: This study provides evidence for the improved efficacy of high-dose melphalan plus salvage ASCT when compared with cyclophosphamide in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma eligible for intensive therapy, which might help to guide clinical decisions regarding the management of such patients.FUNDING: Cancer Research UK.",0,0,0,0
23355041,"A randomized phase II study of gemcitabine and S-1 combination therapy versus gemcitabine monotherapy for advanced biliary tract cancer.PURPOSE: In order to confirm the impact of adding S-1 to gemcitabine, we conducted a randomized phase II study to compare the combination therapy of gemcitabine plus S-1 to gemcitabine monotherapy in patients with advanced biliary tract cancer.METHODS: Sixty-two patients with advanced cholangiocarcinoma or gallbladder cancer were randomized to either the combination therapy of gemcitabine and S-1 (gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 15 and S-1 40 mg/m(2) b.i.d.on days 1-14, repeated every 4 weeks) or gemcitabine monotherapy (gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m(2) on days 1, 8, and 15, repeated every 4 weeks).The primary endpoint of this study was response rate, and the regimen which showed the better response rate was selected as a candidate of phase III study.Tumor response was assessed every two cycles using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria version 1.0.RESULTS: The response rates of the combination therapy and the monotherapy were 20.0 and 9.4 %, respectively.The median time-to-progressions and overall survivals of these two treatments were nearly the same (5.6 vs. 4.3 months; 8.9 vs. 9.2 months).Adverse events occurred more frequently in the combination arm.CONCLUSIONS: The combination therapy of gemcitabine and S-1 showed the better response rate, but the superiority of this combination therapy was not clear in total.Because the standard of care changed to the combination therapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin during this study, it is difficult to select this combination therapy with a 4-week regimen as a candidate of phase III study.",1,1,1,1
25547902,"Intercalated Dosing Schedule of Erlotinib and Docetaxel as a Therapeutic Strategy to Avoid Antagonism and Optimize Its Benefits in Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer. A Randomized Phase II Clinical Trial.INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to assess whether an intercalated dosing schedule of erlotinib and docetaxel could avoid possible negative interactions and optimize the benefit obtained as second-line therapy in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A phase II randomized clinical trial was designed for advanced NSCLC patients in whom previous chemotherapy treatment had failed.The experimental arm with 33 patients consisted of erlotinib 150 mg/d orally, intermittent administration on days 2 to 16 every 21 days, combined with docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) every 21 days; the control arm with 35 patients consisted of erlotinib 150 mg/d orally, administered continuously.The study's primary end point was the proportion of patients who remained progression-free at 6 months in the 2 arms.RESULTS: The proportion of patients who remained progression-free at 6 months was of 5 patients (15%) in the intercalated arm and 3 patients (9%) in the erlotinib monotherapy arm respectively.Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 3.0 versus 2.1 months (hazard ratio [HR], 0.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.39-1.06; P = .086).Median overall survival (OS) was 7.5 and 5.2 months (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.41-1.19; P = .19).Disease control rates were 51.7% and 36.4%, respectively.No new safety signals were observed.CONCLUSION: Erlotinib and docetaxel with intermittent administration of erlotinib improved PFS, OS, and disease control rates compared with erlotinib alone.All of our results indicated that an intercalated dosing schedule of erlotinib and docetaxel could be more efficient than erlotinib treatment alone.Therefore, further studies should be developed in a larger number of patients.This study has shown the absence of antagonism between docetaxel and erlotinib when given in an intercalated fashion.",0,0,0,0
23234763,"Adjuvant lapatinib for women with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer: a randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Worldwide, many patients with HER2-positive early stage breast cancer do not receive trastuzumab-the standard adjuvant treatment.We investigated the efficacy and safety of adjuvant lapatinib for patients with trastuzumab-naive HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer, started at any time after diagnosis.METHODS: This study was a placebo-controlled, multicentre, randomised phase 3 trial.Women outpatients from 405 [corrected] centres in 33 countries [corrected] with HER2-positive early-breast cancer who had previously received adjuvant chemotherapy but not trastuzumab were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive daily lapatinib (1500 mg) or daily placebo for 12 months.Randomisation was done with a computer-generated sequence, stratified by time since diagnosis, lymph node involvement at diagnosis, and tumour hormone-receptor status.Investigators, site staff, and patients were masked to treatment assignment.The primary endpoint was disease-free survival in the intention-to-treat population.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00374322.FINDINGS: Between August, 2006, and May, 2008, 3161 women were enrolled and 3147 were assigned to lapatinib (n=1571) or placebo (n=1576).After a median follow-up of 47.4 months (range 0.4-60.0) in the lapatinib group and 48.3 (0.7-61.3) in the placebo group, 210 (13%) disease-free survival events had occurred in the lapatinib group versus 264 (17%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.83, 95% CI 0.70-1.00; p=0.053).Central review of HER2 status showed that only 2490 (79%) of the randomised women were HER2-positive.157 (13%) of 1230 confirmed HER2-positive patients in the lapatinib group and in 208 (17%) of 1260 in the placebo group had a disease-free survival event (HR 0.82, 95% 0.67-1.00; p=0.04).Serious adverse events occurred in 99 (6%) of 1573 patients taking lapatinib and 77 (5%) of 1574 patients taking placebo, with higher incidences of grade 3-4 diarrhoea (97 [6%] vs nine [<1%]), rash (72 [5%] vs three [<1%]), and hepatobiliary disorders (36 [2%] vs one [<1%]).INTERPRETATION: Our data show that there was no significant difference in disease-free survival between groups when analysed in the intention-to-treat population.However, exploratory analyses restricted to patients who had HER2-positive disease confirmed by central fluorescence in-situ hybridisation review suggested marginal benefit with lapatinib in terms of disease-free survival.Thus lapatinib might be an option for women with HER2-positive breast cancer who do not or cannot receive adjuvant trastuzumab.FUNDING: GlaxoSmithKline.",1,1,1,1
23225450,"Prognostic value of serum CA9 in patients with metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma under targeted therapy.AIM: Carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9) has been found to be one of most powerful biomarkers for clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC).The serum CA9 is detectable.The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential prognostic role of serum CA9 in patients with metastatic clear-cell RCC patients under targeted therapy.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Serum samples came from the randomized phase 2 TORAVA trial.All patients received a targeted therapy (arm A designed as experimental group: temsirolimus and bevacizumab combination; arm B: sunitinib; arm C: interferon-alfa and bevacizumab).Seventy cases of metastatic clear-cell RCC were analyzed.There were 49 males and 21 females.The age ranged from 33.5 to 79.1 years with a median of 61.2 years.Serum samples were collected before treatment.Serum CA9 was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).The correlation of the serum CA9 levels with the clinical parameters, treatment response and overall survival was analyzed.Overall survival estimates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by the log-rank test.RESULTS: Serum concentrations of CA9 ranged between 0 and 897.3 pg/ml, with an average of 94.4+/-176.6 pg/ml.There was no association between serum CA9 and clinical parameters such as Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (p=0.367) or Motzer classification (p=0.431).The serum CA9 levels were lower in the response group (64.7+/-104.7 pg/ml) than the no-response group (108.2+/-203.8 pg/ml), but the difference was not statisticlly significant (p=0.366).For the patient group overall, the Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed that high serum CA9 levels were significantly associated with shorter overall survival (hazard ratio=2.65, 95% confidence interval=1.19-5.92, log-rank test p=0.0136).For the major group of patients treated with temsirolimus and bevacizumab, the Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed that high serum CA9 levels were significantly associated with shorter overall survival (p=0.0006).CONCLUSION: Serum CA9 levels may be of clinical interest to predict the outcome for patients under targeted therapy for metastatic clear-cell RCC.CA9 may be used to select patients with metastatic clear cell RCC for clinical trials.",0,0,0,0

24573743,"A phase II open-label randomized multicenter trial of TSU-68 in combination with S-1 and oxaliplatin versus S-1 in combination with oxaliplatin in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide.The combination of oxaliplatin-based treatments (oxaliplatin plus infusional 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin [FOLFOX] or oxaliplatin plus capecitabine [CapeOX]) and bevacizumab is a standard chemotherapy regimen for metastatic CRC (mCRC).However, several clinical studies that tested S-1 plus oxaliplatin (SOX) indicate that SOX is also a treatment option for mCRC.TSU-68 is an oral compound that inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptor and platelet-derived growth factor receptor.The recommended dose of TSU-68 + SOX was previously determined in a phase I study of mCRC patients.The goal of this trial was to evaluate the efficacy of TSU-68 in combination with SOX.METHODS: This open-label multicenter randomized phase II trial was performed in Korea.Treatment-naive mCRC patients with a performance status of 0 or 1 were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either TSU-68 + SOX or SOX alone.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS).RESULTS: A total of 105 patients (TSU-68 + SOX, 52 patients; SOX alone, 53 patients) were randomized.The median PFS was 7.0 months in the TSU-68 + SOX group (hazard ratio [HR], 1.057) and 7.2 months in the SOX group (p = 0.8401).The most frequent grade 3 and 4 adverse events were thrombocytopenia (9.6 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 26.4 % [SOX]), neutropenia (13.5 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 15.1 % [SOX]), and anemia (3.8 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 13.2 % [SOX]).We observed a difference between the 2 groups for all grades of anemia (15.4 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 32.1 % [SOX]), diarrhea (30.8 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 47.2 % [SOX]), vomiting (50.0 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 26.4 % [SOX]), and chromaturia (23.1 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 0.0 % [SOX]).Analysis using a Cox proportional hazard model showed that baseline interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels were associated with a survival benefit of TSU-68 (p = 0.012).CONCLUSION: TSU-68 + SOX had a favorable safety profile.However, TSU-68 did not have a synergistic effect on the efficacy of SOX.The baseline serum IL-6 level could be a prognostic factor for TSU-68 efficacy.",1,1,1,1
24650009,"Sotatercept in patients with osteolytic lesions of multiple myeloma.This phase IIa study evaluated the safety and tolerability of sotatercept, and its effects on bone metabolism and haematopoiesis in newly diagnosed and relapsed multiple myeloma (MM) patients.Patients were randomized (4:1) to receive four 28-d cycles of sotatercept (0.1, 0.3, or 0.5 mg/kg) or placebo.Patients also received six cycles of combination oral melphalan, prednisolone, and thalidomide (MPT).Thirty patients were enrolled; six received placebo and 24 received sotatercept.Overall, 25% of patients received all four sotatercept doses; 71% of sotatercept-treated patients had >/=1 dose interruption mainly due to increases in haemoglobin levels.Grade >/=3 adverse events (AEs) were reported in 17% of patients receiving placebo and 58% receiving sotatercept.Grade 4 AEs in sotatercept-treated patients were neutropenia, granulocytopenia, and atrial fibrillation (one patient each).In patients without bisphosphonate use, anabolic improvements in bone mineral density and in bone formation relative to placebo occurred, whereas bone resorption was minimally affected.Increases in haemoglobin levels, versus baseline, and the duration of the increases, were higher in the sotatercept-treated patients, with a trend suggesting a dose-related effect.Multiple doses of sotatercept plus MPT appear to be safe and generally well-tolerated in MM patients.",0,0,0,0
26054688,"Prolonged adjuvant capecitabine chemotherapy improved survival of stage IIIA gastric cancer after D2 gastrectomy.GOALS: This study aims to investigate the safety and efficacy of prolonged adjuvant capecitabine chemotherapy on survival of gastric cancer after D2 gastrectomy.BACKGROUND: Inadequate evidence is available on optimal duration of chemotherapy and the number of administered cycles is generally based on patient responsiveness and individual tolerability as well as physician preferences.STUDY: We randomly assigned 307 gastric cancer patients after D2 gastrectomy between January 2006 and December 2010 to XELOX group and Prolonged group.XELOX consisted of a 2-h intravenous infusion of oxaliplatin 130mg/mg on day 1 and oral capecitabine 1000mg/m(2) twice daily on days 1-14 of a 3-week cycle for eight cycles in half a year.In Prolonged group, patients underwent extra oral capecitabine 1000mg/m(2) twice daily on days 1-14 of a 3-week cycle for eight cycles after eight cycles of XELOX.The disease-free survival and overall survival were compared.RESULTS: Significant differences were found in 3-year disease-free survival (Prolonged group 56.6%, XELOX group 48.4%, P=0.0357).Subgroup analysis by TNM staging showed that patients with stage IIIA gastric cancer in the Prolonged group had significantly higher DFS (50.00% vs 40.96, P=0.0178) and OS (71.95% vs 57.83, P=0.0230) than that of patients in the XELOX group.No grade 4 adverse effects or treatment-related deaths were reported.More patients in the Prolonged group experienced hand-foot syndrome than in the XELOX group.CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged capecitabine chemotherapy prevents improves the prognosis of patients with stage IIIA gastric cancer after D2 gastrectomy.",1,1,1,1
23442174,"Monitoring laparoscopic radiofrequency renal lesions in real time using contrast-enhanced ultrasonography: an open-label, randomized, comparative pilot trial.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has been considered as an important therapy for small renal lesions.The main limitation of RFA, however, is the lack of pathologic confirmation of complete tumor eradication.A single center, open label, randomized pilot study was designed to evaluate whether contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) with Sonovue, performed in real time could allow us to determine the end point during laparoscopic radiofrequency ablation (LRFA) and the clinical outcome of this method.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ninety-six patients undergoing LRFA were randomly assigned to CEUS or a control group; finally, 38 and 40 patients with a pathologic diagnosis of renal-cell carcinoma completed a 3-month follow-up.CEUS was conducted in real time during the procedure to determine the end point in the CEUS group.The primary outcome was the incomplete ablation rate according to a radiographic image at 3 months after the procedure.The secondary outcome included the local tumor control rate and disease-free survival rate.RESULTS: There were no differences in the incomplete ablation rate and disease-free survival rate between the two groups.Within a median 16-month follow-up period, three incomplete ablations and two local recurrences according to a radiographic image were found in the control group.Meanwhile, there was no incomplete ablation or recurrence but one lung metastasis in the CEUS group.The local tumor control rate was 87.5% (35/40) in the control group vs 100% (38/38) (P=0.073) in the CEUS group.CONCLUSION: In patients undergoing LRFA, there were no differences in the incomplete ablation rate and local tumor control rate between the CEUS group and the control group in our study despite a nonsignificant trend in favor of CEUS.CEUS may have the potential to provide more effective renal tumor ablation.These novel data support the need for a larger study of CEUS during LRFA surgery.",0,0,0,0
26202595,"Randomized phase II study evaluating veliparib (ABT-888) with temozolomide in patients with metastatic melanoma.BACKGROUND: Veliparib (ABT-888) is a potent, orally bioavailable, small-molecule inhibitor of the DNA repair enzymes poly ADP-ribose polymerase-1 and -2.Veliparib enhances the efficacy of temozolomide (TMZ) and other cytotoxic agents in preclinical tumor models.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this multicenter, double-blind trial, adults with unresectable stage III or IV metastatic melanoma were randomized 1:1:1 to TMZ plus veliparib 20 or 40 mg, or placebo twice daily.Efficacy end points included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and objective response rate (ORR).RESULTS: Patients (N = 346) were randomized between February 2009 and January 2010.Median [95% confidence interval (CI)] PFS was 3.7 (3.0-5.5), 3.6 (1.9-4.1), and 2 (1.9-3.7) months in the 20-mg, 40-mg, and placebo arms, respectively.Median (95% CI) OS was 10.8 (9.0-13.1), 13.6 (11.4-15.9), and 12.9 (9.8-14.3) months, respectively; ORR was 10.3%, 8.7%, and 7.0%.Exploratory analyses showed patients with low ERCC1 expression had longer PFS when TMZ was combined with veliparib.Toxicities were as expected for TMZ.The frequencies of thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and leukopenia were significantly increased in the veliparib groups.Grade 3 or 4 adverse events, mainly hematologic toxicities, were seen in 55%, 63%, and 41% of patients in the 20-mg, 40-mg, and placebo arms, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Median PFS with 20 and 40 mg veliparib almost doubled numerically compared with placebo, but the improvements did not reach statistical significance.OS was not increased with veliparib.Toxicities were similar to TMZ monotherapy, but with increased frequency.",1,1,1,1
27557302,"Daratumumab, Bortezomib, and Dexamethasone for Multiple Myeloma.BACKGROUND: Daratumumab, a human IgGkappa monoclonal antibody that targets CD38, induces direct and indirect antimyeloma activity and has shown substantial efficacy as monotherapy in heavily pretreated patients with multiple myeloma, as well as in combination with bortezomib in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.METHODS: In this phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 498 patients with relapsed or relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma to receive bortezomib (1.3 mg per square meter of body-surface area) and dexamethasone (20 mg) alone (control group) or in combination with daratumumab (16 mg per kilogram of body weight) (daratumumab group).The primary end point was progression-free survival.RESULTS: A prespecified interim analysis showed that the rate of progression-free survival was significantly higher in the daratumumab group than in the control group; the 12-month rate of progression-free survival was 60.7% in the daratumumab group versus 26.9% in the control group.After a median follow-up period of 7.4 months, the median progression-free survival was not reached in the daratumumab group and was 7.2 months in the control group (hazard ratio for progression or death with daratumumab vs. control, 0.39; 95% confidence interval, 0.28 to 0.53; P<0.001).The rate of overall response was higher in the daratumumab group than in the control group (82.9% vs. 63.2%, P<0.001), as were the rates of very good partial response or better (59.2% vs. 29.1%, P<0.001) and complete response or better (19.2% vs. 9.0%, P=0.001).Three of the most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events reported in the daratumumab group and the control group were thrombocytopenia (45.3% and 32.9%, respectively), anemia (14.4% and 16.0%, respectively), and neutropenia (12.8% and 4.2%, respectively).Infusion-related reactions that were associated with daratumumab treatment were reported in 45.3% of the patients in the daratumumab group; these reactions were mostly grade 1 or 2 (grade 3 in 8.6% of the patients), and in 98.2% of these patients, they occurred during the first infusion.CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with relapsed or relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, daratumumab in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone resulted in significantly longer progression-free survival than bortezomib and dexamethasone alone and was associated with infusion-related reactions and higher rates of thrombocytopenia and neutropenia than bortezomib and dexamethasone alone.(Funded by Janssen Research and Development; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02136134.).",1,1,1,1

26487588,"Early initiation of chemotherapy following complete resection of advanced ovarian cancer associated with improved survival: NRG Oncology/Gynecologic Oncology Group study.BACKGROUND: To determine whether time from surgery to initiation of chemotherapy impacts survival in advanced ovarian carcinoma.PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a post-trial ad hoc analysis of Gynecologic Oncology Group protocol 218, a phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to study the antiangiogenesis agent, bevacizumab, in primary and maintenance therapy for patients with newly diagnosed advanced ovarian carcinoma.Maximum attempt at debulking was an eligibility criterion.Stage III patients, not stage IV, were required to have gross macroscopic or palpable residual disease following surgery.The survival impact of time from surgery to initiation of chemotherapy was studied using Cox regression models and stratified by treatment arm, residual disease and other clinical and pathologic factors.RESULTS: One thousand seven hundred eighteen assessable patients were randomized (stage III (n = 1237); stage IV (n = 477), including those with complete resection (stage IV only, n = 81), low-volume residual (</=1 cm, n = 701), and suboptimal (>1 cm, n = 932).On multivariate analysis, time to chemotherapy initiation was predictive of overall survival (P < 0.001), with the complete resection group (i.e. stage IV) encountering an increased risk of death when time to initiation of chemotherapy exceeded 25 days (95% confidence interval 16.6-49.9 days).CONCLUSION: Survival for women with advanced ovarian cancer may be adversely affected when initiation of chemotherapy occurs >25 days following surgery.Our analysis applies to stage IV only as women with stage III who underwent complete resection were not eligible for this trial.These results, however, are consistent with Gompertzian first-order kinetics where patients with microscopic residual are most vulnerable.CLINICAL TRIALS IDENTIFIER: NCT00262847.",0,0,0,0
23957945,"Initial biopsy Gleason score as a predictive marker for survival benefit in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with docetaxel: data from the TAX327 study.BACKGROUND: Since 2004, docetaxel has been the standard first-line systemic therapy for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).With abiraterone recently becoming available in the predocetaxel setting, it is warranted to identify subgroups of patients who may obtain the greatest benefit from docetaxel and particularly qualify for receiving docetaxel as first-line treatment for mCRPC.OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify factors that could characterize subgroups of patients who obtain the greatest benefit from the use of docetaxel.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: TAX327 was multinational, randomized, phase 3 study that was conducted from 2000 to 2002 in 1006 men with mCRPC.INTERVENTION: Patients were randomized to receive docetaxel every 3 wk (D3), weekly docetaxel (D1), or mitoxantrone every 3 wk (M3), each with prednisone.OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: We investigated whether patients with poorly differentiated tumors (Gleason score >/=7) at diagnosis had greater benefit from D3 compared with M3 than patients with better differentiated tumors (Gleason score </=6).Using a Cox model, we compared overall survival (OS) between the treatment groups within each subgroup of Gleason score.RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: The TAX 327 data showed that the OS benefit of D3 versus M3 was greater in patients with high-grade tumors (median OS: 18.9 vs 14.5 mo; p=0.009) than in patients with low-grade tumors (median OS: 21.6 vs 20.7 mo; p=0.674).Limitations of a retrospective analysis apply.CONCLUSIONS: The survival benefit obtained with docetaxel is most pronounced in patients with high-Gleason-score tumors (Gleason >/=7).In a time of shifting paradigms in mCRPC, with abiraterone becoming available prior to docetaxel chemotherapy, Gleason score may help in selecting patients who obtain the greatest benefit from docetaxel as first-line treatment for mCRPC.Prospective validation of these findings is warranted.",1,1,1,1
