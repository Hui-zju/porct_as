24148258,"A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 study of tigatuzumab (CS-1008) in combination with carboplatin/paclitaxel in patients with chemotherapy-naive metastatic/unresectable non-small cell lung cancer.INTRODUCTION: Tigatuzumab, a humanized monoclonal DR5 agonist antibody induces apoptosis in human cancer cell lines.The objective of this study was to investigate the antitumor effects of tigatuzumab combined with carboplatin/paclitaxel in chemotherapy-naive patients with metastatic/unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).METHODS: Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed NSCLC stage IIIB/IV disease by RECIST (version 1.0) and ECOG-PS 0-1 were enrolled at 15 European sites.Patients received tigatuzumab or placebo intravenously with carboplatin/paclitaxel every 3 weeks (1 cycle) for up to 6 cycles.The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS).Secondary end points were overall survival (OS), objective response rate and safety.RESULTS: 97 patients were analyzed for efficacy (49 tigatuzumab; 48 placebo).Median PFS (95% CI) was 5.4 months (3.3, 6.6) for tigatuzumab compared with 4.3 months (4.1, 5.8) for placebo.Median OS (95% CI) was 8.4 months (6.9, 16.3) for tigatuzumab versus 9.0 months (7.6, 14.5) for placebo.12 patients (24.5%) in the tigatuzumab arm and 11 patients (22.9%) in the placebo arm had partial response.No patient had complete response.In a prospectively-defined Fc gamma receptor genotype subset (n=25), there was a non-significant trend toward increased PFS with tigatuzumab versus placebo (HR=0.47; 95% CI: 0.16, 1.35) but no difference in OS.Tigatuzumab was well tolerated.However, grade 3/4 neutropenia was reported in 10 patients (20.4%) receiving tigatuzumab compared with 4 patients (8.3%) receiving placebo.CONCLUSIONS: Tigatuzumab was well tolerated but did not improve efficacy of carboplatin/paclitaxel in systemic therapy-naive, unselected advanced NSCLC patients.",0,0,0,0
21844132,"Effect of imatinib therapy with and without turmeric powder on nitric oxide levels in chronic myeloid leukemia.Nitric oxide (NO) is involved in different stages of malignancies.Increased levels of NO have been reported in different leukemias.Imatinib is the preferred drug for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).Turmeric powder contains curcumin which has anti-leukemic property and also decreases NO synthesis.This study was conducted on fifty patients of CML divided into two groups, group A receiving imatinib alone and group B receiving turmeric powder along with imatinib for six weeks.Nitric oxide levels were estimated in these patients before and after receiving therapy and were analyzed statistically.Nitric oxide levels were found to be significantly decreased in both the groups, but more significantly in group B after receiving the respective treatments.Thus, curcumin acts as an adjuvant to imatinib in decreasing the NO levels and may help in the treatment of CML patients.",0,0,0,0
23192279,"A randomized phase II study of biweekly irinotecan monotherapy or a combination of irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin (mFOLFIRI) in patients with metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma refractory to or progressive after first-line chemotherapy.BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of irinotecan (CPT-11) monotherapy and CPT-11 plus 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)/leucovorin (LV) combination (mFOLFIRI) as second-line treatment in patients with advanced gastric cancer (AGC).METHODS: A total of 59 patients were randomly assigned to either CPT-11 (150 mg/m(2) iv on day 1) or mFOLFIRI (CPT-11 150 mg/m(2) plus LV 20 mg/m(2) on day 1 followed by 5-FU 2,000 mg/m(2) over 48 h), every 2 weeks.The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR).RESULTS: Following random assignment, 29 patients received CPT-11 and 30 patients mFOLFIRI.The ORR was 17.2 % [95 % confidence interval (CI) 3.4-30.9] and 20.0 % (95 % CI 5.6-34.3) for the CPT-11 and mFOLFIRI arms, respectively (P = 0.525).There was no significant difference in median progression-free survival: 2.2 months (95 % CI 0.2-4.3) for CPT-11 versus 3.0 months (95 % CI 2.0-3.7) for mFOLFIRI (P = 0.481) or in median overall survival: 5.8 months (95 % CI 3.0-8.7), compared with 6.7 months (95 % CI 5.3-8.2) (P = 0.514).Grade 3/4 toxicity was observed in 21 and 28 events in the CPT-11 and mFOLFIRI arms, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Although this study had a small sample size and limited statistical power, CPT-11 monotherapy and mFOLFIRI appear to be equally active and tolerable as second-line chemotherapy for AGC.The addition of 5-FU/LV to CPT-11 did not significantly improve efficacy.",0,0,0,0
25035205,"Random forests to predict rectal toxicity following prostate cancer radiation therapy.PURPOSE: To propose a random forest normal tissue complication probability (RF-NTCP) model to predict late rectal toxicity following prostate cancer radiation therapy, and to compare its performance to that of classic NTCP models.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Clinical data and dose-volume histograms (DVH) were collected from 261 patients who received 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy for prostate cancer with at least 5 years of follow-up.The series was split 1000 times into training and validation cohorts.A RF was trained to predict the risk of 5-year overall rectal toxicity and bleeding.Parameters of the Lyman-Kutcher-Burman (LKB) model were identified and a logistic regression model was fit.The performance of all the models was assessed by computing the area under the receiving operating characteristic curve (AUC).RESULTS: The 5-year grade >/=2 overall rectal toxicity and grade >/=1 and grade >/=2 rectal bleeding rates were 16%, 25%, and 10%, respectively.Predictive capabilities were obtained using the RF-NTCP model for all 3 toxicity endpoints, including both the training and validation cohorts.The age and use of anticoagulants were found to be predictors of rectal bleeding.The AUC for RF-NTCP ranged from 0.66 to 0.76, depending on the toxicity endpoint.The AUC values for the LKB-NTCP were statistically significantly inferior, ranging from 0.62 to 0.69.CONCLUSIONS: The RF-NTCP model may be a useful new tool in predicting late rectal toxicity, including variables other than DVH, and thus appears as a strong competitor to classic NTCP models.",0,0,0,0
23660628,"Correlation between eight-gene expression profiling and response to therapy of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients treated with thalidomide-dexamethasone incorporated into double autologous transplantation.We performed a molecular study aimed at identifying a gene expression profile (GEP) signature predictive of attainment of at least near complete response (CR) to thalidomide-dexamethasone (TD) as induction regimen in preparation for double autologous stem cell transplantation in 112 younger patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.A GEP supervised analysis was performed on a training set of 32 patients, allowing to identify 157 probe sets differentially expressed in patients with CR versus those failing CR to TD.We then generated an eight-gene GEP signature whose performance was subsequently validated in a training set of 80 patients.A correct prediction of response to TD was found in 71 % of the cases analyzed.The eight genes were downregulated in patients who achieved CR to TD.Comparisons between post-autotransplantation outcomes of the 44 non-CR-predicted patients and of the 36 CR-predicted patients showed that this latter subgroup had a statistically significant benefit in terms of higher rate of CR after autotransplant(s) and longer time to progression, event-free survival, and overall survival.These results can be an important first step to identify at diagnosis those patients who will respond more favourably to a particular treatment strategy.",0,0,0,0
22356596,"Determinants of long-term response to group therapy for dysfunctional fear of progression in chronic diseases.Prior work demonstrated that cognitive-behavioral (CBT) and supportive-experiential (SET) group interventions can reduce dysfunctional fear of progression (FoP) in patients with chronic diseases.In this secondary analysis of a randomized controlled study, we investigated determinants of long-term response to group therapy for FoP. Response to therapy after 12 months was assessed using the Reliable Change Index (RCI).Outcome data were available for 129 patients with cancer and 116 patients with chronic arthritis.37.9% of the patients in the CBT group and 32.7% of those attending the SET group indicated response to therapy (p=.402).Educational level predicted long-term response to therapy (OR 2.53, 95% CI 1.33-4.81; p=.005).Medical patients with lower education may need additional attention in order to gain long-lasting benefit from brief group psychotherapy.However, this investigation needs to be replicated in a study that includes a broader range of psychological predictors.",0,0,0,0
23340351,"A double-blind randomized trial of wound and intercostal space infiltration with ropivacaine during breast cancer surgery: effects on chronic postoperative pain.BACKGROUND: The efficacy of local anesthetic wound infiltration for the treatment of acute and chronic postoperative pain is controversial and there are no detailed studies.The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of ropivacaine wound infiltration on chronic pain after breast surgery.METHODS: In this prospective, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study, 236 patients scheduled for breast cancer surgery were randomized (1:1) to receive ropivacaine or placebo infiltration of the wound, the second and third intercostal spaces and the humeral insertion of major pectoralis.Acute pain, analgesic consumption, nausea and vomiting were assessed every 30 min for 2 h in the postanesthesia care unit and every 6 h for 48 h. Chronic pain was evaluated 3 months, 6 months, and 1 yr after surgery by the brief pain inventory, hospital anxiety and depression, and neuropathic pain questionnaires.RESULTS: Ropivacaine wound infiltration significantly decreased immediate postoperative pain for the first 90 min, but did not decrease chronic pain at 3 months (primary endpoint), or at 6 and 12 months postoperatively.At 3 months, the incidence of chronic pain was 33% and 27% (P = 0.37) in the ropivacaine and placebo groups, respectively.During follow-up, brief pain inventory, neuropathic pain, and anxiety increased over time in both groups (P < 0.001) while depression remained stable.No complications occurred.CONCLUSION: This multicenter, prospective study shows that ropivacaine wound infiltration after breast cancer surgery decreased immediate postoperative pain but did not decrease chronic pain at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively.",0,0,0,0

22157370,"Efficacy and safety of pemetrexed maintenance therapy versus best supportive care in patients from East Asia with advanced, nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer: an exploratory subgroup analysis of a global, randomized, phase 3 clinical trial.INTRODUCTION: In a recent global phase 3 trial, patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), who had not progressed after four cycles of platinum-based induction chemotherapy, were randomized to maintenance therapy with pemetrexed or placebo.The objective of this retrospective, exploratory, post hoc subgroup analysis was to compare outcomes of East Asian patients with non-East Asian patients treated with pemetrexed or placebo.METHODS: Only patients with nonsquamous histology were analyzed.Patients were grouped by enrollment location (East Asian = China, Korea, or Taiwan; non-East Asian = all other countries).The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) times.Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using unadjusted Cox proportional hazard models.RESULTS: Of the 663 patients enrolled in the study, 481 patients had nonsquamous NSCLC: East Asian = 27% and non-East Asian = 73%.In the East Asian subgroup, there were more women, never smokers, and patients with adenocarcinoma.PFS was similar between the subgroups and significantly prolonged in patients treated with pemetrexed than placebo (median PFS: East Asian, 4.4 versus 1.6 months, HR = 0.42, p < 0.001; non-East Asian, 4.5 versus 2.8 months, HR = 0.45, p < 0.001).OS was numerically prolonged in East Asians (median OS: pemetrexed, 19.7 months; placebo, 16.4 months) compared with non-East Asians (pemetrexed, 13.2 months; placebo, 8.5 months).Pemetrexed was reasonably well tolerated with few severe adverse events reported.CONCLUSION: The results of this subgroup analysis support pemetrexed as maintenance therapy for East Asian patients with advanced, nonsquamous NSCLC.",0,0,0,0
24214881,"Vitamin D-binding protein, circulating vitamin D and risk of renal cell carcinoma.Cell culture experiments suggest that vitamin D may inhibit renal carcinogenesis, but human studies of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], the accepted measure of vitamin D status, and kidney cancer have been null.Limited research has examined the role of circulating vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) in the association between 25(OH)D and disease risk, and it is unclear whether free 25(OH)D in circulation is a better measure of effective exposure, or if DBP may independently impact outcomes.We conducted a nested case-control analysis within the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention (ATBC) Study to examine whether circulating DBP concentration was prospectively associated with risk of renal cell carcinoma, and whether it modified the association with 25(OH)D. Renal cell carcinoma cases (n = 262) were matched 1:1 to controls on age (+/-1 year) and date of blood collection (+/- 30 days).We estimated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of renal cell carcinoma risk by quartiles of 25(OH)D, DBP and the molar ratio of 25(OH)D:DBP, a proxy for free circulating 25(OH)D. Men with higher DBP concentrations were at significantly decreased risk of kidney cancer (Q4 vs. Q1: OR = 0.17, 95% CI = 0.08-0.33; p-trend < 0.0001), a finding unchanged by adjustment for 25(OH)D. Although we observed no association with total 25(OH)D, we found slightly increased risk with higher levels of estimated free 25(OH)D [Q4 vs. Q1 of the 25(OH)D:DBP ratio, OR = 1.61, 95% CI = 0.95-2.73; p-trend = 0.09].The strong protective association observed between higher circulating DBP concentration and kidney cancer risk requires replication but suggests a vitamin D-independent influence of DBP.",0,0,0,0

22065199,"Temozolomide plus radiotherapy for glioblastoma in a Canadian province: efficacy versus effectiveness and the impact of O6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase promoter methylation.BACKGROUND: Radiotherapy with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide has been the standard of care for newly diagnosed glioblastoma in adults since the pivotal trial by Roger Stupp and colleagues.The effectiveness of this regimen has not been evaluated in Canada.Additionally, the impact of O6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation on patient survival has not been confirmed.Hence, survival outcomes and MGMT predictive value were compared for the patients in Alberta versus the Stupp trial population.METHODS: Retrospective chart review of 215 adult glioblastoma patients who started radiotherapy and temozolomide between January 2007 and December 2010 at the Cross Cancer Institute (Edmonton, Alberta) or the Tom Baker Cancer Centre (Calgary, Alberta).RESULTS: In the Alberta population, median overall survival was 14.3 months (vs. 14.6 months in trial, p = NS) and median progression-free survival was 5.8 months (vs. 6.9 months in trial, p = NS).However, unlike the trial, the Alberta MGMT subgroup analysis for overall survival was not statistically significant, despite a hazard ratio of 0.65 in favor of the methylated group.More Alberta patients received corticosteroids (p < 0.0001) and fewer underwent complete resection (p = 0.0001) or a postprogression second surgery (p = 0.01) than the Stupp population, but characteristics were otherwise similar.CONCLUSION: Current practice in Alberta enables patients to achieve overall and progression-free survival similar to the clinical trial.Further follow-up is required to confirm the predictive value of the MGMT assay.Until that is clarified or better treatments are developed, it is reasonable to continue offering this treatment regimen to patients regardless of MGMT methylation status.",0,0,0,0
24119351,"Feasibility and acceptability of conducting a randomized clinical trial designed to improve interpretation of screening mammography.PURPOSE: To describe recruitment, enrollment, and participation in a study of US radiologists invited to participate in a randomized controlled trial of two continuing medical education (CME) interventions designed to improve interpretation of screening mammography.METHODS: We collected recruitment, consent, and intervention-completion information as part of a large study involving radiologists in California, Oregon, Washington, New Mexico, New Hampshire, North Carolina, and Vermont.Consenting radiologists were randomized to receive either a 1-day live, expert-led educational session; to receive a self-paced DVD with similar content; or to a control group (delayed intervention).The impact of the interventions was assessed using a preintervention-postintervention test set design.All activities were institutional review board approved and HIPAA compliant.RESULTS: Of 403 eligible radiologists, 151 of 403 (37.5%) consented to participate in the trial and 119 of 151 (78.8%) completed the preintervention test set, leaving 119 available for randomization to one of the two intervention groups or to controls.Female radiologists were more likely than male radiologists to consent to and complete the study (P = .03).Consenting radiologists who completed all study activities were more likely to have been interpreting mammography for 10 years or less compared to radiologists who consented and did not complete all study activities or did not consent at all.The live intervention group was more likely to report their intent to change their clinical practice as a result of the intervention compared to those who received the DVD (50% versus 17.6%, P = .02).The majority of participants in both interventions groups felt the interventions were a useful way to receive CME mammography credits.CONCLUSIONS: Community radiologists found interactive interventions designed to improve interpretative mammography performance acceptable and useful for clinical practice.This suggests CME credits for radiologists should, in part, be for examining practice skills.",0,0,0,0
22417251,"Prostate-cancer mortality at 11 years of follow-up.BACKGROUND: Several trials evaluating the effect of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing on prostate-cancer mortality have shown conflicting results.We updated prostate-cancer mortality in the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer with 2 additional years of follow-up.METHODS: The study involved 182,160 men between the ages of 50 and 74 years at entry, with a predefined core age group of 162,388 men 55 to 69 years of age.The trial was conducted in eight European countries.Men who were randomly assigned to the screening group were offered PSA-based screening, whereas those in the control group were not offered such screening.The primary outcome was mortality from prostate cancer.RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 11 years in the core age group, the relative reduction in the risk of death from prostate cancer in the screening group was 21% (rate ratio, 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.68 to 0.91; P=0.001), and 29% after adjustment for noncompliance.The absolute reduction in mortality in the screening group was 0.10 deaths per 1000 person-years or 1.07 deaths per 1000 men who underwent randomization.The rate ratio for death from prostate cancer during follow-up years 10 and 11 was 0.62 (95% CI, 0.45 to 0.85; P=0.003).To prevent one death from prostate cancer at 11 years of follow-up, 1055 men would need to be invited for screening and 37 cancers would need to be detected.There was no significant between-group difference in all-cause mortality.CONCLUSIONS: Analyses after 2 additional years of follow-up consolidated our previous finding that PSA-based screening significantly reduced mortality from prostate cancer but did not affect all-cause mortality.(Current Controlled Trials number, ISRCTN49127736.).",0,0,0,0

23146280,"The prognostic and predictive value of mRNA expression of vascular endothelial growth factor family members in breast cancer: a study in primary tumors of high-risk early breast cancer patients participating in a randomized Hellenic Cooperative Oncology Group trial.INTRODUCTION: The main prognostic variables in early breast cancer are tumor size, histological grade, estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor (ER/PgR) status, number of positive nodes and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status.The present study evaluated the prognostic and/or predictive value of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family members in high-risk early breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant chemo-hormonotherapy.METHODS: RNA was isolated from 308 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded primary tumor samples from breast cancer patients enrolled in the HE10/97 trial, evaluating adjuvant dose-dense sequential chemotherapy with epirubicin followed by cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil (CMF) with or without paclitaxel (E-T-CMF versus E-CMF).A fully automated method based on magnetic beads was applied for RNA extraction, followed by one-step quantitative RT-PCR for mRNA analysis of VEGF-A, -B, -C and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) 1, 2, 3.RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 8 years, 109 patients (35%) developed a relapse and 80 patients (26%) died.In high VEGF-C and VEGFR1 mRNA expressing tumors, ER/PgR-negative tumors (Fisher's exact test, P = 0.001 and P = 0.021, respectively) and HER2-positive tumors (P <0.001 and P = 0.028, respectively) were more frequent than in low VEGF-C and VEGFR1 expressing tumors, respectively.From the VEGF family members evaluated, high VEGFR1 mRNA expression (above the 75th percentile) emerged as a significant negative prognostic factor for overall survival (OS; hazard ratio (HR) = 1.60, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01 to 2.55, Wald's P = 0.047) and disease-free survival (DFS; HR = 1.67, 95% CI: 1.13 to 2.48, P = 0.010), when adjusting for treatment group.High VEGF-C mRNA expression was predictive for benefit from adjuvant treatment with paclitaxel (E-T-CMF arm) for OS (test for interaction, Wald's P = 0.038), while in multivariate analysis the interaction of VEGF-C with taxane treatment was significant for both OS (Wald's P = 0.019) and DFS (P = 0.041) and continuous VEGF-B mRNA expression values for OS (P = 0.019).CONCLUSIONS: The present study reports, for the first time, that VEGF-C mRNA overexpression, as assessed by qRT-PCR, has a strong predictive value in high-risk early breast cancer patients undergoing adjuvant paclitaxel-containing treatment.Further studies are warranted to validate the prognostic and/or predictive value of VEGF-B, VEGF-C and VEGFR1 in patients treated with adjuvant therapies and to reveal which members of the VEGF family could possibly be useful markers in identifying patients who will benefit most from anti-VEGF strategies.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR) ACTRN12611000506998.",0,0,0,0

An exploratory analysis of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer 55971 randomised trial.BACKGROUND: To investigate whether biomarkers consisting of baseline characteristics of advanced stage ovarian cancer patients can help in identifying subgroups of patients who would benefit more from primary surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy.METHODS: We used data of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 55971 trial in which 670 patients were randomly assigned to primary surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy.The primary outcome was overall survival.Ten baseline clinical and pathological characteristics were selected as potential biomarkers.Using Subpopulation Treatment Effect Pattern Plots (STEPP), biomarkers with a statistically significant qualitative additive interaction with treatment were considered as potentially informative for treatment selection.We also combined selected biomarkers to form a multimarker treatment selection rule.FINDINGS: The size of the largest metastatic tumour and clinical stage were significantly associated with the magnitude of the benefit from treatment, in terms of five-year survival (p for interaction: 0.008 and 0.016, respectively).Stage IIIC patients with metastatic tumours 45 mm benefited more from primary surgery while stage IV patients with metastatic tumours >45 mm benefited more from neoadjuvant chemotherapy.In stage IIIC patients with larger metastatic tumours and in stage IV patients with less extensive metastatic tumours both treatments were equally effective.We estimated that by selecting treatments for patients based on largest metastatic tumour and clinical stage, the potential five-year survival rate in the population of treated patients would be 27.3% (95% confidence interval (CI) 21.9-33.0), 7.8% higher than if all were treated with primary surgery, and 5.6% higher if all were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.INTERPRETATION: Although survival was comparable after primary surgery and neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the overall group of patients with ovarian cancer in the EORTC 55971 trial, we found in this exploratory analysis that patients with stage IIIC and less extensive metastatic tumours had higher survival with primary surgery, while patients with stage IV disease and large metastatic tumours had higher survival with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.For patients who did not meet these criteria, both treatment options led to comparable survival rates.",1,1,1,1
23234763,"Adjuvant lapatinib for women with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer: a randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Worldwide, many patients with HER2-positive early stage breast cancer do not receive trastuzumab-the standard adjuvant treatment.We investigated the efficacy and safety of adjuvant lapatinib for patients with trastuzumab-naive HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer, started at any time after diagnosis.METHODS: This study was a placebo-controlled, multicentre, randomised phase 3 trial.Women outpatients from 405 [corrected] centres in 33 countries [corrected] with HER2-positive early-breast cancer who had previously received adjuvant chemotherapy but not trastuzumab were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive daily lapatinib (1500 mg) or daily placebo for 12 months.Randomisation was done with a computer-generated sequence, stratified by time since diagnosis, lymph node involvement at diagnosis, and tumour hormone-receptor status.Investigators, site staff, and patients were masked to treatment assignment.The primary endpoint was disease-free survival in the intention-to-treat population.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00374322.FINDINGS: Between August, 2006, and May, 2008, 3161 women were enrolled and 3147 were assigned to lapatinib (n=1571) or placebo (n=1576).After a median follow-up of 47.4 months (range 0.4-60.0) in the lapatinib group and 48.3 (0.7-61.3) in the placebo group, 210 (13%) disease-free survival events had occurred in the lapatinib group versus 264 (17%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.83, 95% CI 0.70-1.00; p=0.053).Central review of HER2 status showed that only 2490 (79%) of the randomised women were HER2-positive.157 (13%) of 1230 confirmed HER2-positive patients in the lapatinib group and in 208 (17%) of 1260 in the placebo group had a disease-free survival event (HR 0.82, 95% 0.67-1.00; p=0.04).Serious adverse events occurred in 99 (6%) of 1573 patients taking lapatinib and 77 (5%) of 1574 patients taking placebo, with higher incidences of grade 3-4 diarrhoea (97 [6%] vs nine [<1%]), rash (72 [5%] vs three [<1%]), and hepatobiliary disorders (36 [2%] vs one [<1%]).INTERPRETATION: Our data show that there was no significant difference in disease-free survival between groups when analysed in the intention-to-treat population.However, exploratory analyses restricted to patients who had HER2-positive disease confirmed by central fluorescence in-situ hybridisation review suggested marginal benefit with lapatinib in terms of disease-free survival.Thus lapatinib might be an option for women with HER2-positive breast cancer who do not or cannot receive adjuvant trastuzumab.FUNDING: GlaxoSmithKline.",1,1,1,1

23588130,"Increasing human papillomavirus vaccine acceptability by tailoring messages to young adult women's perceived barriers.BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination is a safe and effective primary prevention strategy for cervical cancer.Despite the need for effective HPV vaccination interventions, relatively few have been tested.Moreover, existing interventions have tended to use a one-size-fits-all educational approach.We investigated whether tailoring intervention materials to young adult women's perceived barriers to HPV vaccination-a known psychosocial predictor of vaccine uptake-would increase women's intentions to receive the HPV vaccine.METHODS: Young adult women (N = 94; aged 18-26 years) who had not been vaccinated against HPV were randomly assigned to read either a nontailored message about HPV vaccination or a message that was individually tailored to participants' perceived barriers to HPV vaccine uptake (e.g., safety concerns, cost, and not sexually active).Participants' intentions to receive the HPV vaccine in the next year were assessed before and after delivery of the intervention and served as the primary outcome variable.RESULTS: The most commonly selected barrier and primary reason for not getting vaccinated was concern about vaccine adverse effects (endorsed by 55%).Knowledge about HPV vaccination increased after exposure to the intervention but did not differ by experimental condition.Although HPV vaccination intentions increased from pretest to posttest in both conditions, participants in the tailored condition reported greater increases in intentions than did participants in the nontailored condition (F1,90 = 4.02, P = 0.048, partial eta = 0.043).CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that tailoring intervention materials to women's individual barriers is a potentially promising strategy for increasing HPV vaccination among young adult women.",0,0,0,0

23940227,"Optimization of chemotherapy for younger patients with acute myeloid leukemia: results of the medical research council AML15 trial.PURPOSE: Treatment outcomes in younger patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have improved, but optimization and new combinations are needed.We assess three combinations in induction and consolidation.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Younger untreated patients with AML (median age, 49 years; range, 0 to 73 years) were randomly allocated to two induction courses of daunorubicin and cytarabine (DA) with or without etoposide (ADE; n = 1983) or ADE versus fludarabine, cytarabine, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and idarubicin (FLAG-Ida; n = 1268), and to amsacrine, cytarabine, etoposide, and then mitoxantrone/cytarabine (MACE-MidAC) or high-dose cytarabine (n = 1,445) 3 g/m(2) or 1.5 g/m(2) (n = 657) in consolidation, and finally to a fifth course (cytarabine) or not (n = 227).RESULTS: Overall remission rates were similar for DA versus ADE (84% v 86%; P = .14) and ADE versus FLAG-Ida (86% v 85%; P = .7), with more course 1 remissions after FLAG-Ida (77%) reducing relapse (38% v 55%; P < .001) and improving relapse-free survival (45% v 34%; P = .01), overall and in subgroups, but with increased myelosuppression, reducing participation in the consolidation randomization.Overall outcomes were similar between MACE/MidAc and high-dose cytarabine (1.5/3.0 g/m(2)), but cytarabine required less supportive care.MACE/MidAc was superior for high-risk patients.A fifth course provided no benefit.The outcome for recipients of only two FLAG-Ida courses were not different from that with DA/ADE with consolidation.CONCLUSION: FLAG-Ida is an effective remission induction treatment, with a high complete remission rate after course 1 and reduced relapse.Consolidation with MACE/MidAc is similar overall to high-dose cytarabine, but superior in high-risk patients.Cytarabine at 1.5 g/m(2) is equivalent to a 3 g/m(2) dose.A fifth course is unnecessary.In patients receiving FLAG-Ida (two courses) and cytarabine (two courses), 8-year survival was 63% for patients with intermediate-risk and 95% for those with favorable-risk disease.",0,0,0,0
22641239,"Responder analysis of the effects of denosumab on bone mineral density in men receiving androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer.BACKGROUND: Denosumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody against RANK ligand, increased bone mineral density (BMD) and reduced fracture risk vs placebo in a phase 3 trial in men with prostate cancer on androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).The present analysis of this study evaluated BMD changes after 36 months in responder subgroups and in individual patients for three key skeletal sites (lumbar spine (LS), femoral neck (FN) and total hip (TH)) and the distal radius.METHODS: Men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer receiving ADT were treated with subcutaneous denosumab 60 mg (n=734) or placebo (n=734) every 6 months for up to 36 months in a phase 3, randomized, double-blind study.Patients were instructed to take supplemental calcium and vitamin D. For this BMD responder analysis, the primary outcome measure was the percentage change in BMD from baseline to month 36 at the LS, FN and TH as measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.BMD at the distal 1/3 radius at 36 months was measured in a substudy of 309 patients.RESULTS: At 36 months, significantly more patients in the denosumab arm had increases of >3% BMD from baseline at each site studied compared with placebo (LS, 78 vs 17%; FN, 48 vs 13%; TH, 48 vs 6%; distal 1/3 radius, 40 vs 7% (P<0.0001 for all)).BMD loss at the LS, FN and TH occurred in 1% of denosumab-treated patients vs 42% of placebo patients, and BMD gain at all three sites occurred in 69% of denosumab patients vs 8% of placebo patients.Lower baseline BMD was associated with higher-magnitude BMD responses to denosumab at the LS, FN and TH.CONCLUSIONS: In men with prostate cancer receiving ADT, significantly higher BMD response rates were observed with denosumab vs placebo.Patients with lower baseline T-scores benefited the most from denosumab treatment.",0,0,0,0

23031619,"Breast density as indicator for the use of mammography or MRI to screen women with familial risk for breast cancer (FaMRIsc): a multicentre randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: To reduce mortality, women with a family history of breast cancer often start mammography screening at a younger age than the general population.Breast density is high in over 50% of women younger than 50 years.With high breast density, breast cancer incidence increases, but sensitivity of mammography decreases.Therefore, mammography might not be the optimal method for breast cancer screening in young women.Adding MRI increases sensitivity, but also the risk of false-positive results.The limitation of all previous MRI screening studies is that they do not contain a comparison group; all participants received both MRI and mammography.Therefore, we cannot empirically assess in which stage tumours would have been detected by either test.The aim of the Familial MRI Screening Study (FaMRIsc) is to compare the efficacy of MRI screening to mammography for women with a familial risk.Furthermore, we will assess the influence of breast density.METHODS/DESIGN: This Dutch multicentre, randomized controlled trial, with balanced randomisation (1:1) has a parallel grouped design.Women with a cumulative lifetime risk for breast cancer due to their family history of >/=20%, aged 30-55 years are eligible.Identified BRCA1/2 mutation carriers or women with 50% risk of carrying a mutation are excluded.Group 1 receives yearly mammography and clinical breast examination (n = 1000), and group 2 yearly MRI and clinical breast examination, and mammography biennially (n = 1000).Primary endpoints are the number and stage of the detected breast cancers in each arm.Secondary endpoints are the number of false-positive results in both screening arms.Furthermore, sensitivity and positive predictive value of both screening strategies will be assessed.Cost-effectiveness of both strategies will be assessed.Analyses will also be performed with mammographic density as stratification factor.DISCUSSION: Personalized breast cancer screening might optimize mortality reduction with less over diagnosis.Breast density may be a key discriminator for selecting the optimal screening strategy for women < 55 years with familial breast cancer risk; mammography or MRI.These issues are addressed in the FaMRIsc study including high risk women due to a familial predisposition.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Netherland Trial Register NTR2789.",1,1,0,0

22669453,"Tumor budding is an independent predictor of outcome in AJCC/UICC stage II colorectal cancer.BACKGROUND: In colorectal cancer, the morphology of the invasive tumor margin may reflect aggressiveness of tumor growth, thus providing important prognostic information.The tumor growth pattern according to Jass and the extent of tumor budding were analyzed in patients with American Joint Committee on Cancer/Union for International Cancer Control (AJCC/UICC) stage II disease.METHODS: Tumors of 120 randomly selected patients with AJCC/UICC stage II disease were retrospectively reviewed for tumor growth pattern (expanding vs. infiltrating) and the extent of tumor budding, with high-grade budding reflecting presence of 10 or more budding foci scattered at the invasive tumor margin.Progression-free and cancer-specific survivals were determined by the Kaplan-Meier method.For multivariable analysis, Cox's proportional hazards regression models were performed.RESULTS: The infiltrating growth pattern was significantly associated with histological subtype and lymphovascular invasion, while high-grade budding was significantly associated with tumor grade and lymphovascular invasion.High-grade budding, but not the infiltrating growth pattern, was significantly associated with outcome in univariable analysis.Cox's proportional hazards regression models proved tumor budding to be an independent predictor of disease progression (hazard ratio 3.91, 95 % confidence interval 1.3-11.77; P = 0.02) and cancer-related death (hazard ratio 5.90, 95 % confidence interval 1.62-21.51; P = 0.007).The combination of infiltrating growth pattern and high-grade budding did not have a stronger prognostic significance than tumor budding alone.CONCLUSIONS: Tumor budding independently predicted patient outcome in patients with AJCC/UICC stage II colorectal cancer and may therefore be used for accurate prognostication, patient counseling, and design of clinical trials by using integrated multimodal therapy.",0,0,0,0
21553314,"Compression garments versus compression bandaging in decongestive lymphatic therapy for breast cancer-related lymphedema: a randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Lymphedema as a result of curative surgery for breast cancer can lead to long-term morbidity.Decongestive lymphatic therapy (DLT) is recognized as an optimal management strategy for patients with moderate symptomatologies, but there is little data in regard to the most effective means of providing compression therapy within a DLT protocol.We conducted a randomized trial of two forms of compression therapy within the initial treatment phase of a DLT protocol for breast cancer-related lymphedema.METHODS: Subjects were required to have mild-moderate lymphedema (10-40% volume difference) acquired as a result of curative breast cancer surgery and were randomized to compression bandaging or garments within the initial treatment phase of a DLT protocol.Primary endpoint was change in affected limb volume assessed via volumetry, and secondary endpoints were symptom control and upper extremity function assessed via visual analogue scales and the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire, respectively.Endpoints were assessed at day 10 of treatment and at 3 months and compared to baseline.RESULTS: Twenty-one subjects were available for analysis.The group receiving bandaging experienced greater median volume reductions at 10 days (70 vs. 5 mL; p = 0.387) and at 3 months (97.5 vs. 50 mL; p = 0.182).The bandaging group also experienced a greater increase in median DASH scores at 10 days (+20.9 vs. +5; p = 0.143) and at 3 months (+18.4 vs. +3.3; p = 0.065).CONCLUSION: Within the initial treatment phase of a DLT protocol for acquired, breast cancer-related lymphedema, compression bandaging may lead to greater volume reduction but worse upper extremity functional status (higher DASH scores) as compared to compression garments.",0,0,0,0
25015740,"A cohort analysis to identify eligible patients for intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) of early breast cancer.BACKGROUND: Since the results from the randomized TARGIT A trial were published, intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) is used more often.IORT can be provided as accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) or as a boost.The definition of suitable patients for IORT as APBI differs between different national societies (e.g. ESTRO and ASTRO) and different inclusion criteria of trials and so does the eligibility of patients.This analysis identifies eligible patients for IORT according to available consensus statements and inclusion criteria of the ongoing TARGIT trials.METHODS: Between 01/03 - 12/09, 1505 breast cancer cases were treated at the breast cancer center at the University Medical Center Mannheim.Complete data sets for age, stage (T, N, and M), histology and hormone receptor status were available in 1108 cases.Parameters to identify eligible patients are as follows: ESTRO: >50 years, invasive ductal carcinoma/other favorable histology (IDC), T1-2 (</=3 cm), N0, any hormone receptor status, M0; ASTRO: >/=60 years, IDC, T1, N0, positive estrogen hormone receptor status, M0; TARGIT E ""elderly"", risk adapted radiotherapy with IORT followed by external beam radiotherapy in case of risk factors in final histopathology, phase II: >/=70 years, IDC, T1, N0, any hormone receptor status, M0; TARGIT C ""consolidation"", risk adapted radiotherapy, phase IV: >/=50 years, IDC, T1, N0, positive hormone receptor status, M0; TARGIT BQR ""boost quality registry"": every age, every histology, T1-2 (max.3.5 cm), any hormone receptor status, N0/+, M0/+.RESULTS: Out of the 1108 cases, 379 cases (34.2%) were suitable for IORT as APBI regarding the ESTRO and 175 (15.8%) regarding the ASTRO consensus statements.82 (7.4%) patients were eligible for the TARGIT E trial, 258 (23.3%) for the TARGIT C trial and 671 (60.6%) for the TARGIT BQR registry.According to the consensus statements of ASTRO (45.1%) and ESTRO (41.4%) about half of the eligible patients were treated with IORT as APBI.From the eligible patients fulfilling the criteria for IORT boost (35%) about one third was eventually treated.CONCLUSIONS: Patient selection for IORT should be restrictive.For IORT as APBI the TARGIT trials are even more restrictive including patients than the ESTRO and ASTRO consensus statements.",0,0,0,0
24629419,"A randomized controlled trial assessing the effect of prescribed patient position changes during colonoscope withdrawal on adenoma detection.BACKGROUND: High-quality colonoscope withdrawal technique is associated with a higher adenoma detection rate.Position change is routinely used in barium enema and CT colonography to facilitate adequate distension of the colon and promote movement of fluid from the segment of the colon being assessed.OBJECTIVE: To determine whether prescribed position changes during colonoscope withdrawal affect the adenoma detection rate compared with the usual care per endoscopist.DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, controlled trial.SETTING: Tertiary-care, university-affiliated hospital.PATIENTS: Patients referred for outpatient colonoscopy between July 2011 and July 2012 were evaluated for eligibility.Inclusion criteria were outpatient status and age >/=40 years.Exclusion criteria were (1) complete colonoscopy within 1 year before the procedure, (2) inability to provide informed consent, (3) incomplete colonoscopy to the cecum, (4) previous bowel resection, (5) inflammatory bowel disease, (6) colonic polyposis syndrome, (7) inadequate bowel preparation, and (8) musculoskeletal disorder or other mobility issues limiting effective patient position changes during colonoscopy.INTERVENTIONS: Prescribed position changes during colonoscope withdrawal.MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Polyp detection rate (PDR) and adenoma detection rate (ADR).RESULTS: A total of 776 patients were enrolled, with 388 in the dynamic group.There was no difference in PDR (odds ratio [OR] 0.99; P = .93) or ADR (OR 1.17; P = .28).Colonoscope withdrawal time was longer in the dynamic group (median time 466.5 vs 422.5 seconds; P < .0001).LIMITATIONS: Single-center study.Indication for procedure not controlled.Lack of standardized bowel preparation and blinding.CONCLUSION: Prescribed position changes during colonoscope withdrawal do not affect polyp/adenoma detection compared with the usual practice when the baseline ADR is above the recommended standard.( CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT01395173.).",0,0,0,0
24245838,"CHESS improves cancer caregivers' burden and mood: results of an eHealth RCT.OBJECTIVE: Informal caregivers (family and friends) of people with cancer are often unprepared for their caregiving role, leading to increased burden or distress.Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System (CHESS) is a Web-based lung cancer information, communication, and coaching system for caregivers.This randomized trial reports the impact on caregiver burden, disruptiveness, and mood of providing caregivers access to CHESS versus the Internet with a list of recommended lung cancer websites.METHODS: A total of 285 informal caregivers of patients with advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer were randomly assigned to a comparison group that received Internet or a treatment group that received Internet and CHESS.Caregivers were provided a computer and Internet service if needed.Written surveys were completed at pretest and during the intervention period bimonthly for up to 24 months.Analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) compared the intervention's effect on caregivers' disruptiveness and burden (CQOLI-C), and negative mood (combined Anxiety, Depression, and Anger scales of the POMS) at 6 months, controlling for blocking variables (site, caregiver's race, and relationship to patient) and the given outcome at pretest.RESULTS: Caregivers randomized to CHESS reported lower burden, t(84) = 2.36, p = .021, d = .39, and negative mood, t(86) = 2.82, p = .006, d = .44, than those in the Internet group.The effect on disruptiveness was not significant.CONCLUSIONS: Although caring for someone with a terminal illness will always exact a toll on caregivers, eHealth interventions like CHESS may improve caregivers' understanding and coping skills and, as a result, ease their burden and mood.",0,0,0,0
25662406,"Phase I trial of a cancer vaccine consisting of 20 mixed peptides in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer: dose-related immune boosting and suppression.The heterogeneity expression of tumor-associated antigens (TAA) and variability of human T cell repertoire suggest that effective cancer vaccine requires induction of a wide breadth of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) specificities.This can be achieved with vaccines targeting multiple TAA.We evaluated the safety and immune dynamics of a cancer vaccine consisting of 20 mixed peptides (KRM-20) designed to induce CTLs against 12 different TAA in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).Patients received each of three different randomly assigned doses of KRM-20 (6, 20, or 60 mg) once a week for 6 weeks.KRM-20 was applicable for patients with positive human leukocyte antigen (HLA) A2, A3, A11, A24, A26, A31 or A33 alleles, which cover the majority of the global population.To evaluate the minimum immunological effective dose (MIED), peptide-specific CTL and immunoglobulin G (IgG) responses, and immune suppressive subsets were evaluated during the vaccination.Total of 17 patients was enrolled.No serious adverse drug reactions were encountered.The MIED of KRM-20 in CTL or IgG response calculated by logistic regression model was set as 16 or 1.6 mg, respectively.The frequency of immune suppressive subsets was fewer in the 20 mg cohort than that in 6 or 60 mg cohort.Clinical responses determined by prostate-specific antigen levels were two partial responses (from the 20 mg cohort), five no changes and ten progressive diseases.Twenty milligrams of KRM-20 could be recommended for further studies because of the safety and ability to augment CTL activity.",0,0,0,0
24613908,"Clinical benefit response in pancreatic cancer trials revisited.OBJECTIVES: Clinical benefit response (CBR), based on changes in pain, Karnofsky performance status, and weight, is an established palliative endpoint in trials for advanced gastrointestinal cancer.We investigated whether CBR is associated with survival, and whether CBR reflects a wide-enough range of domains to adequately capture patients' perception.METHODS: CBR was prospectively evaluated in an international phase III chemotherapy trial in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer (n = 311) in parallel with patient-reported outcomes (PROs).RESULTS: The median time to treatment failure was 3.4 months (range: 0-6).The majority of the CBRs (n = 39) were noted in patients who received chemotherapy for at least 5 months.Patients with CBR (n = 62) had longer survival than non-responders (n = 182) (hazard ratio = 0.69; 95% confidence interval: 0.51-0.94; p = 0.013).CBR was predicted with a sensitivity and specificity of 77-80% by various combinations of 3 mainly physical PROs.A comparison between the duration of CBR (n = 62, median = 8 months, range = 4-31) and clinically meaningful improvements in the PROs (n = 100-116; medians = 9-11 months, range = 4-24) showed similar intervals.CONCLUSION: CBR is associated with survival and mainly reflects physical domains.Within phase III chemotherapy trials for advanced gastrointestinal cancer, CBR can be replaced by a PRO evaluation, without losing substantial information but gaining complementary information.",0,0,0,0
22559906,"A nurse practitioner directed intervention improves the quality of life of patients with metastatic cancer: results of a randomized pilot study.BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of randomized studies evaluating the value of palliative interventions on a prospective basis in newly diagnosed oncology patients.We sought to prospectively evaluate quality of life (QoL) outcomes in advanced cancer patients who received discussion-based palliative care interventions from an advanced registered nurse practitioner (ARNP) integrated into the oncology team, and compare these outcomes with a control population.METHODS: Patients with metastatic cancer were randomized to standard care or an ARNP-directed intervention that included discussions of the benefits of hospice, discussions on living wills and advanced directives (Five Wishes document) along with an assessment of QoL. Relevant endpoints included change from baseline QoL and improvement in hospice knowledge.RESULTS: From November 13, 2008, through July 28, 2009, 26 patients were accrued at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida.The study closed early due to published data demonstrating the benefits of early palliative care interventions in the management of metastatic cancer patients.Statistically significant improvements from baseline were noted in emotional and mental QoL assessments in the intervention group that were not seen in the control group.Patients found it useful to have the living will and Five Wishes documents offered as part of the ARNP intervention.CONCLUSIONS: An ARNP-directed intervention that explains the benefits of hospice and addresses advanced directives early in the course of metastatic cancer patients' treatment, is well received by the patients and their relatives and leads to measurable improvement in the patient's emotional and mental QoL.",1,1,0,0
23018640,"Sequence analysis of beta-subunit genes of the 20S proteasome in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma treated with bortezomib or dexamethasone.Variations within proteasome beta (PSMB) genes, which encode the beta subunits of the 20S proteasome, may affect proteasome function, assembly, and/or binding of proteasome inhibitors.To investigate the potential association between PSMB gene variants and treatment-emergent resistance to bortezomib and/or long-term outcomes, in the present study, PSMB gene sequence variation was characterized in tumor DNA samples from patients who participated in the phase 3 Assessment of Proteasome Inhibition for Extending Remissions (APEX) study of bortezomib versus high-dose dexamethasone for treatment of relapsed multiple myeloma.Twelve new PSMB variants were identified.No associations were found between PSMB single nucleotide polymorphism genotype frequency and clinical response to bortezomib or dexamethasone treatment or between PSMB single nucleotide polymorphism allelic frequency and pooled overall survival or time to progression.Although specific PSMB5 variants have been identified previously in preclinical models of bortezomib resistance, these variants were not detected in patient tumor samples collected after clinical relapse from bortezomib, which suggests that alternative mechanisms underlie bortezomib insensitivity.",0,0,0,0
24916951,"Inflammation and psychosocial factors mediate exercise effects on sleep quality in breast cancer survivors: pilot randomized controlled trial.OBJECTIVE: To improve mechanistic understanding, this pilot randomized controlled trial examined mediators of an exercise intervention effects on sleep in breast cancer survivors (BCS).METHODS: Forty-six postmenopausal BCS (</=Stage II, off primary treatment) were randomized to a 3-month exercise intervention or control group.Intervention included 160 min/week of moderate intensity aerobic walking, twice weekly resistance training (resistance bands), and six discussion groups (to improve adherence).Blinded assessments at baseline and post-intervention included sleep disturbance (PSQI and PROMIS(R)), objective sleep quality (accelerometer), serum cytokines, accelerometer physical activity, cardiorespiratory fitness, body composition, fatigue, and psychosocial factors.Mediation was tested using Freedman-Schatzkin difference-in-coefficients tests.RESULTS: When compared with control, the intervention group demonstrated a significant increase in PSQI sleep duration (i.e., fewer hours of sleep/night) (d = 0.73, p = .03).Medium to large but non-significant standardized effect sizes were noted for PSQI daytime somnolence (d = -0.63, p = .05) and accelerometer latency (d = -0.49, p = .14).No statistically significant mediators were detected for PSQI sleep duration score or accelerometer latency.Daytime somnolence was mediated by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (mediated 23% of intervention effect, p < .05), interleukin (IL)-6:IL-10 (16%, p < .01), IL-8:IL-10 (26%, p < .01), and fatigue (38%, p < .05).Mediating or enhancing relationships for several of the sleep outcomes were noted for accelerometer physical activity, PROMIS(R) fatigue, exercise social support, and/or physical activity enjoyment.CONCLUSIONS: Inflammation and psychosocial factors may mediate or enhance sleep response to our exercise intervention.Further study is warranted to confirm our results and translate our findings into more effective interventions aimed at improving sleep quality in BCS.",0,0,0,0
22887343,"Phase 3 clinical trial investigating the effect of selenium supplementation in men at high-risk for prostate cancer.PURPOSE: This study was conducted to investigate the effect of Se supplementation on prostate cancer incidence in men at high risk for prostate cancer.METHODS: A Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted in 699 men at high risk for prostate cancer (prostate specific antigen (PSA) >4 ng/ml and/or suspicious digital rectal examination and/or PSA velocity >0.75 ng/ml/year), but with a negative prostate biopsy.Participants were randomized to receive daily oral placebo (N = 232), 200 microg selenium (N = 234), or 400 microg selenium (N = 233) as selenized yeast.They were followed every 6 months for up to 5 years.The time to diagnosis of prostate cancer was compared between treatment groups using the Cox proportional hazards model.RESULT: Compared to placebo, the hazard ratios [95% confidence intervals] for risk of developing prostate cancer in the selenium 200 microg/day or the selenium 400 microg/day group were 0.94 [0.52, 1.7] and 0.90 [0.48, 1.7], respectively.PSA velocity in the selenium arms was not significantly different from that observed in the placebo group (P = 0.18 and P = 0.17, respectively).CONCLUSION: Selenium supplementation appeared to have no effect on the incidence of prostate cancer in men at high risk.In conjunction with results of other studies, these data indicate that selenium supplementation may not have a role in prostate cancer chemoprevention.",0,0,0,0

METHODS: Patients in the HALT-C Trial were tested every 3 months for 42 months.Screening ultrasound was performed every 12 months.Levels of biomarkers were compared in patients in whom HCC did or did not develop.RESULTS: In all, 855 patients were evaluated; HCC developed in 46.Among patients without HCC, 73.2% had AFP consistently <20, 24.5% had at least one AFP between 20 and 199, and 2.3% had at least one AFP value >/=200 ng/ml; 73.7% had DCP consistently <90, 11.6% had at least one DCP between 90 and 149, and 14.7% had at least one DCP value >/=150 mAU/ml.AFP-L3 >/=10% was present at least once in 9.0% and in 17.1% of those with AFP >/=20 ng/ml.Among all patients with elevated biomarkers, a diagnosis of HCC was made in 0-31.6% (depending on the biomarker and cutoff) during the subsequent 24 months.AFP >/=200 ng/ml had the highest specificity (99%), but sensitivity was </=20%.DCP >/=40mAU/ml had the highest sensitivity (76%), but specificity was </=58%.Independent predictors of elevated AFP were gender (female), race (Black), more advanced disease, and HCC.Elevated DCP was associated with more advanced disease and HCC.CONCLUSIONS: Mild-moderate elevations in total AFP and DCP but not in AFP-L3 occur frequently in patients with chronic hepatitis C and advanced fibrosis, are related to factors other than HCC, and are poor predictors of HCC.",0,0,0,0
23185750,"[Effects of qisheng mixture on chemotherapy induced myelosuppression in patients with colorectal cancer].OBJECTIVE: To observe the intervention of Qisheng Mixture (QM) on the chemotherapy induced myelosuppression in patients with colorectal cancer.METHODS: One hundred and twenty patients with colorectal cancer at Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine were randomly assigned to the pure chemotherapy group (as the control group) and the QM + chemotherapy group (as the treatment group), 60 in each group.All patients received FOLFOX4 or XELOX regimen for totally 6 cycles.Patients in the treatment group took QM 150 mL at the end of chemotherapy, once in the morning and once in the evening for 7 successive days, totally 6 therapeutic courses.The total and average dosages of using granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) were observed in all patients.The changes of white blood cell (WBC) counts were determined before chemotherapy and after the 6th chemotherapy.The hemoglobin (Hb), red blood cell (RBC), and platelet (PLT) counts were observed before chemotherapy, before the 4th chemotheray, and after the 6th chemotherapy.The clinical symptoms integrals (fatigue, liability to catch cold, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngalgia, pale complexion, poor appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, and so on) and the safety indicators (the functions of the liver and kidney, urine routines) were observed.The grading toxic and adverse reactions, KPS scoring, body weight, and the efficacy of the symptoms integrals were compared between the two groups.RESULTS: During the treatment period the total and average dosages of G-CSF used were larger in the control group than in the treatment group (P<0.01).After treatment the WBC count of the two groups were reduced with statistical difference (P<0.01).The WBC counts were higher in the treatment group than in the control group in the whole therapeutic process except the first chemotherapy (P<0.01, P<0.05).Compared with before treatment in the same group, RBC and PLT were reduced in the two groups before the 4th chemotherapy, RBC, Hb, and PLT were reduced after treatment (P<0.05, P<0.01).Better effects on body weight were obtained in the treatment group than in the control group with statistical difference (P<0.01).Compared with the control group, the clinical symptoms integrals such as fatigue, liability to catch cold, pharyngalgia, pale complexion, poor appetite, vomiting, and diarrhea were reduced (P<0.01).Compared with the control group, the toxic and adverse reactions were reduced in the treatment group before the 4th chemotherapy (P<0.01).CONCLUSIONS: QM could effectively intervene chemotherapy induced myelosuppression in patients with colorectal cancer.It was a safe Chinese medicine compound with lower toxicity.",0,0,0,0
22564713,"Randomized phase II trial of carboplatin and paclitaxel with or without lonafarnib in first-line treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer stage IIB-IV.OBJECTIVES: This study evaluates whether a molecular targeted therapy with the farnesyltransferase inhibitor lonafarnib added to standard chemotherapy in first-line treatment of advanced ovarian cancer (OC) could improve progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS).PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a prospective randomized phase II study to compare standard therapy carboplatin (C; AUC 5) and paclitaxel (T; 175 mg/m(2)) in primary advanced OC with or without lonafarnib (L).Lonafarnib was given in a dose of 100mg orally twice a day during chemotherapy and was increased afterwards to 200mg up to six months as a maintenance therapy.RESULTS: 105 patients were recruited (53 patients were randomized to receive LTC, 52 to TC).Hematologic toxicity was similar in both arms.Grade 3 and 4 non-hematological toxicity, occurred significantly more often with LTC (23% versus 4%, p=0.005) and was associated with a higher dropout rate.PFS and OS were not significantly different among both arms.The LTC arm showed inferiority in the stratum with residual tumor of more than 1cm: median PFS was 11.5 months (95% CI: 7.4-14.2) compared with 16.4 (95% CI: 10.3-40.4) for TC (p=0.0141; HR=0.36 (95% CI: 0.15-0.84)) with median OS 20.6 months (95% CI: 13.1-31.0) and 43.4 months (95% CI: 15.7-) for the TC arm (p=0.012; HR=0.32 (95% CI: 0.13-0.8)).CONCLUSION: The addition of lonafarnib did not improve PFS or OS.Patients with a residual tumor of more than 1cm had significantly shorter PFS and OS.Incorporation of lonafarnib into future studies for primary therapy of OC is not recommended.",0,0,0,0
22641493,"Is it effective to perform two more prostate biopsies according to prostate-specific antigen level and prostate volume in detecting prostate cancer? Prospective study of 10-core and 12-core prostate biopsy.PURPOSE: To evaluate the effectiveness of 2 more core prostate biopsy protocol in detecting the prostate cancer (PCa) by comparing 10-core prostate biopsy with 12-core according to the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level and the prostate volume.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 474 men with elevated serum levels of PSA between 2.5 and 20.0 ng/mL, regardless of abnormal finding on digital rectal examination and transrectal ultrasonography, received transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsies.The patients were prospectively randomized to undergo 10-core (group 1, n = 351) or 12-core (group 2, n = 123) biopsy.The PCa detection rates were assessed and compared according to the serum level of PSA and prostate volume.RESULTS: Of 474 men, 128 (27.0%) were diagnosed with PCa.The PCa detection rates of 10-core and 12-core biopsies were 26.4% and 28.4%, respectively (P = .378).There was no difference in cancer detection rates according to PSA level in both groups.Comparing the cancer detection rates according to the prostate volume (< 40 mL and >/= 40 mL), the patients with prostate volume >/= 40 mL showed higher cancer detection rates in 12-core biopsy group (26.9%) compared with 10-core biopsy group (16.4%) (P < .05).CONCLUSION: The overall cancer detection rates showed no differences in both groups.But the 12-core biopsy was a more efficient method in men with a prostate volume of >/= 40 mL, compared to the 10-core biopsy.",0,0,0,0
23497452,"A randomized trial to assess the biological activity of short-term (pre-surgical) fulvestrant 500 mg plus anastrozole versus fulvestrant 500 mg alone or anastrozole alone on primary breast cancer.INTRODUCTION: Fulvestrant shows dose-dependent biological activity.Greater estrogen-receptor (ER) blockade may feasibly be achieved by combining fulvestrant with anastrozole.This pre-surgical study compared fulvestrant plus anastrozole versus either agent alone in patients with ER-positive breast cancer.METHODS: In this double-blind, multicenter trial, 121 patients received fulvestrant 500 mg on Day 1 plus anastrozole 1 mg/day for 14 to 21 days (F + A); fulvestrant plus anastrozole placebo (F); or fulvestrant placebo plus anastrozole (A), 2 to 3 weeks before surgery.ER, progesterone-receptor (PgR) and Ki67 expression were determined from tumor biopsies before treatment and at surgery.RESULTS: A total of 103 paired samples were available (F, n = 35; F+A, n = 31; A, n = 37).All treatments significantly reduced mean ER expression from baseline (F: -41%, P = 0.0001; F + A: -39%, P = 0.0001; A: -13%, P = 0.0034).F and F + A led to greater reductions in ER versus A (both P = 0.0001); F + A did not lead to additional reductions versus F. PgR and Ki67 expression were significantly reduced with all treatments (means were -34% to -45%, and -75% to -85%, respectively; all P = 0.0001), with no differences between groups.CONCLUSIONS: In this short-term study, all treatments reduced ER expression, although F and F + A showed greater reductions than A. No significant differences were detected between the treatment groups in terms of PgR and Ki67 expression.No additional reduction in tumor biomarkers with combination treatment was observed, suggesting that F + A is unlikely to have further clinical benefit over F alone.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00259090.",1,1,1,1
24878085,"[Effect of metformin addition to an acute lymphoblastic leukemia chemotherapy treatment].BACKGROUND: Recently it has been reported a benefit effect with the use of metformin in patients with malignant disease.Our objective was to evaluate the effect of adding metformin to chemotherapy regimen over the percentage of early relapse in acute lymphoblastic leukemia.METHODS: A prospective, longitudinal and experimental study was performed in patients with de novo acute lymphoblastic leukemia enrolled in the Hospital General de Mexico.They were divided in two groups: first group received chemotherapy + metformin (850 mg three times a day); second group only received standard chemotherapy.The sample was randomized 3:1 in favor of the second group.RESULTS: 93 patients were included (73 treated with chemotherapy + metformin and 20 received standard chemotherapy), with 303 +/-53 days of follow-up.Complete remission was higher in the group without metformin (81.3 % [n = 61] versus 70 % [n = 14]), which also presented more patients with relapse (47.9 % versus 25 %).Overall survival at one year was of 68 % and free survival disease was 64 %, without significant differences between groups.Absence of metformin was the only variable of adverse prognostic considered significant (p = 0.55).Cox regression showed that adding metfomin reduced 56 % the risk of relapse.CONCLUSIONS: The adding metformin to the treatment of leukemias showed that was useful in our research.However, randomized and double-blind studies must be designed in order to express final recommendations about its use.",0,0,0,0
22374991,"Gastric cancer incidence among Hispanics in California: patterns by time, nativity, and neighborhood characteristics.BACKGROUND: Better understanding about gastric cancer incidence patterns among Hispanics by birthplace, socioeconomic status (SES), and acculturation can improve preventive strategies and disease models.METHODS: Incidence rates, rate ratios, and estimated annual percent change (EAPC) in rates of anatomic and histologic subtype-specific gastric cancer were calculated by age, sex, and nativity among Hispanics using California Cancer Registry data from 1988 through 2004.Incidence rates in 1998 to 2002 were compared by neighborhood SES and Hispanic enclave status according to 2000 US Census data.RESULTS: Incidence rates of diffuse gastric cancer increased from 1988 through 2004 among foreign-born Hispanic men (EAPC: 3.5%, 95% CI: 1.5%-5.5%) and U.S.-born Hispanic women (EAPC: 3.0%, 95% CI: 0.7%-5.3%).During the same time period, incidence rates of intestinal gastric cancer declined significantly and both cardia and noncardia gastric cancer were steady or declined among foreign-born and U.S.-born Hispanic men and women.Noncardia and both intestinal and diffuse gastric cancer were more common in foreign-born than U.S.-born Hispanic men and women, and in those from lower SES, higher enclave neighborhoods.By contrast, among younger and middle-aged Hispanic men, cardia tumors were more common in the U.S.-born than the foreign-born, and in higher SES, lower enclave neighborhoods.CONCLUSIONS: Varying gastric cancer risk factors among Hispanic subgroups and increasing rates of diffuse gastric cancer in foreign-born Hispanic men and U.S.-born Hispanic women merit further investigation to identify separate disease etiologies.IMPACT: Age, sex, birthplace, SES, and acculturation modify gastric cancer incidence in Hispanics and should be considered when examining disease risk and prevention.",0,0,0,0
22488460,"Efficient identification and referral of low-income women at high risk for hereditary breast cancer: a practice-based approach.BACKGROUND: Identification of low-income women with the rare but serious risk of hereditary cancer and their referral to appropriate services presents an important public health challenge.We report the results of formative research to reach thousands of women for efficient identification of those at high risk and expedient access to free genetic services.External validity is maximized by emphasizing intervention fit with the two end-user organizations who must connect to make this possible.This study phase informed the design of a subsequent randomized controlled trial.METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled pilot study (n = 38) to compare two intervention models for feasibility and impact.The main outcome was receipt of genetic counseling during a two-month intervention period.Model 1 was based on the usual outcall protocol of an academic hospital genetic risk program, and Model 2 drew on the screening and referral procedures of a statewide toll-free phone line through which large numbers of high-risk women can be identified.In Model 1, the risk program proactively calls patients to schedule genetic counseling; for Model 2, women are notified of their eligibility for counseling and make the call themselves.We also developed and pretested a family history screener for administration by phone to identify women appropriate for genetic counseling.RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in receipt of genetic counseling between women randomized to Model 1 (3/18) compared with Model 2 (3/20) during the intervention period.However, when unresponsive women in Model 2 were called after 2 months, 7 more obtained counseling; 4 women from Model 1 were also counseled after the intervention.Thus, the intervention model that closely aligned with the risk program's outcall to high-risk women was found to be feasible and brought more low-income women to free genetic counseling.Our screener was easy to administer by phone and appeared to identify high-risk callers effectively.The model and screener are now in use in the main trial to test the effectiveness of this screening and referral intervention.A validation analysis of the screener is also underway.CONCLUSION: Identification of intervention strategies and tools, and their systematic comparison for impact and efficiency in the context where they will ultimately be usedare critical elements of practice-based research.",0,0,0,0
24030729,"FLT3-ITD and MLL-PTD influence the expression of MDR-1, MRP-1, and BCRP mRNA but not LRP mRNA assessed with RQ-PCR method in adult acute myeloid leukemia.Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3-internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) and mixed-lineage leukemia gene-partial tandem duplication (MLL-PTD) are aberrations associated with leukemia which indicate unsatisfactory prognosis.Downstream regulatory targets of FLT3-ITD and MLL-PTD are not well defined.We have analyzed the expression of MDR-1, multidrug resistant protein-1 (MRP-1), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), and lung resistance protein (LRP) messenger RNA (mRNA) in relation to the mutational status of FLT3-ITD and MLL-PTD in 185 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) adult patients.The real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction method was performed to assess the expression of the MDR-1, MRP-1, BCRP, and LRP mRNA, and the results were presented as coefficients calculated using an intermediate method according to Pfaffl's rule.Significantly higher expressions of MDR-1 mRNA were found in patients who did not harbor FLT3-ITD (0.20 vs. 0.05; p = 0.0001) and MRP-1 mRNA in patients with this mutation (0.96 vs. 0.70; p = 0.002) and of BCRP mRNA in patients with MLL-PTD (0.61 vs. 0.38; p = 0.03).In univariate analysis, the high expression of MDR-1 mRNA (>/=0.1317) negatively influenced the outcome of induction therapy (p = 0.05), whereas the high expression of BCRP mRNA (>/=1.1487) was associated with a high relapse rate (RR) (p = 0.013).We found that the high expression of MDR-1 (>/=0.1317), MRP-1 (>/=0.8409), and BCRP mRNA (>/=1.1487) significantly influenced disease-free survival (DFS; p = 0.059, 0.032, and 0.009, respectively) and overall survival (0.048, 0.014, and 0.059, respectively).Moreover, a high expression of BCRP mRNA (>/=1.1487) proved to be an independent prognostic factor for RR (p = 0.01) and DFS (p = 0.002) in multivariate analysis.The significant correlation between the expression of MDR-1, MRP-1, and BCRP mRNA and FLT3-ITD or MLL-PTD in AML patients requires further investigation.",0,0,0,0

24213602,"Estrogen metabolism and breast cancer risk among postmenopausal women: a case-cohort study within B~FIT.Although elevated circulating estrogens are associated with increased postmenopausal breast cancer risk, less is known regarding the role of estrogen metabolism in breast carcinogenesis.We conducted a case-cohort study within the Breast and Bone Follow-up to the Fracture Intervention Trial to assess serum estrogens and estrogen metabolites (EMs) in 407 incident breast cancer cases diagnosed during follow-up and a subcohort of 496 women.In 1992-93, women completed a baseline questionnaire and provided blood samples.Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusted for geography and trial participation status, were estimated using Cox proportional hazard regression.Serum concentrations of EMs were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.EMs (quintiles, Q) were analyzed individually, as metabolic pathways (C-2, -4 or -16) and as ratios.Elevated circulating estradiol was associated with increased breast cancer risk (HRQ5vsQ1 = 1.86; 95% CI: 1.19-2.90; P trend = 0.04).An elevated ratio of the 2-hydroxylation pathway (HRQ5vsQ1 = 0.69; 95% CI: 0.46-1.05; P trend = 0.01) and 4-hydroxylation pathway (HRQ5vsQ1 = 0.61; 95% CI: 0.40-0.93; P trend = 0.004) to parent estrogens (estradiol and estrone) was inversely associated with risk.A higher ratio of the 2/16-hydroxylation pathways was associated with reduced risk (HRQ5vsQ1 = 0.60; 95% CI: 0.40-0.90; P trend = 0.002).Increased 2- or 4-hydroxylation of parent estrogens may lower risk of postmenopausal breast cancer.Analyses of metabolic pathways may help elucidate the role of estrogen metabolism in breast carcinogenesis.",0,0,0,0
22627104,"Preoperative chemoradiotherapy and postoperative chemotherapy with fluorouracil and oxaliplatin versus fluorouracil alone in locally advanced rectal cancer: initial results of the German CAO/ARO/AIO-04 randomised phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Preoperative chemoradiotherapy, total mesorectal excision surgery, and adjuvant chemotherapy with fluorouracil is the standard combined modality treatment for rectal cancer.With the aim of improving disease-free survival (DFS), this phase 3 study (CAO/ARO/AIO-04) integrated oxaliplatin into standard treatment.METHODS: This was a multicentre, open-label, randomised, phase 3 study in patients with histologically proven carcinoma of the rectum with clinically staged T3-4 or any node-positive disease.Between July 25, 2006, and Feb 26, 2010, patients were randomly assigned to two groups: a control group receiving standard fluorouracil-based combined modality treatment, consisting of preoperative radiotherapy of 50.4 Gy plus infusional fluorouracil (1000 mg/m(2) days 1-5 and 29-33), followed by surgery and four cycles of bolus fluorouracil (500 mg/m(2) days 1-5 and 29; fluorouracil group); and an experimental group receiving preoperative radiotherapy of 50.4 Gy plus infusional fluorouracil (250 mg/m(2) days 1-14 and 22-35) and oxaliplatin (50 mg/m(2) days 1, 8, 22, and 29), followed by surgery and eight cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with oxaliplatin (100 mg/m(2) days 1 and 15), leucovorin (400 mg/m(2) days 1 and 15), and infusional fluorouracil (2400 mg/m(2) days 1-2 and 15-16; fluorouracil plus oxaliplatin group).Randomisation was done with computer-generated block-randomisation codes stratified by centre, clinical T category (cT1-4 vs cT4), and clinical N category (cN0 vs cN1-2) without masking.DFS is the primary endpoint.Secondary endpoints, including toxicity, compliance, and histopathological response are reported here.Safety and compliance analyses included patients as treated, efficacy endpoints were analysed according to the intention-to-treat principle.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00349076.FINDINGS: Of the 1265 patients initially enrolled, 1236 were evaluable (613 in the fluorouracil plus oxaliplatin group and 623 in the fluorouracil group).Preoperative grade 3-4 toxic effects occurred in 140 (23%) of 606 patients who actually received fluorouracil and oxaliplatin during chemoradiotherapy and in 127 (20%) of 624 patients who actually received fluorouracil chemoradiotherapy.Grade 3-4 diarrhoea was more common in those who received fluorouracil and oxaliplatin during chemoradiotherapy than in those who received fluorouracil during chemoradiotherapy (73 patients [12%] vs 52 patients [8%]), as was grade 3-4 nausea or vomiting (23 [4%] vs nine [1%]).516 (85%) of the 606 patients who received fluorouracil and oxaliplatin-based chemoradiotherapy had the full dose of chemotherapy, and 571 (94%) had the full dose of radiotherapy; as did 495 (79%) and 601 (96%) of 624 patients who received fluorouracil-based chemoradiotherapy, respectively.A pathological complete response was achieved in 103 (17%) of 591 patients who underwent surgery in the fluorouracil and oxaliplatin group and in 81 (13%) of 606 patients who underwent surgery in the fluorouracil group (odds ratio 1.40, 95% CI 1.02-1.92; p=0.038).In the fluorouracil and oxaliplatin group, 352 (81%) of 435 patients who began adjuvant chemotherapy completed all cycles (with or without dose reduction), as did 386 (83%) of 463 patients in the fluorouracil group.INTERPRETATION: Inclusion of oxaliplatin into modified fluorouracil-based combined modality treatment was feasible and led to more patients achieving a pathological complete response than did standard treatment.Longer follow-up is needed to assess DFS.FUNDING: German Cancer Aid (Deutsche Krebshilfe).",0,0,0,0
22947544,"Effect of exercise on bone structural traits, physical performance and body composition in breast cancer patients--a 12-month RCT.In this 12-month RCT, we examined whether aerobic impact exercise training (3x/week) could facilitate breast cancer survivors' recovery by enhancing their bone structural strength, physical performance and body composition.After the adjuvant chemo- and/ or radiotherapy, 86 patients were randomly assigned into the training or control group.Structural bone traits were assessed with pQCT at the tibia and with DXA at the femoral neck.Agility (figure-8 running), jump force and power (force platform), grip strength and cardiovascular fitness (2-km walk test) were also assessed.Training effects on outcome variables were estimated by two-way factorial ANCOVA using the study group and menopausal status as fixed factors.Bone structural strength was better maintained among the trainees.At the femoral neck, there was a small but significant 2% training effect in the bone mass distribution (p=0.05).At the tibial diaphysis, slight 1% to 2% training effects (p=0.03) in total cross-sectional area and bone structural strength were observed (p=0.03) among the postmenopausal trainees.Also, 3% to 4% training effects were observed in the figure-8 running time (p=0.03) and grip strength (p=0.01).In conclusion, vigorous aerobic impact exercise training has potential to maintain bone structural strength and improve physical performance among breast cancer survivors.",0,0,0,0
23494582,"Transient swelling versus lymphoedema in the first year following surgery for breast cancer.PURPOSE: The aim was to better understand the incidence, time course and risk factors for swelling in the arm on the side of surgery over the first year following surgery for breast cancer.METHOD: Women (n = 160) were assessed 1 month following surgery and then randomised to the exercise or control group.Reassessment occurred 3, 9 and 15 months following surgery.Potential risk factors for swelling included age, body mass index, side of surgery and surgical and medical treatments for their breast cancer, physical measures of shoulder range of motion and strength, inter-limb arm circumference difference and the group to which they were randomised.Swelling was determined using bioimpedance spectroscopy with reference to previously established cut-offs for lymphoedema.RESULTS: The number of women with swelling at 3, 9 and 15 months was 15, 15 and 13, respectively; however, at 15 months only 5/13 presented with swelling in either of the preceding assessments.The risk of swelling increased at 3, 9 and 15 months for each centimetre increase in the baseline inter-limb difference in sum of arm circumferences by 1.30, 1.17 and 1.14.In addition, risk of swelling at 3 months was 2.6 times greater for women in the control group; at 9 months, 7 times greater for women who had taxane-based chemotherapy; and at 15 months, the risk increased 1.16 times for each day the drain was in situ.CONCLUSION: Swelling in the first year is likely to be transient, and factors including exercise and taxane chemotherapy affect the risk of developing swelling.",0,0,0,0

And 68.4, 30, and 45%, respectively, did not reach castration levels, considering a testosterone cutoff </= 20 ng/dl.CONCLUSIONS: There were no statistically significant differences in the levels of castration when comparing leuprolide 3.75 mg, leuprolide 7.5 mg, and goserelin 3.6 mg, altogether.When compared in groups of two, there was a statistically significant difference between leuprolide 3.75 mg and leuprolide 7.5 mg, the latter presented better results in reaching castration levels, cutoff </= 20 ng/dl.The importance of this difference, however, must be measured with caution, since the comparison of the three groups simultaneously did not reach the established significance level, even though it came close.",1,1,0,0
22710258,"The impact of healing touch on pediatric oncology patients.HYPOTHESES: Healing Touch (HT) is an energy therapy that has been shown to lower stress, pain, and fatigue in adult oncology patients.This study evaluated the feasibility of administering HT in pediatric oncology inpatient and outpatient units at Kapi'olani Medical Center for Women and Children.STUDY DESIGN: This study was a 1-year randomized prospective study consisting of 2 study arms.The HT arm was considered the treatment group, and reading/play activity was designated as the control group.Participants were randomly assigned to each arm on enrollment in the study.METHODS: They were recruited by the pediatric oncology social worker.Interested participants were asked to provide informed consent and were randomized to either the HT arm or the reading/play activity arm of the study.They received their designated intervention for 30 minutes at each inpatient or outpatient encounter.Participants, parents, and care providers were asked to complete preintervention and postintervention assessments.RESULTS: In all, 15 participants, aged 3 to 18 years old, were approached about the study between July 2009 and June 2010.A total of 9 participants enrolled (recruitment rate of 60%); 6 patients were randomized to receive HT sessions, and 3 patients received reading/play activities; 2 participants dropped out of the study because of prolonged hospitalizations and complicated treatments.An additional participant expired while in the study because of disease progression.Those in the HT group showed significant decreases in the scores for pain, stress, and fatigue for participants, parents, and caregivers.Furthermore, parents' perception of their children's pain decreased significantly for the HT group when compared with the group receiving reading/play activity.CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the feasibility of using energy therapy in the pediatric oncology patient population.There also seems to be an interest in this treatment modality for this patient population.Furthermore, these findings suggest that HT has a positive impact on pain, stress, and fatigue related to oncology treatment.",0,0,0,0
25449185,"Effects of yoga on cancer-related fatigue and global side-effect burden in older cancer survivors.BACKGROUND: Sixty percent of cancer survivors are 65years of age or older.Cancer and its treatments lead to cancer-related fatigue and many other side effects, in turn, creating substantial global side-effect burden (total burden from all side effects) which, ultimately, compromises functional independence and quality of life.Various modes of exercise, such as yoga, reduce cancer-related fatigue and global side-effect burden in younger cancer survivors, but no studies have specifically examined the effects of yoga on older cancer survivors.OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of a 4-week yoga intervention (Yoga for Cancer Survivors: YOCAS(c)(R)) on overall cancer-related fatigue, and due to its multidimensional nature, the subdomains of cancer-related fatigue (general, physical, emotional, and mental) and global side-effect burden in older cancer survivors.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis on data from a multicenter phase III randomized controlled clinical trial with 2 arms (standard care and standard care plus a 4-week YOCAS(c)(R) intervention).The sample for this secondary analysis was 97 older cancer survivors (>/=60years of age), between 2months and 2years post-treatment, who participated in the original trial.RESULTS: Participants in the YOCAS(c)(R) intervention arm reported significantly lower cancer-related fatigue, physical fatigue, mental fatigue, and global side-effect burden than participants in the standard care arm following the 4-week intervention period (p<0.05).CONCLUSIONS: YOCAS(c)(R) is an effective standardized yoga intervention for reducing cancer-related fatigue, physical fatigue, mental fatigue, and global side-effect burden among older cancer survivors.",0,0,0,0
22855579,"Thalidomide in total therapy 2 overcomes inferior prognosis of myeloma with low expression of the glucocorticoid receptor gene NR3C1.PURPOSE: Because dexamethasone remains a key component of myeloma therapy, we wished to examine the impact of baseline and relapse expression levels of the glucocorticoid receptor gene NR3C1 on survival outcomes in the context of treatment with or without thalidomide.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We investigated the clinical impact of gene expression profiling (GEP)-derived expression levels of NR3C1 in 351 patients with GEP data available at baseline and in 130 with data available at relapse, among 668 subjects accrued to total therapy 2 (TT2).RESULTS: Low NR3C1 expression levels had a negative impact on progression-free survival (PFS; HR, 1.47; P = 0.030) and overall survival (OS; HR, 1.90; P = 0.002) in the no-thalidomide arm.Conversely, there was a significant clinical benefit of thalidomide for patients with low receptor levels (OS: HR, 0.54; P = 0.015; PFS: HR, 0.54; P = 0.004), mediated most likely by thalidomide's upregulation of NR3C1.In the context of both baseline and relapse parameters, post-relapse survival (PRS) was adversely affected by low NR3C1 levels at relapse in a multivariate analysis (HR, 2.61; P = 0.012).CONCLUSION: These findings justify the inclusion of NR3C1 expression data in the work-up of patients with myeloma as it can significantly influence the choice of therapy and, ultimately, OS.The identification of an interaction term between thalidomide and NR3C1 underscores the importance of pharmacogenomic studies in the systematic study of new drugs.",0,0,0,0

25556937,"Opportunistic testing versus organized prostate-specific antigen screening: outcome after 18 years in the Goteborg randomized population-based prostate cancer screening trial.BACKGROUND: It has been shown that organized screening decreases prostate cancer (PC) mortality, but the effect of opportunistic screening is largely unknown.OBJECTIVE: To compare the ability to reduce PC mortality and the risk of overdiagnosis between organized and opportunistic screening.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Goteborg screening study invited 10 000 randomly selected men for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing every 2 yr since 1995, with a prostate biopsy recommended for men with PSA >/=2.5 ng/ml.The control group of 10 000 men not invited has been exposed to a previously reported increased rate of opportunistic PSA testing.Both groups were followed until December 31, 2012.OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Observed cumulative PC incidence and mortality rates in both groups were calculated using the actuarial method.Using historical data from 1990-1994 (pre-PSA era), we calculated expected PC incidence and mortality rates in the absence of any PSA testing.The number needed to invite (NNI) and the number needed to diagnose (NND) were calculated by comparing the expected versus observed incidence and mortality rates.RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: At 18 yr, 1396 men were diagnosed with PC and 79 men died of PC in the screening group, compared to 962 and 122, respectively, in the control group.In the screening group, the observed cumulative PC incidence/mortality was 16%/0.98% compared to expected values of 6.8%/1.7%.The corresponding values for the control group were 11%/1.5% and 6.9%/1.7%.Organized screening was associated with an absolute PC-specific mortality reduction of 0.72% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.50-0.94%) and relative risk reduction of 42% (95% CI 28-54%).There was an absolute reduction in PC deaths of 0.20% (95% CI -0.06% to 0.47%) and a relative risk reduction of 12% (95% CI -5 to 26%) associated with opportunistic PSA testing.NNI and NND were 139 (95% CI 107-200) and 13 for organized biennial screening and 493 (95% CI 213- -1563) and 23 for opportunistic screening.The extent of opportunistic screening could not be measured; incidence trends were used as a proxy.CONCLUSIONS: Organized screening reduces PC mortality but is associated with overdiagnosis.Opportunistic PSA testing had little if any effect on PC mortality and resulted in more overdiagnosis, with almost twice the number of men needed to be diagnosed to save one man from dying from PC compared to men offered an organized biennial screening program.PATIENT SUMMARY: Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening within the framework of an organized program seems more effective than unorganized screening.",0,0,0,0
24249435,"Double-blind, randomized, phase 2 trial of maintenance sunitinib versus placebo after response to chemotherapy in patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma.BACKGROUND: Angiogenesis contributes to the progression of urothelial carcinoma (UC).In the current study, the authors investigated the role of maintenance sunitinib in patients with advanced UC.METHODS: Patients with locally recurrent/metastatic UC and adequate organ function who achieved stable disease or a partial or complete response after 4 to 6 chemotherapy cycles were randomized to sunitinib at a dose of 50 mg/day (28 days on and 14 days off) or placebo.The primary endpoint was the 6-month progression rate.Secondary endpoints were safety, survival, change in serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/soluble VEGF receptor-2 (sVEGFR2), and the activity of sunitinib in patients who developed disease progression while receiving placebo.A total of 38 eligible patients per treatment arm were required to select better therapy with 90% probability (alpha = .05).RESULTS: A total of 54 eligible patients were randomized to either the sunitinib arm (26 patients) or the placebo arm (28 patients).The median number of cycles received was 2 cycles per treatment arm.The most common grade 3 to 4 adverse events (graded according to version 3.0 of the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) among patients receiving sunitinib were thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, mucositis, fatigue, and hypertension.There were no grade 3 or 4 adverse events noted among > 5% of patients receiving placebo.The 6-month progression rate was 72% versus 64%.The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 2.9 months (range, 0.5 months-32.5 months) versus 2.7 months (range, 0.8 months -65 months) for the sunitinib versus placebo arms, respectively.Patients receiving placebo were found to have no changes in their serum VEGF/sVEGFR2 levels over time.Patients treated with sunitinib had no significant change in their VEGF level, but the sVEGFR2 level significantly decreased after cycles 1 and 2 (P < .0001) and at the time of disease progression (P = .0002).A baseline VEGF level that was at or greater than the median was found to be correlated with a longer PFS.Sixteen patients who were receiving placebo received sunitinib at the time of disease progression, with the best responses being 1 partial response (6.3%), 6 cases of stable disease (37.5%), and 5 cases of progressive disease (31.3%); 4 patients were not evaluable for response.The median PFS was 3.7 months (range, 0.1 months-22 months).CONCLUSIONS: The current multicenter study was limited by premature closure and a small sample size.Maintenance sunitinib did not appear to improve the 6-month progression rate.Open-label sunitinib was found to have only modest activity.The sVEGFR2 level decreased among patients receiving sunitinib.",0,0,0,0
25349301,"Phase III study of iniparib plus gemcitabine and carboplatin versus gemcitabine and carboplatin in patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer.PURPOSE: There is a lack of treatments providing survival benefit for patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC), with no standard of care.A randomized phase II trial showed significant benefit for gemcitabine, carboplatin, and iniparib (GCI) over gemcitabine and carboplatin (GC) in clinical benefit rate, response rate, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).Here, we formally compare the efficacy of these regimens in a phase III trial.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with stage IV/locally recurrent TNBC who had received no more than two previous chemotherapy regimens for mTNBC were randomly allocated to gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m(2) and carboplatin area under the curve 2 (days 1 and 8) alone or GC plus iniparib 5.6 mg/kg (days 1, 4, 8, and 11) every 3 weeks.Random assignment was stratified by the number of prior chemotherapies.The coprimary end points were OS and PFS.Patients receiving GC could cross over to iniparib on progression.RESULTS: Five hundred nineteen patients were randomly assigned (261 GCI; 258 GC).In the primary analysis, no statistically significant difference was observed for OS (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.88; 95% CI, 0.69 to 1.12; P = .28) nor PFS (HR = 0.79; 95% CI, 0.65 to 0.98; P = .027).An exploratory analysis showed that patients in the second-/third-line had improved OS (HR = 0.65; 95% CI, 0.46 to 0.91) and PFS (HR = 0.68; 95% CI, 0.50 to 0.92) with GCI.The safety profile for GCI was similar to GC.CONCLUSION: The trial did not meet the prespecified criteria for the coprimary end points of PFS and OS in the ITT population.The potential benefit with iniparib observed in second-/third-line subgroup warrants further evaluation.",1,1,1,0
25524261,"Comparison of colonoscopic performance between medical and nurse endoscopists: a non-inferiority randomised controlled study in Asia.OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that trained nurse endoscopists are not inferior to medical endoscopists in finding adenomas during colonoscopy.DESIGN: This is a prospective, randomised, single-blind, non-inferiority study comparing nurses with medical endoscopists in performing screening colonoscopy.The nurse endoscopists had been trained according to the British Joint Advisory Group on GI Endoscopy curriculum and had completed at least 140 colonoscopic procedures prior to the study.The primary endpoint was the adenoma detection rate.Secondary endpoints included the caecal intubation rate, intubation time, complication rate, patient pain and satisfaction scores.RESULTS: We enrolled and analysed a total of 731 patients over a 15-month period.At least one adenoma was found in 159 (43.8%) of 363 patients by nurse endoscopists and 120 (32.7%) of 367 patients by medical endoscopists and a proportion difference of +11.1% compared with the medical endoscopists (95% CI 4.1% to 18.1%).The withdrawal time was, however, significantly longer among nurses (998 vs 575 s, p<0.001).After adjusting for differences in a regression analysis, colonoscopy by nurses was associated with a lower adenoma detection rate (OR 0.475: 95% CI 0.311 to 0.725).Nurse endoscopists had a lower caecal intubation rate (97.3% vs 100%), received better pain and satisfaction scores and had a high rate of patient acceptance.CONCLUSIONS: In this pragmatic trial, nurses can perform screening colonoscopy but require a longer procedural time to achieve a comparable adenoma detection rate as medical endoscopists.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT01923155.",0,0,0,0
24775812,"Efficacy and safety of fosfomycin-trometamol in the prophylaxis for transrectal prostate biopsy. Prospective randomized comparison with ciprofloxacin.OBJECTIVE: Prostate biopsy is the standardized diagnostic method for prostate cancer.However, although there is not a standardized protocol, there are recommendations in order to reduce the incidence of complications.The objective of the present work is to assess the efficacy and safety of antibiotic prophylaxis in the prostate biopsy by comparing two antibiotic regimes: two doses of fosfomycin-trometamol 3g (FMT) every 48 hours with 10 doses of oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg every 12 hours during 5 days.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Randomized prospective study was performed with 671 patients who had undergone to walking transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy.Patients of group A (n=312) were treated with ciprofloxacin, and patients of group B (n=359) with FMT.Efficacy and tolerability of two prophylactic regimes were compared.Urine culture was carried out at 2 weeks after biopsy.Initially, patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria were not treated with antibiotics; urine culture was repeated after 1 month, persistent bacteriuria was treated according to antibiogram.RESULTS: No differences between groups were found in age (P=.78), cancer presence (P=.9) or number of biopsy cylinders (P=.93).The mean number of cores obtained was 11.3 +/- 3.25 (range 6-20).Digestive intolerance was observed for 9 patients (2.9%) of group A and 10 patients (2.8%) in group B. One patient (.3%) of group A showed severe allergic reaction.In total, 167 patients (24.6%) had complications: 16 (2.4%) fever, 47 (6.9%) hemospermia, 81 (11.9%) hematuria, 7 (1%) rectal bleeding and 16 (2.4%) urinary retention.No statistically differences between groups were observed (27.6% vs. 22.6%; P=.17).However, hemospermia was more frequent in group A (9.9% vs. 4.5%; P=.006).Bacteriuria after biopsy was detected in 44 patients (6.6%), being more frequent in group B patients (4.2% vs. 8.6%; P=.02) although a higher number of second treatment cycles were not needed (53.9% vs. 29%; P=.17).The likelihood of resistance to ciprofloxacin in patients with bacteriuria in A was greater than that of FMT in B (69.2% vs. 41.9%; P=.0004).CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic prophylaxis with FMT (2 doses of 3g) in prostate biopsy is an alternative as effective and safe as ciprofloxacin (10 doses of 500 mg), which carries lower rate of resistance.According to our experience, this drug is a safe, well-tolerated, and easily manageable prophylactic option, facilitating patient compliance.More prospective multicenter studies are necessary to confirm these findings.",0,0,0,0

23182660,"Second-line pemetrexed versus docetaxel in Chinese patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer: a randomized, open-label study.INTRODUCTION: This randomized, open-label study compared pemetrexed versus docetaxel as second-line therapy for Chinese patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).The primary endpoint tested non-inferiority of overall survival (OS) on the combined data from these patients and those in the global registration trial.Data from patients in the current study only (Chinese patients) were the basis for the study's secondary objectives.METHODS: Patients with stage IIIB/IV disease were randomized (1:1) to receive pemetrexed (500 mg/m(2); 107 randomized; 106 treated) or docetaxel (75 mg/m(2); 104 randomized; 102 treated) on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle.Treatment continued until progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity or patient/investigator decision.All efficacy and safety data were analyzed at the pre-specified study completion; supplementary OS analyses were performed later, after additional events had been recorded.RESULTS: The primary endpoint of OS noninferiority of pemetrexed to docetaxel was not met, the lower CL was <50% and P>0.025 (efficacy retained=97.9% [95% CLs: 47.1, 141.9]; P=0.0276), in the combined population (pemetrexed: n=390, docetaxel: n=392).Supplementary values were 101.3% (95% CLs: 57.9, 148.8), P=0.0186.For the secondary objectives, assessed in the population from the current study (pemetrexed: n=107, docetaxel: n=104), median OS was 11.7 and 12.2 months for the pemetrexed and docetaxel arms, respectively (HR [95% CLs]: 1.14 [0.78, 1.68], P=0.492).Supplementary values were 11.4 and 11.5 months, respectively (HR [95% CLs]: 1.02 [0.74, 1.40], P=0.926).Median PFS values were 2.8 and 3.1 months (HR [95% CLs]: 1.05 [0.75, 1.46], P=0.770) and ORR values were 9.6% and 4.1% (odds ratio [95% CLs]: 2.50 [0.76, 8.25], P=0.133) for pemetrexed and docetaxel, respectively.Pemetrexed-treated patients had significantly fewer drug-related grade 3-4 adverse events (pemetrexed: 20.8%, docetaxel: 40.2%; P=0.003).Few drug-related serious adverse events were reported (pemetrexed: 5 patients, docetaxel: 8 patients).CONCLUSION: The comparable efficacy and superior tolerability of pemetrexed compared with docetaxel in this study supports the use of single-agent, second-line pemetrexed for advanced non-squamous NSCLC in Chinese patients.ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00391274.",0,0,0,0
24080607,"New harmonic scalpel versus conventional hemostasis in right colon surgery: a prospective randomized controlled clinical trial.BACKGROUND: The Harmonic Scalpel (HS) is a device that uses vibrations to coagulate and cut tissues simultaneously.Its advantages are represented by minimal lateral thermal tissue damage, less smoke formation, no neuromuscular stimulation and no transmission of electricity to the patient.METHODS: A total of 211 consecutive patients (113 men, 98 women; mean age 64 years) undergoing hemicolectomy for cancer of the right colon were divided into two groups, namely those in whom the operation was performed using a new HS handpiece (NHS; 108 patients) and those assigned to conventional hemostasis (CH; 103 patients).The two surgical groups were compared regarding patients' age and sex, tumor size, location, histotype and local invasiveness assessed by American Joint Cancer Committee stage, operative time, fluid content in the suction balloon (drainage volume) during the first 1-3 days after surgery, hospital stay and complications.RESULTS: Ultrasonic energy delivered through an HS has been shown to be safe and to produce minimal damage to the surrounding tissues because of its minimal heat production.Electrical devices allow hemostatic control in vessels up to 3 mm in diameter, while HS can coagulate vessels up to 5 mm in diameter; thus, HS allows not only better control of bleeding but also of lymphorrhea.In fact, the amount of fluid collected in the drainage was significantly lower in the NHS group compared to the CH group.Protein depletion influences the patient's regenerative capacity and thus also the occurrence of complications and recovery time.CONCLUSION: NHS is a useful device in colon surgery; it facilitates surgical maneuvers and reduces operative times and blood and lymphatic losses, allowing satisfactory maintenance of protein storage.This results in a lower incidence of complications and faster recovery by patients.",0,0,0,0

23479454,"Prostate cancer mortality in the Finnish randomized screening trial.BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer (PC) screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) has been shown to decrease PC mortality by the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC).We evaluated mortality results in the Finnish Prostate Cancer Screening Trial, the largest component of ERSPC.The primary endpoint was PC-specific mortality.METHODS: A total of 80 144 men were identified from the population registry and randomized to either a screening arm (SA) or a control arm (CA).Men in the SA were invited to serum PSA determination up to three times with a 4-year interval between each scan and referred to biopsy if the PSA concentration was greater than or equal to 4.0 ng/mL or 3.0 to 3.99 ng/mL with a free/total PSA ratio less than or equal to 16%.Men in the CA received usual care.The analysis covers follow-up to 12 years from randomization for all men.Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated for incidence and mortality using Cox proportional hazard model.All statistical tests were two-sided.RESULTS: PC incidence was 8.8 per 1000 person-years in the SA and 6.6 in the CA (HR = 1.34, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.27 to 1.40).The incidence of advanced PC was lower in the SA vs CA arm (1.2 vs 1.6, respectively; HR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.64 to 0.82; P < .001).For PC mortality, no statistically significant difference was observed between the SA and CA (HR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.69 to 1.04) (with intention-to-screen analysis).To avoid one PC death, we needed to invite 1199 men to screening and to detect 25 PCs.We observed no difference in all-cause mortality between trial arms.CONCLUSIONS: At 12 years, a relatively conservative screening protocol produced a small, non-statistically significant PC-specific mortality reduction in the Finnish trial, at the cost of moderate overdiagnosis.",0,0,0,0
24953333,"First-line pemetrexed plus cisplatin followed by gefitinib maintenance therapy versus gefitinib monotherapy in East Asian patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer: a randomised, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: In the Iressa Pan-ASia Study (IPASS), gefitinib claimed improved progression-free survival (PFS) versus carboplatin-paclitaxel in clinically selected lung cancer patients.The primary objective of this study was to assess the PFS of pemetrexed-cisplatin (PC) followed by gefitinib maintenance versus gefitinib monotherapy in an IPASS-like population.METHODS: In this open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial, eligible patients were 18 years, chemonaive, East Asian, light ex-smokers/never-smokers with advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1 and unknown epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation status who enrolled at 12 sites in Asia.Patients randomly received (1:1) pemetrexed (500 mg/m(2)) plus cisplatin (75mg/m(2)) for six 21-day cycles, followed by gefitinib maintenance or gefitinib monotherapy (250 mg/day).Patient tissue was retrospectively analysed for EGFR mutations.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01017874.FINDINGS: Between 23rd November 2009 and 27th April 2012, 253 patients entered, and 236 patients were randomly assigned to and treated with PC therapy (N=114) and gefitinib monotherapy (N=118).Between-arm baseline characteristics were balanced.PFS was not significantly different between treatment arms (p=0.217).The unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) was 0.85 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63-1.13).The HR should be cautiously interpreted as it was not constant.EGFR mutation status was determined for 74 tissue samples; 50 (67.6%) had mutations.In a pre-specified subgroup analysis, only the treatment-by-EGFR mutation interaction was significant (p=0.008) for PFS.For the entire treatment period, a higher proportion of patients in the PC/gefitinib arm versus gefitinib experienced possibly drug-related grade 3-4 treatment-emergent adverse events (39 of 114 [34%] versus 19 of 118 [16%]; p=0.002).INTERPRETATION: In the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, PFS was not significantly different.In the biomarker-assessable population, front-line EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor monotherapy was not efficacious in patients with wild-type EGFR.Identification of EGFR mutation status is key in the management of advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer.FUNDING: Eli Lilly and Company.",1,1,1,1
22134512,"A phase III study of late course accelerated hyperfractionated radiotherapy versus conventionally fractionated radiotherapy in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma.OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and toxicity of late course accelerated hyperfractionated radiotherapy (LCAF) with conventionally fractionated (CF) radiotherapy in the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).METHODS: Between March 1998 and November 2002, 200 eligible patients with NPC were randomized to receive either LCAF (48 Gy in 40 fractions, 2 fractions per day, 1.2 Gy/fraction, with an interval of >/=6 h, 5 d/wk, followed by 30 Gy in 20 fractions using 2 fractions per day, 1.5 Gy/fraction, 5 d/wk) or CF (35 fractions, 2.0 Gy/fraction/d, 5 d/wk, to a total dose of 70 Gy).RESULTS: All patients completed the treatment.Overall baseline characteristics of the study population of the 2 arms were well balanced.With a median follow-up of 6.9 years, the 5-year local control rate was higher in the LCAF arm (87.6% vs. 75.9%, P=0.044).The 5-year overall survival rates were 74.1% vs. 58.0% (P=0.024) for the LCAF arm and the CF arm, respectively.LCAF patients had a higher occurrence of acute mucositis and a more evident weight loss than CF patients, whereas incidence rates of radiation-induced damage to the central nervous system were similar in the 2 arms.CONCLUSIONS: LCAF achieved higher local control and overall survival rates than CF radiotherapy, without increasing radiation-related late complications such as cranial nerve palsy.",0,0,0,0
22705118,"Biweekly combination therapy with gemcitabine and carboplatin compared with gemcitabine monotherapy in elderly patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer: a randomized, phase-II study.INTRODUCTION: The strategy of chemotherapy in the elderly is controversial.We wanted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of biweekly gemcitabine and low-dose carboplatin combination therapy in elderly patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).METHODS: In this phase-II trial, chemotherapy-naive elderly patients (aged >/=76 years) with NSCLC were randomly treated with biweekly combination therapy with gemcitabine and carboplatin (1000 mg/m(2) gemcitabine and carboplatin at an area under the curve (AUC) of 3 on days 1 and 15, every 4 weeks) or gemcitabine monotherapy (1000 mg/m(2) on days 1, 8 and 15, every 4 weeks).The primary endpoint was overall response rate and analysis was based on intention-to-treat.RESULTS: Thirty-one patients were randomly assigned combination therapy and 30 were assigned monotherapy.The median age was 79.0 years.Response rate was 22.6% (95% confidence interval (CI): 11.4-39.8%) for biweekly combination therapy and 10.0% (95% CI: 3.5-25.6%) for monotherapy.Median progression-free survival in combination chemotherapy was 3.9 months (95% CI: 0.5-8.5 months), which was significantly longer that that in monotherapy (2.4 months, 95% CI: 0.5-6.7 months).The prevalence of hematological and non-hematological adverse events reaching grade 3/4 was not significantly different between combination therapy and monotherapy.CONCLUSIONS: Biweekly gemcitabine and low-dose carboplatin combination chemotherapy showed acceptable efficacy, toxicity, and tolerability in those aged >/=76 years with NSCLC.Further investigations with a large population are required to confirm our results.",1,1,1,0
