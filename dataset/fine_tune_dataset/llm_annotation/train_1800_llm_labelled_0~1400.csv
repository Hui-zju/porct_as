31200823,"Combination of icotinib and chemotherapy as first-line treatment for advanced lung adenocarcinoma in patients with sensitive EGFR mutations: A randomized controlled study.OBJECTIVE: To explore the efficacy and safety of icotinib with chemotherapy as first-line therapy for advanced lung adenocarcinoma in patients with sensitive epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations.METHODS: This prospective, randomized, controlled trial was conducted in 10 general hospitals in Shandong Province, China.Previously untreated patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma and sensitive EGFR mutations were recruited between January 16, 2014 and December 31, 2016 and randomly allocated to the combination group (icotinib plus pemetrexed and carboplatin) or the icotinib only group.The patients were followed up until May 23, 2018.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS).RESULTS: The efficacy analysis (intention-to-treat analysis) include 179 patients (n = 90 in the combination group and n = 89 in the icotinib only group).PFS was significantly longer in the combination group than in the icotinib only group (16.0 months vs. 10.0 months, hazard ratio [HR] = 0.59, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.42-0.84, P = 0.003).The objective response rate and the disease control rate for the combination group were significantly higher than those for the icotinib only group (77.8% vs. 64.0%, chi(2) = 4.094, P = 0.043; 91.1% vs. 79.8%, chi(2) = 4.632, P = 0.031).However, overall survival did not differ between the two groups (36.0 months vs. 34.0 months, HR = 0.81, 95%CI 0.54-1.22, P = 0.309).The incidence rates of leukopenia and liver function damage of grades 3-4 were higher in the combination group than in the icotinib only group (12.2% vs. 0%, chi(2) = 11.086, P = 0.001; 12.2% vs. 3.5%, chi(2) = 4.488, P = 0.034).However, adverse events were resolved in most patients.CONCLUSION: Use of the combination of icotinib and chemotherapy as first-line therapy significantly improved the PFS of advanced lung adenocarcinoma patients with sensitive EGFR mutations.Although the combination therapy increased the incidence of leukopenia and liver function damage, the observed adverse events were tolerable and manageable.",1,1,1,1
25257375,"High plasma ghrelin protects from coronary heart disease and Leu72Leu polymorphism of ghrelin gene from cancer in healthy adults during the 19 years follow-up study.The aim of our investigation was to find out if ghrelin concentrations or polymorphisms predict the future risk for cardiovascular diseases and cancer in a population-based cohort initiated in 1991 (491 hypertensive and 513 control subjects).Total mortality and hospital events were followed up for 19 years.Fasting total ghrelin concentrations were determined and Arg51Gln, Leu72Met and -501 A > C polymorphisms identified.Cox regression analysis was performed.The mean value in the control cohort was 674 pg/ml whereas in the hypertensive cohort it was 661 pg/ml.The associations found suggest that in the controls the highest ghrelin quartile protected from CHD (coronary heart disease).The results were significant without or with adjustments for age, sex, smoking, systolic blood pressure and LDL cholesterol, BMI, type 2 diabetes or QUICK index.C/C variant of the promoter associated with the prevention of IHD (ischemic heart disease) in the hypertensive group (p<0.05).The controls with the Leu72Leu genotype had less cancer (p<0.05).In conclusion, high plasma ghrelin concentration was related to protection from CHD and Leu72Leu genotype to prevention of cancer in healthy adults during the 19 years follow-up.C/C promoter protects from IHD in the hypertensive subjects.",0,0,0,0
27764906,"A Multicenter Randomized Phase II Study of Docetaxel vs. Docetaxel Plus Cisplatin vs. Docetaxel Plus S-1 as Second-Line Chemotherapy in Metastatic Gastric Cancer Patients Who Had Progressed after Cisplatin Plus Either S-1 or Capecitabine.PURPOSE: This study evaluated the re-challenge of S-1 or cisplatin in combination with docetaxel in metastatic gastric cancer (MGC) that had progressed on a cisplatin plus either S-1 or capecitabine regimen.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with progressive disease after first-line cisplatin plus S-1 or capecitabine were randomized to receive 3-week cycles of docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) intravenously (IV) on D1 (D), docetaxel 60 mg/m(2) IV plus cisplatin 60 mg/m(2) IV on D1 (DC), or docetaxel 60 mg/m(2) IV D1 plus oral S-1 30 mg/m(2) twice a day on D1-14 (DS).RESULTS: Seventy-two patients were randomized to the D (n=23), DC (n=24), or DS (n=25) group.The confirmed response rate was 4.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0% to 12.6%), 4.3% (95% CI, 0% to 12.6%), and 8.7% (95% CI, 0% to 20.2%) for the D, DC, and DS groups, respectively.Compared to the D arm, the DS arm had a better progression-free survival (2.7 months vs. 1.3 months, p=0.034) without any deterioration in safety or quality of life, whereas the DC arm had a similar progression-free survival (1.8 months vs. 1.3 months, p=0.804) and poorer overall survival (5.6 months vs. 10.0 months, p=0.035).CONCLUSION: A re-challenge with S-1, but not cisplatin, in combination with docetaxel has potential anticancer benefits over docetaxel alone in MGC with progression after prior cisplatin plus S-1 or capecitabine.",0,0,0,0
28958502,"Dacomitinib versus gefitinib as first-line treatment for patients with EGFR-mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (ARCHER 1050): a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Dacomitinib is a second-generation, irreversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor.We compared its efficacy and safety with that of the reversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib in the first-line treatment of patients with advanced EGFR-mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).METHODS: In this international, multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3 study (ARCHER 1050), we enrolled adults (aged >/=18 years or >/=20 years in Japan and South Korea) with newly diagnosed advanced NSCLC and one EGFR mutation (exon 19 deletion or Leu858Arg) at 71 academic medical centres and university hospitals in seven countries or special administrative regions.We randomly assigned participants (1:1) to receive oral dacomitinib 45 mg/day (in 28-day cycles) or oral gefitinib 250 mg/day (in 28-day cycles) until disease progression or another discontinuation criterion was met.Randomisation, stratified by race and EGFR mutation type, was done with a computer-generated random code assigned by a central interactive web response system.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival assessed by masked independent review in the intention-to-treat population.Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01774721, and is ongoing but no longer recruiting patients.FINDINGS: Between May 9, 2013, and March 20, 2015, 452 eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive dacomitinib (n=227) or gefitinib (n=225).Median duration of follow-up for progression-free survival was 22.1 months (95% CI 20.3-23.9).Median progression-free survival according to masked independent review was 14.7 months (95% CI 11.1-16.6) in the dacomitinib group and 9.2 months (9.1-11.0) in the gefitinib group (hazard ratio 0.59, 95% CI 0.47-0.74; p<0.0001).The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were dermatitis acneiform (31 [14%] of 227 patients given dacomitinib vs none of 224 patients given gefitinib), diarrhoea (19 [8%] vs two [1%]), and raised alanine aminotransferase levels (two [1%] vs 19 [8%]).Treatment-related serious adverse events were reported in 21 (9%) patients given dacomitinib and in ten (4%) patients given gefitinib.Two treatment-related deaths occurred in the dacomitinib group (one related to untreated diarrhoea and one to untreated cholelithases/liver disease) and one in the gefitinib group (related to sigmoid colon diverticulitis/rupture complicated by pneumonia).INTERPRETATION: Dacomitinib significantly improved progression-free survival over gefitinib in first-line treatment of patients with EGFR-mutation-positive NSCLC and should be considered as a new treatment option for this population.FUNDING: SFJ Pharmaceuticals Group and Pfizer.",1,1,1,1
28188670,"A randomized phase II trial of personalized peptide vaccine with low dose cyclophosphamide in biliary tract cancer.Since the prognosis of advanced biliary tract cancer (aBTC) still remains very poor, new therapeutic approaches, including immunotherapies, need to be developed.In the current study, we conducted an open-label randomized phase II study to test whether low dose cyclophosphamide (CPA) could improve antigen-specific immune responses and clinical efficacy of personalized peptide vaccination (PPV) in 49 previously treated aBTC patients.Patients with aBTC refractory to at least one regimen of chemotherapies were randomly assigned to receive PPV with low dose CPA (100 mg/day for 7 days before vaccination) (PPV/CPA, n = 24) or PPV alone (n = 25).A maximum of four HLA-matched peptides were selected based on the pre-existing peptide-specific IgG responses, followed by subcutaneous administration.T cell responses to the vaccinated peptides in the PPV/CPA arm tended to be greater than those in the PPV alone arm.The PPV/CPA arm showed significantly better progression-free survival (median time: 6.1 vs 2.9 months; hazard ratio (HR): 0.427; P = 0.008) and overall survival (median time: 12.1 vs 5.9 months; HR: 0.376; P = 0.004), compared to the PPV alone arm.The PPV alone arm, but not the PPV/CPA arm, showed significant increase in plasma IL-6 after vaccinations, which might be associated with inhibition of antigen-specific T cell responses.These results suggested that combined treatment with low dose CPA could provide clinical benefits in aBTC patients under PPV, possibly through prevention of IL-6-mediated immune suppression.Further clinical studies would be recommended to clarify the clinical efficacy of PPV/CPA in aBTC patients.",1,1,1,1
25081390,"NY-ESO-1 specific antibody and cellular responses in melanoma patients primed with NY-ESO-1 protein in ISCOMATRIX and boosted with recombinant NY-ESO-1 fowlpox virus.Vaccination strategies based on repeated injections of NY-ESO-1 protein formulated in ISCOMATRIX particles (NY-ESO-1 ISCOMATRIX) have shown to elicit combined NY-ESO-1 specific antibody and T cell responses.However, it remains unclear whether heterologous prime-boost strategies based on the combination with NY-ESO-1 ISCOMATRIX with different NY-ESO-1 boosting reagents could be used to increase NY-ESO-1 CD8(+) or CD4(+) T cell responses.To address this question, we carried out a randomized clinical trial in 39 high-risk, resected melanoma patients vaccinated with NY-ESO-1 ISCOMATRIX, and then boosted with repeated injections of either recombinant fowlpox virus encoding full length NY-ESO-1 (rF-NY-ESO-1) (Arm A) or NY-ESO-1 ISCOMATRIX alone (Arm B).We have comprehensively analyzed NY-ESO-1 specific T cells and B cells response in all patients before and after vaccination for a total of seven time points per patient.NY-ESO-1 ISCOMATRIX alone elicited a strong NY-ESO-1 specific CD4(+) T cell and antibody response, which was maintained by both regiments at similar levels.However, CD8(+) T cell responses were significantly boosted in 3 out of 18 patients in Arm A after the first rF-NY-ESO-1 injection and such responses were maintained until the end of the trial, while no patients in Arm B showed similar CD8(+) T cell responses.In addition, our results clearly identified immunodominant regions in the NY-ESO-1 protein: NY-ESO-179-102 and NY-ESO-1115-138 for CD4+ T cells and NY-ESO-185-108 for CD8+ T cells in a large proportion of vaccinated patients.These regions of NY-ESO-1 protein should be considered in future clinical trials as immunodominant epitopes.",1,1,1,1
29310613,"Efficacy of a telephone outcall program to reduce caregiver burden among caregivers of cancer patients [PROTECT]: a randomised controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Informal caregivers provide extended support to people with cancer but they receive little support from the health care system to assist them in their caring role.The aim of this single-blind, multi-centre, randomised controlled trial was to test the efficacy of a telephone outcall program to reduce caregiver burden and unmet needs, and improve psychological well-being among cancer caregivers, as well as evaluating the potential impact on patient outcomes.METHODS: Cancer patient/caregiver dyads (N = 216) were randomised to a telephone outcall program (n = 108) or attention control group (n = 108).The primary outcome was self-reported caregiver burden.Secondary endpoints included depressive symptoms, unmet needs, self-esteem, self-empowerment, and health literacy.Data were collected at baseline and at both 1 and 6 months post-intervention.An intention to treat analysis was performed.RESULTS: The intervention had no effect on the primary outcome (caregiver burden), but reduced the number of caregiver unmet needs (intervention group baseline, mean = 2.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) [1.91-3.54]; intervention group 1 month post intervention, mean = 0.85, 95%CI [0.42-1.44]; control group baseline, mean = 1.30 95%CI [0.80-1.94], control group 1 month post intervention, mean = 1.02 95%CI [0.52-1.69]; p = 0.023).For caregivers at risk for depression, the intervention had a significant effect on caregivers' confidence in having sufficient information to manage their health (p = 0.040).No effects were found for patients' depressive symptoms, unmet needs, self-empowerment, and other health literacy domains.CONCLUSIONS: While caregiver burden was not reduced, the outcall program was effective in reducing unmet needs in caregivers.Provision of cancer information and support via a telephone service may represent a feasible approach to reducing unmet needs among cancer caregiver populations.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ACTRN12613000731796 ; prospectively registered on 02/07/2013.",0,0,0,0
25196855,"Extramedullary relapse of acute leukemia after haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: incidence, risk factors, treatment, and clinical outcomes.We examined the incidence, risk factors, treatment, and clinical outcomes of extramedullary relapse (EMR) in 961 acute leukemia patients undergoing HLA-haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (haplo-HSCT) between 2002 and 2013.Multiple control subjects were selected at random from the same cohort and matched to EMR cases for diagnosis, disease status at HSCT, age at the time of the HSCT, and year of HSCT.Forty patients exhibited EMR, with a median time to EMR of 207 days.The cumulative incidence of EMR was 4.0% at 3 years, and the incidence was higher in acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients compared with acute myeloid leukemia patients (5.6% versus 2.4%).In the multivariate analysis, non-complete remission (CR) status at HSCT (hazard ratio [HR] = 4.6; P = .018) and non-chronic graft-versus-host disease after HSCT (HR = 3.2; P < .001) were the independent risk factors for EMR after haplo-HSCT.Twenty-seven patients received combination treatments, and the proportion of patients who achieved CR was higher than those who received single treatment.Multifocal involvement at EMR (HR = 2.7; P = .024) and non-CR after EMR treatments (HR = 4.6; P < .001) were the independent risk factors for poor survival rates among EMR patients.We found that graft-versus-leukemia effect may help to prevent EMR after haplo-HSCT.",0,0,0,0
25130401,"A randomized, open-label, multicentre, phase 2/3 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lumiliximab in combination with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab versus fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab alone in subjects with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.Lumiliximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody that targets CD23 on the surface of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) B-cells.Early phase clinical studies with lumiliximab alone and in combination with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab (FCR) established its potential efficacy and tolerability.The 152CL201 trial [Lumiliximab with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab (FCR) versus FCR alone in subjects with relapsed CLL; LUCID] was a phase 2/3, randomized (1:1), open-label, multicentre study of lumiliximab in combination with FCR versus FCR alone in patients with relapsed CLL.Six hundred and twenty-seven patients were randomized to either arm.Overall the combination of lumiliximab with FCR was not significantly better than FCR alone (overall response rate 71% vs. 72%, complete response rate 16% vs. 15%, median progression-free survival 24.6 vs. 23.9 months respectively, for FCR with and without lumiliximab).There was a slightly increased incidence of adverse events with lumiliximab but these increases did not appear to lead to differences in eventual outcomes.An interim analysis failed to show sufficient efficacy of the combination of lumiliximab with FCR.The study was therefore stopped early for lack of efficacy.Despite the eventual outcome, the LUCID trial is one of the largest studies that provides valuable insight into the efficacy and tolerability of FCR as a therapeutic option for patients with relapsed CLL.",1,1,1,1
22383680,"Influence of zoledronic acid on disseminated tumor cells in primary breast cancer patients.BACKGROUND: The presence of disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) in bone marrow of patients with early breast cancer (EBC) has been correlated with increased risk of metastatic disease or locoregional relapse.Zoledronic acid (ZOL) treatment has reduced DTCs in the bone marrow of patients with EBC in several studies.This controlled study sought to confirm these observations.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with EBC and DTC-positive bone marrow were randomized (N = 96) to treatment with ZOL plus adjuvant systemic therapy or adjuvant systemic therapy alone.The change in DTC numbers at 12 months versus baseline was measured.RESULTS: DTC-positive patients treated with ZOL were more likely to become DTC-negative after 12 months of treatment compared with the controls (67% versus 35%; P = 0.009).At 12 months, DTC counts decreased to a mean of 0.5 +/- 0.8 DTCs in the ZOL group and to 0.9 +/- 0.8 DTCs in the control group.In addition, ZOL was generally well tolerated.CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with ZOL improves elimination of DTCs.Further studies are needed to determine whether the reduction in DTCs by ZOL provides clinical benefit.",1,1,1,1
29070044,"Neoadjuvant everolimus plus letrozole versus fluorouracil, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide for ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer: study protocol for a randomized pilot trial.BACKGROUND: The response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) varies by estrogen receptor (ER) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) statuses, with responses being lower in ER-positive, HER2-negative tumors as compared with ER-negative, HER2-positive or triple-negative tumors.Neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (NET) is an attractive alternative to NAC for ER-positive, HER2-negative cancer.However, a prior trial comparing NET with standard NAC in ER-positive tumor showed that the difference of response was not significant.Studies demonstrated that the mTOR inhibitor everolimus could sensitize breast tumors to endocrine therapy.A pilot open-label, randomized trial has been designed to evaluate the feasibility, efficacy and tolerability of neoadjuvant everolimus plus letrozole versus NAC in treating postmenopausal women with ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer.METHODS: Forty postmenopausal women with non-metastatic ER-positive, HER2-negative invasive breast cancer with a primary tumor > 2 cm or positive axillary lymph node(s) proved by biopsy will be randomly (1:1) enrolled from Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital to receive neoadjuvant everolimus plus letrozole for 18 weeks or fluorouracil, epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide (FEC) for six cycles before surgery.Primary outcome is the feasibility of the trial.Secondary outcome measures include ultrasound response rate, pathological complete response rate, breast-conserving surgery rate, toxicities, and changes in the percentages of peripheral blood CD4(+) T cells, CD8(+) T cells, T helper cells, regulatory T cells, and NK cells.DISCUSSION: This is the first study to determine the feasibility, efficacy and tolerability of head-to-head neoadjuvant everolimus plus letrozole versus neoadjuvant FEC in treating postmenopausal women with ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer.The trial will provide evidence to assess the feasibility of a future multicenter, randomized controlled trial, and will provide valuable clinical data of the immunoregulatory effect of everolimus in breast cancer.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov registry, ID: NCT02742051 .Registered on 7 April 2016.",1,1,1,1
28743247,"A randomized phase II study of paclitaxel alone versus paclitaxel plus sorafenib in second- and third-line treatment of patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer (PASO).BACKGROUND: We conducted an open-label, randomized, two-arm multi-center study to assess the efficacy and safety of paclitaxel versus paclitaxel + sorafenib in patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer.METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive either paclitaxel monotherapy (80 mg/m(2)) weekly (3 weeks on, 1 week off) plus sorafenib 400 mg orally, twice a day taken continuously throughout 28 day cycles.Sorafenib dose was gradually escalated from a starting dose of 200 mg twice a day.The primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS).RESULTS: A pre-planned efficacy interim analysis was performed on the data of 60 patients, 30 patients in each treatment arm.Median PFS was estimated at 6.6 months (95% CI: 5.1 to 9.0) in patients randomized to single-agent paclitaxel (Arm A) and 5.6 months (95% CI: 3.8 to 6.5) in patients randomized to paclitaxel-sorafenib combination (Arm B) therapy.Contrary to the hypothesis, the treatment effect was statistically significant in favor of paclitaxel monotherapy (hazard ratio 1.80, 95% CI: 1.02 to 3.20; log-rank test P = 0.0409).It was decided to stop the trial early for futility.Median OS was also in favor of Arm A (20.7 months (95% CI: 16.4 to 26.7) versus 12.1 months (95% CI: 5.8 to 20.4) in Arm B. Clinical control was achieved in 28 patients (93.3%) in Arm A and in 21 patients 70.0% in Arm B. Overall response rate was met in 43.3% of patients in Arm A and in 40.0% in Arm B. Toxicities were increased in Arm B with higher rates of diarrhea, nausea, neutropenia, hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) and anorexia, Grad 3 and 4 toxicities were rare.CONCLUSIONS: In this pre-planned interim analysis, paclitaxel-sorafenib combination therapy was not found to be superior to paclitaxel monotherapy with regard to the primary end point, progression-free survival.The trial was therefore discontinued early.There was no indication of more favorable outcomes for combination therapy in secondary efficacy end points.As expected, the safety and toxicity profile of the combination therapy was less favorable compared to monotherapy.Overall, this trial did not demonstrate that adding sorafenib to second- or third-line paclitaxel provides any clinical benefit to patients with HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer.Cautious dosing using a sorafenib ramp up schedule might have contributed to negative results.TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered at EudraCT (No 2009-018025-73) and retrospectively registered at Clinical trials.gov on March 17, 2011 ( NCT01320111 ).",1,1,1,1

28743247,"A randomized phase II study of paclitaxel alone versus paclitaxel plus sorafenib in second- and third-line treatment of patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer (PASO).BACKGROUND: We conducted an open-label, randomized, two-arm multi-center study to assess the efficacy and safety of paclitaxel versus paclitaxel + sorafenib in patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer.METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive either paclitaxel monotherapy (80 mg/m(2)) weekly (3 weeks on, 1 week off) plus sorafenib 400 mg orally, twice a day taken continuously throughout 28 day cycles.Sorafenib dose was gradually escalated from a starting dose of 200 mg twice a day.The primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS).RESULTS: A pre-planned efficacy interim analysis was performed on the data of 60 patients, 30 patients in each treatment arm.Median PFS was estimated at 6.6 months (95% CI: 5.1 to 9.0) in patients randomized to single-agent paclitaxel (Arm A) and 5.6 months (95% CI: 3.8 to 6.5) in patients randomized to paclitaxel-sorafenib combination (Arm B) therapy.Contrary to the hypothesis, the treatment effect was statistically significant in favor of paclitaxel monotherapy (hazard ratio 1.80, 95% CI: 1.02 to 3.20; log-rank test P = 0.0409).It was decided to stop the trial early for futility.Median OS was also in favor of Arm A (20.7 months (95% CI: 16.4 to 26.7) versus 12.1 months (95% CI: 5.8 to 20.4) in Arm B. Clinical control was achieved in 28 patients (93.3%) in Arm A and in 21 patients 70.0% in Arm B. Overall response rate was met in 43.3% of patients in Arm A and in 40.0% in Arm B. Toxicities were increased in Arm B with higher rates of diarrhea, nausea, neutropenia, hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) and anorexia, Grad 3 and 4 toxicities were rare.CONCLUSIONS: In this pre-planned interim analysis, paclitaxel-sorafenib combination therapy was not found to be superior to paclitaxel monotherapy with regard to the primary end point, progression-free survival.The trial was therefore discontinued early.There was no indication of more favorable outcomes for combination therapy in secondary efficacy end points.As expected, the safety and toxicity profile of the combination therapy was less favorable compared to monotherapy.Overall, this trial did not demonstrate that adding sorafenib to second- or third-line paclitaxel provides any clinical benefit to patients with HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer.Cautious dosing using a sorafenib ramp up schedule might have contributed to negative results.TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered at EudraCT (No 2009-018025-73) and retrospectively registered at Clinical trials.gov on March 17, 2011 ( NCT01320111 ).",1,1,1,1

24661333,"Long-term tolerability and efficacy of degarelix: 5-year results from a phase III extension trial with a 1-arm crossover from leuprolide to degarelix.OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the safety and efficacy of up to 5 years of degarelix treatment and the effects of crossing over from leuprolide to degarelix in the extension phase of a phase III pivotal 1-year trial.METHODS: Patients receiving degarelix who completed the 1-year trial continued on 80 mg (n = 125) or 160 mg (n = 126) maintenance doses.Patients who received leuprolide were rerandomized to degarelix 240/80 mg (n = 69) or 240/160 mg (n = 65).Safety and tolerability were assessed (primary end point), as well as testosterone and prostate-specific antigen levels and prostate-specific antigen progression-free survival (secondary end points).RESULTS: Adverse event frequency was similar between both the groups.Adverse events included initial injection site reactions, hot flushes, and increased weight.Testosterone and prostate-specific antigen values during the extension study were similar to those seen during the 1-year trial in patients who continued on degarelix or crossed over from leuprolide.The prostate-specific antigen progression-free survival hazard rate was decreased significantly after the crossover in the leuprolide to degarelix group (from 0.20 to 0.09; P = .002), whereas in patients who continued on degarelix, the rate did not change significantly.In patients with baseline prostate-specific antigen >20 ng/mL, the same hazard rate change pattern was observed on crossover (from 0.38 to 0.19; P = .019).CONCLUSION: Degarelix was well tolerated; no safety concerns were identified.The significant prostate-specific antigen progression-free survival benefit established for degarelix over leuprolide during year 1 remained consistent at 5 years.",0,0,0,0
25284802,"Multicenter randomized controlled trial of percutaneous cryoablation versus radiofrequency ablation in hepatocellular carcinoma.UNLABELLED: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is considered a curative treatment option for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Growing data have demonstrated that cryoablation represents a safe and effective alternative therapy for HCC, but no randomized controlled trial (RCT) has been reported to compare cryoablation with RFA in HCC treatment.The present study was a multicenter RCT aimed to compare the outcomes of percutaneous cryoablation with RFA for the treatment of HCC.In all, 360 patients with Child-Pugh class A or B cirrhosis and one or two HCC lesions </= 4 cm, treatment-naive, without metastasis were randomly assigned to cryoablation (n = 180) or RFA (n = 180).The primary endpoints were local tumor progression at 3 years after treatment and safety.Local tumor progression rates at 1, 2, and 3 years were 3%, 7%, and 7% for cryoablation and 9%, 11%, and 11% for RFA, respectively (P = 0.043).For lesions >3 cm in diameter, the local tumor progression rate was significantly lower in the cryoablation group versus the RFA group (7.7% versus 18.2%, P = 0.041).The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates were 97%, 67%, and 40% for cryoablation and 97%, 66%, and 38% for RFA, respectively (P = 0.747).The 1-, 3-, and 5-year tumor-free survival rates were 89%, 54%, and 35% in the cryoablation group and 84%, 50%, and 34% in the RFA group, respectively (P = 0.628).Multivariate analyses demonstrated that Child-Pugh class B and distant intrahepatic recurrence were significant negative predictors for overall survival.Major complications occurred in seven patients (3.9%) following cryoablation and in six patients (3.3%) following RFA (P = 0.776).CONCLUSION: Cryoablation resulted in a significantly lower local tumor progression than RFA, although both cryoablation and RFA were equally safe and effective, with similar 5-year survival rates.",1,1,1,1
22844002,"Colposcopy referral rate can be reduced by high-risk human papillomavirus triage in the management of recurrent atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion cytology in Finland.The aim of this study was to establish whether a combination of high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) testing and cervical cytology could reduce colposcopy referral among women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion cytology.We randomized 598 women in the Helsinki area, Finland into three study groups.Different strategies of hrHPV testing, cytology and colposcopy with biopsy were used; subsequent hrHPV test results and cytological findings were compared with histology.The rates of hrHPV positivity and CIN2+ were compared.In total, 62.5% of all samples were hrHPV-positive.Altogether 45 (12.7%) CIN2 or worse (CIN2+) lesions were found in study groups A and B. Among hrHPV-positive women the rate of CIN2+ was 19.0% (n = 43), in contrast with 1.6% (n = 2) among hrHPV-negative women (relative risk = 12.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.6-81.1, P < 0.001).Among all hrHPV-negative women whose cytological findings were normal or ASCUS, dysplastic lesions were uncommon (n = 4/119, 3.4%), and all were CIN1.If these women had not been referred to colposcopy, the number of colposcopies would have been reduced by 33.6%.We conclude that hrHPV testing combined with repeat cervical cytology had a high negative predictive value in patients with recurrent low-grade cervical cytology.This could reduce the referral rate to colposcopy without jeopardizing patient safety.",0,0,0,0
24353113,"Randomized controlled trial on timing and number of sampling for bile aspiration cytology.BACKGROUND: The issue on timing and number of bile sampling for exfoliative bile cytology is still unsettled.METHODS: A total of 100 patients with cholangiocarcinoma undergoing resection after external biliary drainage were randomized into two groups: a 2-day group where bile was sampled five times per day for 2 days; and a 10-day group where bile was sampled once per day for 10 days (registered University Hospital Medical Information Network/ID 000005983).The outcome of 87 patients who underwent laparotomy was analyzed, 44 in the 2-day group and 43 in the 10-day group.RESULTS: There were no significant differences in patient characteristics between the two groups.Positivity after one sampling session was significantly lower in the 2-day group than in the 10-day group (17.0 +/- 3.7% vs. 20.7 +/- 3.5%, P = 0.034).However, cumulative positivity curves were similar and overlapped each other between both groups.The final cumulative positivity by the 10th sampling session was 52.3% in the 2-day group and 51.2% in the 10-day group.We observed a small increase in cumulative positivity after the 5th or 6th session in both groups.CONCLUSIONS: Bile cytology positivity is unlikely to be affected by sample time.",0,0,0,0
22258366,"Impact of a cancer clinical trials web site on discussions about trial participation: a cluster randomized trial.BACKGROUND: Cancer patients want access to reliable information about currently recruiting clinical trials.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Oncologists and their patients were randomly assigned to access a consumer-friendly cancer clinical trials web site [Australian Cancer Trials (ACT), www.australiancancertrials.gov.au] or to usual care in a cluster randomized controlled trial.The primary outcome, measured from audio recordings of oncologist-patient consultations, was the proportion of patients with whom participation in any clinical trial was discussed.Analysis was by intention-to-treat accounting for clustering and stratification.RESULTS: Thirty medical oncologists and 493 patients were recruited.Overall, 46% of consultations in the intervention group compared with 34% in the control group contained a discussion about clinical trials (P=0.08).The mean consultation length in both groups was 29 min (P=0.69).The proportion consenting to a trial was 10% in both groups (P=0.65).Patients' knowledge about randomized trials was lower in the intervention than the control group (mean score 3.0 versus 3.3, P=0.03) but decisional conflict scores were similar (mean score 42 versus 43, P=0.83).CONCLUSIONS: Good communication between patients and physicians is essential.Within this context, a web site such as Australian Cancer Trials may be an important tool to encourage discussion about clinical trial participation.",0,0,0,0

30247967,"Effectiveness of a Self-Care Toolkit for Surgical Breast Cancer Patients in a Military Treatment Facility.OBJECTIVE: To assess whether a self-care toolkit (SCT) provided to breast cancer patients undergoing surgery could mitigate distress and lessen symptoms associated with surgery.DESIGN: One hundred women with breast cancer, planning to undergo initial surgery, were randomly assigned to either one of two groups: treatment as usual (TAU; n = 49) or TAU with the addition of an SCT (n = 51).The SCT contained an MP3 player with audio-files of guided mind-body techniques (breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, meditation, guided imagery, and self-hypnosis) and acupressure antinausea wristbands.Anxiety, pain, nausea, sleep, fatigue, global health, and quality of life (QOL) were assessed using validated outcome measures.Two inflammatory blood markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR] and C-reactive protein [CRP]) were measured serially.Data were collected at baseline (T1), immediately before surgery (T2), within 10 h postoperatively (T3), and approximately 2 weeks postsurgery (T4).SETTINGS: Numerous studies have shown that psychological distress associated with a cancer diagnosis can affect pain perception and QOL.RESULTS: Between T1 and T4, there were significant between-group differences in Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-57 scores of Pain Interference, Fatigue, and Satisfaction with Social Roles, favoring the SCT group compared with TAU (p = 0.005, p = 0.023, and p = 0.021, respectively).There was a significant mean change in Defense and Veterans Pain Rating Scale (DVPRS) scores from T2 to T3, with the SCT group having significantly smaller increases in postoperative pain (p = 0.008) and in postoperative ESR (p = 0.0197) compared with the TAU group.Clinically significant reductions in anxiety occurred in the SCT group during the main intervention period.CONCLUSION: These results suggest that using the SCT in the perioperative period decreased pain perceptions, fatigue, and inflammatory cytokine secretion.",0,0,0,0
30303516,"NCI 8628: A randomized phase 2 study of ziv-aflibercept and high-dose interleukin 2 or high-dose interleukin 2 alone for inoperable stage III or IV melanoma.BACKGROUND: Interleukin 2 (IL-2) is a growth factor for T and natural killer cells, promotes proinflammatory cytokines, and can lead to durable responses in patients with melanoma.Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) promotes angiogenesis and modulates host innate and adaptive immunity.High VEGF levels were found to be associated with nonresponse to IL-2.Ziv-aflibercept may deplete VEGF and thereby enhance antitumor T-cell responses, thus supporting a combination immunotherapeutic strategy with IL-2.METHODS: NCI 8628 was a phase 2 trial of ziv-aflibercept and IL-2 (arm A) versus IL-2 alone (arm B) randomized at 2:1, respectively.Eligible patients had inoperable American Joint Committee on Cancer stage III or stage IV melanoma.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS).RESULTS: A total of 89 patients were enrolled and 84 patients were treated.The median follow-up was 41.4 months.Among treated patients (55 patients in arm A and 29 patients in arm B), PFS was significantly improved in favor of arm A, with a median of 6.9 months (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 4.1-8.7 months) versus 2.3 months (95% CI, 1.6-3.5 months) (P<.001).No significant difference was noted with regard to overall survival, with a median of 26.9 months (95% CI, 14.4-63.6 months) for arm A and 24.2 months (95% CI, 11.3-36.4 months) for arm B. The response rate (according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors [RECIST]) was 22% in arm A (4 complete responses [CRs] and 8 partial responses [PRs]) and 17% in arm B (1 CR and 4 PRs).Stable disease or PR or CR was noted in 65% of patients in arm A and 48% of patients in arm B. The combination was found to be superior to monotherapy in patients with high and low levels of serum VEGF and VEGF receptor 2.Adverse events were consistent with the expected profiles of monotherapy with IL-2 and ziv-aflibercept.CONCLUSIONS: Ziv-aflibercept and IL-2 were found to significantly improve PFS compared with IL-2 alone, thereby meeting the primary endpoint of the current study.These findings support further study of immunotherapeutic combination strategies involving VEGF inhibitors.",1,1,1,1
26946057,"BRCA1-like profile predicts benefit of tandem high dose epirubicin-cyclophospamide-thiotepa in high risk breast cancer patients randomized in the WSG-AM01 trial.BRCA1 is an important protein in the repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), which are induced by alkylating chemotherapy.A BRCA1-like DNA copy number signature derived from tumors with a BRCA1 mutation is indicative for impaired BRCA1 function and associated with good outcome after high dose (HD) and tandem HD DSB inducing chemotherapy.We investigated whether BRCA1-like status was a predictive biomarker in the WSG AM 01 trial.WSG AM 01 randomized high-risk breast cancer patients to induction (2x epirubicin-cyclophosphamide) followed by tandem HD chemotherapy with epirubicin, cyclophosphamide and thiotepa versus dose dense chemotherapy (4x epirubicin-cyclophospamide followed by 3x cyclophosphamide-methotrexate-5-fluorouracil).We generated copy number profiles for 143 tumors and classified them as being BRCA1-like or non-BRCA1-like.Twenty-six out of 143 patients were BRCA1-like.BRCA1-like status was associated with high grade and triple negative tumors.With regard to event-free-survival, the primary endpoint of the trial, patients with a BRCA1-like tumor had a hazard rate of 0.2, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.07-0.63, p = 0.006.In the interaction analysis, the combination of BRCA1-like status and HD chemotherapy had a hazard rate of 0.19, 95% CI: 0.067-0.54, p = 0.003.Similar results were observed for overall survival.These findings suggest that BRCA1-like status is a predictor for benefit of tandem HD chemotherapy with epirubicin-thiotepa-cyclophosphamide.",1,1,1,1

23442174,"Monitoring laparoscopic radiofrequency renal lesions in real time using contrast-enhanced ultrasonography: an open-label, randomized, comparative pilot trial.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has been considered as an important therapy for small renal lesions.The main limitation of RFA, however, is the lack of pathologic confirmation of complete tumor eradication.A single center, open label, randomized pilot study was designed to evaluate whether contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) with Sonovue, performed in real time could allow us to determine the end point during laparoscopic radiofrequency ablation (LRFA) and the clinical outcome of this method.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ninety-six patients undergoing LRFA were randomly assigned to CEUS or a control group; finally, 38 and 40 patients with a pathologic diagnosis of renal-cell carcinoma completed a 3-month follow-up.CEUS was conducted in real time during the procedure to determine the end point in the CEUS group.The primary outcome was the incomplete ablation rate according to a radiographic image at 3 months after the procedure.The secondary outcome included the local tumor control rate and disease-free survival rate.RESULTS: There were no differences in the incomplete ablation rate and disease-free survival rate between the two groups.Within a median 16-month follow-up period, three incomplete ablations and two local recurrences according to a radiographic image were found in the control group.Meanwhile, there was no incomplete ablation or recurrence but one lung metastasis in the CEUS group.The local tumor control rate was 87.5% (35/40) in the control group vs 100% (38/38) (P=0.073) in the CEUS group.CONCLUSION: In patients undergoing LRFA, there were no differences in the incomplete ablation rate and local tumor control rate between the CEUS group and the control group in our study despite a nonsignificant trend in favor of CEUS.CEUS may have the potential to provide more effective renal tumor ablation.These novel data support the need for a larger study of CEUS during LRFA surgery.",0,0,0,0

29299592,"Chemoprevention of Basal and Squamous Cell Carcinoma With a Single Course of Fluorouracil, 5%, Cream: A Randomized Clinical Trial.Importance: Keratinocyte carcinoma (ie, cutaneous basal and squamous cell carcinoma) is the most common cancer in the United States.Objective: To determine whether topical fluorouracil could prevent surgically treated keratinocyte carcinoma.Design, Setting, and Participants: The Veterans Affairs Keratinocyte Carcinoma Chemoprevention Trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of topical fluorouracil for chemoprevention of keratinocyte carcinoma.Participants were recruited from May 2009 to September 2011 from 12 Veterans Affairs medical centers and followed until June 30, 2013.Participants were veterans (n = 932) with a history of at least 2 keratinocyte carcinomas in the past 5 years; almost all were white males and the median age was 70 years.Interventions: Application of fluorouracil, 5%, (n = 468) or vehicle control cream (n = 464) to the face and ears twice daily for 2 to 4 weeks upon randomization.Main Outcomes and Measures: Surgically treated keratinocyte, basal cell, and squamous cell carcinoma risk on the face and ears in the first year after enrollment; and time to first surgically treated keratinocyte, basal cell, and squamous cell carcinoma.The a priori hypothesis was that fluorouracil would be effective in preventing these cancers.Results: Of 932 participants (916 men [98%]; 926 white [99%]; median age, 70 years), 299 developed a basal cell carcinoma end point (95 in year 1) and 108 developed a squamous cell carcinoma end point (25 in year 1) over 4 years (median follow-up, 2.8 years).Over the entire study, there was no difference between treatment groups in time to first keratinocyte, basal cell, or squamous cell carcinoma.During the first year, however, 5 participants (1%) in the fluorouracil group developed a squamous cell carcinoma vs 20 (4%) in the control group, a 75% (95% CI, 35%-91%) risk reduction (P = .002).The 11% reduction in basal cell carcinoma risk during year 1 (45 [10%] in the fluorouracil group vs 50 [11%] in the control group) was not statistically significant (95% CI, 39% reduction to 31% increase), nor was there a significant effect on keratinocyte carcinoma risk.However, a reduction in keratinocyte carcinomas treated with Mohs surgery was observed.Conclusions and Relevance: A conventional course of fluorouracil to the face and ears substantially reduces surgery for squamous cell carcinoma for 1 year without significantly affecting the corresponding risk for basal cell carcinoma.Trial Registration: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00847912.",0,0,0,0
22546317,"Evaluating the Ozioma cancer news service: a community randomized trial in 24 U.S. cities.OBJECTIVE: This community randomized trial evaluated effects of the Ozioma News Service on the amount and quality of cancer coverage in Black weekly newspapers in 24 U.S. cities.METHOD: We created and operated Ozioma, the first cancer information news service specifically for Black newspapers.Over 21 months, Ozioma developed community- and race-specific cancer news releases for each of 12 Black weekly newspapers in intervention communities.Cancer coverage in these papers was tracked before and during the intervention and compared to 12 Black newspapers in control communities.RESULTS: From 2004 to 2007, we coded 9257 health and cancer stories from 3178 newspaper issues.Intervention newspapers published approximately 4 times the expected number of cancer stories compared to control newspapers (p(12,21 mo)<.01), and also saw an increase in graphics (p(12,21 mo)<.01), local relevance (p(12 mo)=.01), and personal mobilization (p(12 mo)<.10).However, this increased coverage supplanted other health topics and had smaller graphics (NS), had less community mobilization (p(21 mo)=.01), and is less likely to be from a local source (NS).CONCLUSION: Providing news releases with localized and race-specific features to minority-serving media outlets can increase the quantity of cancer coverage.Results are mixed for the journalistic and public health quality of this increased cancer coverage in Black newspapers.",0,0,0,0
22614994,"Reach out to enhance wellness home-based diet-exercise intervention promotes reproducible and sustainable long-term improvements in health behaviors, body weight, and physical functioning in older, overweight/obese cancer survivors.PURPOSE: Diet and exercise interventions have been tested in cancer survivors as a means to reduce late effects and comorbidity, but few have assessed adherence and health outcomes long term.METHODS: Between July 2005 and May 2007, the Reach Out to Enhance Wellness (RENEW) trial accrued 641 locoregionally staged, long-term (>/= 5 years from diagnosis) colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer survivors in the United States (21 states), Canada, and the United Kingdom.All participants were sedentary (< 150 minutes of physical activity [PA] a week), overweight or obese (body mass index, 25 to 40 kg/m(2)), and over age 65 years.The trial tested a diet-exercise intervention delivered via mailed print materials and telephone counseling.RENEW used a wait-list control, cross-over design (ie, participants received the year-long intervention immediately or after a 1-year delay), which allowed the opportunity to assess program efficacy (previously reported primary outcome), durability, and reproducibility (reported herein).Measures included diet quality (DQ), PA, BMI, and physical function (PF).RESULTS: No significant relapse was observed in the immediate-intervention arm for DQ, PA, and BMI; however, rates of functional decline increased when the intervention ceased.From year 1 to year 2, significant improvements were observed in the delayed-intervention arm; mean change scores in behaviors and BMI and PF slopes were as follows: DQ score, 5.2 (95% CI, 3.4 to 7.0); PA, 45.8 min/wk (95% CI, 26.9 to 64.6 min/wk); BMI, -0.56 (95% CI, -0.75 to -0.36); and Short Form-36 PF, -1.02 versus -5.52 (P < .001 for all measures).Overall, both arms experienced significant improvements in DQ, PA, and BMI from baseline to 2-year follow-up (P < .001).CONCLUSION: Older cancer survivors respond favorably to lifestyle interventions and make durable changes in DQ and PA that contribute to sustained weight loss.These changes positively reorient functional decline trajectories during intervention delivery.",1,1,0,0
24584876,"Biomarker prediction of chemotherapy-related amenorrhea in premenopausal women with breast cancer participating in E5103.This study aimed to investigate whether pre-chemotherapy anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) is a biomarker for chemotherapy-related amenorrhea (CRA) in breast cancer patients.A multicenter randomized controlled trial, ECOG5103, assigned patients with early stage breast cancer to standard doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel with either placebo or one of two durations of bevacizumab therapy.Five hundred ninety-one patients were part of the decision-making/quality of life substudy, in which there were surveys from baseline through 18-month follow-up.One hundred twenty-four women were included in this analysis of menses data because they were premenopausal at enrollment, responded to the 12-month survey, had not undergone bilateral oophorectomy or ovarian function suppression before that survey, and had serum banked for research before chemotherapy.One hundred of the 124 also responded to the 18-month survey.Median age was 45 years (range 25-55), and median serum AMH level was 0.11 ng/mL (range 0.01-8.63) prior to treatment.Eighty-two percent had CRA at 12 months, and 81 % at 18 months.In multivariate analyses, older age (p = 0.0003) was the only statistically significant predictor of 12-month CRA, but at 18-months, lower pre-chemotherapy AMH (p = 0.04) and older age (p = 0.008) were both statistically significant predictors of CRA.Race, bevacizumab therapy, and tamoxifen use were not statistically significantly associated with CRA after adjustment for AMH and age.Pre-chemotherapy AMH level is a potential novel biomarker for CRA in premenopausal women with early stage breast cancer.Further research to evaluate the clinical utility of AMH testing is warranted.",0,0,0,0

24573743,"A phase II open-label randomized multicenter trial of TSU-68 in combination with S-1 and oxaliplatin versus S-1 in combination with oxaliplatin in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide.The combination of oxaliplatin-based treatments (oxaliplatin plus infusional 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin [FOLFOX] or oxaliplatin plus capecitabine [CapeOX]) and bevacizumab is a standard chemotherapy regimen for metastatic CRC (mCRC).However, several clinical studies that tested S-1 plus oxaliplatin (SOX) indicate that SOX is also a treatment option for mCRC.TSU-68 is an oral compound that inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptor and platelet-derived growth factor receptor.The recommended dose of TSU-68 + SOX was previously determined in a phase I study of mCRC patients.The goal of this trial was to evaluate the efficacy of TSU-68 in combination with SOX.METHODS: This open-label multicenter randomized phase II trial was performed in Korea.Treatment-naive mCRC patients with a performance status of 0 or 1 were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either TSU-68 + SOX or SOX alone.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS).RESULTS: A total of 105 patients (TSU-68 + SOX, 52 patients; SOX alone, 53 patients) were randomized.The median PFS was 7.0 months in the TSU-68 + SOX group (hazard ratio [HR], 1.057) and 7.2 months in the SOX group (p = 0.8401).The most frequent grade 3 and 4 adverse events were thrombocytopenia (9.6 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 26.4 % [SOX]), neutropenia (13.5 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 15.1 % [SOX]), and anemia (3.8 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 13.2 % [SOX]).We observed a difference between the 2 groups for all grades of anemia (15.4 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 32.1 % [SOX]), diarrhea (30.8 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 47.2 % [SOX]), vomiting (50.0 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 26.4 % [SOX]), and chromaturia (23.1 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 0.0 % [SOX]).Analysis using a Cox proportional hazard model showed that baseline interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels were associated with a survival benefit of TSU-68 (p = 0.012).CONCLUSION: TSU-68 + SOX had a favorable safety profile.However, TSU-68 did not have a synergistic effect on the efficacy of SOX.The baseline serum IL-6 level could be a prognostic factor for TSU-68 efficacy.",1,1,1,1

28352657,"Randomized, placebo-controlled window trial of EGFR, Src, or combined blockade in head and neck cancer.BACKGROUND.EGFR and Src family kinases are upregulated in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).EGFR interacts with Src to activate STAT3 signaling, and dual EGFR-Src targeting is synergistic in HNSCC preclinical models.pSrc overexpression predicted resistance to the EGFR inhibitor, erlotinib, in a prior window trial.We conducted a 4-arm window trial to identify biomarkers associated with response to EGFR and/or Src inhibition.METHODS.Patients with operable stage II-IVa HNSCC were randomized to 7-21 days of neoadjuvant erlotinib, the Src inhibitor dasatinib, the combination of both, or placebo.Paired tumor specimens were collected before and after treatment.Pharmacodynamic expression of EGFR and Src pathway components was evaluated by IHC of tissue microarrays and reverse-phase protein array of tissue lysates.Candidate biomarkers were assessed for correlation with change in tumor size.RESULTS.From April 2009 to December 2012, 58 patients were randomized and 55 were treated.There was a significant decrease in tumor size in both erlotinib arms (P = 0.0014); however, no effect was seen with dasatinib alone (P = 0.24).High baseline pMAPK expression was associated with response to erlotinib (P = 0.03).High baseline pSTAT3 was associated with resistance to dasatinib (P = 0.099).CONCLUSIONS.Brief exposure to erlotinib significantly decreased tumor size in operable HNSCC, with no additive effect from dasatinib.Baseline pMAPK expression warrants further study as a response biomarker for anti-EGFR therapy.Basal expression of pSTAT3 may be independent of Src, explain therapeutic resistance, and preclude development of dasatinib in biomarker-unselected cohorts.TRIAL REGISTRATION.NCT00779389.FUNDING.National Cancer Institute, American Cancer Society, Pennsylvania Department of Health, V Foundation for Cancer Research, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Astellas Pharma.",1,1,1,1
31501084,"Regression Discontinuity Analysis of Salvage Radiotherapy in Prostate Cancer.There is a lack of randomized evidence comparing early (eSRT) to late (lSRT) salvage radiotherapy (SRT) after radical prostatectomy (RP) for prostate cancer (PCa).Moreover, the existing evidence is often affected by lead-time bias.We sought to address this gap in a cohort of 1458 PCa patients undergoing SRT for biochemical recurrence (BCR) after RP in two tertiary care centers between 1992 and 2013.Using a quasi-randomized study design known as regression discontinuity (RD) and adjusting for lead-time bias, we compared metastasis-free survival (MFS) at 5 and 10years after surgery between eSRT (prostate-specific antigen [PSA] <0.5ng/ml) and lSRT (PSA>/=0.5ng/ml).Overall, 1049 patients (71.9%) underwent eSRT and 409 (28.1%) lSRT at a mean follow-up of 84 mo (interquartile range (IQR) 52-120.4).The MFS rate decreased nonsignificantly at the proposed cutoff by 0.04 (95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.06 to 0.19) at 5years and by 0.07 (95% CI:-0.12 to 0.32) at 10years.Cox regression analysis revealed a hazard ratio for the cutoff examined of 1.3 (95% CI: 0.8-2.4; p=0.2).In conclusion, in a quasirandomized study design accounting for lead-time bias, eSRT (PSA<0.5ng/ml) did not improve MFS.Our results underline the need for level-one evidence to compare eSRT and lSRT.PATIENT SUMMARY: We compared early versus late salvage radiotherapy (SRT) for biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy by simulating a randomized trial.We found that early SRT (initiated at prostate-specific antigen <0.5ng/ml) compared to late SRT did not improve metastasis-free survival.",0,0,0,0
25795410,"Nivolumab versus chemotherapy in patients with advanced melanoma who progressed after anti-CTLA-4 treatment (CheckMate 037): a randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Nivolumab, a fully human IgG4 PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor antibody, can result in durable responses in patients with melanoma who have progressed after ipilimumab and BRAF inhibitors.We assessed the efficacy and safety of nivolumab compared with investigator's choice of chemotherapy (ICC) as a second-line or later-line treatment in patients with advanced melanoma.METHODS: In this randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 3 trial, we recruited patients at 90 sites in 14 countries.Eligible patients were 18 years or older, had unresectable or metastatic melanoma, and progressed after ipilimumab, or ipilimumab and a BRAF inhibitor if they were BRAF(V 600) mutation-positive.Participating investigators randomly assigned (with an interactive voice response system) patients 2:1 to receive an intravenous infusion of nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks or ICC (dacarbazine 1000 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks or paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2) combined with carboplatin area under the curve 6 every 3 weeks) until progression or unacceptable toxic effects.We stratified randomisation by BRAF mutation status, tumour expression of PD-L1, and previous best overall response to ipilimumab.We used permuted blocks (block size of six) within each stratum.Primary endpoints were the proportion of patients who had an objective response and overall survival.Treatment was given open-label, but those doing tumour assessments were masked to treatment assignment.We assessed objective responses per-protocol after 120 patients had been treated with nivolumab and had a minimum follow-up of 24 weeks, and safety in all patients who had had at least one dose of treatment.The trial is closed and this is the first interim analysis, reporting the objective response primary endpoint.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01721746.FINDINGS: Between Dec 21, 2012, and Jan 10, 2014, we screened 631 patients, randomly allocating 272 patients to nivolumab and 133 to ICC.Confirmed objective responses were reported in 38 (31.7%, 95% CI 23.5-40.8) of the first 120 patients in the nivolumab group versus five (10.6%, 3.5-23.1) of 47 patients in the ICC group.Grade 3-4 adverse events related to nivolumab included increased lipase (three [1%] of 268 patients), increased alanine aminotransferase, anaemia, and fatigue (two [1%] each); for ICC, these included neutropenia (14 [14%] of 102), thrombocytopenia (six [6%]), and anaemia (five [5%]).We noted grade 3-4 drug-related serious adverse events in 12 (5%) nivolumab-treated patients and nine (9%) patients in the ICC group.No treatment-related deaths occurred.INTERPRETATION: Nivolumab led to a greater proportion of patients achieving an objective response and fewer toxic effects than with alternative available chemotherapy regimens for patients with advanced melanoma that has progressed after ipilimumab or ipilimumab and a BRAF inhibitor.Nivolumab represents a new treatment option with clinically meaningful durable objective responses in a population of high unmet need.FUNDING: Bristol-Myers Squibb.",1,1,1,1

27977890,"Scissor-type knife significantly improves self-completion rate of colorectal endoscopic submucosal dissection: Single-center prospective randomized trial.BACKGROUND AND AIM: Colorectal endoscopic submucosal dissection (C-ESD) is recognized as a difficult procedure.Recently, scissors-type knives were launched to reduce the difficulty of C-ESD.The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combined use of a scissors-type knife and a needle-type knife with a water-jet function (WJ needle-knife) for C-ESD compared with using the WJ needle-knife alone.METHODS: This was a prospective randomized controlled trial in a referral center.Eighty-five patients with superficial colorectal neoplasms were enrolled and randomly assigned to undergo C-ESD using a WJ needle-knife alone (Flush group) or a scissor-type knife-supported WJ needle-knife (SB Jr group).Procedures were conducted by two supervised residents.Primary endpoint was self-completion rate by the residents.RESULTS: Self-completion rate was 67% in the SB Jr group, which was significantly higher than that in the Flush group (39%, P = 0.01).Even after exclusion of four patients in the SB Jr group in whom C-ESD was completed using the WJ needle-knife alone, the self-completion rate was significantly higher (63% vs 39%; P = 0.03).Median procedure time among the self-completion cases did not differ significantly between the two groups (59 vs 51 min; P = 0.14).No fatal adverse events were observed in either group.CONCLUSIONS: In this single-center phase II trial, scissor-type knife significantly improved residents' self-completion rate for C-ESD, with no increase in procedure time or adverse events.A multicenter trial would be warranted to confirm the validity of the present study.",1,1,0,0
23542954,"Randomized controlled trial of a clinic-based survivorship intervention following adjuvant therapy in breast cancer survivors.In 2006, the IOM released a report citing the importance of ""survivorship plans"" to improve quality of life and care coordination for cancer survivors, but little has been done to evaluate their efficacy.Women with early-stage breast cancer were randomized within 6 weeks of completing adjuvant therapy to a survivorship intervention group (SI) or control group (CG).All subjects were given the NCI publication, ""Facing Forward: Life after Cancer Treatment."" The SI also met with a nurse/nutritionist to receive a treatment summary, surveillance, and lifestyle recommendations.Both groups completed questionnaires on the impact of cancer (IOC), patient satisfaction (FACIT-TS-PS), and assessment of survivor concerns (ASC) at baseline, 3 and 6 months.Within and between group t tests and linear regression analyses were performed.Among 126 women (60 CG, 66 SI), mean age was 54 years, 48 % were Hispanic, and the groups were well-balanced by baseline characteristics.No significant differences between the CG and SI on the FACIT-TS-PS or IOC at 3 and 6 months were seen.The ASC health worry subscale was lower (less worry) in the SI compared to CG (p = 0.02).At all time-points, Hispanic women had higher (worse) health worry (p = 0.0008), social-life interference (p = 0.009), and meaning of cancer scales (p = 0.0004), and more trust in medical professionals (p = 0.03) compared to non-Hispanic women.While the SI did not lead to significant improvements in most patient-reported outcomes, it was associated with decreased health worry.Future interventions should determine the most efficient and effective method for delivering survivorship care plans.",0,0,0,0
30829271,"Comparison of resection margins and cosmetic outcome following intraoperative ultrasound-guided excision versus conventional palpation-guided breast conservation surgery in breast cancer: A randomized controlled trial.INTRODUCTION: Use of intraoperative ultrasound (IOUS) has been shown to help achieve satisfactory cosmesis and negative margins in breast conserving surgery (BCS).This study has been done to compare the oncological and cosmetic outcomes following BCS using conventional palpatory method and IOUS.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a prospective randomized controlled trial conducted at a tertiary care teaching and research institute in India.Patients with early operable breast cancer willing for BCS were included.Tumors were excised with 1 cm margin.In palpatory group, tumor was palpated and 1 cm margin was taken with a measuring scale while in the second group, IOUS was used to mark the margins.Histopathological evaluation was done to assess margins and cosmesis was assessed by patient, resident doctor, and nurse independently.RESULTS: Sixty patients were included, 32 in the ultrasonography-guided and 28 in palpation-guided wide local excision.The mean age of patients was 48.78 years.In both groups, mean tumor size was 3.18 cm.Margin thickness and positivity was higher in palpatory group (though P > 0.05).Most patients were satisfied with cosmesis.There was no significant difference in complications and specimen volume in both groups.Presence of ductal carcinoma in situ component and expression of Her2neu by tumor cells had a significant impact on margin positivity.CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative use of ultrasound offers a real-time assessment of margin status and may reduce the margin positivity rate compared to conventional palpation-guided method.",0,0,0,0
28274672,"The role of screening expectations in modifying short-term psychological responses to low-dose computed tomography lung cancer screening among high-risk individuals.OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the relationship between pre-screening expectations and psychological responses to low-dose computerised tomography (LDCT) screening among high-risk individuals in the United Kingdom Lung Cancer Screening (UKLS) pilot trial.METHODS: Prior to screening, high-risk individuals randomised into the intervention arm of the UKLS were asked about their expected screening test result.Their actual LDCT scan result was compared with their baseline screening expectation to determine the level of congruence.Levels of concern about and perceived accuracy of the result were assessed in a questionnaire two weeks following receipt of their test result.RESULTS: The sample included 1589 participants.Regardless of their expected results, patients who required follow-up investigations after their initial LDCT scan were the most concerned about their result (p<0.001).Participants who expected to require follow-up, but did not need it, perceived the test to be least accurate (p=0.006).CONCLUSIONS: Lung cancer screening participants who require follow-up or who have unexpected negative results can be identified for supportive interventions.PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: These findings can be used to ensure that any future LDCT lung cancer screening programme is tailored to identify and support those high-risk individuals who may benefit from additional help.",0,0,0,0
29534639,"Cytokeratin-18 fragments predict treatment response and overall survival in gastric cancer in a randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer is common malignancy and exhibits a poor prognosis.At the time of diagnosis, the majority of patients present with metastatic disease which precludes curative treatment.Non-invasive biomarkers which discriminate early from advanced stages or predict the response to treatment are urgently required.This study explored the cytokeratin-18 fragment M30 and full-length cytokeratin-18 M65 in predicting treatment response and survival in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of advanced gastric cancer.METHODS: Patients enrolled in the SUN-CASE study received sunitinib or placebo as an adjunct to standard therapy with leucovorin (Ca-folinate), 5-fluorouracil, and irinotecan in second or third line.Treatment response rates, progression-free survival and overall survival were assessed during a follow-up period of 12 months.Cytokeratin-18 fragments were analyzed in 52 patients at baseline and day 14 of therapy.RESULTS: Levels of M30 correlated with the presence of metastasis and lymph node involvement and decreased significantly during chemotherapy.Importantly, baseline levels of M30 were significantly higher in patients who failed therapy.In addition, patients who did not respond to treatment were also identifiable at day 14 based on elevated M30 levels.By stepwise regression analysis, M30 at day 14 was identified as independent predictor of treatment response.Likewise, serum levels of full-length cytokeratin-18 M65 at baseline also correlated with treatment failure and progression-free survival.The addition of sunitinib did not exert any effects on serum levels of M30 or M65.CONCLUSION: The cytokeratin-18 fragment M30 at day 14 identifies patients that fail to second- or third-line therapy for advanced gastric cancer.Validation of this non-invasive biomarker in gastric cancer is warranted.",1,1,1,1

26250474,"Prospective study of DNA methylation at LINE-1 and Alu in peripheral blood and the risk of prostate cancer.BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that global blood DNA methylation levels may be associated with the risk of various cancers, but no studies have evaluated this relationship for prostate cancer.METHODS: We used pyrosequencing to quantify DNA methylation levels at the long interspersed nuclear element 1 (LINE-1) and Alu repetitive elements in pre-diagnostic blood samples from 694 prostate cancer cases and 703 controls from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial.We evaluated prostate cancer risk associated with the mean methylation level for each element using logistic regression, adjusting for potential confounders.RESULTS: We did not observe a significant association with prostate cancer for LINE-1 [odds ratio (OR) for the highest compared to the lowest quartile = 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.73-1.39, Ptrend = 0.99] or Alu (OR = 0.94, 95% CI: 0.68-1.29, Ptrend = 0.69) methylation levels overall.However, for Alu, we observed that higher DNA methylation levels were associated with a significant increased risk for those diagnosed 4 or more years after blood draw (OR = 2.26, 95% CI: 1.27-4.00, Ptrend = 4.4 x 10(-3) ).In contrast, there was no association for those diagnosed 2 (OR = 1.13, 95% CI: 0.67-1.90, Ptrend = 0.64) or 3 years after draw (OR = 1.22, 95% CI: 0.71-2.07, Ptrend = 0.32), and a decreased risk for those diagnosed less than 2 years after draw (OR = 0.40, 95% CI: 0.25-0.65, Ptrend = 3.8 x 10(-5) ; Pheterogeneity = 5.3 x 10(-6) ).CONCLUSIONS: Although LINE-1 DNA methylation levels were not associated with prostate cancer, we observed an association for Alu that varied by time from blood draw to diagnosis.Our study suggests that elevated Alu blood DNA methylation levels several years before diagnosis may be associated with an increased prostate cancer risk.",0,0,0,0
24989892,"Association studies of Fcgamma receptor polymorphisms with outcome in HER2+ breast cancer patients treated with trastuzumab in NCCTG (Alliance) Trial N9831.Patients with HER2+ breast cancer treated with trastuzumab and chemotherapy have superior survival compared with patients treated with chemotherapy alone.Polymorphisms within FCGR2A and FCGR3A are associated with binding affinity of natural killer cells to the IgG1 portion of trastuzumab, and a polymorphism in FCGR2B (I232T) is associated with impaired regulatory activity.The association of these polymorphisms with clinical response among trastuzumab-treated patients is equivocal, with both positive and negative associations.We performed genotyping analysis on the FCGR3A V158F, FCGR2A R131H, and FCGR2B I232T polymorphisms in 1,325 patients from the N9831 clinical trial.Patients in arm A (N = 419) received chemotherapy only.Patients in arms B (N = 469) and C (N = 437) were treated with chemotherapy and trastuzumab (sequentially in arm B and concurrently in arm C).Using log-rank test and Cox proportional hazard models, we compared disease-free survival (DFS) among genotypic groups within pooled arms B/C. We found no differences in DFS between trastuzumab-treated patients who had the FCGR3A 158 V/V and/or FCGR2A 131 H/H high-affinity genotypes and patients without those genotypes.Furthermore, there was no significant interaction between FCGR3A and FCGR2A and treatment.However, there was a difference in DFS for FCGR2B I232T, with I/I patients deriving benefit from trastuzumab (P < 0.001), compared with the T carriers who did not (P = 0.81).The interaction between FCGR2B genotype and treatment was statistically significant (P = 0.03).Our analysis did not reveal an association between FcgammaR high-affinity genotypes and outcomes.However, it seems that the FCGR2B inhibitory gene may be predictive of adjuvant trastuzumab benefit.",0,0,0,0
22679142,"Development of a clinical prediction rule for risk stratification of recurrent venous thromboembolism in patients with cancer-associated venous thromboembolism.BACKGROUND: Long-term low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is the current standard for treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in cancer patients.Whether treatment strategies should vary according to individual risk of VTE recurrence remains unknown.We performed a retrospective cohort study and a validation study in patients with cancer-associated VTE to derive a clinical prediction rule that stratifies VTE recurrence risk.METHODS AND RESULTS: The cohort study of 543 patients determined the model with the best classification performance included 4 independent predictors (sex, primary tumor site, stage, and prior VTE) with 100% sensitivity, a wide separation of recurrence rates, 98.1% negative predictive value, and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.16.In this model, the score sum ranged between -3 and 3 score points.Patients with a score </= 0 had low risk (</= 4.5%) for recurrence and patients with a score >1 had a high risk (>/= 19%) for VTE recurrence.Subsequently, we applied and validated the rule in an independent set of 819 patients from 2 randomized, controlled trials comparing low-molecular-weight heparin to coumarin treatment in cancer patients.CONCLUSIONS: By identifying VTE recurrence risk in cancer patients with VTE, we may be able to tailor treatment, improving clinical outcomes while minimizing costs.",0,0,0,0
30679315,"A Phase II Randomized Trial of Panitumumab, Erlotinib, and Gemcitabine Versus Erlotinib and Gemcitabine in Patients with Untreated, Metastatic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma: North Central Cancer Treatment Group Trial N064B (Alliance).LESSONS LEARNED: Dual epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-directed therapy with erlotinib and panitumumab in combination with gemcitabine was superior to gemcitabine and erlotinib, but the clinical relevance is uncertain given the limited role of gemcitabine monotherapy.A significantly longer overall survival was observed in patients receiving the dual EGFR-directed therapy.The dual EGFR-directed therapy resulted in increased toxicity.BACKGROUND: Gemcitabine is active in patients with advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma.The combination of erlotinib, an oral epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor, and gemcitabine was shown to modestly prolong overall survival when compared with gemcitabine alone.The North Central Cancer Treatment Group (now part of Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology) trial N064B compared gemcitabine plus erlotinib versus gemcitabine plus combined EGFR inhibition with erlotinib and panitumumab.METHODS: Eligible patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas were randomized to either gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m(2) on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle with erlotinib 100 mg p.o.daily (Arm A) or the same combination with the addition of panitumumab 4 mg/kg on days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle (Arm B).The primary endpoint of the trial was overall survival.Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival, the confirmed response rate, and toxicity.Comparison between arms for the primary endpoint was done with a one-sided log-rank test, and a p value less than .20 was considered statistically significant.Response rate comparison was done with Fisher's exact test.All other reported p values are two-sided.RESULTS: A total of 92 patients were randomized, 46 to each arm.The median overall survival was 4.2 months in Arm A and 8.3 months in Arm B (hazard ratio, 0.817; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.530-1.260; p = .1792).The progression-free survival was 2.0 months in Arm A and 3.6 months in Arm B (hazard ratio, 0.843; 95% CI, 0.555-1.280; p = .4190).A partial confirmed response was seen in 8.7% of patients on Arm A and 6.5% on Arm B (p = .9999).No patients had a complete response.Grade 3 and higher nonhematologic toxicities were more common in patients on Arm B compared with those on Arm A (82.6% vs. 52.2%; p = .0018).CONCLUSION: Dual EGFR-directed therapy resulted in a significant prolongation of overall survival in patients with advanced adenocarcinoma of the pancreas but was associated with substantially increased toxicities.Dual EGFR-directed therapy in combination with gemcitabine alone cannot be recommended for further study, as single-agent gemcitabine is no longer considered an appropriate therapy for otherwise fit patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.",0,0,0,0
28743247,"A randomized phase II study of paclitaxel alone versus paclitaxel plus sorafenib in second- and third-line treatment of patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer (PASO).BACKGROUND: We conducted an open-label, randomized, two-arm multi-center study to assess the efficacy and safety of paclitaxel versus paclitaxel + sorafenib in patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer.METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive either paclitaxel monotherapy (80 mg/m(2)) weekly (3 weeks on, 1 week off) plus sorafenib 400 mg orally, twice a day taken continuously throughout 28 day cycles.Sorafenib dose was gradually escalated from a starting dose of 200 mg twice a day.The primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS).RESULTS: A pre-planned efficacy interim analysis was performed on the data of 60 patients, 30 patients in each treatment arm.Median PFS was estimated at 6.6 months (95% CI: 5.1 to 9.0) in patients randomized to single-agent paclitaxel (Arm A) and 5.6 months (95% CI: 3.8 to 6.5) in patients randomized to paclitaxel-sorafenib combination (Arm B) therapy.Contrary to the hypothesis, the treatment effect was statistically significant in favor of paclitaxel monotherapy (hazard ratio 1.80, 95% CI: 1.02 to 3.20; log-rank test P = 0.0409).It was decided to stop the trial early for futility.Median OS was also in favor of Arm A (20.7 months (95% CI: 16.4 to 26.7) versus 12.1 months (95% CI: 5.8 to 20.4) in Arm B. Clinical control was achieved in 28 patients (93.3%) in Arm A and in 21 patients 70.0% in Arm B. Overall response rate was met in 43.3% of patients in Arm A and in 40.0% in Arm B. Toxicities were increased in Arm B with higher rates of diarrhea, nausea, neutropenia, hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) and anorexia, Grad 3 and 4 toxicities were rare.CONCLUSIONS: In this pre-planned interim analysis, paclitaxel-sorafenib combination therapy was not found to be superior to paclitaxel monotherapy with regard to the primary end point, progression-free survival.The trial was therefore discontinued early.There was no indication of more favorable outcomes for combination therapy in secondary efficacy end points.As expected, the safety and toxicity profile of the combination therapy was less favorable compared to monotherapy.Overall, this trial did not demonstrate that adding sorafenib to second- or third-line paclitaxel provides any clinical benefit to patients with HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer.Cautious dosing using a sorafenib ramp up schedule might have contributed to negative results.TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered at EudraCT (No 2009-018025-73) and retrospectively registered at Clinical trials.gov on March 17, 2011 ( NCT01320111 ).",1,1,1,1
30408319,"The effect of preoperative chemotherapy on histological subtyping and staging of Wilms tumors: The United Kingdom Children's Cancer Study Group (UKCCSG) Wilms tumor trial 3 (UKW3) experience.BACKGROUND: Two principal approaches to Wilms tumor (WT) treatment are immediate surgery (IS) and preoperative chemotherapy (PCT), and both treatments use the risk-adapted approach that includes histological subclassification of the tumor, combined with additional prognostic factors.In the UKW3 trial, these two approaches were compared.The aim of the present study was to compare histological features between the two groups, to assess the impact of PCT on distribution of histological subtyping and staging and to evaluate whether PCT resulted in more staging discrepancies between local and central pathology review (CPR).MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cases were identified from the UKW3 trial database.The criteria for inclusion in the study were unilateral, nonmetastatic, nonanaplastic WTs, and submitted for CPR with an adequate number of slides.They were subclassified according to the NWTS and later the SIOP 9301 criteria.RESULTS: There were 244 WTs in the IS and 182 in the PCT group subclassified as follows: blastemal 86 (35%) vs 9 (5%), epithelial 34 (14%) vs 12 (7%), stromal 12 (5%) vs 25 (14%), mixed 112 (46%) vs 45 (25%), respectively, plus 40% regressive and 10% completely necrotic WTs in the PCT group.The differences between the two groups for blastemal and mixed types were statistically significant.In the PCT group, there was a significant decrease in stage III tumors.The discrepancies in staging between local and CPR were not significant.CONCLUSION: PCT significantly altered histological features and typing of WTs.It resulted in fewer stage III tumors, and staging discrepancies were equally represented in both groups.",0,0,0,0
23765449,"Testing the measurement equivalence of paper and interactive voice response system versions of the EORTC QLQ-C30.PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the measurement equivalence of an interactive voice response system (IVRS) version and the original paper-based version of the EORTC QLQ-C30.METHODS: The QLQ-C30 is a cancer-specific, health-related quality of life questionnaire consisting of nine multi-item scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive and social functioning, fatigue, nausea/vomiting, pain, and quality of life) and six single item measures (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial problems).This study utilized a crossover design with subjects randomly assigned to one of two assessment orders: (1) paper then IVRS or (2) IVRS then paper.Equivalence between the two administration modes was established by comparing the 95% lower confidence interval (CI) of the intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for each scale, with a critical value of 0.70.RESULTS: The ICCs for the nine multi-item scales were all above 0.79, ranging from 0.791 to 0.899 (ICC 95% lower CI range 0.726-0.865) and significantly different from our threshold reliability of 0.70.The ICCs for the six single items ranged from 0.689 to 0.896 (ICC 95% lower CI range 0.611-0.888).Two of the items, insomnia and appetite loss, were not statistically different from 0.70.When considered together, the per-protocol analysis results support the equivalence of the paper and IVRS versions of the QLQ-C30 for 13 of the 15 scores.CONCLUSION: This analysis provides evidence that the scores obtained from the IVRS version of the QLQ-C30 are equivalent to those obtained with the original paper version except for the insomnia and appetite loss items.",0,0,0,0

31398258,"Randomized controlled trial on the effect of an online decision aid for young female cancer patients regarding fertility preservation.STUDY QUESTION: Does the use of an online decision aid (DA) about fertility preservation (FP), in addition to standard counselling by a specialist in reproductive medicine, reduce decisional conflict compared to standard counselling alone?SUMMARY ANSWER: Female cancer patients who could make use of the online DA had a significantly lower short-term decisional conflict score.WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Nowadays, female cancer patients have several options for preserving fertility, but having to decide whether to opt for FP within a short time frame after cancer diagnosis and before the start of treatment is challenging.According to previous studies focussing mainly on breast cancer patients, decisional conflict among these women is high, and they have expressed the need for additional support.STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: The study was a randomized controlled trial including female cancer patients who were referred by their treating oncologist to a specialist in reproductive medicine for fertility counselling.Participants were randomly assigned to the control group (counselling only) or to the intervention group (counselling and additional use of the online DA immediately after counselling).Recruitment was ongoing from July 2016 to December 2017 at eight fertility centres in Switzerland and Germany.PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The online DA was developed by an interdisciplinary team of specialists in reproductive medicine, gynaecologists, oncologists and psychologists.Of 79 recruited participants, 59 completed the first assessment and could therefore be enrolled in the study.They were asked to complete an online questionnaire at three time points: at T1, after counselling (control group, n = 27) or after counselling and the additional use of the DA (intervention group, n = 24); at T2, 1 month later (N = 41: control group, n = 23; intervention group, n = 18); and at T3, 12 months later (N = 37: control group, n = 20; intervention group, n = 17).The survey comprised questions about fertility-related knowledge, attitude towards FP, willingness to undergo FP and socio-demographic data, as well as the decisional conflict and decisional regret scales.MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: All participants showed low decisional conflict scores.Women who used the online DA in addition to counselling (intervention group) showed a significantly lower total score on the Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS) compared to the control group at T1 (P = 0.008; M = 12.15, SD = 4.38; 95% CI, 3.35-20.95) and at T2 (P = 0.043; M = 9.35, SD = 4.48; 95% CI, 0.31-18.38).At T3, the mean total score of the DCS was still lower in the intervention group compared to the control group; however, this group difference was no longer significant (P = 0.199, M = 6.86, SD = 5.24; 95% CI, -3.78 to 17.51).The majority of participants had already made a decision regarding FP (yes or no) at T1 (72.5%): 91.7% in the intervention group compared to 55.6% in the control group (P = 0.014).Those who had decided already at T1 showed significantly lower decisional conflict (P = 0.007; M = 13.69, SD = 4.89; 95% CI, 3.86-23.52).The average number of DA sessions per user was 2.23, and 80.8% of the participants completed the DA's value clarification exercises.Participants in the intervention group were satisfied with the DA and would recommend it to other patients.LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The recruitment of participants was challenging because of the emotionally difficult situation patients were in.This led to the limited sample size for final analysis.Education levels were high in two-thirds of the participants.It is difficult to say whether the DA would be equally effective in women with a lower educational background.WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: There is evidence that the DA served as a helpful complement to the decision-making process for young female cancer patients qualifying for FP.This is, to our knowledge, the first randomized controlled trial evaluating a DA targeted at patients with several cancer types and in a language other than English (i.e. German).This study contributes to extending the range of the still limited number of DAs in the context of FP.STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): The study was supported by a research grant of the Swiss Cancer Research.The authors declare that no competing interests exist.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: Clinicaltrials.gov, trial no.

23788002,"Rapid incorporation of omega-3 fatty acids into colonic tissue after oral supplementation in patients with colorectal cancer: a randomized, placebo-controlled intervention trial.BACKGROUND: The purpose of the study was to examine whether a preoperative supplement with omega-3 fatty acids (FAs) leads to their incorporation into colonic tissue in patients scheduled for colorectal cancer surgery.This would be of interest because omega-3 FAs have potential beneficial (local) immunological effects that might benefit these patients.METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, prospective, placebo-controlled, single-center intervention trial, patients referred for elective colorectal cancer surgery received either an omega-3 FA-enriched oral nutrition supplement (ONS) (200 mL twice daily) providing 2.0 g of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 1.0 g of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) per day or a standard ONS for 7 days before surgery.Tissue samples from healthy colonic tissue (mucosa and muscular layer) were obtained during surgery, and tissue fatty acid composition was analyzed by gas chromatography.RESULTS: EPA was significantly higher in colonic mucosa (P = .001) and in the colonic muscular layer (P = .004) in the omega-3 FA group compared with controls.Patients in the omega-3 FA group also tended to have higher docosapentaenoic acid and DHA levels in colonic tissue.CONCLUSIONS: EPA is incorporated rapidly into colonic mucosa and colonic muscular layer in patients given 3 g of omega-3 FA daily for 7 days before surgery for colorectal cancer.This may lead to potential beneficially effects on (local) immune function, which might benefit these patients.",0,0,0,0
23234763,"Adjuvant lapatinib for women with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer: a randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Worldwide, many patients with HER2-positive early stage breast cancer do not receive trastuzumab-the standard adjuvant treatment.We investigated the efficacy and safety of adjuvant lapatinib for patients with trastuzumab-naive HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer, started at any time after diagnosis.METHODS: This study was a placebo-controlled, multicentre, randomised phase 3 trial.Women outpatients from 405 [corrected] centres in 33 countries [corrected] with HER2-positive early-breast cancer who had previously received adjuvant chemotherapy but not trastuzumab were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive daily lapatinib (1500 mg) or daily placebo for 12 months.Randomisation was done with a computer-generated sequence, stratified by time since diagnosis, lymph node involvement at diagnosis, and tumour hormone-receptor status.Investigators, site staff, and patients were masked to treatment assignment.The primary endpoint was disease-free survival in the intention-to-treat population.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00374322.FINDINGS: Between August, 2006, and May, 2008, 3161 women were enrolled and 3147 were assigned to lapatinib (n=1571) or placebo (n=1576).After a median follow-up of 47.4 months (range 0.4-60.0) in the lapatinib group and 48.3 (0.7-61.3) in the placebo group, 210 (13%) disease-free survival events had occurred in the lapatinib group versus 264 (17%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.83, 95% CI 0.70-1.00; p=0.053).Central review of HER2 status showed that only 2490 (79%) of the randomised women were HER2-positive.157 (13%) of 1230 confirmed HER2-positive patients in the lapatinib group and in 208 (17%) of 1260 in the placebo group had a disease-free survival event (HR 0.82, 95% 0.67-1.00; p=0.04).Serious adverse events occurred in 99 (6%) of 1573 patients taking lapatinib and 77 (5%) of 1574 patients taking placebo, with higher incidences of grade 3-4 diarrhoea (97 [6%] vs nine [<1%]), rash (72 [5%] vs three [<1%]), and hepatobiliary disorders (36 [2%] vs one [<1%]).INTERPRETATION: Our data show that there was no significant difference in disease-free survival between groups when analysed in the intention-to-treat population.However, exploratory analyses restricted to patients who had HER2-positive disease confirmed by central fluorescence in-situ hybridisation review suggested marginal benefit with lapatinib in terms of disease-free survival.Thus lapatinib might be an option for women with HER2-positive breast cancer who do not or cannot receive adjuvant trastuzumab.FUNDING: GlaxoSmithKline.",1,1,1,1

30386984,"Short-term surgical outcomes of laparoscopy-assisted versus open D2 distal gastrectomy for locally advanced gastric cancer in North China: a multicenter randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Although laparoscopic surgery has been recommended as an optional therapy for patients with early gastric cancer, whether patients with locally advanced gastric cancer (AGC) could benefit from laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy (LADG) with D2 lymphadenectomy remains elusive due to a lack of comprehensive clinical data.To evaluate the efficacy of LADG, we conducted a multi-institutional randomized controlled trial to compare laparoscopy-assisted versus open distal gastrectomy (ODG) for AGC in North China.METHODS: In this RCT, after patients were enrolled according to the eligibility criteria, they were preoperatively assigned to LADG or ODG arm randomly with a 1:1 allocation ratio.The primary endpoint was the morbidity and mortality within 30 postoperative days to evaluate the surgical safety of LADG.The secondary endpoint was 3-year disease-free survival.This trial was registered at ClinicalTrial.gov as NCT02464215.RESULTS: Between March 2014 and August 2017, a total of 446 patients with cT2-4aN0-3M0 (AJCC 7th staging system) were enrolled.Of these, 222 patients underwent LADG and 220 patients underwent ODG were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis.The compliance rate of D2 lymph node dissection was identical between the LADG and ODG arms (99.5%, P = 1.000).No significant difference was observed regarding the overall postoperative complication rate in two groups (LADG 13.1%, ODG 17.7%, P = 0.174).No operation-related death occurred in both arms.CONCLUSIONS: This trial confirmed that LADG performed by credentialed surgeons was safe and feasible for patients with AGC compared with conventional ODG.",1,1,1,1
29976469,"Robot-assisted radical cystectomy versus open radical cystectomy in patients with bladder cancer (RAZOR): an open-label, randomised, phase 3, non-inferiority trial.BACKGROUND: Radical cystectomy is the surgical standard for invasive bladder cancer.Robot-assisted cystectomy has been proposed to provide similar oncological outcomes with lower morbidity.We aimed to compare progression-free survival in patients with bladder cancer treated with open cystectomy and robot-assisted cystectomy.METHODS: The RAZOR study is a randomised, open-label, non-inferiority, phase 3 trial done in 15 medical centres in the USA.Eligible participants (aged >/=18 years) had biopsy-proven clinical stage T1-T4, N0-N1, M0 bladder cancer or refractory carcinoma in situ.Individuals who had previously had open abdominal or pelvic surgery, or who had any pre-existing health conditions that would preclude safe initiation or maintenance of pneumoperitoneum were excluded.Patients were centrally assigned (1:1) via a web-based system, with block randomisation by institution, stratified by type of urinary diversion, clinical T stage, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, to receive robot-assisted radical cystectomy or open radical cystectomy with extracorporeal urinary diversion.Treatment allocation was only masked from pathologists.The primary endpoint was 2-year progression-free survival, with non-inferiority established if the lower bound of the one-sided 97.5% CI for the treatment difference (robotic cystectomy minus open cystectomy) was greater than -15 percentage points.The primary analysis was done in the per-protocol population.Safety was assessed in the same population.This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01157676.FINDINGS: Between July 1, 2011, and Nov 18, 2014, 350 participants were randomly assigned to treatment.The intended treatment was robotic cystectomy in 176 patients and open cystectomy in 174 patients.17 (10%) of 176 patients in the robotic cystectomy group did not have surgery and nine (5%) patients had a different surgery to that they were assigned.21 (12%) of 174 patients in the open cystectomy group did not have surgery and one (1%) patient had robotic cystectomy instead of open cystectomy.Thus, 302 patients (150 in the robotic cystectomy group and 152 in the open cystectomy group) were included in the per-protocol analysis set.2-year progression-free survival was 72.3% (95% CI 64.3 to 78.8) in the robotic cystectomy group and 71.6% (95% CI 63.6 to 78.2) in the open cystectomy group (difference 0.7%, 95% CI -9.6% to 10.9%; pnon-inferiority=0.001), indicating non-inferiority of robotic cystectomy.Adverse events occurred in 101 (67%) of 150 patients in the robotic cystectomy group and 105 (69%) of 152 patients in the open cystectomy group.The most common adverse events were urinary tract infection (53 [35%] in the robotic cystectomy group vs 39 [26%] in the open cystectomy group) and postoperative ileus (33 [22%] in the robotic cystectomy group vs 31 [20%] in the open cystectomy group).INTERPRETATION: In patients with bladder cancer, robotic cystectomy was non-inferior to open cystectomy for 2-year progression-free survival.Increased adoption of robotic surgery in clinical practice should lead to future randomised trials to assess the true value of this surgical approach in patients with other cancer types.FUNDING: National Institutes of Health National Cancer Institute.",0,0,0,0

22674529,"A phase 3 study of induction treatment with concurrent chemoradiotherapy versus chemotherapy before surgery in patients with pathologically confirmed N2 stage IIIA nonsmall cell lung cancer (WJTOG9903).BACKGROUND: This study sought to ascertain whether induction-concurrent radiotherapy added to chemotherapy could improve the survival of patients undergoing surgery for stage IIIA N2 nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC).METHODS: Patients with pathologically proven N2 disease were randomized to receive either induction chemotherapy (docetaxel 60 mg/m(2) and carboplatin AUC [area under the receiver operating characteristic curve] = 5 for 2 cycles) plus concurrent radiation therapy (40 Gy) followed by surgery (CRS arm) or induction chemotherapy followed by surgery (CS arm).They subsequently underwent pulmonary resection when possible.RESULTS: Sixty patients were randomly assigned between December 2000 and August 2005.The study was prematurely terminated in January 2006 because of slow accrual.The most common toxicity was grade 3 or 4 leukopenia in 92.9% of patients in the CRS arm and 46.4% in the CS arm.Induction therapy was generally well tolerated, and there were no treatment-related deaths in either arm.Downstaging in the CS arm and CRS arm was 21% and 40%, respectively.The progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in the CS arm were 9.7 months and 29.9 months (PFS, hazard ratio [HR] = 0.68, P = .187), and those in the CRS arm were 12.4 months and 39.6 months (OS, HR = 0.77, P = .397), respectively.The PFS with and without downstaging was 55.0 and 9.4 months, respectively (HR = 3.39, P = .001).The OS with and without downstaging was 63.3 and 29.5 months, respectively (HR = 2.62, P = .021).CONCLUSIONS: The addition of radiotherapy to induction chemotherapy conferred better local control without significant adverse events.Tumor downstaging is important for prolonging the OS in patients with stage IIIA (N2) NSCLC.",1,1,1,1
28189429,"Regular Aspirin Use and the Risk of Lethal Prostate Cancer in the Physicians' Health Study.BACKGROUND: Regular aspirin use probably protects against some malignancies including prostate cancer (PC), but its impact on lethal PC is particularly unclear.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between regular aspirin and (1) the risk of lethal PC in a large prospective cohort and (2) survival after PC diagnosis.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In 1981/82, the Physicians' Health Study randomized 22 071 healthy male physicians to aspirin, beta-carotene, both, or placebo.After the trial ended in 1988, annual questionnaires have obtained data on aspirin use, cancer diagnoses, and outcomes up to 2009 for the whole cohort, and to 2015 for PC patients.OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: We evaluated the relationship between regular aspirin (>3 tablets/week) and lethal PC (metastases or PC death).Cox proportional-hazards models estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for the risk of lethal PC in the whole cohort and postdiagnosis survival among men initially diagnosed with nonlethal PC.RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Risk analysis revealed that 502 men developed lethal PC by 2009.Current and past regular aspirin was associated with a lower risk of lethal PC (current: HR 0.68, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.52-0.89; past: HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.40-0.74) compared to never users.In the survival analysis, 407/3277 men diagnosed with nonlethal PC developed lethal disease by 2015.Current postdiagnostic aspirin was associated with lower risks of lethal PC (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.52-0.90) and overall mortality (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61-0.9).We could not assess aspirin dose, and inconsistencies were observed in some sensitivity analyses.CONCLUSIONS: Current regular aspirin use was associated with a lower risk of lethal PC among all participants.Current postdiagnostic use was associated with improved survival after diagnosis, consistent with a potential inhibitory effect of aspirin on PC progression.A randomized trial is warranted to confirm or refute these findings.PATIENT SUMMARY: We examined the potential effect of regular aspirin use on lethal prostate cancer.We found that taking aspirin was associated with a lower risk of lethal prostate cancer, and taking it after diagnosis may help to prevent prostate cancer from becoming fatal.",0,0,0,0

26581577,"Proposal of supervised data analysis strategy of plasma miRNAs from hybridisation array data with an application to assess hemolysis-related deregulation.BACKGROUND: Plasma miRNAs have the potential as cancer biomarkers but no consolidated guidelines for data mining in this field are available.The purpose of the study was to apply a supervised data analysis strategy in a context where prior knowledge is available, i.e., that of hemolysis-related miRNAs deregulation, so as to compare our results with existing evidence.RESULTS: We developed a structured strategy with innovative applications of existing bioinformatics methods for supervised analyses including: 1) the combination of two statistical (t- and Anderson-Darling) test results to detect miRNAs with significant fold change or general distributional differences in class comparison, which could reveal hidden differential biological processes worth to be considered for building predictive tools; 2) a bootstrap selection procedure together with machine learning techniques in class prediction to guarantee the transferability of results and explore the interconnections among the selected miRNAs, which is important for highlighting their inherent biological dependences.The strategy was applied to develop a classifier for discriminating between hemolyzed and not hemolyzed plasma samples, defined according to a recently published hemolysis score.We identified five miRNAs with increased expression in hemolyzed plasma samples (miR-486-5p, miR-92a, miR-451, miR-16, miR-22).CONCLUSIONS: We identified four miRNAs previously reported in the literature as hemolysis related together with a new one (miR-22).which needs further investigations.Our findings confirm the validity of the proposed strategy and, in parallel, the hemolysis score capability to be used as pre-analytic hemolysis detector.R codes for implementing the approaches are provided.",0,0,0,0

29648580,"Bevacizumab plus hypofractionated radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone in elderly patients with glioblastoma: the randomized, open-label, phase II ARTE trial.Background: The addition of bevacizumab to temozolomide-based chemoradiotherapy (TMZ/RT --> TMZ) did not prolong overall survival (OS) in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma in phase III trials.Elderly and frail patients are underrepresented in clinical trials, but early reports suggested preferential benefit in this population.Patients and methods: ARTE was a 2 : 1 randomized, multi-center, open-label, non-comparative phase II trial of hypofractionated RT (40 Gy in 15 fractions) with bevacizumab (10 mg/kgx14 days) (arm A, N = 50) or without bevacizumab (arm B, N = 25) in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma aged >/=65 years.The primary objective was to obtain evidence for prolongation of median OS by the addition of bevacizumab to RT.Response was assessed by RANO criteria.Quality of life (QoL) was monitored by the EORTC QLQ-C30/BN20 modules.Exploratory studies included molecular subtyping by 450k whole methylome and gene expression analyses.Results: Median PFS was longer in arm A than in arm B (7.6 and 4.8 months, P = 0.003), but OS was similar (12.1 and 12.2 months, P = 0.77).Clinical deterioration was delayed and more patients came off steroids in arm A. Prolonged PFS in arm A was confined to tumors with the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) I methylation subtype (HR 0.25, P = 0.014) and proneural gene expression (HR 0.29, P = 0.025).In a Cox model of OS controlling for established prognostic factors, associations with more favorable outcome were identified for age <70 years (HR 0.52, P = 0.018) and Karnofsky performance score 90%-100% (HR 0.51, P = 0.026).Including molecular subtypes into that model identified an association of the RTK II gene methylation subtype with inferior OS (HR 1.73, P = 0.076).Conclusion: Efficacy outcomes and exploratory analyses of ARTE do not support the hypothesis that the addition of bevacizumab to RT generally prolongs survival in elderly glioblastoma patients.Molecular biomarkers may identify patients with preferential benefit from bevacizumab.Clinical trial registration number: NCT01443676.",1,1,1,1

24076063,"Neoadjuvant treatment of endometrial cancer using anastrozole: a randomised pilot study.OBJECTIVE: Excessive oestrogenic stimulation is a well-known risk factor for the development and progression of endometrial cancer.Aromatase is the key enzyme which catalyses the conversion of androgens to oestrogens in postmenopausal women.Inhibition of aromatase may therefore be a useful strategy in the management of endometrial cancer.A pilot study was designed to assess the feasibility of a neoadjuvant model and understand the biological effects of anastrozole, an aromatase inhibitor, in the treatment of endometrial cancer.METHODS: Patients with endometrial cancer who consented to participate in the study were randomised to receive anastrozole or placebo for a minimum of 14 days prior to definitive surgery.Endometrial samples were obtained before and after treatment.Immunohistochemistry was performed to ascertain the expression of oestrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha), progesterone receptor (PR), androgen receptor (AR), ki-67 and Bcl2 before and after treatment in glands and stroma of the endometrium.RESULTS: A total of 16 patients were randomised to the anastrozole arm and 8 to the placebo arm (2:1 randomisation).A significant decrease in the glandular expression of ERalpha and AR was observed in the anastrozole arm.There was no significant change in the expression of PR or Bcl2.Expression of ki-67, a proliferation marker, also decreased significantly following treatment with anastrozole.CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with anastrozole caused a significant decrease in proliferation as demonstrated by decreased ki-67 expression.A large randomised controlled trial is warranted to fully assess the role of anastrozole in the neoadjuvant treatment of endometrial cancer.",1,1,1,1
30229370,"The effect of anesthetic technique on micro-opioid receptor expression and immune cell infiltration in breast cancer.BACKGROUND: Clinical histological studies demonstrate that the distribution of natural killer (NK) cells, other immune cells and mu-opioid receptors (MOR) within cancer tissue can predict cancer prognosis.No clinical study has evaluated whether anesthetic technique influences immune cell and MOR expression within human breast cancer.METHODS: Excised preoperative biopsies and intraoperative breast cancer specimens from 20 patients randomly chosen from patients previously enrolled in an ongoing, prospective, randomized trial (NCT00418457) investigating the effect of anesthetic technique on long-term breast cancer outcome were immunohistochemically stained and microscopically examined by two independent investigators, masked to randomization, to quantify MOR and immune cell infiltration: CD56, CD57 (NK cells), CD4 (T helper cells), CD8 (cytotoxic T cells) and CD68 (macrophages).Patients had been randomized to receive either a propofol-paravertebral anesthetic with continuing analgesia (PPA, n = 10) or balanced general anesthetic with opioid analgesia (GA, n = 10).RESULTS: There were no differences between the groups in staining intensity in preoperative biopsy specimens.Expression intensity values (median 25-75%) for MOR in intraoperative resected biopsy were higher in GA 8.5 (3-17) versus PPA 1 (0-10), p = 0.04.The numbers of MOR-positive cells were also higher in GA patients.Expression and absolute numbers of CD56, CD57, CD4 and CD68 were similar in resected tumor in both groups.CONCLUSION: General anesthesia with opioid analgesia increased resected tumor MOR expression compared with propofol-paravertebral anesthetic technique, but the anesthetic technique did not significantly influence the expression of immune cell markers.",0,0,0,0

28352657,"Randomized, placebo-controlled window trial of EGFR, Src, or combined blockade in head and neck cancer.BACKGROUND.EGFR and Src family kinases are upregulated in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).EGFR interacts with Src to activate STAT3 signaling, and dual EGFR-Src targeting is synergistic in HNSCC preclinical models.pSrc overexpression predicted resistance to the EGFR inhibitor, erlotinib, in a prior window trial.We conducted a 4-arm window trial to identify biomarkers associated with response to EGFR and/or Src inhibition.METHODS.Patients with operable stage II-IVa HNSCC were randomized to 7-21 days of neoadjuvant erlotinib, the Src inhibitor dasatinib, the combination of both, or placebo.Paired tumor specimens were collected before and after treatment.Pharmacodynamic expression of EGFR and Src pathway components was evaluated by IHC of tissue microarrays and reverse-phase protein array of tissue lysates.Candidate biomarkers were assessed for correlation with change in tumor size.RESULTS.From April 2009 to December 2012, 58 patients were randomized and 55 were treated.There was a significant decrease in tumor size in both erlotinib arms (P = 0.0014); however, no effect was seen with dasatinib alone (P = 0.24).High baseline pMAPK expression was associated with response to erlotinib (P = 0.03).High baseline pSTAT3 was associated with resistance to dasatinib (P = 0.099).CONCLUSIONS.Brief exposure to erlotinib significantly decreased tumor size in operable HNSCC, with no additive effect from dasatinib.Baseline pMAPK expression warrants further study as a response biomarker for anti-EGFR therapy.Basal expression of pSTAT3 may be independent of Src, explain therapeutic resistance, and preclude development of dasatinib in biomarker-unselected cohorts.TRIAL REGISTRATION.NCT00779389.FUNDING.National Cancer Institute, American Cancer Society, Pennsylvania Department of Health, V Foundation for Cancer Research, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Astellas Pharma.",1,1,1,1

30833647,"Phase III randomised trial comparing 6 vs. 12-month of capecitabine as adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with stage III colon cancer: final results of the JFMC37-0801 study.BACKGROUND: Up to 6-months oxaliplatin-containing regimen is now widely accepted as a standard adjuvant chemotherapy for stage III colorectal cancer (CRC).However, oral fluoropyrimidine monotherapy is used for some part of patients, especially in Asian countries including Japan, and its optimal duration is yet to be fully investigated.METHODS: A total of 1306 patients with curatively-resected stage III CRC were randomly assigned to receive capecitabine (2500 mg/m(2)/day) for 14 out of 21 days for 6 (n = 654) or 12 (n = 650) months.The primary endpoint was disease-free survival (DFS), and the secondary endpoints were relapse-free survival (RFS), overall survival (OS), and adverse events.RESULTS: The 3- and 5-year DFS were 70.0% and 65.3% in the 6M group and 75.3% and 68.7% in the 12M group, respectively (p = 0.0549, HR = 0.858, 90% CI: 0.732-1.004).The 5-year RFS was 69.3% and 74.1% in the 6M and 12M groups, respectively (p = 0.0143, HR = 0.796, 90% CI: 0.670-0.945).The 5-year OS was 83.2% and 87.6%, respectively (p = 0.0124, HR = 0.727, 90% CI: 0.575-0.919).The incidence of overall grade 3-4 adverse events was almost comparable in both groups.CONCLUSIONS: Although 12-month adjuvant capecitabine did not demonstrate superior DFS to that of 6-month, the observed better RFS and OS in the 12-month treatment period could be of value in selected cases.",1,1,1,1
28071624,"Comparison of two different radiation fractionation schedules with concurrent chemotherapy in head and neck malignancy.INTRODUCTION: The worldwide incidence of head and neck malignancy exceeds half a million cases annually.In radiotherapy (RT), conventional fractionation comprises giving five fractions per week from Monday to Friday.Accelerated RT includes administration of six fractions per week is being advocated.It gives better locoregional control and the median overall treatment time is 39 days as compared to 46 days in conventional group.Our study involved comparison of conventional versus accelerated RT with concurrent chemotherapy, in evaluation of local control and toxicity in the two arms.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty patients of locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma head and neck region were studied.All the patients received cisplatin (30 mg/m2) weekly during the therapy.The patients received RT dose of 70 Gray (Gy) in 35 fractions (#).The patients were randomly assorted into two groups: Group 1 - Study group (n = 30) - Six fractions RT per week (Monday-Saturday).Group 2 - Control group (n = 30) - Five fractions RT per week (Monday-Friday).During and after the treatment, locoregional control, acute and late radiation toxicity were assessed.Results and Observation: There was no significant difference between the two schedules regarding locoregional control rate.The Grade 3 or higher acute toxicities were significantly higher in the accelerated arm although there was no significant difference in late toxicities between the two arms.CONCLUSION: Accelerated fractionation regimen was not more efficacious than conventional fractionation in the treatment of previously untreated head and neck carcinoma.",0,0,0,0
28216065,"Preliminary evaluation of a telephone-based smoking cessation intervention in the lung cancer screening setting: A randomized clinical trial.Incorporating effective smoking cessation interventions into lung cancer screening (LCS) programs will be essential to realizing the full benefit of screening.We conducted a pilot randomized trial to determine the feasibility and efficacy of a telephone-counseling (TC) smoking cessation intervention vs. usual care (UC) in the LCS setting.In collaboration with 3 geographically diverse LCS programs, we enrolled current smokers (61.5% participation rate) who were: registered to undergo LCS, 50-77 years old, and had a 20+ pack-year smoking history.Eligibility was not based on readiness to quit.Participants completed pre-LCS (T0) and post-LCS (T1) telephone assessments, were randomized to TC (N=46) vs. UC (N=46), and completed a final 3-month telephone assessment (T2).Both study arms received a list of evidence-based cessation resources.TC participants also received up to 6 brief counseling calls with a trained cessation counselor.Counseling calls incorporated motivational interviewing and utilized the screening result as a motivator for quitting.The outcome was biochemically verified 7-day point prevalence cessation at 3-months post-randomization.Participants (56.5% female) were 60.2 (SD=5.4) years old and reported 47.1 (SD=22.2) pack years; 30% were ready to stop smoking in the next 30 days.TC participants completed an average of 4.4 (SD=2.3) sessions.Using intent-to-treat analyses, biochemically verified quit rates were 17.4% (TC) vs. 4.3% (UC), p<.05.This study provides preliminary evidence that telephone-based cessation counseling is feasible and efficacious in the LCS setting.As millions of current smokers are now eligible for lung cancer screening, this setting represents an important opportunity to exert a large public health impact on cessation among smokers who are at very high risk for multiple tobacco-related diseases.If this evidence-based, brief, and scalable intervention is replicated, TC could help to improve the overall cost-effectiveness of LCS.TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT02267096, https://clinicaltrials.gov.",0,0,0,0
27869649,"Randomized trial of calcipotriol combined with 5-fluorouracil for skin cancer precursor immunotherapy.BACKGROUND: Actinic keratosis is a precursor to cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.Long treatment durations and severe side effects have limited the efficacy of current actinic keratosis treatments.Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is an epithelium-derived cytokine that induces a robust antitumor immunity in barrier-defective skin.Here, we investigated the efficacy of calcipotriol, a topical TSLP inducer, in combination with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) as an immunotherapy for actinic keratosis.METHODS: The mechanism of calcipotriol action against skin carcinogenesis was examined in genetically engineered mouse models.The efficacy and safety of 0.005% calcipotriol ointment combined with 5% 5-FU cream were compared with Vaseline plus 5-FU for the field treatment of actinic keratosis in a randomized, double-blind clinical trial involving 131 participants.The assigned treatment was self-applied to the entirety of the qualified anatomical sites (face, scalp, and upper extremities) twice daily for 4 consecutive days.The percentage of reduction in the number of actinic keratoses (primary outcome), local skin reactions, and immune activation parameters were assessed.RESULTS: Calcipotriol suppressed skin cancer development in mice in a TSLP-dependent manner.Four-day application of calcipotriol plus 5-FU versus Vaseline plus 5-FU led to an 87.8% versus 26.3% mean reduction in the number of actinic keratoses in participants (P < 0.0001).Importantly, calcipotriol plus 5-FU treatment induced TSLP, HLA class II, and natural killer cell group 2D (NKG2D) ligand expression in the lesional keratinocytes associated with a marked CD4+ T cell infiltration, which peaked on days 10-11 after treatment, without pain, crusting, or ulceration.CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate the synergistic effects of calcipotriol and 5-FU treatment in optimally activating a CD4+ T cell-mediated immunity against actinic keratoses and, potentially, cancers of the skin and other organs.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02019355.FUNDING: Not applicable (investigator-initiated clinical trial).",1,1,1,1
24323034,"Targeted androgen pathway suppression in localized prostate cancer: a pilot study.PURPOSE: Ligand-mediated activation of the androgen receptor (AR) is critical for prostate cancer (PCa) survival and proliferation.The failure to completely ablate tissue androgens may limit suppression of PCa growth.We evaluated combinations of CYP17A and 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors for reducing prostate androgen levels, AR signaling, and PCa volumes.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-five men with intermediate/high-risk clinically localized PCa were randomly assigned to goserelin combined with dutasteride (ZD), bicalutamide and dutasteride (ZBD), or bicalutamide, dutasteride, and ketoconazole (ZBDK) for 3 months before prostatectomy.Controls included patients receiving combined androgen blockade with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist and bicalutamide.The primary outcome measure was tissue dihydrotestosterone (DHT) concentration.RESULTS: Prostate DHT levels were substantially lower in all experimental arms (0.02 to 0.04 ng/g v 0.92 ng/g in controls; P < .001).The ZBDK group demonstrated the greatest percentage decline in serum testosterone, androsterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (P < .05 for all).Staining for AR and the androgen-regulated genes prostate-specific antigen and TMPRSS2 was strongly suppressed in benign glands and moderately in malignant glands (P < .05 for all).Two patients had pathologic complete response, and nine had </= 0.2 cm(3) of residual tumor (defined as a near-complete response), with the largest numbers of complete and near-complete responses in the ZBDK group.CONCLUSION: Addition of androgen synthesis inhibitors lowers prostate androgens below that achieved with standard therapy, but significant AR signaling remains.Tissue-based analysis of steroids and AR signaling is critical to informing the search for optimal local and systemic control of high-risk prostate cancer.",1,1,1,1

29342492,"Efficacy and safety of endoscopic radiofrequency ablation for unresectable extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma: a randomized trial.BACKGROUND: Endoscopic placement of biliary stents to relieve jaundice is the main palliative treatment for unresectable extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.Endoscopic biliary radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has been reported to prolong stent patency, which may be beneficial in improving patient survival.However, available evidence is still insufficient, as most reported studies are retrospective case series.The aim of this study was to explore the clinical effect and safety of RFA in patients with unresectable extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.METHODS: 65 patients with unresectable extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, except Bismuth type III and IV hilar cholangiocarcinoma, were enrolled and randomly underwent either RFA combined with biliary stenting (RFA + stent group; n = 32) or biliary stent only (stent-only group; n = 33).Overall survival time, stent patency period, and postoperative adverse events were recorded.RESULTS: In the 21-month follow-up period, the overall mean survival time was significantly longer in the RFA + stent group than in the stent-only group (13.2 +/- 0.6 vs. 8.3 +/- 0.5 months; P < 0.001).The mean stent patency period of the RFA + stent group was also significantly longer than that of the stent-only group (6.8 vs. 3.4 months; P = 0.02).There was no significant difference in the incidence of postoperative adverse events between the two groups (6.3 % [2/32] vs. 9.1 % [3/33]; P = 0.67).CONCLUSION: Endoscopic RFA combined with stenting can significantly prolong survival and the stent patency period without increasing the incidence of adverse events in patients with extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma patient, except Bismuth type III and IV hilar cholangiocarcinoma.This approach can be considered as a safe and effective palliative treatment for these patients.",0,0,0,0
25403578,"FOLFOX4 versus sequential dose-dense FOLFOX7 followed by FOLFIRI in patients with resectable metastatic colorectal cancer (MIROX): a pragmatic approach to chemotherapy timing with perioperative or postoperative chemotherapy from an open-label, randomized phase III trial.BACKGROUND: Perioperative FOLFOX4 (oxaliplatin plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin) chemotherapy is the current standard in patients with resectable metastases from colorectal cancer (CRC).We aimed to determine whether a sequential chemotherapy with dose-dense oxaliplatin (FOLFOX7) and irinotecan (FOLFIRI; irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin) is superior to FOLFOX4.The chemotherapy timing was not imposed, and was perioperative or postoperative.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this open-label, phase III trial, patients with resectable or resected metastases were randomly assigned either to 12 cycles of FOLFOX4 (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m(2)) or 6 cycles of FOLFOX7 (oxaliplatin 130 mg/m(2)) followed by 6 cycles of FOLFIRI (irinotecan 180 mg/m(2)).Randomization was done centrally, with stratification by chemotherapy timing, type of local treatment (surgery versus radiofrequency ablation with/without surgery), and Fong's prognostic score.The primary end point was 2-year disease-free survival (DFS).RESULTS: A total of 284 patients were randomized, 142 in each treatment group.Chemotherapy was perioperative in 168 (59.2%) patients and postoperative in 116 (40.8%) patients.Perioperative chemotherapy was preferentially proposed for synchronous metastases, whereas postoperative chemotherapy was more frequently used for metachronous metastases.Two-year DFS was 48.5% in the FOLFOX4 group and 50.0% in the FOLFOX7-FOLFIRI group.In the multivariable analysis, more than one metastasis [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.15] and synchronous metastases (HR = 1.63) were independent prognostic factors for shorter DFS.Five-year overall survival (OS) rate was 69.5% with FOLFOX4 versus 66.6% with FOLFOX7-FOLFIRI.CONCLUSIONS: FOLFOX7-FOLFIRI is not superior to FOLFOX4 in patients with resectable metastatic CRC.Five-year OS rates observed in both groups are the highest ever reported in this setting, possibly reflecting the pragmatic approach to chemotherapy timing.CLINICAL TRIALS NUMBER: NCT00268398.",1,1,1,1
26908330,"Circulating biomarkers and outcome from a randomised phase II trial of sunitinib vs everolimus for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.BACKGROUND: RECORD-3 assessed non-inferiority of progression-free survival (PFS) with everolimus vs sunitinib in previously untreated patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.Baseline plasma sample collection and randomised design enabled correlation of circulating biomarkers with efficacy.METHODS: Samples were analysed for 121 cancer-related biomarkers.Analyses of biomarkers categorised patients as high or low (vs median) to assess association with first-line PFS (PFS1L) for each treatment arm.A composite biomarker score (CBS) incorporated biomarkers potentially predictive of PFS1L with everolimus.RESULTS: Plasma samples from 442 of the 471 randomised patients were analysed.Biomarkers were associated with PFS1L for everolimus alone (29), sunitinib alone (9) or both (12).Everolimus-specific biomarkers (CSF1, ICAM1, IL-18BP, KIM1, TNFRII) with hazard ratio 1.8 were integrated into a CBS (range 0-5).For CBS low (0-3, n = 291) vs high (4-5, n = 151), PFS1L differed significantly for everolimus but not for sunitinib.There was no significant difference in PFS1L between everolimus and sunitinib in the high CBS patient cohort.CONCLUSIONS: Baseline levels of multiple soluble biomarkers correlated with benefit from everolimus and/or sunitinib, independent of clinical risk factors.A similar PFS1L was observed for both treatments among patients with high CBS score.",1,1,1,1
25057173,"EGFR biomarkers predict benefit from vandetanib in combination with docetaxel in a randomized phase III study of second-line treatment of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.BACKGROUND: ZODIAC was a randomized phase III study of second-line treatment in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that evaluated the addition of vandetanib to docetaxel.The study showed a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival and objective response rate, but not in overall survival for unselected patients.This study evaluated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutation, copy number gain, and protein expression, and KRAS gene mutation, in pretreatment tumor samples as potential biomarkers predicting benefit from vandetanib as second-line treatment of NSCLC.PATIENTS AND METHODS: After progression following first-line chemotherapy, 1391 patients with locally advanced or metastatic (stage IIIB/IV) NSCLC were randomized 1 : 1 to receive vandetanib (100 mg/day) plus docetaxel (75 mg/m(2) every 21 days) or placebo plus docetaxel in the ZODIAC study.Archival tumor samples (n = 570) were collected from consenting patients (n = 958) for predefined, prospective biomarker analyses.RESULTS: Of evaluable samples, 14% were EGFR mutation positive, 35% were EGFR FISH positive, 88% were EGFR protein expression positive, and 13% were KRAS mutation positive.Compared with the overall study population, in which progression-free survival (PFS) [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.79] but not OS (HR = 0.91) were significantly improved with vandetanib, there was greater relative clinical benefit for patients with EGFR mutation-positive tumors [PFS HR 0.51, confidence interval (CI) 0.25-1.06 and OS HR 0.46, CI 0.14-1.57] and EGFR FISH-positive tumors (PFS HR 0.61, CI 0.39-0.94 and OS HR 0.48, CI 0.28-0.84).Similarly, patients with EGFR mutation or FISH-positive tumor samples who received vandetanib had an increased chance of objective tumor response (odds ratios 3.34, CI 0.8-13.89, and 3.90, CI 1.02-14.82, respectively).There did not appear to be benefit for vandetanib in patients with KRAS mutation-positive tumors.CONCLUSIONS: High EGFR gene copy number or activating EGFR mutations may identify patient subgroups who receive increased clinical benefit from vandetanib in combination with docetaxel in second-line NSCLC.CLINICALTRIALSGOV: NCT00312377.",1,1,1,1

24296288,"Development of a new biochemical test to diagnose and monitor neuroblastoma in Vietnam: homovanillic and vanillylmandelic acid by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to develop an accurate robust testing method to simultaneously measure urine levels of HVA and VMA using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS) and to establish age-specific reference intervals of HVA and VMA in random urines for Vietnamese children.DESIGN AND METHODS: The assay for urinary HVA and VMA was developed based on a classical urinary organic acid profiling method.Briefly, this incorporated 3-phenyl butyric acid as the internal standard and liquid-liquid extraction with ethyl acetate followed by derivatization with BSTFA.The Agilent 7890A GC and 5975C Mass Selective Detector in single ion monitoring mode was used for analysis.Reference intervals were developed from random urine samples collected from 634 disease free Vietnamese children and compared to 50 known neuroblastoma patient samples.Results were reported relative to creatinine concentration.Age related 95% reference intervals for urinary HVA and VMA were estimated from sample quantiles.The analytes (expressed as analyte/creatinine ratios) diagnostic values were determined by calculating the related sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratios.RESULTS: HVA and VMA were linear to at least 193 and 221mumol/L, respectively.The limit of quantitation for both analytes was 0.9mumol/L. Using the bi-level control (n=15), the within-batch coefficients of variations (CVs) were less than 3% for both analytes across the assay range.The between-batch CVs (n=20 over three months), were 3.6% at 11mumol/L and 2.1% at 88mumol/L for HVA, 6.6% at 18.2mumol/L and 2.6% at 90.6mumol/L for VMA.Vietnamese age related reference intervals were established for urinary HVA and VMA per creatinine.HVA for children <6months (n=91) was 5.3-37.0mumol/mmol; 6months to <1year (n=141) was 2.7-27.7mumol/mmol; 1 to 5years (n=139) was 3.4-17.9mumol/mmol; 6 to 10years (n=136) was 2.7-8.8mumol/mmol; and 11 to 15years (n=127) was 1.1-9.4mumol/mmol.VMA for children <6months was 1.8-12.2mumol/mmol; 6months to <1year was 1.5-9.3mumol/mmol; 1 to 5years was 1.9-7.8mumol/mmol; 6 to 10years was 1.6-5.1mumol/mmol; and 11 to 15years was <0.9-6.3mumol/mmol.CONCLUSIONS: A robust testing method for simultaneous quantitation of urinary HVA and VMA by GCMS was developed.This method is accurate, precise and fit for its clinical purpose and suitable for developing countries.Age-related reference intervals of urinary HVA and VMA were established for Vietnamese children and the intervals declined progressively with increasing age for each analyte.",0,0,0,0

29852043,"Effect of Adjuvant Trastuzumab for a Duration of 9 Weeks vs 1 Year With Concomitant Chemotherapy for Early Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2-Positive Breast Cancer: The SOLD Randomized Clinical Trial.Importance: Trastuzumab plus chemotherapy is the standard adjuvant treatment for patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive early breast cancer.While the standard duration of trastuzumab treatment is 12 months, the benefits and harms of trastuzumab continued beyond the chemotherapy are unclear.Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of adjuvant trastuzumab continued beyond chemotherapy in women treated with up-front chemotherapy containing a taxane and trastuzumab.Design, Setting, and Participants: Open-label, randomized (1:1) clinical trial including women with HER2-positive breast cancer.Chemotherapy was identical in the 2 groups, consisting of 3 cycles of 3-weekly docetaxel (either 80 or 100 mg/m2) plus trastuzumab for 9 weeks, followed by 3 cycles of fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide.Thereafter, no trastuzumab was administered in the 9-week group, whereas controls received trastuzumab to complete 1 year of administration.Disease-free survival (DFS) was compared between the groups using a Cox model and the noninferiority approach.The estimated sample size was 2168 patients (1-sided testing, with a relative noninferiority margin of 1.3).From January 3, 2008, to December 16, 2014, 2176 patients were accrued from 7 countries.Intervention: Docetaxel plus trastuzumab for 9 weeks, followed by 3 cycles of fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide in both groups.Controls continued trastuzumab to 1 year.Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary objective was DFS; secondary objectives included distant disease-free survival, overall survival, cardiac DFS, and safety.Results: In the 2174 women analyzed, median age was 56 (interquartile range [IQR], 48-64) years.The median follow-up was 5.2 (IQR, 3.8-6.7) years.Noninferiority of the 9-week treatment could not be demonstrated for DFS (hazard ratio, 1.39; 2-sided 90% CI, 1.12-1.72).Distant disease-free survival and overall survival did not differ substantially between the groups.Thirty-six (3%) and 21 (2%) patients in the 1-year and the 9-week groups, respectively, had cardiac failure; the left ventricle ejection fraction was better maintained in the 9-week group.An interaction was detected between the docetaxel dose and DFS; patients in the 9-week group treated with 80 mg/m2 had inferior and those treated with 100 mg/m2 had similar DFS as patients in the 1-year group.Conclusions and Relevance: Nine weeks of trastuzumab was not noninferior to 1 year of trastuzumab when given with similar chemotherapy.Cardiac safety was better in the 9-week group.The docetaxel dosing with trastuzumab requires further study.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00593697.",1,1,1,1
24654201,"Food or medicine: ethnic variations in perceptions of advanced cancer patients and their caregivers regarding artificial hydration during the last weeks of life.PURPOSE: To identify whether advanced cancer patients receiving home hospice care and their primary caregivers view artificial hydration (AH) as food or medicine, and the demographic and clinical factors influencing these perceptions.METHODS: Participants were enrolled in a randomised, double-blind controlled trial examining the efficacy of AH in cancer hospice patients.In-depth interviews at days 1 and 4 of study enrolment explored the meanings attributed to AH at the end of life.Responses to the question, 'Are these fluids more like food or more like medicine?' were categorised as 'food', 'medicine', 'both' or 'other'. chi(2) analyses were conducted with data from 122 interviews (54 patients and 68 caregivers) to identify differences between patients and caregivers, and by gender, age, ethnicity and caregiver relationship.Predictors of perceptions were identified using logistic regression analysis.RESULTS: Overall, 47 participants (38%) understood the fluids to be more like food, 41 (34%) as medicine, 17 (14%) as both, and 17 (14%)as 'other'. Ethnic minority participants (n=34, 66%) were significantly more likely than non-Hispanic European Americans (n=30, 42%) to view AH as food, or both as food and medicine (p=0.034).Ethnic differences persisted in the final regression model (OR 2.7; 95% CI 1.3 to 5.7, p=0.010).No significant differences were detected between patients and caregivers, or across gender, age, caregivers' relationship to the patients, group assignment, disease severity or cancer type.CONCLUSIONS: AH was perceived as food/nutrition by many cancer patients and caregivers in the study, particularly among ethnic minorities.This perception may lead to greater distress if fluids are discontinued or withheld.Asking patients/caregivers about their AH perceptions may enhance patient/provider communication and culturally appropriate end-of-life care.",0,0,0,0

29168064,"Adipose tissue inflammation in breast cancer survivors: effects of a 16-week combined aerobic and resistance exercise training intervention.PURPOSE: Obesity is a leading modifiable contributor to breast cancer mortality due to its association with increased recurrence and decreased overall survival rate.Obesity stimulates cancer progression through chronic, low-grade inflammation in white adipose tissue, leading to accumulation of adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs), in particular, the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype macrophage.Exercise has been shown to reduce M1 ATMs and increase the more anti-inflammatory M2 ATMs in obese adults.The purpose of this study was to determine whether a 16-week exercise intervention would positively alter ATM phenotype in obese postmenopausal breast cancer survivors.METHODS: Twenty obese postmenopausal breast cancer survivors were randomized to a 16-week aerobic and resistance exercise (EX) intervention or delayed intervention control (CON).The EX group participated in 16 weeks of supervised exercise sessions 3 times/week.Participants provided fasting blood, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and superficial subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue biopsies at baseline and following the 16-week study period.RESULTS: EX participants experienced significant improvements in body composition, cardiometabolic biomarkers, and systemic inflammation (all p < 0.03 vs. CON).Adipose tissue from EX participants showed a significant decrease in ATM M1 (p < 0.001), an increase in ATM M2 (p < 0.001), increased adipose tissue secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as adiponectin, and decreased secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF- alpha (all p < 0.055).CONCLUSIONS: A 16-week aerobic and resistance exercise intervention attenuates adipose tissue inflammation in obese postmenopausal breast cancer survivors.Future large randomized trials are warranted to investigate the impact of exercise-induced reductions in adipose tissue inflammation and breast cancer recurrence.",0,0,0,0
29381560,"Omega-3 decreases IL-6 levels in HIV and human herpesvirus-8 coinfected patients in Uganda.OBJECTIVE: Kaposi sarcoma is a HIV-associated malignancy caused by human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) that occurs at highest incidence in sub-Saharan Africa.Kaposi sarcoma patients often present with inflammatory symptoms associated with higher mortality.DESIGN: We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study in Uganda to test whether omega-3 supplementation could reduce inflammation in HIV and HHV-8 coinfected adults.Patients with acute illness, AIDS, or advanced Kaposi sarcoma were ineligible, as were pregnant women.Participant IDs were pre-randomized, blocked by Kaposi sarcoma status, to either the omega-3 or placebo arm.METHODS: Omega-3 participants received a 3-g pill dose daily for 12 weeks (1.8-g eicosapentaenoic acid, 1.2-mg docosapentaenoic acid); placebo participants received 44.8 mg of high oleic safflower oil that appeared indistinguishable from the active supplement.Intervention effects were evaluated as the baseline-adjusted mean difference after 12 weeks between omega-3 and placebo participants in concentrations of fatty acids, inflammatory cytokines, and immune cells.RESULTS: The final study population included 56 Kaposi sarcoma patients and 11 Kaposi sarcoma-negative, HIV and HHV-8-positive participants randomized to receive either omega-3 (N = 33) or placebo (N = 34).Inflammatory cytokine IL-6 concentrations decreased in omega-3 participants (-0.78 pg/ml) but increased in placebo participants (+3.2 pg/ml; P = 0.04).We observed a trend toward decreased IL-6 after omega-3 supplementation specific to Kaposi sarcoma patients (P = 0.08).CD8 T-cell counts tended to increase in the omega-3 arm Kaposi sarcoma patients (+60 cells/mul), in contrast to decreases (-47 cells/mul) among placebo (P = 0.11).CONCLUSION: Omega-3 supplementation decreased IL-6 concentrations among HIV and HHV-8 coinfected Ugandans, which may have clinical benefit for Kaposi sarcoma patients.",0,0,0,0
29852043,"Effect of Adjuvant Trastuzumab for a Duration of 9 Weeks vs 1 Year With Concomitant Chemotherapy for Early Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2-Positive Breast Cancer: The SOLD Randomized Clinical Trial.Importance: Trastuzumab plus chemotherapy is the standard adjuvant treatment for patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive early breast cancer.While the standard duration of trastuzumab treatment is 12 months, the benefits and harms of trastuzumab continued beyond the chemotherapy are unclear.Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of adjuvant trastuzumab continued beyond chemotherapy in women treated with up-front chemotherapy containing a taxane and trastuzumab.Design, Setting, and Participants: Open-label, randomized (1:1) clinical trial including women with HER2-positive breast cancer.Chemotherapy was identical in the 2 groups, consisting of 3 cycles of 3-weekly docetaxel (either 80 or 100 mg/m2) plus trastuzumab for 9 weeks, followed by 3 cycles of fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide.Thereafter, no trastuzumab was administered in the 9-week group, whereas controls received trastuzumab to complete 1 year of administration.Disease-free survival (DFS) was compared between the groups using a Cox model and the noninferiority approach.The estimated sample size was 2168 patients (1-sided testing, with a relative noninferiority margin of 1.3).From January 3, 2008, to December 16, 2014, 2176 patients were accrued from 7 countries.Intervention: Docetaxel plus trastuzumab for 9 weeks, followed by 3 cycles of fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide in both groups.Controls continued trastuzumab to 1 year.Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary objective was DFS; secondary objectives included distant disease-free survival, overall survival, cardiac DFS, and safety.Results: In the 2174 women analyzed, median age was 56 (interquartile range [IQR], 48-64) years.The median follow-up was 5.2 (IQR, 3.8-6.7) years.Noninferiority of the 9-week treatment could not be demonstrated for DFS (hazard ratio, 1.39; 2-sided 90% CI, 1.12-1.72).Distant disease-free survival and overall survival did not differ substantially between the groups.Thirty-six (3%) and 21 (2%) patients in the 1-year and the 9-week groups, respectively, had cardiac failure; the left ventricle ejection fraction was better maintained in the 9-week group.An interaction was detected between the docetaxel dose and DFS; patients in the 9-week group treated with 80 mg/m2 had inferior and those treated with 100 mg/m2 had similar DFS as patients in the 1-year group.Conclusions and Relevance: Nine weeks of trastuzumab was not noninferior to 1 year of trastuzumab when given with similar chemotherapy.Cardiac safety was better in the 9-week group.The docetaxel dosing with trastuzumab requires further study.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00593697.",1,1,1,1
23002282,"A randomized phase II study evaluating the combination of carboplatin-based chemotherapy with pertuzumab versus carboplatin-based therapy alone in patients with relapsed, platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer.BACKGROUND: Pertuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)-mediated signalling, has shown activity in ovarian cancer in preclinical models and in the clinic.This randomized phase II study evaluated efficacy and safety of pertuzumab in combination with carboplatin-based chemotherapy in patients with platinum-sensitive, recurrent advanced ovarian cancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomized to receive six cycles of chemotherapy (carboplatin and either paclitaxel (Taxol) or gemcitabine) with or without pertuzumab.The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) as determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors and/or by CA 125 measurements.Secondary end points evaluated the response rate, safety profile, duration of response, time to progression and overall survival for both treatment arms.RESULTS: A total of 149 patients received either chemotherapy with pertuzumab (arm A, n=74) or chemotherapy alone (arm B, n=75).There was no significant difference either in median PFS or in the secondary end points between the two arms.No differences were seen in an exploratory biomarker analysis of HER3 mRNA expression between the two arms.Pertuzumab was well tolerated, with no increase in cardiac adverse events compared with chemotherapy alone.CONCLUSIONS: The addition of pertuzumab to carboplatin-based chemotherapy did not substantially prolong PFS in unselected patients with platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer.",1,1,1,0
24290734,"Bioequivalence of Liposome-Entrapped Paclitaxel Easy-To-Use (LEP-ETU) formulation and paclitaxel in polyethoxylated castor oil: a randomized, two-period crossover study in patients with advanced cancer.BACKGROUND: Preclinical studies comparing paclitaxel formulated with polyethoxylated castor oil with the sonicated formulation of liposome-entrapped paclitaxel (LEP) have demonstrated that LEP was associated with reduced toxicity while maintaining similar efficacy.Preliminary studies on the pharmacokinetics in patients support earlier preclinical data, which suggested that the LEP Easy-to-Use (LEP-ETU) formulation and paclitaxel formulated with castor oil may have comparable pharmacokinetic properties.OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were: (1) to determine bioequivalence of paclitaxel pharmaceutically formulated as LEP-ETU (test) and paclitaxel formulated with castor oil (reference); and (2) to assess the tolerability of LEP-ETU following intravenous administration.METHODS: Patients with advanced cancer were studied in a randomized, 2-period crossover bioequivalence study.Patients received paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2) administered as an intravenous infusion over 180 minutes, either as a single-treatment cycle of the test formulation followed by a single-treatment cycle of the reference formulation, or vice versa.RESULTS: Thirty-two of 58 patients were evaluable and were included in the analysis for bioequivalence.Mean total paclitaxel Cmax values for the test and reference formulations were 4955.0 and 5108.8 ng/mL, respectively.Corresponding AUC0-infinity values were 15,853.8 and 18,550.8 ng.h/mL, respectively.Treatment ratios of the geometric means were 97% (90% CI, 91%-103%) for Cmax and 84% (90% CI, 80%-90%) for AUC0-infinity.These results met the required 80% to 125% bioequivalence criteria.The most frequently reported adverse events after LEP-ETU administration were fatigue, alopecia, and myalgia.CONCLUSION: At the studied dose regimen, LEP-ETU showed bioequivalence with paclitaxel formulated with polyethoxylated castor oil.",1,1,0,0

27262301,"Pretreatment quality of life, performance status and their relation to treatment discontinuation and treatment changes in high-risk breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy: results from the prospective randomized ADEBAR trial.BACKGROUND: Health-related quality of life (QoL) is a self-assessed construct indicating how people feel in regard to aspects of their health.Performance status (PS) is evaluated by the treating physician.We examined whether pretreatment QoL and PS are related to subsequent treatment discontinuation and treatment changes in high-risk breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study with data from a randomized phase III trial comparing FEC- and EC-DOC-chemotherapy in patients with primary breast cancer (ADEBAR).We examined the patient's request to discontinue the study, discontinuation due to toxicity, the prolongation of therapy, and dose reduction.Baseline QoL was assessed using the EORTC QLQ-C30.PS was evaluated using the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Scale (ECOG).Four QoL scales were selected prior to analysis as outcomes: global health, physical functioning, emotional functioning, and fatigue.Multivariate binary logistic regression analyses were used to test for differences within the independent variables.MAIN RESULTS: 1322 patients were included.1094 (82.8 %) patients completed therapy according to protocol.6.3 % stopped therapy due to toxicity and 4.4 % refused treatment.Global health was not related to any of the four QoL outcomes.Physical functioning had the strongest impact on QoL, when comparing the fittest group to the lowest quintile [OR 2.14 (95 % CI 1.00-4.60)].ECOG 0 compared to worse than 1 was strongly correlated to therapy discontinuation due to toxicity [OR 20.15 (95 % CI 9.48-42.83)] and treatment refusal [OR 8.32 (95 % CI 3.81-18.14)].CONCLUSIONS: Pretreatment QoL, especially physical functioning, is associated with subsequent therapy discontinuation due to toxicity and with changes of the treatment protocol.Pretreatment performance status is strongly associated with therapy discontinuation due to toxicity and with treatment refusal.",0,0,0,0
24435414,"Long term duration of protective effect for HPV negative women: follow-up of primary HPV screening randomised controlled trial.OBJECTIVES: To assess whether the increased sensitivity of screening for human papillomavirus (HPV) may represent overdiagnosis and to compare the long term duration of protective effect against cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CIN2+) in HPV based and cytology based screening.DESIGN: 13 year follow-up of the Swedescreen randomised controlled trial of primary HPV screening.SETTING: Organised cervical screening programme in Sweden.PARTICIPANTS: 12,527 women aged 32-38 attending organised screening were enrolled and randomised to HPV and cytology double testing (intervention arm, n=6257) or to cytology only, with samples frozen for future HPV testing (control arm, n=6270).MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cumulative incidence of CIN2+ and CIN3+ (Kaplan Meier curves).Longitudinal test characteristics were calculated for cytology only, HPV testing only, and cytology and HPV testing combined, adjusting for censoring.RESULTS: The increased detection of CIN2+ in the intervention arm decreased over time.After six years, the cumulative incidence of CIN3+ was similar in both trial arms, and after 11 years the cumulative incidence of CIN2+ became similar in both arms.The longitudinal sensitivity of cytology for CIN2+ in the control arm at three years was similar to the sensitivity of HPV testing in the intervention arm at five years of follow-up: 85.94% (95% confidence interval 76.85% to 91.84%) v 86.40% (79.21% to 91.37%).The sensitivity of HPV screening for CIN3+after five years was 89.34% (80.10% to 94.58%) and for cytology after three years was 92.02% (80.59% to 96.97%).CONCLUSIONS: Over long term follow-up, the cumulative incidence of CIN2+ was the same for HPV screening and for cytology, implying that the increased sensitivity of HPV screening for CIN2+ reflects earlier detection rather than overdiagnosis.The low long term risks of CIN3+ among women who tested negative in HPV screening, support screening intervals of five years for such women.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00479375.",0,0,0,0
22890582,"Oral supplementation of branched-chain amino acids reduces early recurrence after hepatic resection in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma: a prospective study.PURPOSES: The long-term outcomes of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) administration after hepatic resection in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unclear.This study assessed the effect of oral supplementation with BCAA on the development of liver tumorigenesis after hepatic resection in HCC patients.METHODS: Fifty-six patients were randomly assigned to receive either BCAA supplementation (Livact group, n = 26) or a conventional diet (Control group, n = 30).Twenty-six patients in the BCAA group were treated orally for 2 weeks before and 6 months after hepatic resection.Postoperative tumor recurrence was continuously evaluated in all patients by measuring various clinical parameters.RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the overall survival rate between the two patient groups; however, the recurrence rate at 30 months after surgery was significantly better in the Livact group in comparison to the Control group.Interestingly, the tumor markers, such as AFP and PIVKA-II, significantly decreased at 36 months after liver resection in the Livact group in comparison to the Control group.CONCLUSIONS: Oral supplementation of BCAA reduces early recurrence after hepatic resection in patients with HCC.This treatment regimen offers potential benefits for clinical use in such patients, even in cases with a well-preserved preoperative liver function.",1,1,1,1
26946057,"BRCA1-like profile predicts benefit of tandem high dose epirubicin-cyclophospamide-thiotepa in high risk breast cancer patients randomized in the WSG-AM01 trial.BRCA1 is an important protein in the repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), which are induced by alkylating chemotherapy.A BRCA1-like DNA copy number signature derived from tumors with a BRCA1 mutation is indicative for impaired BRCA1 function and associated with good outcome after high dose (HD) and tandem HD DSB inducing chemotherapy.We investigated whether BRCA1-like status was a predictive biomarker in the WSG AM 01 trial.WSG AM 01 randomized high-risk breast cancer patients to induction (2x epirubicin-cyclophosphamide) followed by tandem HD chemotherapy with epirubicin, cyclophosphamide and thiotepa versus dose dense chemotherapy (4x epirubicin-cyclophospamide followed by 3x cyclophosphamide-methotrexate-5-fluorouracil).We generated copy number profiles for 143 tumors and classified them as being BRCA1-like or non-BRCA1-like.Twenty-six out of 143 patients were BRCA1-like.BRCA1-like status was associated with high grade and triple negative tumors.With regard to event-free-survival, the primary endpoint of the trial, patients with a BRCA1-like tumor had a hazard rate of 0.2, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.07-0.63, p = 0.006.In the interaction analysis, the combination of BRCA1-like status and HD chemotherapy had a hazard rate of 0.19, 95% CI: 0.067-0.54, p = 0.003.Similar results were observed for overall survival.These findings suggest that BRCA1-like status is a predictor for benefit of tandem HD chemotherapy with epirubicin-thiotepa-cyclophosphamide.",1,1,1,1
23222000,"Obesity-related hormones and endometrial cancer among postmenopausal women: a nested case-control study within the B~FIT cohort.Endometrial cancer risk is strongly influenced by obesity, but the mechanisms of action remain unclear.Leptin and adiponectin, secreted from adipose tissue, reportedly play a role in such carcinogenic processes as cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and insulin regulation.In this case-control study, nested within the Breast and Bone Follow-up of the Fracture Intervention Trial (n=15,595), we assessed pre-diagnostic serum leptin, total adiponectin, and high-molecular-weight (HMW) adiponectin in relation to endometrial cancer among postmenopausal women.During the 10-year follow-up, 62 incident endometrial cases were identified and matched to 124 controls on age, geographical site, time of fasting blood draw at baseline (1992-1993), and trial participation status.Adipokines and C-peptide were measured by ELISA.Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated via conditional logistic regression, with exposures categorized in tertiles (T).Multivariable models considered C-peptide, BMI (kg/m(2)), and estradiol (E2) as potential confounders.Endometrial cancer risk was significantly associated with higher leptin levels, adjusted for E2 and C-peptide (OR(T3 vs T1)=2.96; 95% CI, 1.21-7.25; P trend <0.01).After further adjustment for BMI, the estimates were attenuated and the positive trend was no longer statistically significant (OR(T3 vs T1)=2.11; 95% CI, 0.69-6.44; P trend=0.18).No significant associations were observed with adiponectin or HMW adiponectin and endometrial cancer.Our findings with leptin suggest that the leptin-BMI axis might increase endometrial cancer risk through mechanisms other than estrogen-driven proliferation.Continued exploration of these pathways in larger prospective studies may help elucidate mechanisms underlying observed obesity-endometrial cancer associations.",0,0,0,0

23281805,"Randomized Phase II trial of paclitaxel and carboplatin followed by gemcitabine switch-maintenance therapy versus gemcitabine and carboplatin followed by gemcitabine continuation-maintenance therapy in previously untreated advanced non-small cell lung cancer.BACKGROUND: In recent years, maintenance chemotherapy is increasingly being recognized as a new treatment strategy to improve the outcome of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).However, the optimal maintenance strategy is still controversial.Gemcitabine is a promising candidate for single-agent maintenance therapy because of little toxicity and good tolerability.We have conducted a randomized phase II study to evaluate the validity of single-agent maintenance chemotherapy of gemcitabine and to compare continuation- and switch-maintenance.METHODS: Chemonaive patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC were randomly assigned 1:1 to either arm A or B. Patients received paclitaxel (200 mg/m2, day 1) plus carboplatin (AUC 6 mg/mL/min, day 1) every 3 weeks in arm A, or gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2, days 1 and 8) plus carboplatin (AUC 5 mg/mL/min, day1) every 3 weeks in arm B. Non-progressive patients following 3 cycles of induction chemotherapy received maintenance gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2, days 1 and 8) every 3 weeks.( TRIAL REGISTRATION: UMIN000008252)RESULTS: The study was stopped because of delayed accrual at interim analysis.Of the randomly assigned 50 patients, 49 except for one in arm B were evaluable.Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 4.6 months for arm A vs. 3.5 months for arm B (HR = 1.03; 95% CI, 0.45-2.27; p = 0.95) and median overall survival (OS) was 15.0 months for arm A vs. 14.8 months for arm B (HR = 0.79; 95% CI, 0.40-1.51; p = 0.60), showing no difference between the two arms.The response rate, disease control rate, and the transit rate to maintenance phase were 36.0% (9/25), 64.0% (16/25), and 48% (12/25) for arm A vs. 16.7% (4/24), 50.0% (12/24), and 33% (8/24) for arm B, which were also statistically similar between the two arms (p = 0.13, p = 0.32, and p = 0.30, respectively).Both induction regimens were tolerable, except that more patients experienced peripheral neuropathy in arm A. Toxicities during the maintenance phase were also minimal.CONCLUSION: Survival and overall response were not significantly different between the two arms.Gemcitabine may be well-tolerable and feasible for maintenance therapy.",1,1,1,1

A Hellenic Cooperative Oncology Group (HeCOG) trial.Several studies support an important role of angiogenesis in breast cancer growth and metastasis.The main objectives of the study were to investigate the immunohistochemical expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family ligands (VEGF-A and VEGF-C) and receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3) in breast cancer and their associations with clinicopathological parameters, cancer subtypes/subgroups and patient outcome.Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue samples were collected from early-stage breast cancer patients treated with anthracycline-based chemotherapy within a randomized trial.Immunohistochemistry was performed on serial 2.5 mum thick tissue sections from tissue microarray blocks.High VEGF-A, VEGF-C, VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3 protein expression was observed in 11.8% (N = 87), 80.8% (N = 585), 28.1% (N = 202), 64.6% (N = 359) and 71.8% (N = 517) of the cases, respectively.Significant associations were observed among all proteins (all p-values <0.05), with the exception of the one between VEGF-C and VEGFR1 (chi-square test, p = 0.15).Tumors with high VEGF-A protein expression, as compared to tumors with low expression were more frequently ER/PgR-negative (33.3% vs. 20.8%, chi-square test, p = 0.009) and HER2-positive (44.8% vs. 20.6%, p<0.001).In addition, tumors with high VEGFR1 expression, were more frequently HER2-positive (32.8% vs. 19.6%, p<0.001), while tumors with high VEGFR3 expression were more frequently ER/PgR-negative (24.9% vs. 17.0%, p = 0.024) and HER2-positive (26.9% vs. 14.8%, p = 0.001).High VEGF-A and VEGF-C protein expression was associated with increased DFS in the entire cohort (HR = 0.57, 95% CI 0.36-0.92, Wald's p = 0.020 and HR = 0.71, 95% CI 0.52-0.96, p = 0.025, respectively), as well as in specific subtypes/subgroups, such as HER2-positive (VEGF-A, HR = 0.32, 95% CI 0.14-0.74, p = 0.008) and triple-negative (VEGF-C, HR = 0.44, 95% CI 0.21-0.91, p = 0.027) patients.High vs. low VEGFR1 expression was an unfavorable factor for DFS in triple-negative patients (HR = 2.74, 95% CI 1.26-5.98, p = 0.011), whereas the opposite was observed among the ER/PgR-positive patients (HR = 0.69, 95% CI 0.48-0.98, p = 0.041).Regarding OS, high VEGF-C protein expression was associated with increased OS in the entire cohort (HR = 0.64, 95% CI 0.46-0.89, Wald's p = 0.008), as well as in in specific subtypes/subgroups, such as ER/PgR-negative (HR = 0.37, 95% CI 0.20-0.71, p = 0.003) and triple-negative (HR = 0.42, 95% CI 0.19-0.90, p = 0.026) patients.In conclusion, high expression of angiogenesis-related proteins is associated with adverse clinicopathological parameters in early-stage breast cancer patients and may be surrogate markers of biologically distinct subgroups of ER/PgR-negative or triple-negative tumors with superior outcome.Further validation of our findings in independent cohorts is needed.",0,0,0,0
24141008,"Improved survival with ursodeoxycholic acid prophylaxis in allogeneic stem cell transplantation: long-term follow-up of a randomized study.We report the long-term results of a prospective randomized study on the use of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) for prevention of hepatic complications after allogeneic stem cell transplantation.Two hundred forty-two patients, 232 with malignant disease, were randomized to receive (n = 123) or not to receive (n = 119) UDCA from the beginning of the conditioning until 90 days post-transplantation.The results were reported after 1-year follow-up.UDCA administration reduced significantly the proportion of patients developing high serum bilirubin levels as well as the incidence of severe acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), liver GVHD, and intestinal GVHD.In the UDCA prophylaxis group, nonrelapse mortality (NRM) was lower and overall survival better than in the control group.After a 10-year follow-up, the difference in the survival and NRM in favor of the UDCA-treated group, seen at 1 year, was maintained (survival 48% versus 38%, P = .037; NRM 28% versus 41%, P = .01).A landmark analysis in patients surviving at 1 year post-transplantation showed no significant differences between the study groups in the long-term follow-up in chronic GVHD, relapse rate, NRM, disease-free survival, or overall survival.These long-term results continue to support the useful role of UDCA in the prevention of transplant-related complications in allogeneic transplantation.",1,1,1,1
29534639,"Cytokeratin-18 fragments predict treatment response and overall survival in gastric cancer in a randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer is common malignancy and exhibits a poor prognosis.At the time of diagnosis, the majority of patients present with metastatic disease which precludes curative treatment.Non-invasive biomarkers which discriminate early from advanced stages or predict the response to treatment are urgently required.This study explored the cytokeratin-18 fragment M30 and full-length cytokeratin-18 M65 in predicting treatment response and survival in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of advanced gastric cancer.METHODS: Patients enrolled in the SUN-CASE study received sunitinib or placebo as an adjunct to standard therapy with leucovorin (Ca-folinate), 5-fluorouracil, and irinotecan in second or third line.Treatment response rates, progression-free survival and overall survival were assessed during a follow-up period of 12 months.Cytokeratin-18 fragments were analyzed in 52 patients at baseline and day 14 of therapy.RESULTS: Levels of M30 correlated with the presence of metastasis and lymph node involvement and decreased significantly during chemotherapy.Importantly, baseline levels of M30 were significantly higher in patients who failed therapy.In addition, patients who did not respond to treatment were also identifiable at day 14 based on elevated M30 levels.By stepwise regression analysis, M30 at day 14 was identified as independent predictor of treatment response.Likewise, serum levels of full-length cytokeratin-18 M65 at baseline also correlated with treatment failure and progression-free survival.The addition of sunitinib did not exert any effects on serum levels of M30 or M65.CONCLUSION: The cytokeratin-18 fragment M30 at day 14 identifies patients that fail to second- or third-line therapy for advanced gastric cancer.Validation of this non-invasive biomarker in gastric cancer is warranted.",1,1,1,1
30817251,"Phase III Trial of PROSTVAC in Asymptomatic or Minimally Symptomatic Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.PURPOSE: PROSTVAC, a viral vector-based immunotherapy, prolonged median overall survival (OS) by 8.5 months versus placebo in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in a phase II study.This phase III study further investigated those findings.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to PROSTVAC (Arm V; n = 432), PROSTVAC plus granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (Arm VG; n = 432), or placebo (Arm P; n = 433), stratified by prostate-specific antigen (less than 50 ng/mL v 50 ng/mL or more) and lactate dehydrogenase (less than 200 v 200 U/L or more).Primary end point was OS.Secondary end points were patients alive without events (AWE)-namely, radiographic progression, pain progression, chemotherapy initiation, or death-at 6 months and safety.The study design was a superiority trial of PROSTVAC (Arm V or Arm VG) versus Arm P. Three interim analyses were planned.RESULTS: At the third interim analysis, criteria for futility were met and the trial was stopped early.Neither active treatment had an effect on median OS (Arm V, 34.4 months; hazard ratio, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.84 to 1.20; P = .47; Arm VG, 33.2 months; hazard ratio, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.86 to 1.22; P = .59; Arm P, 34.3 months).Likewise, AWE at 6 months was similar (Arm V, 29.4%; odds ratio, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.71 to 1.29; Arm VG, 28.0%; odds ratio, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.66 to 1.20; placebo, 30.3%).Adverse events were similar for the treatment and placebo groups, with the most common being injection site reactions (62% to 72%) and fatigue (21% to 24%).Arrhythmias were the most common cardiac-related events (1.4% to 3.5%).There were no reports of either myocarditis or pericarditis.Serious treatment-related events occurred in less than 1% of all patients.CONCLUSION: Whereas PROSTVAC was safe and well tolerated, it had no effect on OS or AWE in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.Combination therapy is currently being explored in clinical trials.",0,0,0,0

28159846,"Standardised versus individualised multiherb Chinese herbal medicine for oligomenorrhoea and amenorrhoea in polycystic ovary syndrome: a randomised feasibility and pilot study in the UK.OBJECTIVES: To explore feasibility of a randomised study using standardised or individualised multiherb Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) for oligomenorrhoea and amenorrhoea in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), to pilot study methods and to obtain clinical data to support sample size calculations.DESIGN: Prospective, pragmatic, randomised feasibility and pilot study with participant and practitioner blinding.SETTING: 2 private herbal practices in the UK.PARTICIPANTS: 40 women diagnosed with PCOS and oligomenorrhoea or amenorrhoea following Rotterdam criteria.INTERVENTION: 6 months of either standardised CHM or individualised CHM, 16 g daily taken orally as a tea.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Our primary objective was to determine whether oligomenorrhoea and amenorrhoea were appropriate as the primary outcome measures for the main study.Estimates of treatment effects were obtained for menstrual rate, body mass index (BMI), weight and hirsutism.Data were collected regarding safety, feasibility and acceptability.RESULTS: Of the 40 participants recruited, 29 (72.5%) completed the study.The most frequently cited symptoms of concern were hirsutism, weight and menstrual irregularity.Statistically significant improvements in menstrual rates were found at 6 months within group for both standardised CHM (mean difference (MD) 0.18+/-0.06, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.29; p=0.0027) and individualised CHM (MD 0.27+/-0.06, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.39; p<0.001), though not between group (p=0.26).No improvements were observed for BMI nor for weight in either group.Improvements in hirsutism scores found within group for both groups were not statistically significant between group (p=0.09).Liver and kidney function and adverse events data were largely normal.Participant feedback suggests changing to tablet administration could facilitate adherence.CONCLUSIONS: A CHM randomised controlled trial for PCOS is feasible and preliminary data suggest that both individualised and standardised multiherb CHMs have similar safety profiles and clinical effects on promoting menstrual regularity.These data will inform the design of a study in primary care that will incorporate an appropriate control.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN 31072075; Results.",1,0,0,0
22149921,"ABVD alone versus radiation-based therapy in limited-stage Hodgkin's lymphoma.BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy plus radiation treatment is effective in controlling stage IA or IIA nonbulky Hodgkin's lymphoma in 90% of patients but is associated with late treatment-related deaths.Chemotherapy alone may improve survival because it is associated with fewer late deaths.METHODS: We randomly assigned 405 patients with previously untreated stage IA or IIA nonbulky Hodgkin's lymphoma to treatment with doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD) alone or to treatment with subtotal nodal radiation therapy, with or without ABVD therapy.Patients in the ABVD-only group, both those with a favorable risk profile and those with an unfavorable risk profile, received four to six cycles of ABVD.Among those assigned to subtotal nodal radiation therapy, patients who had a favorable risk profile received subtotal nodal radiation therapy alone and patients with an unfavorable risk profile received two cycles of ABVD plus subtotal nodal radiation therapy.The primary end point was 12-year overall survival.RESULTS: The median length of follow-up was 11.3 years.At 12 years, the rate of overall survival was 94% among those receiving ABVD alone, as compared with 87% among those receiving subtotal nodal radiation therapy (hazard ratio for death with ABVD alone, 0.50; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.25 to 0.99; P=0.04); the rates of freedom from disease progression were 87% and 92% in the two groups, respectively (hazard ratio for disease progression, 1.91; 95% CI, 0.99 to 3.69; P=0.05); and the rates of event-free survival were 85% and 80%, respectively (hazard ratio for event, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.54 to 1.43; P=0.60).Among the patients randomly assigned to ABVD alone, 6 patients died from Hodgkin's lymphoma or an early treatment complication and 6 died from another cause; among those receiving radiation therapy, 4 deaths were related to Hodgkin's lymphoma or early toxic effects from the treatment and 20 were related to another cause.CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma, ABVD therapy alone, as compared with treatment that included subtotal nodal radiation therapy, was associated with a higher rate of overall survival owing to a lower rate of death from other causes.(Funded by the Canadian Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute; HD.6 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00002561.).",1,1,1,1
25081390,"NY-ESO-1 specific antibody and cellular responses in melanoma patients primed with NY-ESO-1 protein in ISCOMATRIX and boosted with recombinant NY-ESO-1 fowlpox virus.Vaccination strategies based on repeated injections of NY-ESO-1 protein formulated in ISCOMATRIX particles (NY-ESO-1 ISCOMATRIX) have shown to elicit combined NY-ESO-1 specific antibody and T cell responses.However, it remains unclear whether heterologous prime-boost strategies based on the combination with NY-ESO-1 ISCOMATRIX with different NY-ESO-1 boosting reagents could be used to increase NY-ESO-1 CD8(+) or CD4(+) T cell responses.To address this question, we carried out a randomized clinical trial in 39 high-risk, resected melanoma patients vaccinated with NY-ESO-1 ISCOMATRIX, and then boosted with repeated injections of either recombinant fowlpox virus encoding full length NY-ESO-1 (rF-NY-ESO-1) (Arm A) or NY-ESO-1 ISCOMATRIX alone (Arm B).We have comprehensively analyzed NY-ESO-1 specific T cells and B cells response in all patients before and after vaccination for a total of seven time points per patient.NY-ESO-1 ISCOMATRIX alone elicited a strong NY-ESO-1 specific CD4(+) T cell and antibody response, which was maintained by both regiments at similar levels.However, CD8(+) T cell responses were significantly boosted in 3 out of 18 patients in Arm A after the first rF-NY-ESO-1 injection and such responses were maintained until the end of the trial, while no patients in Arm B showed similar CD8(+) T cell responses.In addition, our results clearly identified immunodominant regions in the NY-ESO-1 protein: NY-ESO-179-102 and NY-ESO-1115-138 for CD4+ T cells and NY-ESO-185-108 for CD8+ T cells in a large proportion of vaccinated patients.These regions of NY-ESO-1 protein should be considered in future clinical trials as immunodominant epitopes.",1,1,1,1

29444771,"Consumption of ultra-processed foods and cancer risk: results from NutriNet-Sante prospective cohort.OBJECTIVE: To assess the prospective associations between consumption of ultra-processed food and risk of cancer.DESIGN: Population based cohort study.SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: 104 980 participants aged at least 18 years (median age 42.8 years) from the French NutriNet-Sante cohort (2009-17).Dietary intakes were collected using repeated 24 hour dietary records, designed to register participants' usual consumption for 3300 different food items.These were categorised according to their degree of processing by the NOVA classification.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Associations between ultra-processed food intake and risk of overall, breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer assessed by multivariable Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for known risk factors.RESULTS: Ultra-processed food intake was associated with higher overall cancer risk (n=2228 cases; hazard ratio for a 10% increment in the proportion of ultra-processed food in the diet 1.12 (95% confidence interval 1.06 to 1.18); P for trend<0.001) and breast cancer risk (n=739 cases; hazard ratio 1.11 (1.02 to 1.22); P for trend=0.02).These results remained statistically significant after adjustment for several markers of the nutritional quality of the diet (lipid, sodium, and carbohydrate intakes and/or a Western pattern derived by principal component analysis).CONCLUSIONS: In this large prospective study, a 10% increase in the proportion of ultra-processed foods in the diet was associated with a significant increase of greater than 10% in risks of overall and breast cancer.Further studies are needed to better understand the relative effect of the various dimensions of processing (nutritional composition, food additives, contact materials, and neoformed contaminants) in these associations.STUDY REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT03335644.",0,0,0,0
25361980,"Translational studies within the TAMRAD randomized GINECO trial: evidence for mTORC1 activation marker as a predictive factor for everolimus efficacy in advanced breast cancer.BACKGROUND: Everolimus is an agent frequently associated with specific toxicities.Predictive markers of efficacy are needed to help define which patients could benefit from it.The goal of this exploratory study was to identify potential predictive biomarkers in the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1) activation pathway using primary tumor samples collected during the phase II tamoxifen plus everolimus (TAMRAD) trial.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Tumor tissues were collected retrospectively from the TAMRAD trial.Immunohistochemistry was carried out using specific antibodies directed toward proteins that result in mTORC1 activation [canonical phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt)/mTOR or alternative pathways].DNA was extracted from the tumor tissue; mutation screening in the PIK3CA gene (exons 9 and 20) and the KRAS gene (exons 2 and 3) was first carried out using Sanger direct sequencing, and then completed by next-generation sequencing for PIK3CA.An exploratory analysis of everolimus efficacy in terms of a time-to-progression (TTP) increase was carried out in each biomarker subgroup (high versus low expression referring to the median percentage of marked cells).RESULTS: A total of 55 primary tumor samples from the TAMRAD trial-25 from the tamoxifen-alone group and 30 from the tamoxifen/everolimus group-were evaluated for biomarkers.The subgroups most likely to have an improvement in TTP with tamoxifen/everolimus therapy, compared with tamoxifen alone, were patients with high p4EBP1, low 4EBP1, low liver kinase B1, low pAkt, and low PI3K.Among the 45 samples screened for mutation status, nine samples (20%; 95% CI 9.6-34.6) had a PIK3CA mutation.KRAS mutation was observed in one patient.CONCLUSIONS: A positive correlation between late effectors of mTORC1 activation, a positive correlation between Akt-independent mTORC1 activation, and an inverse correlation between canonical PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and everolimus efficacy were observed in this exploratory analysis.However, these correlations need to be validated in larger studies before applying the findings to routine clinical practice.",0,0,0,0
24051942,"[Evaluation of a new association between insulin-sensitizers and alpha-lipoic acid in obese women affected by PCOS].AIM: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a multifactorial pathology affecting 7-10% of the female population.Usually occurs with oligo/amenorrhea, anovulation, hirsutism, polycystic ovaries.Hyperinsulinemia associated with insulin resistance has been causally linked to all features of the syndrome.It has been demonstrated that by reducing hyperinsulinemia, in particular with the administration of metformin, insulin-lowering agents might improve endocrine and reproductive abnormalities in PCOS patients.METHODS: Original association between myo-inositol and alpha-lipoic acid, has recently been successfully administered in women with PCOS.The alpha-lipoic acid is a powerful natural antioxidant and an enzyme cofactor of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, is found to be a substance capable of improving glycemic control in patients with type II diabetes.In our study we compared two groups: group A, treated with metformin (3 g) and group B treated with metformin (1.7 g), myo-inositol and alpha-lipoic acid.RESULTS: The results of this study demonstrated a good efficacy of both treatments, although in the group treated with the combination of metformin/myo-inositol/alpha-lipoic acid improvement in hyperandrogenism, BMI and HOMA index were significantly better.CONCLUSION: Thus, the association metformin/myo-inositol/alpha-lipoic acid represents an excellent therapy choice to suggest to those obese women affected by PCOS who do not want to take hormones and neither to have any severe side effect.",0,0,0,0

27325147,"Adrenal vein sampling versus CT scan to determine treatment in primary aldosteronism: an outcome-based randomised diagnostic trial.BACKGROUND: The distinction between unilateral aldosterone-producing adenoma or bilateral adrenal hyperplasia as causes of primary aldosteronism is usually made by adrenal CT or by adrenal vein sampling (AVS).Whether CT or AVS represents the best test for diagnosis remains unknown.We aimed to compare the outcome of CT-based management with AVS-based management for patients with primary aldosteronism.METHODS: In a randomised controlled trial, we randomly assigned patients with aldosteronism to undergo either adrenal CT or AVS to determine the presence of aldosterone-producing adenoma (with subsequent treatment consisting of adrenalectomy) or bilateral adrenal hyperplasia (subsequent treatment with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists).The primary endpoint was the intensity of drug treatment for obtaining target blood pressure after 1 year of follow-up, in the intention-to-diagnose population.Intensity of drug treatment was expressed as daily defined doses.Key secondary endpoints included biochemical outcome in patients who received adrenalectomy, health-related quality of life, cost-effectiveness, and adverse events.This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01096654.FINDINGS: We recruited 200 patients between July 6, 2010, and May 30, 2013.Of the 184 patients that completed follow-up, 92 received CT-based treatment (46 adrenalectomy and 46 mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist) and 92 received AVS-based treatment (46 adrenalectomy and 46 mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist).We found no differences in the intensity of antihypertensive medication required to control blood pressure between patients with CT-based treatment and those with AVS-based treatment (median daily defined doses 3.0 [IQR 1.0-5.0] vs 3.0 [1.1-5.9], p=0.52; median number of drugs 2 [IQR 1-3] vs 2 [1-3], p=0.87).Target blood pressure was reached in 39 (42%) patients and 41 (45%) patients, respectively (p=0.82).On secondary endpoints we found no differences in health-related quality of life (median RAND-36 physical scores 52.7 [IQR 43.9-56.8] vs 53.2 [44.0-56.8], p=0.83; RAND-36 mental scores 49.8 [43.1-54.6] vs 52.7 [44.9-55.5], p=0.17) for CT-based and AVS-based treatment.Biochemically, 37 (80%) of patients with CT-based adrenalectomy and 41 (89%) of those with AVS-based adrenalectomy had resolved hyperaldosteronism (p=0.25).A non-significant mean difference of 0.05 (95% CI -0.04 to 0.13) in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) was found to the advantage of the AVS group, associated with a significant increase in mean health-care costs of euro2285 per patient (95% CI 1323-3248).At a willingness-to-pay value of euro30 000 per QALY, the probability that AVS compared with CT constitutes an efficient use of health-care resources in the diagnostic work-up of patients with primary aldosteronism is less than 0.2.There was no difference in adverse events between groups (159 events of which nine were serious vs 187 events of which 12 were serious) for CT-based and AVS-based treatment.INTERPRETATION: Treatment of primary aldosteronism based on CT or AVS did not show significant differences in intensity of antihypertensive medication or clinical benefits for patients after 1 year of follow-up.This finding challenges the current recommendation to perform AVS in all patients with primary aldosteronism.FUNDING: Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development-Medical Sciences, Institute of Cardiology, Warsaw.",0,0,0,0
22290808,"Long-term effect of the self-management comprehensive coping strategy program on quality of life in patients with breast cancer treated with high-dose chemotherapy.BACKGROUND: This study aims to examine the effectiveness of a self-management multimodal comprehensive coping strategy program (CCSP) on quality of life (QOL) among breast cancer patients 1 year after treatment.METHODS: Patients (n = 110) with stage II, III, or IV breast cancer scheduled to receive high dose chemotherapy and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation were randomized to either CCSP treatment or control group.The CCSP intervention was taught 2 week before hospital admission with reinforcement at specified times during treatment and 3 months after discharge.The CCSP components included educational information, cognitive restructuring, coping skills enhancement, and relaxation with guided imagery.Instruments administered at baseline included the following: Quality of Life Index-Cancer Version (QOLI-CV), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory, and Coping Strategies Questionnaire.At 1-year follow-up, patients (n = 73) completed and returned the follow-up QOLI-CV.RESULTS: Patients were mainly >/= 40 years of age, married, Caucasian, and diagnosed with advanced breast cancer.A model measuring effectiveness of CCSP on QOL (total and subscale) at 1-year follow-up showed that the CCSP group (n = 38) had significant improvement in overall QOL (p < 0.01), health and functioning (p < 0.05), and socioeconomic (p < 0.05) and psychological/spiritual well-being (p < 0.01) compared with the control group (n = 35).The CCSP patients frequently used the CCSP to manage psychological (51%) and sleep problems (60%).CONCLUSIONS: The CCSP improved QOL for patients at 1-year follow-up.Patients overwhelmingly reported that CCSP was beneficial.The CCSP as an effective coping intervention has potential as a self-management program for breast cancer survivors.",0,0,0,0
26110667,"MR Imaging as an Additional Screening Modality for the Detection of Breast Cancer in Women Aged 50-75 Years with Extremely Dense Breasts: The DENSE Trial Study Design.Women with extremely dense breasts have an increased risk of breast cancer and lower mammographic tumor detectability.Nevertheless, in most countries, these women are currently screened with mammography only.Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has the potential to improve breast cancer detection at an early stage because of its higher sensitivity.However, MR imaging is more expensive and is expected to be accompanied by an increase in the number of false-positive results and, possibly, an increase in overdiagnosis.To study the additional value of MR imaging, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design is needed in which one group undergoes mammography and the other group undergoes mammography and MR imaging.With this design, it is possible to determine the proportion of interval cancers within each study arm.For this to be an effective screening strategy, the additional cancers detected at MR imaging screening must be accompanied by a subsequent reduction in interval cancers.The Dense Tissue and Early Breast Neoplasm Screening, or DENSE, trial is a multicenter RCT performed in the Dutch biennial population-based screening program (subject age range, 50-75 years).The study was approved by the Dutch Minister of Health, Welfare and Sport.In this study, mammographic density is measured by using a fully automated volumetric method.Participants with extremely dense breasts (American College of Radiology breast density category 4) and a negative result at mammography (Breast Imaging Recording and Data System category 1 or 2) are randomly assigned to undergo additional MR imaging (n = 7237) or to be treated according to current practice (n = 28 948).Participants provide written informed consent before the MR imaging examination, which consists of dynamic breast MR imaging with gadolinium-based contrast medium and is intended to be performed for three consecutive screening rounds.The primary outcome is the difference in the proportions of interval cancers between the study arms.Secondary outcomes are the number of MR imaging screening-detected cancers, proportions of false-positive results, diagnostic yield of MR imaging, tumor characteristics, quality of life, and cost effectiveness.",0,0,0,0
22965507,"Sclerotherapy of simple hepatic cysts by repeated aspiration and alcohol instillation.BACKGROUND/AIMS: The efficacy and safety of traditional alcohol sclerotherapy procedures are controversial in the management of large simple hepatic cysts.In this study, we aimed to develop and evaluate a novel alcohol sclerotherapy procedure, termed repeated aspiration and alcohol instillation sclerotherapy, for the treatment of simple hepatic cysts.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective, double-blind, randomized study was performed.Sixty-seven patients with large simple hepatic cysts were randomized into two groups to receive either single-session alcohol retention sclerotherapy (alcohol was instilled into the cyst cavity, kept for 20 minutes and aspirated) or repeated aspiration and alcohol instillation sclerotherapy (instillation of 30-70 ml of alcohol and immediate aspiration with repetition 3 to 6 times until the estimated alcohol concentration exceeded 80%).The cyst volume reduction was calculated to compare the efficacy of the two procedures.We evaluated the safety of the procedure by monitoring side effects and assaying blood alcohol concentrations at 0, 0.5, 1, 2 and 3 hours after sclerotherapy.RESULTS: The cyst volume reduction in patients undergoing repeated aspiration and alcohol instillation sclerotherapy was significantly higher than that in those receiving alcohol-retention sclerotherapy.The concentration of alcohol in the last aspirated cyst fluid was correlated with the mean volume reduction in patients undergoing repeated aspiration and alcohol instillation sclerotherapy but not in the alcohol-retention group.Only minor side effects occurred in both groups.Although elevated blood alcohol concentration was noted in all patients, it declined to normal levels within 2-3 hours after treatment.There were no significant differences in blood alcohol concentration between the two groups.CONCLUSIONS: Repeated aspiration and alcohol instillation sclerotherapy is superior to single-session alcohol-retention sclerotherapy in the management of large simple hepatic cysts.",0,0,0,0
22674529,"A phase 3 study of induction treatment with concurrent chemoradiotherapy versus chemotherapy before surgery in patients with pathologically confirmed N2 stage IIIA nonsmall cell lung cancer (WJTOG9903).BACKGROUND: This study sought to ascertain whether induction-concurrent radiotherapy added to chemotherapy could improve the survival of patients undergoing surgery for stage IIIA N2 nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC).METHODS: Patients with pathologically proven N2 disease were randomized to receive either induction chemotherapy (docetaxel 60 mg/m(2) and carboplatin AUC [area under the receiver operating characteristic curve] = 5 for 2 cycles) plus concurrent radiation therapy (40 Gy) followed by surgery (CRS arm) or induction chemotherapy followed by surgery (CS arm).They subsequently underwent pulmonary resection when possible.RESULTS: Sixty patients were randomly assigned between December 2000 and August 2005.The study was prematurely terminated in January 2006 because of slow accrual.The most common toxicity was grade 3 or 4 leukopenia in 92.9% of patients in the CRS arm and 46.4% in the CS arm.Induction therapy was generally well tolerated, and there were no treatment-related deaths in either arm.Downstaging in the CS arm and CRS arm was 21% and 40%, respectively.The progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in the CS arm were 9.7 months and 29.9 months (PFS, hazard ratio [HR] = 0.68, P = .187), and those in the CRS arm were 12.4 months and 39.6 months (OS, HR = 0.77, P = .397), respectively.The PFS with and without downstaging was 55.0 and 9.4 months, respectively (HR = 3.39, P = .001).The OS with and without downstaging was 63.3 and 29.5 months, respectively (HR = 2.62, P = .021).CONCLUSIONS: The addition of radiotherapy to induction chemotherapy conferred better local control without significant adverse events.Tumor downstaging is important for prolonging the OS in patients with stage IIIA (N2) NSCLC.",1,1,1,1
26761561,"Physical exercise for functional capacity, blood immune function, fatigue, and quality of life in high-risk prostate cancer patients during radiotherapy: a prospective, randomized clinical study.BACKGROUND: During radiotherapy (RT), prostate cancer (PCa) patients may report cancer related fatigue (CRF), which impairs functional capacity, psychological status, and quality of life (QoL).RT can induce cytokine responses that could play a role in mediating radiation toxicity by increasing inflammation.While it is known that physical exercise plays an important anti-inflammatory role in healthy adults, its specific anti-inflammatory effects in PCa patients with CRF have not yet been determined.AIM: Previous studies have shown that physical exercise in cancer patients undergoing RT improves cardiac fitness, muscle strength, and QoL, however it is still unknown how physical exercise affects inflammation and its specific consequences in PCa patients.Therefore, the purpose of this trial was to examine the effect of supervised physical exercise on inflammatory blood markers, as well as the relationship of these parameters with functional capacity, fatigue, and QoL in high-risk PCa patients undergoing RT.DESIGN: This was a prospective, two-arm randomized controlled clinical trial.SETTING: The study was performed in our outpatients center.POPULATION: Fifty-four high-risk PCa men were randomly allocated to two groups prior to undergoing RT.METHODS: Twenty-seven patients performed supervised, moderate-intensity physical exercise (exercise group; EG) and the other 27 formed a control group that carried out normal daily physical activity (usual group; UG).The following parameters were assessed before and after RT: functional capacity, changes in blood count variables and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL]-1beta, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha), fatigue, and QoL (using FACT-F score and EORTC questionnaires).RESULTS: No significant differences existed between the study groups at baseline assessment.After RT, there was a significant improvement in functional capacity (P<0.05) and a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokine levels (P>0.05) and fatigue (P<0.05) in the EG compared to the UG.Fatigue level was significantly higher in the UG (F[2.126]; P<0.05) after RT than before.Physical exercise had no effect on the correlation between inflammatory blood markers and functional capacity and fatigue scores provided by study participants.CONCLUSIONS: Regular, moderate-intensity physical exercise improves functional capacity, decreases the production of inflammatory markers and fatigue, and has a positive influence on QoL in high-risk PCa patients during RT.CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: This is one of the first studies to examine the effects of supervised exercise training on pro-inflammatory cytokine levels during RT in PCa patients by measuring functional capacity, fatigue, and QoL.",0,0,0,0
26168782,"Converting from CT- to MRI-only-based target definition in radiotherapy of localized prostate cancer: A comparison between two modalities.PURPOSE: To investigate the conversion of prostate cancer radiotherapy (RT) target definition from CT-based planning into an MRI-only-based planning procedure.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using the CT- and MRI-only-based RT planning protocols, 30 prostate cancer patients were imaged in the RT fixation position.Two physicians delineated the prostate in both CT and T2-weighted MRI images.The CT and MRI images were coregistered based on gold seeds and anatomic borders of the prostate.The uncertainty of the coregistration, as well as differences in target volumes and uncertainty of contour delineation were investigated.Conversion of margins and dose constraints from CT- to MRI-only-based treatment planning was assessed.RESULTS: On average, the uncertainty of image coregistration was 0.4 +/- 0.5 mm (one standard deviation, SD), 0.9 +/- 0.8 mm and 0.9 +/- 0.9 mm in the lateral, anterior-posterior and base-apex direction, respectively.The average ratio of the prostate volume between CT and MRI was 1.20 +/- 0.15 (one SD).Compared to the CT-based contours, the MRI-based contours were on average 2-7 mm smaller in the apex, 0-1 mm smaller in the rectal direction and 1-4 mm smaller elsewhere.CONCLUSION: When converting from a CT-based planning procedure to an MRI-based one, the overall planning target volumes (PTV) are prominently reduced only in the apex.The prostate margins and dose constraints can be retained by this conversion.",0,0,0,0

29034009,"A multicenter, randomized study of decitabine as epigenetic priming with induction chemotherapy in children with AML.BACKGROUND: Decitabine is a deoxycytidine nucleoside derivative inhibitor of DNA-methyltransferases, which has been studied extensively and is approved for myelodysplastic syndrome in adults but with less focus in children.Accordingly, we conducted a phase 1 multicenter, randomized, open-label study to evaluate decitabine pre-treatment before standard induction therapy in children with newly diagnosed AML to assess safety and tolerability and explore a number of biologic endpoints.RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were fully assessable for all study objectives per protocol (10 in Arm A = epigenetic priming induction, 14 in Arm B = standard induction).All patients experienced neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.The most common grade 3 and 4 non-hematologic adverse events observed were gastrointestinal toxicities and hypophosphatemia.Plasma decitabine PK were similar to previously reported adult data.Overall CR/CRi was similar for the two arms.MRD negativity at end-induction was 85% in Arm A versus 67% in Arm B patients.DNA methylation measured in peripheral blood over the course of treatment tracked with blast clearance and matched marrow aspirates at day 0 and day 21.Unlike end-induction marrow analyses, promoter methylation in blood identified an apparent reversal of response in the lone treatment failure, 1 week prior to the patient's marrow aspirate confirming non-response.Decitabine-induced effects on end-induction (day 35-43 following initiation of treatment) marrows in Arm A were reflected by changes in DNA methylation in matched paired marrow diagnostic aspirates.CONCLUSIONS: This first-in-pediatrics trial demonstrates that decitabine prior to standard combination chemotherapy is feasible and well tolerated in children with newly diagnosed AML.Pre-treatment with decitabine may represent a newer therapeutic option for pediatric AML, especially as it appears to induce important epigenetic alterations.The novel biological correlates studied in this trial offer a clinically relevant window into disease progression and remission.Additional studies are needed to definitively assess whether decitabine can enhance durability responses in children with AML.TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT01177540.",1,1,1,1

22474202,"Effect of oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and leucovorin with or without cetuximab on survival among patients with resected stage III colon cancer: a randomized trial.CONTEXT: Leucovorin, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) is the standard adjuvant therapy for resected stage III colon cancer.Adding cetuximab to FOLFOX benefits patients with metastatic wild-type KRAS but not mutated KRAS colon cancer.OBJECTIVE: To assess the potential benefit of cetuximab added to the modified sixth version of the FOLFOX regimen (mFOLFOX6) in patients with resected stage III wild-type KRAS colon cancer.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A randomized trial of 2686 patients aged 18 years or older at multiple institutions across North America enrolled following resection and informed consent between February 10, 2004, and November 25, 2009.The primary randomized comparison was 12 biweekly cycles of mFOLFOX6 with and without cetuximab.KRAS mutation status was centrally determined.The trial was halted after a planned interim analysis of 48% of predicted events (246/515) occurring in 1863 (of 2070 planned) patients with tumors having wild-type KRAS.A total of 717 patients with mutated KRAS and 106 with indeterminate KRAS were accrued.The 2070 patients with wild-type KRAS provided 90% power to detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.33 (2-sided alpha = .05), with planned interim efficacy analyses after 25%, 50%, and 75% of expected relapses.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Disease-free survival in patients with wild-type KRAS mutations.Secondary end points included overall survival and toxicity.RESULTS: Median (range) follow-up was 28 (0-68) months.The trial demonstrated no benefit when adding cetuximab.Three-year disease-free survival for mFOLFOX6 alone was 74.6% vs 71.5% with the addition of cetuximab (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.98-1.49; P = .08) in patients with wild-type KRAS, and 67.1% vs 65.0% (HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.86-1.46; P = .38) in patients with mutated KRAS, with no significant benefit in any subgroups assessed.Among all patients, grade 3 or higher adverse events (72.5% vs 52.3%; odds ratio [OR], 2.4; 95% CI, 2.1-2.8; P < .001) and failure to complete 12 cycles (33% vs 23%; OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.4-1.9; P < .001) were significantly higher with cetuximab.Increased toxicity and greater detrimental differences in all outcomes were observed in patients aged 70 years or older.CONCLUSION: Among patients with stage III resected colon cancer, the use of cetuximab with adjuvant mFOLFOX6 compared with mFOLFOX6 alone did not result in improved disease-free survival.TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00079274.",1,1,1,1
23497452,"A randomized trial to assess the biological activity of short-term (pre-surgical) fulvestrant 500 mg plus anastrozole versus fulvestrant 500 mg alone or anastrozole alone on primary breast cancer.INTRODUCTION: Fulvestrant shows dose-dependent biological activity.Greater estrogen-receptor (ER) blockade may feasibly be achieved by combining fulvestrant with anastrozole.This pre-surgical study compared fulvestrant plus anastrozole versus either agent alone in patients with ER-positive breast cancer.METHODS: In this double-blind, multicenter trial, 121 patients received fulvestrant 500 mg on Day 1 plus anastrozole 1 mg/day for 14 to 21 days (F + A); fulvestrant plus anastrozole placebo (F); or fulvestrant placebo plus anastrozole (A), 2 to 3 weeks before surgery.ER, progesterone-receptor (PgR) and Ki67 expression were determined from tumor biopsies before treatment and at surgery.RESULTS: A total of 103 paired samples were available (F, n = 35; F+A, n = 31; A, n = 37).All treatments significantly reduced mean ER expression from baseline (F: -41%, P = 0.0001; F + A: -39%, P = 0.0001; A: -13%, P = 0.0034).F and F + A led to greater reductions in ER versus A (both P = 0.0001); F + A did not lead to additional reductions versus F. PgR and Ki67 expression were significantly reduced with all treatments (means were -34% to -45%, and -75% to -85%, respectively; all P = 0.0001), with no differences between groups.CONCLUSIONS: In this short-term study, all treatments reduced ER expression, although F and F + A showed greater reductions than A. No significant differences were detected between the treatment groups in terms of PgR and Ki67 expression.No additional reduction in tumor biomarkers with combination treatment was observed, suggesting that F + A is unlikely to have further clinical benefit over F alone.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00259090.",1,1,1,1
29534639,"Cytokeratin-18 fragments predict treatment response and overall survival in gastric cancer in a randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer is common malignancy and exhibits a poor prognosis.At the time of diagnosis, the majority of patients present with metastatic disease which precludes curative treatment.Non-invasive biomarkers which discriminate early from advanced stages or predict the response to treatment are urgently required.This study explored the cytokeratin-18 fragment M30 and full-length cytokeratin-18 M65 in predicting treatment response and survival in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of advanced gastric cancer.METHODS: Patients enrolled in the SUN-CASE study received sunitinib or placebo as an adjunct to standard therapy with leucovorin (Ca-folinate), 5-fluorouracil, and irinotecan in second or third line.Treatment response rates, progression-free survival and overall survival were assessed during a follow-up period of 12 months.Cytokeratin-18 fragments were analyzed in 52 patients at baseline and day 14 of therapy.RESULTS: Levels of M30 correlated with the presence of metastasis and lymph node involvement and decreased significantly during chemotherapy.Importantly, baseline levels of M30 were significantly higher in patients who failed therapy.In addition, patients who did not respond to treatment were also identifiable at day 14 based on elevated M30 levels.By stepwise regression analysis, M30 at day 14 was identified as independent predictor of treatment response.Likewise, serum levels of full-length cytokeratin-18 M65 at baseline also correlated with treatment failure and progression-free survival.The addition of sunitinib did not exert any effects on serum levels of M30 or M65.CONCLUSION: The cytokeratin-18 fragment M30 at day 14 identifies patients that fail to second- or third-line therapy for advanced gastric cancer.Validation of this non-invasive biomarker in gastric cancer is warranted.",1,1,1,1

26188849,"Prevention of central venous catheter-associated bloodstream infections in paediatric oncology patients using 70% ethanol locks: A randomised controlled multi-centre trial.BACKGROUND: The prevention of central venous catheter (CVC) associated bloodstream infections (CABSIs) in paediatric oncology patients is essential.Ethanol locks can eliminate pathogens colonising CVCs and microbial resistance is rare.Aim of this study was to determine whether two hour 70% ethanol locks can reduce CABSI in paediatric oncology patients.METHODS: We conducted a randomised, double blind, multi-centre trial in paediatric oncology patients (1-18 years) with newly inserted CVCs.Patients were randomly assigned to receive two hour ethanol locks (1.5 or 3 ml 70%) or heparin locks (1.5 or 3 ml 100 IU/ml), whenever it was needed to use the CVC, maximum frequency once weekly.Primary outcomes were time to CABSI or death due to CABSI.RESULTS: We recruited 307 patients (ethanol, n=153; heparin, n=154).In the ethanol group, 16/153 (10%) patients developed a CABSI versus 29/154 (19%) in the heparin group.The incidence of CABSI was 0.77/1000 and 1.46/1000 catheter days respectively (p=0.039).The number-needed-to-treat was 13.No patients died of CABSI.In particular, Gram-positive CABSIs were reduced (ethanol, n=8; heparin, n=21; p=0.012).Fewer CVCs were removed because of CABSI in the ethanol group (p=0.077).The ethanol lock patients experienced significantly more transient symptoms compared to the heparin lock patients (maximum grade 2) (nausea, p=0.030; taste alteration, p<0.001; dizziness, p=0.001; blushing, p<0.001), no suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSAR) occurred.CONCLUSIONS: This is the first randomised controlled trial to show that ethanol locks can prevent CABSI in paediatric oncology patients, in particular CABSI caused by Gram-positive bacteria.Implementation of ethanol locks in clinical practice should be considered.",0,0,0,0
27197293,"Exercise-Induced Dose-Response Alterations in Adiponectin and Leptin Levels Are Dependent on Body Fat Changes in Women at Risk for Breast Cancer.BACKGROUND: Dysregulation of adipokines, such as adiponectin and leptin, is associated with a variety of chronic diseases, including cancer.Physical activity protects against breast cancer and one of the mechanisms which may underlie this association is exercise-induced changes in adipokine levels.The WISER Sister Trial was a three-armed randomized controlled trial in premenopausal women (n = 137) with an elevated risk for breast cancer.METHODS: A 5-menstrual-cycle-long dosed aerobic exercise intervention compared low-dose exercise (150 min/wk; n = 44) or high-dose exercise (300 min/wk; n = 48) with a control group asked to maintain usual activity levels (n = 45).Exercise intensity progressed to and was maintained at 70% to 80% of age predicted heart rate max.Body composition and adipokine levels were measured at baseline and follow-up.RESULTS: We observed significant linear trends for increased fitness capacity (Delta%: -2.0% control, 10.1% low dose, 13.1% high dose), decreased fat tissue-to-total tissue mass (Delta%: 0.7% control, -2.9% low dose, -3.7% high dose), increased body fat adjusted adiponectin (Delta%: -0.6% control, 0.6% low dose, 0.9% high dose), and decreased body fat adjusted leptin (Delta%: 0.7% control, -8.2% low dose, -10.2% high dose).CONCLUSIONS: In this randomized clinical trial of premenopausal women at risk for breast cancer, we demonstrate a dose-response effect of exercise on adiponectin and leptin and that dose response is dependent on changes in body fat.IMPACT: Improved adipokine levels, achieved by aerobic exercise training-induced decreases in body fat, may decrease breast cancer risk for high-risk premenopausal women.Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 25(8); 1195-200.(c)2016 AACR.",1,0,0,0
29274828,"Mean medical costs associated with vaginal and vulvar cancers for commercially insured patients in the United States and Texas.OBJECTIVE: To estimate the average medical costs for vaginal and vulvar cancers in a commercially insured population in the U.S. and Texas.METHODS: 2011-2014U.S. MarketScan databases were used to estimate the average medical costs associated with vaginal and vulvar cancers.Women with newly diagnosed vaginal or vulvar cancer were matched to a comparison group without cancer using propensity score.Year 1 and year 2 costs after index diagnosis date were estimated.A generalized linear model was used to estimate the cost for censored months.The differential costs between groups were defined as the net costs associated with cancer diagnosis and treatment.RESULTS: The analysis included 355 women with vaginal cancer and 997 with vulvar cancer in the U.S. The year 1 and year 2 costs for vaginal cancer were $86,995 and $51,107, respectively.The year 1 and year 2 costs for vulvar cancer were $37,657 and $19,139, respectively.The major factors associated with higher monthly vaginal and vulvar cancer costs were higher Charlson Comorbidity Index score and higher medical costs prior to cancer diagnosis.Monthly costs for vaginal and vulvar cancers decreased rapidly from month 1 to month 6 after diagnosis and then remained stable.CONCLUSIONS: Seventy to 75% of all vaginal and vulvar cancers are due to HPV infections and mean medical costs associated with these cancers are substantial.These data will serve as key cost parameters in the economic evaluation of HPV vaccination dissemination and estimation of the long-term net economic benefit of promoting HPV vaccination.",0,0,0,0

27382257,"Fondaparinux vs warfarin for the treatment of unsuspected pulmonary embolism in cancer patients.INTRODUCTION: In cancer patients, the chest computer tomography (CT) can be used to identify asymptomatic pulmonary embolism (APE).In most cases, these patients are treated with anticoagulant drugs for at least 3 months.The American College of Physicians recommend treatment of these patients as patients with symptomatic pulmonary embolism.In this study, we evaluated and compared the efficacy and safety of fondaparinux vs warfarin in the prevention of unsuspected pulmonary embolism in patients with active cancer.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective and parallel group study was performed on 64 cancer patients (29 males and 35 females) with APE.A multidetector CT angiography with high spatial and temporal resolution and quality of arterial opacification was used to make the diagnosis.Lung scintigraphy was reserved to selected patients only.Patients were randomized to either the warfarin (Group A) or the fondaparinux (Group B) for 90 days.The first end point of efficacy was the persistence, reduction, or disappearance of thrombosis after 90 days.The second end point was the reappearance of thrombosis after 1 year.The first end point of safety was the development of major bleeding.RESULTS: We enrolled 32 patients into each treatment group.We reached the first end point of efficacy and safety in Group B which showed that fondaparinux was able to induce the disappearance of thrombotic pulmonary with a lower incidence of major bleeding events compared with warfarin.No difference in the secondary end point was recorded.CONCLUSION: We suggest that the treatment of cancer patients with APE can be oriented with the administration of a standard dose of fondaparinux until the next CT lung control (3 months).However, the lack of a randomized clinical trial, including a larger patient cohort, does not allow formulation of final recommendations in these patients.A broader study would be desirable, involving a larger number of patients and a longer follow-up period.",0,0,0,0
25332249,"Trastuzumab plus adjuvant chemotherapy for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast cancer: planned joint analysis of overall survival from NSABP B-31 and NCCTG N9831.PURPOSE: Positive interim analysis findings from four large adjuvant trials evaluating trastuzumab in patients with early-stage human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) -positive breast cancer were first reported in 2005.One of these reports, the joint analysis of North Central Cancer Treatment Group NCCTG N9831 (Combination Chemotherapy With or Without Trastuzumab in Treating Women With HER2-Overexpressing Breast Cancer) and the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project NSABP B-31 (Doxorubicin and Cyclophosphamide Plus Paclitaxel With or Without Trastuzumab in Treating Women With Node-Positive Breast Cancer That Overexpresses HER2), was updated in 2011.We now report the planned definitive overall survival (OS) results from this joint analysis along with updates on the disease-free survival (DFS) end point.METHODS: In all, 4,046 patients with HER2-positive operable breast cancer were enrolled to receive doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel with or without trastuzumab in both trials.The required number of events for the definitive statistical analysis for OS (710 events) was reached in September 2012.Updated analyses of overall DFS and related subgroups were also performed.RESULTS: Median time on study was 8.4 years.Adding trastuzumab to chemotherapy led to a 37% relative improvement in OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.63; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.73; P < .001) and an increase in 10-year OS rate from 75.2% to 84%.These results were accompanied by an improvement in DFS of 40% (HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.68; P < .001) and increase in 10-year DFS rate from 62.2% to 73.7%.All patient subgroups benefited from addition of this targeted anti-HER2 agent.CONCLUSION: The addition of trastuzumab to paclitaxel after doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide in early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer results in a substantial and durable improvement in survival as a result of a sustained marked reduction in cancer recurrence.",0,0,0,0
30305115,"Molecular profiling of hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancers from patients treated with neoadjuvant endocrine therapy in the CARMINA 02 trial (UCBG-0609).BACKGROUND: Postmenopausal women with large, hormone receptor (HR)-positive/HER2-negative and low-proliferative breast cancer derived a benefit from neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (NET) in the CARMINA02 trial.This study was designed to correlate gene expression and mutation profiles with both response to NET and prognosis.METHODS: Gene expression profiling using RNA sequencing was performed in 86 pre-NET and post-NET tumor samples.Targeted next-generation sequencing of 91 candidate breast cancer-associated genes was performed on DNA samples from 89 patients.Molecular data were correlated with radiological response and relapse-free survival.RESULTS: The transcriptional profile of tumors to NET in responders involved immune-associated genes enriched in activated Th1 pathway, which remained unchanged in non-responders.Immune response was confirmed by analysis of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs).The percentage of TILs was significantly increased post-NET compared to pre-NET samples in responders (p = 0.0071), but not in non-responders (p = 0.0938).Gene expression revealed that lipid metabolism was the main molecular function related to prognosis, while PPARgamma is the most important upstream regulator gene.The most frequently mutated genes were PIK3CA (48.3%), CDH1 (20.2%), PTEN (15.7%), TP53 (10.1%), LAMA2 (10.1%), BRCA2 (9.0%), MAP3K1 (7.9%), ALK (6.7%), INPP4B (6.7%), NCOR1 (6.7%), and NF1 (5.6%).Cell cycle and apoptosis pathway and PIK3CA/AKT/mTOR pathway were altered significantly more frequently in non-responders than in responders (p = 0.0017 and p = 0.0094, respectively).The average number of mutations per sample was significantly higher in endocrine-resistant tumors (2.88 vs. 1.64, p = 0.03), but no difference was observed in terms of prognosis.ESR1 hotspot mutations were detected in 3.4% of treatment-naive tumors.CONCLUSIONS: The Th1-related immune system and lipid metabolism appear to play key roles in the response to endocrine therapy and prognosis in HR-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer.Deleterious somatic mutations in the cell cycle and apoptosis pathway and PIK3CA/AKT/mTOR pathway may be relevant for clinical management.TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov ( NCT00629616 ) on March 6, 2008, retrospectively registered.",0,0,0,0

27098427,"Disease progression in recurrent glioblastoma patients treated with the VEGFR inhibitor axitinib is associated with increased regulatory T cell numbers and T cell exhaustion.BACKGROUND: Recurrent glioblastoma is associated with a poor overall survival.Antiangiogenic therapy results in a high tumor response rate but has limited impact on survival.Immunotherapy has emerged as an efficient treatment modality for some cancers, and preclinical evidence indicates that anti-VEGF(R) therapy can counterbalance the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment.METHODS: We collected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of patients with recurrent glioblastoma treated in a randomized phase II clinical trial comparing the effect of axitinib with axitinib plus lomustine and analyzed the immunophenotype of PBMC, the production of cytokines and expression of inhibitory molecules by circulating T cells.RESULTS: PBMC of 18 patients were collected at baseline and at 6 weeks after initiation of study treatment.Axitinib increased the number of naive CD8(+) T cells and central memory CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells and reduced the TIM3 expression on CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells.Patients diagnosed with progressive disease on axitinib had a significantly increased number of regulatory T cells and an increased level of PD-1 expression on CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells.In addition, reduced numbers of cytokine-producing T cells were found in progressive patients as compared to patients responding to treatment.CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that axitinib treatment in patients with recurrent glioblastoma has a favorable impact on immune function.At the time of acquired resistance to axitinib, we documented further enhancement of a preexisting immunosuppression.Further investigations on the role of axitinib as potential combination partner with immunotherapy are necessary.",0,0,0,0

22855579,"Thalidomide in total therapy 2 overcomes inferior prognosis of myeloma with low expression of the glucocorticoid receptor gene NR3C1.PURPOSE: Because dexamethasone remains a key component of myeloma therapy, we wished to examine the impact of baseline and relapse expression levels of the glucocorticoid receptor gene NR3C1 on survival outcomes in the context of treatment with or without thalidomide.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We investigated the clinical impact of gene expression profiling (GEP)-derived expression levels of NR3C1 in 351 patients with GEP data available at baseline and in 130 with data available at relapse, among 668 subjects accrued to total therapy 2 (TT2).RESULTS: Low NR3C1 expression levels had a negative impact on progression-free survival (PFS; HR, 1.47; P = 0.030) and overall survival (OS; HR, 1.90; P = 0.002) in the no-thalidomide arm.Conversely, there was a significant clinical benefit of thalidomide for patients with low receptor levels (OS: HR, 0.54; P = 0.015; PFS: HR, 0.54; P = 0.004), mediated most likely by thalidomide's upregulation of NR3C1.In the context of both baseline and relapse parameters, post-relapse survival (PRS) was adversely affected by low NR3C1 levels at relapse in a multivariate analysis (HR, 2.61; P = 0.012).CONCLUSION: These findings justify the inclusion of NR3C1 expression data in the work-up of patients with myeloma as it can significantly influence the choice of therapy and, ultimately, OS.The identification of an interaction term between thalidomide and NR3C1 underscores the importance of pharmacogenomic studies in the systematic study of new drugs.",0,0,0,0
26822398,"Afatinib plus vinorelbine versus trastuzumab plus vinorelbine in patients with HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer who had progressed on one previous trastuzumab treatment (LUX-Breast 1): an open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Trastuzumab resistance is a key therapeutic challenge in metastatic breast cancer.We postulated that broader inhibition of ErbB receptors with afatinib would improve clinical outcomes compared with HER2 inhibition alone in patients who had progressed on previous trastuzumab treatment.LUX-Breast 1 compared afatinib plus vinorelbine with trastuzumab plus vinorelbine for such patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.METHODS: We did this open-label trial at 350 hospitals in 41 countries worldwide.We enrolled female patients with HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer who had progressed on or following adjuvant trastuzumab or first-line treatment of metastatic disease with trastuzumab.Participants were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive oral afatinib (40 mg/day) plus intravenous vinorelbine (25 mg/m(2) per week) or intravenous trastuzumab (2 mg/kg per week after 4 mg/kg loading dose) plus vinorelbine.Randomisation was done centrally and stratified by previous trastuzumab treatment (adjuvant vs first-line treatment), hormone receptor status (oestrogen receptor and progesterone receptor positive vs others), and region.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, assessed in the intention-to-treat population.This trial is closed to enrolment and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01125566.FINDINGS: Between Aug 26, 2010, and April 26, 2013, we enrolled 508 patients: 339 assigned to the afatinib group and 169 assigned to the trastuzumab group.Recruitment was stopped on April 26, 2013, after a benefit-risk assessment by the independent data monitoring committee was unfavourable for the afatinib group.Patients on afatinib plus vinorelbine had to switch to trastuzumab plus vinorelbine, afatinib monotherapy, vinorelbine monotherapy, or receive treatment outside of the trial.Median follow-up was 9.3 months (IQR 3.7-16.0).Median progression-free survival was 5.5 months (95% CI 5.4-5.6) in the afatinib group and 5.6 months (5.3-7.3) in the trastuzumab group (hazard ratio 1.10 95% CI 0.86-1.41; p=0.43).The most common drug-related adverse events of grade 3 or higher were neutropenia (190 [56%] of 337 patients in the afatinib group vs 102 [60%] of 169 patients in the trastuzumab group), leucopenia (64 [19%] vs 34 [20%]), and diarrhoea (60 [18%] vs none).INTERPRETATION: Trastuzumab-based therapy remains the treatment of choice for patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who had progressed on trastuzumab.FUNDING: Boehringer Ingelheim.",1,1,1,1
23928139,"Tumor consistency of pituitary macroadenomas: predictive analysis on the basis of imaging features with contrast-enhanced 3D FIESTA at 3T.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Preoperative evaluation of pituitary macroadenoma tumor consistency is important for neurosurgery.Thus, we aimed to retrospectively assess the role of contrast-enhanced FIESTA in predicting the tumor consistency of pituitary macroadenomas.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-nine patients with pituitary macroadenomas underwent conventional MR imaging sequences and contrast-enhanced FIESTA before surgery.Two neuroradiologists assessed the contrast-enhanced FIESTA, contrast-enhanced T1WI, and T2WI.On the basis of surgical findings, the macroadenomas were classified by the neurosurgeons as either soft or hard.Finally, Fisher exact probability tests and unpaired t tests were used to compare predictions on the basis of the MR imaging findings with the tumor consistency, collagen content, and postoperative tumor size.RESULTS: The 29 pituitary macroadenomas were classified as either solid or mosaic types.Solid type was characterized by a homogeneous pattern of tumor signal intensity without intratumoral hyperintense dots, whereas the mosaic type was characterized by many intratumoral hyperintense dots on each MR image.Statistical analyses revealed a significant correlation between tumor consistency and contrast-enhanced FIESTA findings.Sensitivity and specificity were higher for contrast-enhanced FIESTA (1.00 and 0.88-0.92, respectively) than for contrast-enhanced T1WI (0.80 and 0.25-0.33, respectively) and T2WI (0.60 and 0.38-0.54, respectively).Compared with mosaic-type adenomas, solid-type adenomas tended to have a hard tumor consistency as well as a significantly higher collagen content and lower postoperative tumor size.CONCLUSIONS: Contrast-enhanced FIESTA may provide preoperative information regarding the consistency of macroadenomas that appears to be related to the tumor collagen content.",0,0,0,0
24141008,"Improved survival with ursodeoxycholic acid prophylaxis in allogeneic stem cell transplantation: long-term follow-up of a randomized study.We report the long-term results of a prospective randomized study on the use of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) for prevention of hepatic complications after allogeneic stem cell transplantation.Two hundred forty-two patients, 232 with malignant disease, were randomized to receive (n = 123) or not to receive (n = 119) UDCA from the beginning of the conditioning until 90 days post-transplantation.The results were reported after 1-year follow-up.UDCA administration reduced significantly the proportion of patients developing high serum bilirubin levels as well as the incidence of severe acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), liver GVHD, and intestinal GVHD.In the UDCA prophylaxis group, nonrelapse mortality (NRM) was lower and overall survival better than in the control group.After a 10-year follow-up, the difference in the survival and NRM in favor of the UDCA-treated group, seen at 1 year, was maintained (survival 48% versus 38%, P = .037; NRM 28% versus 41%, P = .01).A landmark analysis in patients surviving at 1 year post-transplantation showed no significant differences between the study groups in the long-term follow-up in chronic GVHD, relapse rate, NRM, disease-free survival, or overall survival.These long-term results continue to support the useful role of UDCA in the prevention of transplant-related complications in allogeneic transplantation.",1,1,1,1
25287137,"Impact of a mindfulness stress management program on stress, anxiety, depression and quality of life in women with polycystic ovary syndrome: a randomized controlled trial.Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder with a significant psychological burden throughout the life course of affected women.Thus, use of mindful awareness may be beneficial as an adjunct to conventional medical management of women with PCOS.A randomized, controlled trial was conducted at the Evgenideion Hospital of the Athens University Medical School to explore the impact of an 8-week mindfulness stress management program on measures of depression, anxiety and stress as well as on the quality of life in reproductive age women with PCOS.The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee.Twenty-three and 15 women with PCOS were randomly allocated to the intervention or control group, respectively.All participants were administered DASS21, PSS-14, PCOSQ, Daily Life and General Life Satisfaction Questionnaires and provided three-timed daily samples of salivary cortisol, before and after the intervention.Intervention group participants were provided with the Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire at the day of enrolment, to check for possible placebo effect on the outcome.Post-intervention, between-group results revealed statistically significant reductions in stress, depressive and anxiety symptoms, as well as in salivary cortisol concentrations, along with an increase in Life Satisfaction and Quality of Life scores in the intervention group only.There was no significant ""placebo"" effect on the outcome measures.Mindfulness techniques seem promising in ameliorating stress, anxiety, depression and the quality of life in women with PCOS and could be used as an adjunct method to the conventional management of these women.",0,0,0,0

25662406,"Phase I trial of a cancer vaccine consisting of 20 mixed peptides in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer: dose-related immune boosting and suppression.The heterogeneity expression of tumor-associated antigens (TAA) and variability of human T cell repertoire suggest that effective cancer vaccine requires induction of a wide breadth of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) specificities.This can be achieved with vaccines targeting multiple TAA.We evaluated the safety and immune dynamics of a cancer vaccine consisting of 20 mixed peptides (KRM-20) designed to induce CTLs against 12 different TAA in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).Patients received each of three different randomly assigned doses of KRM-20 (6, 20, or 60 mg) once a week for 6 weeks.KRM-20 was applicable for patients with positive human leukocyte antigen (HLA) A2, A3, A11, A24, A26, A31 or A33 alleles, which cover the majority of the global population.To evaluate the minimum immunological effective dose (MIED), peptide-specific CTL and immunoglobulin G (IgG) responses, and immune suppressive subsets were evaluated during the vaccination.Total of 17 patients was enrolled.No serious adverse drug reactions were encountered.The MIED of KRM-20 in CTL or IgG response calculated by logistic regression model was set as 16 or 1.6 mg, respectively.The frequency of immune suppressive subsets was fewer in the 20 mg cohort than that in 6 or 60 mg cohort.Clinical responses determined by prostate-specific antigen levels were two partial responses (from the 20 mg cohort), five no changes and ten progressive diseases.Twenty milligrams of KRM-20 could be recommended for further studies because of the safety and ability to augment CTL activity.",0,0,0,0
23233657,"High cereblon expression is associated with better survival in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma treated with thalidomide maintenance.Recently, cereblon (CRBN) expression was found to be essential for the activity of thalidomide and lenalidomide.In the present study, we investigated whether the clinical efficacy of thalidomide in multiple myeloma is associated with CRBN expression in myeloma cells.Patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma were included in the HOVON-65/GMMG-HD4 trial, in which postintensification treatment in 1 arm consisted of daily thalidomide (50 mg) for 2 years.Gene-expression profiling, determined at the start of the trial, was available for 96 patients who started thalidomide maintenance.In this patient set, increase of CRBN gene expression was significantly associated with longerprogression-free survival (P = .005).In contrast, no association between CRBN expression and survival was observed in the arm with bortezomib maintenance.We conclude that CRBN expression may be associated with the clinical efficacy of thalidomide.This trial has been registered at the Nederlands Trial Register (www.trialregister.nl) as NTR213; at the European Union Drug Regulating Authorities Clinical Trials (EudraCT) as 2004-000944-26; and at the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) as 64455289.",1,1,1,1
25038874,"HER2 screening data from ToGA: targeting HER2 in gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancer.BACKGROUND: In the Trastuzumab for GAstric cancer (ToGA) study, trastuzumab plus chemotherapy improved median overall survival by 2.7 months in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive [immunohistochemistry (IHC) 3+/fluorescence in situ hybridization-positive] gastric/gastroesophageal junction cancer compared with chemotherapy alone (hazard ratio 0.74).Post hoc exploratory analyses in patients expressing higher HER2 levels (IHC 2+/fluorescence in situ hybridization-positive or IHC 3+) demonstrated a 4.2-month improvement in median overall survival with trastuzumab (hazard ratio 0.65).The ToGA study provides the largest screening dataset available on HER2 overexpression/amplification in this indication.We further analyzed correlation(s) of HER2 overexpression/amplification with clinical and epidemiological factors.METHODS: HER2-positivity was analyzed by histological subtype, tumor location, geographic region, and specimen type.Exploratory efficacy analyses were performed.RESULTS: The HER2-positivity rate was 22.1 % across analyzed tumor samples.Rates were similar between European and Asian patients (23.6 % vs. 23.9 %), but higher in intestinal- vs. diffuse-type (31.8 % vs. 6.1 %), and gastroesophageal junction cancer versus gastric tumors (32.2 % vs. 21.4 %).Across all IHC scores, variability in HER2 staining (</=30 % stained cells) was observed in almost 50 % of cases, with increasing rates in lower IHC categories, and did not affect treatment outcome.The polysomy rate was 4 %.CONCLUSIONS: HER2 expression varies by tumor location and type.All patients with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer should be tested for HER2 status, preferably using IHC initially.Due to the unique characteristics of gastric cancer, specific testing/scoring guidelines should be adhered to.",0,0,0,0

31063024,"Symptom Assessment in Patients with Advanced Cancer: Are the Most Severe Symptoms the Most Bothersome?Objective: We investigated correspondence between symptom severity and symptom bothersomeness in patients with advanced cancer.Background: Symptom severity is commonly assessed in clinical cancer settings, but bothersomeness of these symptoms is less often measured.Methods: Participants with advanced cancer enrolled in a cluster-randomized trial of early palliative care completed the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS) and the quality of life at the end of life (QUAL-E) measure as part of their baseline assessment.For each symptom, we examined the correspondence between the symptom being indicated as most severe on the ESAS and rated as most bothersome on the QUAL-E. Results: For the 386 patients who completed relevant sections of the ESAS and QUAL-E, tiredness (32.8%), sleep (23.8%), and appetite (20.2%) were most frequently rated as most severe, whereas pain (28.9%) and tiredness (24.3%) were most frequently indicated as most bothersome.The most bothersome and most severe symptom corresponded in 42%.Pain and/or tiredness were consistently among the top three most bothersome symptoms, whereas appetite was frequently rated the most severe symptom but was rarely perceived as the most bothersome.The probability that patients rating a symptom as most severe would also rate it as most bothersome was highest for pain (66%), nausea (58%), and tiredness (40%).Discussion: ESAS symptom severity does not necessarily indicate patients' most bothersome symptom; regardless of severity, pain and tiredness are most frequently perceived as most bothersome.Further research should investigate the clinical benefits of patients also indicating their three most bothersome ESAS symptoms.",0,0,0,0

25403578,"FOLFOX4 versus sequential dose-dense FOLFOX7 followed by FOLFIRI in patients with resectable metastatic colorectal cancer (MIROX): a pragmatic approach to chemotherapy timing with perioperative or postoperative chemotherapy from an open-label, randomized phase III trial.BACKGROUND: Perioperative FOLFOX4 (oxaliplatin plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin) chemotherapy is the current standard in patients with resectable metastases from colorectal cancer (CRC).We aimed to determine whether a sequential chemotherapy with dose-dense oxaliplatin (FOLFOX7) and irinotecan (FOLFIRI; irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin) is superior to FOLFOX4.The chemotherapy timing was not imposed, and was perioperative or postoperative.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this open-label, phase III trial, patients with resectable or resected metastases were randomly assigned either to 12 cycles of FOLFOX4 (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m(2)) or 6 cycles of FOLFOX7 (oxaliplatin 130 mg/m(2)) followed by 6 cycles of FOLFIRI (irinotecan 180 mg/m(2)).Randomization was done centrally, with stratification by chemotherapy timing, type of local treatment (surgery versus radiofrequency ablation with/without surgery), and Fong's prognostic score.The primary end point was 2-year disease-free survival (DFS).RESULTS: A total of 284 patients were randomized, 142 in each treatment group.Chemotherapy was perioperative in 168 (59.2%) patients and postoperative in 116 (40.8%) patients.Perioperative chemotherapy was preferentially proposed for synchronous metastases, whereas postoperative chemotherapy was more frequently used for metachronous metastases.Two-year DFS was 48.5% in the FOLFOX4 group and 50.0% in the FOLFOX7-FOLFIRI group.In the multivariable analysis, more than one metastasis [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.15] and synchronous metastases (HR = 1.63) were independent prognostic factors for shorter DFS.Five-year overall survival (OS) rate was 69.5% with FOLFOX4 versus 66.6% with FOLFOX7-FOLFIRI.CONCLUSIONS: FOLFOX7-FOLFIRI is not superior to FOLFOX4 in patients with resectable metastatic CRC.Five-year OS rates observed in both groups are the highest ever reported in this setting, possibly reflecting the pragmatic approach to chemotherapy timing.CLINICAL TRIALS NUMBER: NCT00268398.",1,1,1,1
27876220,"Breaking bad news to patients with cancer: A randomized control trial of a brief communication skills training module incorporating the stories and preferences of actual patients.OBJECTIVE: This study tested the effectiveness of a brief, learner-centered, breaking bad news (BBN) communication skills training module using objective evaluation measures.METHODS: This randomized control study (N=66) compared intervention and control groups of students (n=28) and residents' (n=38) objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) performance of communication skills using Common Ground Assessment and Breaking Bad News measures.RESULTS: Follow-up performance scores of intervention group students improved significantly regarding BBN (colon cancer (CC), p=0.007, r=-0.47; breast cancer (BC), p=0.003, r=-0.53), attention to patient responses after BBN (CC, p<0.001, r=-0.74; BC, p=0.001, r=-0.65), and addressing feelings (BC, p=0.006, r=-0.48).At CC follow-up assessment, performance scores of intervention group residents improved significantly regarding BBN (p=0.004, r=-0.43), communication related to emotions (p=0.034, r=-0.30), determining patient's readiness to proceed after BBN and communication preferences (p=0.041, r=-0.28), active listening (p=0.011, r=-0.37), addressing feelings (p<0.001, r=-0.65), and global interview performance (p=0.001, r=-0.51).CONCLUSION: This brief BBN training module is an effective method of improving BBN communication skills among medical students and residents.PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Implementation of this brief individualized training module within health education programs could lead to improved communication skills and patient care.",0,0,0,0
28456090,"Dynamic evaluation of circulating tumour cells in patients with advanced gastric and oesogastric junction adenocarcinoma: Prognostic value and early assessment of therapeutic effects.BACKGROUND: The identification of dynamic biomarkers in advanced gastric and oesogastric junction adenocarcinoma (GOA) could help to tailor strategies for each patient.Enumeration of circulating tumour cells (CTCs) is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in breast, colon and prostate cancer but is not in advanced GOA.Our study aims to establish the optimal threshold and the clinical significance of CTC count in advanced GOA before and during treatment.METHODS: One hundred six patients with untreated advanced GOA were included in the ancillary study of the PRODIGE 17-ACCORD 20 trial.CTCs were detected in the peripheral blood using the CellSearch system on day 0 (D0) and day 28 (D28).The prognostic value of CTCs at D0 and D28 was analysed by testing several thresholds.RESULTS: At baseline, median CTC count was 1 (range, 0-415).While CTCs >/=1, 2 or 3 at D0 were all significantly associated with worse overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), CTCs >/=2 were the optimal threshold, on D0 or D28.CTCs >/=2 at D28 were also predictive of disease control.Taking into account both D0 and D28 CTC count defined 3 groups (low/low, high/low and low-high/high) with significantly different PFS (p = 0.0002) and OS (p = 0.003).CONCLUSION: Quantification of CTCs at baseline and during treatment may be a useful prognostic tool in advanced GOA, as it is associated with worse PFS and OS.A threshold >/=2 CTCs seems to have the best discriminant value.Change in CTC count between baseline and D28 could help to tailor treatment to each individual patient.",0,0,0,0
28891398,"Geometric analysis of loco-regional recurrences in relation to pre-treatment hypoxia in patients with head and neck cancer.INTRODUCTION: A previous pattern-of-failure study has suggested that up to 50% of the loco-regional failures (LRF) in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) occur outside the initial hypoxic volume determined by [(18)F]-fluoromisonidazole-PET ([(18)F]-FMISO-PET).The aim of the present analysis was to correlate spatial patterns of failure with respect to the pretherapeutic dynamic [(18)F]-FMISO-PET/CT in HNSCC after radiochemotherapy (RCT).MATERIAL AND METHODS: Within a running phase 2 trial using [(18)F]-FMISO-PET imaging prior to RCT in HNSCC patients (n = 54), we have observed so far 11 LRF with a minimum follow-up of 12 months.For nine patients, LRF imaging (CT or [(18)F]-FDG-PET/CT) for pattern-of-failure analysis was available.Analysis included the static 4-h hypoxic subvolume (VH) as well as a M-parameter volume (VM), which is derived from modeling of dynamic PET.Deformable image registration of the CT scan with the recurrent tumor to the pre-treatment [(18)F]-FMISO-PET/CT and the planning CT was done to quantify the hypoxic subvolumes compared to the recurrent tumor volume.Moreover, a point-of-origin analysis was performed.RESULTS: A total of five local, two regional and two loco-regional recurrences were detected.After deformable image registration of the CT scan with the recurrent tumor to the pre-treatment [(18)F]-FMISO-PET/CT and the planning CT, a significant overlap of the recurrence volume with [(18)F]-FMISO-positive subvolumes in the initial gross tumor volume (GTV) was observed.Median overlap of 40.2%, range 9.4-100.0%, for VH and 49.0%, range 4.4-96.4%, for VM was calculated.The point-of-origin analysis showed median distances of 0.0 mm, range 0.0-11.3 mm to VH and 8.6 mm, range 0.0-15.5 mm to VM, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that loco-regional recurrences after RCT originate from the initial GTV (primary tumor and/or lymph node metastases) containing hypoxic subvolumes, which supports the concept of hypoxia imaging-based dose escalation.",0,0,0,0
24276777,"Nurse navigators in early cancer care: a randomized, controlled trial.PURPOSE: To determine whether a nurse navigator intervention improves quality of life and patient experience with care for people recently given a diagnosis of breast, colorectal, or lung cancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Adults with recently diagnosed primary breast, colorectal, or lung cancer (n = 251) received either enhanced usual care (n = 118) or nurse navigator support for 4 months (n = 133) in a two-group cluster randomized, controlled trial with primary care physicians as the units of randomization.Patient-reported measures included the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) Quality of Life scale, three subscales of the Patient Assessment of Chronic Illness Care (PACIC), and selected subscales from a cancer adaptation of the Picker Institute's patient experience survey.Self-report measures were collected at baseline, 4 months, and 12 months.Automated administrative data were used to assess time to treatment and total health care costs.RESULTS: There were no significant differences between groups in FACT-G scores.Nurse navigator patients reported significantly higher scores on the PACIC and reported significantly fewer problems with care, especially psychosocial care, care coordination, and information, as measured by the Picker instrument.Cumulative costs after diagnosis did not differ significantly between groups, but lung cancer costs were $6,852 less among nurse navigator patients.CONCLUSION: Compared with enhanced usual care, nurse navigator support for patients with cancer early in their course improves patient experience and reduces problems in care, but did not differentially affect quality of life.",0,0,0,0

The levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) at 3 days after the operation also differed significantly between the 3 groups but were lower in all the 3 groups than those at 1 day after the operation (P=0.046), and this reduction was the most obvious in group A. COX-2 expression differed significantly between the 3 groups (P=0.017), among which group A showed the most obvious suppression of COX-2 expression.During the follow-up for a mean of 45 months, no significant difference in the recurrence rate was found between the 3 groups (P=0.549).CONCLUSION: With a lower efficacy than Sou-Medrol in decreasing postoperative inflammation, celecoxib produces a better effect in inhibiting COX-2 expression, but it does not lower postoperative recurrence rate of rectal cancer.",0,0,0,0
23233657,"High cereblon expression is associated with better survival in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma treated with thalidomide maintenance.Recently, cereblon (CRBN) expression was found to be essential for the activity of thalidomide and lenalidomide.In the present study, we investigated whether the clinical efficacy of thalidomide in multiple myeloma is associated with CRBN expression in myeloma cells.Patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma were included in the HOVON-65/GMMG-HD4 trial, in which postintensification treatment in 1 arm consisted of daily thalidomide (50 mg) for 2 years.Gene-expression profiling, determined at the start of the trial, was available for 96 patients who started thalidomide maintenance.In this patient set, increase of CRBN gene expression was significantly associated with longerprogression-free survival (P = .005).In contrast, no association between CRBN expression and survival was observed in the arm with bortezomib maintenance.We conclude that CRBN expression may be associated with the clinical efficacy of thalidomide.This trial has been registered at the Nederlands Trial Register (www.trialregister.nl) as NTR213; at the European Union Drug Regulating Authorities Clinical Trials (EudraCT) as 2004-000944-26; and at the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) as 64455289.",1,1,1,1
28676071,"Effectiveness of an intervention to improve supportive care for family caregivers of patients with lung cancer: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Family caregivers (FC) often experience higher distress levels than their relative with cancer.Many cancer centers have implemented distress screening programs, but most of them concentrate their efforts on patients, with little attention to their FC.To fill this gap, a pragmatic intervention has been designed to improve supportive care for FC of patients with lung cancer.This article describes the study protocol of a single-center randomized controlled trial to assess its effectiveness.METHODS/DESIGN: A total of 120 lung cancer patients and their FC are randomly assigned to the experimental group (exposed to intervention, N = 60) or to the control group (usual care, N = 60).The intervention includes: (1) systematic FC distress screening and problem assessment near their relative's cancer diagnosis, and every 2 months, (2) privileged contact with an oncology nurse (ON) away from the patient to address FC problems and (3) liaison by the ON with the family physician of FC reporting high distress (thermometer score >/=5/10), or problems relying on FP expertise.In both groups, FC, patient and process-of-care outcomes are measured at baseline and every 3 months, up to 9 months.The primary endpoint is FC distress measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Psychological Distress Index used in the Quebec Health Survey (PDQHS).Individual interviews with 10 FC and a focus group with the oncology team will be conducted at the study end to further document the effectiveness of the intervention and its impact on quality of life (for FC) and practice organization (for the oncology team).DISCUSSION: This trial will assess the effectiveness of an innovative intervention based on interprofessional collaboration between primary care and oncology care.It targets a population in great need, yet often neglected, and has the potential to clearly improve patient and caregiver experience of cancer care, and reduce the burden of disease.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, ID: NCT02531464 .Registered on 15 July 2015.",0,0,0,0

PgR and Ki67 expression were significantly reduced with all treatments (means were -34% to -45%, and -75% to -85%, respectively; all P = 0.0001), with no differences between groups.CONCLUSIONS: In this short-term study, all treatments reduced ER expression, although F and F + A showed greater reductions than A. No significant differences were detected between the treatment groups in terms of PgR and Ki67 expression.No additional reduction in tumor biomarkers with combination treatment was observed, suggesting that F + A is unlikely to have further clinical benefit over F alone.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00259090.",1,1,1,1
29070044,"Neoadjuvant everolimus plus letrozole versus fluorouracil, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide for ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer: study protocol for a randomized pilot trial.BACKGROUND: The response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) varies by estrogen receptor (ER) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) statuses, with responses being lower in ER-positive, HER2-negative tumors as compared with ER-negative, HER2-positive or triple-negative tumors.Neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (NET) is an attractive alternative to NAC for ER-positive, HER2-negative cancer.However, a prior trial comparing NET with standard NAC in ER-positive tumor showed that the difference of response was not significant.Studies demonstrated that the mTOR inhibitor everolimus could sensitize breast tumors to endocrine therapy.A pilot open-label, randomized trial has been designed to evaluate the feasibility, efficacy and tolerability of neoadjuvant everolimus plus letrozole versus NAC in treating postmenopausal women with ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer.METHODS: Forty postmenopausal women with non-metastatic ER-positive, HER2-negative invasive breast cancer with a primary tumor > 2 cm or positive axillary lymph node(s) proved by biopsy will be randomly (1:1) enrolled from Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital to receive neoadjuvant everolimus plus letrozole for 18 weeks or fluorouracil, epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide (FEC) for six cycles before surgery.Primary outcome is the feasibility of the trial.Secondary outcome measures include ultrasound response rate, pathological complete response rate, breast-conserving surgery rate, toxicities, and changes in the percentages of peripheral blood CD4(+) T cells, CD8(+) T cells, T helper cells, regulatory T cells, and NK cells.DISCUSSION: This is the first study to determine the feasibility, efficacy and tolerability of head-to-head neoadjuvant everolimus plus letrozole versus neoadjuvant FEC in treating postmenopausal women with ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer.The trial will provide evidence to assess the feasibility of a future multicenter, randomized controlled trial, and will provide valuable clinical data of the immunoregulatory effect of everolimus in breast cancer.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov registry, ID: NCT02742051 .Registered on 7 April 2016.",1,1,1,1
27041692,"Blood graft cellular composition and posttransplant outcomes in myeloma patients mobilized with or without low-dose cyclophosphamide: a randomized comparison.BACKGROUND: Autologous stem cell transplantation is a standard treatment in multiple myeloma (MM).Blood grafts are usually collected after mobilization with granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) alone or in a combination with cyclophosphamide (CY).There is limited knowledge of the possible effects of different mobilization regimens on blood graft characteristics and posttransplant outcomes.STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Thirty-eight patients with MM were included in this study.The patients were randomly assigned at registration to mobilization with either low-dose CY plus G-CSF (Arm A) or G-CSF alone (Arm B) and received three cycles of lenalidomide, bortetzomib, and dexamethasone induction.Flow cytometry analysis of lymphocyte subsets in the blood grafts after cryopreservation was performed.Hematologic and immune recovery were evaluated up to 12 months posttransplant.RESULTS: The blood grafts in Arm A contained significantly more CD34+ cells but in Arm B there was a greater proportion of CD34+CD38- cells and higher numbers of T and B lymphocytes as well as natural killer (NK) cells.The engraftment was comparable but lymphocyte count at 15 days posttransplant was higher in Arm B (0.8 x 10(9) /L vs. 0.5 x 10(9) /L, p = 0.033).At 3 and 6 months posttransplant the total number of NK cells was also higher in G-CSF-mobilized patients.There was no difference in progression-free survival between the study arms.CONCLUSION: CY plus G-GSF yields more CD34+ cells but seems to diminish lymphocyte and NK cell counts in the grafts and hampers immune recovery after transplantation.Thus G-CSF alone might be a preferred mobilization method due to more rapid immune recovery posttransplant.",0,0,0,0

25395283,"Randomized, phase III trial of figitumumab in combination with erlotinib versus erlotinib alone in patients with nonadenocarcinoma nonsmall-cell lung cancer.BACKGROUND: Figitumumab (CP-751,871) is a fully human IgG2 monoclonal antibody that inhibits the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor.This multicenter, randomized, phase III study investigated the efficacy of figitumumab plus erlotinib compared with erlotinib alone in patients with pretreated, nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients (stage IIIB/IV or recurrent disease with nonadenocarcinoma histology) who had previously received at least one platinum-based regimen were randomized to receive open-label figitumumab (20 mg/kg) plus erlotinib 150 mg/day or erlotinib alone every 3 weeks.The primary end point was overall survival (OS).RESULTS: Of 583 patients randomized, 579 received treatment.The study was closed early by an independent data safety monitoring committee due to results crossing the prespecified futility boundary.At the final analysis, median OS was 5.7 months for figitumumab plus erlotinib and 6.2 months for erlotinib alone [hazard ratio (HR) 1.09; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91-1.31; P = 0.35].Median progression-free survival was 2.1 months for figitumumab plus erlotinib and 2.6 months for erlotinib alone (HR 1.08; 95% CI 0.90-1.29; P = 0.43).Treatment-related nonfatal serious adverse events occurred in 18% and 5% of patients in the figitumumab arm or erlotinib alone arm, respectively.There were nine treatment-related deaths (three related to both drugs, four related to erlotinib alone and two related to figitumumab).CONCLUSIONS: The addition of figitumumab to erlotinib did not improve OS in patients with advanced, pretreated, nonadenocarcinoma NSCLC.Clinical development of figitumumab has been discontinued.CLINICAL TRIAL ID: NCT00673049.",1,1,1,1
24654220,"Lack of association between genetic variability and multiple pain-related outcomes in a large cohort of patients with advanced cancer: the European Pharmacogenetic Opioid Study (EPOS).OBJECTIVE: This study examined whether the choice of pain-related outcome to represent opioid efficacy influenced findings in a genetic association study.Data from the European Pharmacogenetic Opioid Study, which used opioid dose as the outcome, were analysed in respect of six alternative outcomes: average pain intensity, pain right now, worst pain intensity, pain at its least, pain relief and pain interference.DESIGN: Cancer pain patients using an opioid for moderate or severe pain were included.The pain outcomes were obtained using the Brief Pain Inventory.Genetic variation was analysed for 112 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 25 candidate genes relevant for opioid efficacy.The patients were randomly divided into a development and a validation sample and linear regression was used to compare the equality of means in the six outcomes.The influence of non-genetic factors was controlled for, the regression analyses were stratified by country, and the results were corrected for multiple testing.RESULTS: 2201 cancer pain patients were included.Their mean age was 62.4 years and mean average pain was 3.5.None of the examined SNPs exceeded p values corrected for multiple testing for any of the outcomes.CONCLUSIONS: None of the outcomes were associated with variation in the selected SNPs, as previously shown for opioid dose.Thus, we observed that findings related to associations between genetic variability and opioid efficacy were consistent for several alternative outcomes.",0,0,0,0
26971190,"Comparison of prostate cancer detection at 3-T MRI with and without an endorectal coil: A prospective, paired-patient study.OBJECTIVES: To compare the sensitivity of 2 different non-endorectal coil strategies vs. endorectal coil (ERC) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for detection of prostate cancer (PCa).METHODS: In this prospective, single-center, paired-patient, paired-reader study, 49 men with a clinical indication for MRI underwent non-ERC (phased-array coil only) T2-weighted imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging followed by the same sequences using both ERC and phased-array coils (ERC Protocol).Patients were randomized into 1 of 2 arms: standard non-ERC protocol and augmented non-ERC protocol.Lesions with Likert score>/=3 were defined as suspicious for cancer.Radical prostatectomy specimen or combined systematic plus targeted biopsies served as the standard of reference.Cancers were stratified into risk groups according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines.Generalized estimating equations with Bonferroni correction were used for comparisons.The level of reader confidence was inferred by the Likert scores assigned to index lesions.RESULTS: The ERC protocol provided sensitivity (78%) superior to MRI without ERC for PCa detection, both with a standard (43%) (P<0.0001) or augmented (60%) (P<0.01) protocol.The ERC MRI missed less-intermediate or high-risk index lesions (4%) than standard non-ERC (42%) (P = 0.02) and augmented non-ERC MRI (25%), although the latter did not reach significance (P = 0.09).The ERC improved radiologist confidence for the detection of PCa (average Likert score = 4.2+/-1.4) compared to standard (2.3+/-2.3) and augmented (2.9+/-2.1) non-ERC (P = 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: The use of combined ERC and pelvic phased-array coil for T2-weighted imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging provides superior sensitivity for the detection of PCa compared to an examination performed without the ERC.",0,0,0,0

27430394,"Physical effects of Anma therapy (Japanese massage) for gynecologic cancer survivors: A randomized controlled trial.OBJECTIVES: Cancer survivors often have physical and psychological complaints after standard cancer treatment.We conducted a randomized control trial to evaluate the physical and psychological/emotional effects of Anma therapy (Japanese massage, AMT) in gynecologic cancer survivors.The primary objective was to verify the effects of 8 consecutive weeks of weekly AMT.The secondary objective was to confirm the immediate effects of single-session AMT.We report here results of the physical effects of AMT.METHODS: Forty participants were randomly allocated to an AMT group that received one 40-min AMT session per week for 8weeks and a no-AMT group.The primary endpoint was severity of subjective physical complaints assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS).Secondary endpoints were urine and saliva analyses and psychological/emotional questionnaire scores.RESULTS: In the primary analysis, least-squares means (LSM) estimates of VAS score improvement over the 8weeks were -21.5 (95% confidence interval [CI], -30.1 to -12.8, P=0.0017) in the AMT group (n=20) and 0.8 (95%CI, -7.7 to 9.2, P=0.89) in the no-AMT group (n=20).The difference in the LSM estimates between the groups was -22.2 (95%CI, -34.4 to -10.1, P=0.0007).There were significant differences in VAS score and urinary epinephrine between before and after the intervention session, demonstrating the superiority of AMT.CONCLUSIONS: A single AMT session reduces the severity of subjective physical complaints and might inhibit the sympathetic nervous system in gynecologic cancer survivors.Receiving weekly AMT sessions for eight weeks effectively continues to reduce the severity of subjective physical complaints.",0,0,0,0
27557302,"Daratumumab, Bortezomib, and Dexamethasone for Multiple Myeloma.BACKGROUND: Daratumumab, a human IgGkappa monoclonal antibody that targets CD38, induces direct and indirect antimyeloma activity and has shown substantial efficacy as monotherapy in heavily pretreated patients with multiple myeloma, as well as in combination with bortezomib in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.METHODS: In this phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 498 patients with relapsed or relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma to receive bortezomib (1.3 mg per square meter of body-surface area) and dexamethasone (20 mg) alone (control group) or in combination with daratumumab (16 mg per kilogram of body weight) (daratumumab group).The primary end point was progression-free survival.RESULTS: A prespecified interim analysis showed that the rate of progression-free survival was significantly higher in the daratumumab group than in the control group; the 12-month rate of progression-free survival was 60.7% in the daratumumab group versus 26.9% in the control group.After a median follow-up period of 7.4 months, the median progression-free survival was not reached in the daratumumab group and was 7.2 months in the control group (hazard ratio for progression or death with daratumumab vs. control, 0.39; 95% confidence interval, 0.28 to 0.53; P<0.001).The rate of overall response was higher in the daratumumab group than in the control group (82.9% vs. 63.2%, P<0.001), as were the rates of very good partial response or better (59.2% vs. 29.1%, P<0.001) and complete response or better (19.2% vs. 9.0%, P=0.001).Three of the most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events reported in the daratumumab group and the control group were thrombocytopenia (45.3% and 32.9%, respectively), anemia (14.4% and 16.0%, respectively), and neutropenia (12.8% and 4.2%, respectively).Infusion-related reactions that were associated with daratumumab treatment were reported in 45.3% of the patients in the daratumumab group; these reactions were mostly grade 1 or 2 (grade 3 in 8.6% of the patients), and in 98.2% of these patients, they occurred during the first infusion.CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with relapsed or relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, daratumumab in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone resulted in significantly longer progression-free survival than bortezomib and dexamethasone alone and was associated with infusion-related reactions and higher rates of thrombocytopenia and neutropenia than bortezomib and dexamethasone alone.(Funded by Janssen Research and Development; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02136134.).",1,1,1,1
23957945,"Initial biopsy Gleason score as a predictive marker for survival benefit in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with docetaxel: data from the TAX327 study.BACKGROUND: Since 2004, docetaxel has been the standard first-line systemic therapy for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).With abiraterone recently becoming available in the predocetaxel setting, it is warranted to identify subgroups of patients who may obtain the greatest benefit from docetaxel and particularly qualify for receiving docetaxel as first-line treatment for mCRPC.OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify factors that could characterize subgroups of patients who obtain the greatest benefit from the use of docetaxel.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: TAX327 was multinational, randomized, phase 3 study that was conducted from 2000 to 2002 in 1006 men with mCRPC.INTERVENTION: Patients were randomized to receive docetaxel every 3 wk (D3), weekly docetaxel (D1), or mitoxantrone every 3 wk (M3), each with prednisone.OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: We investigated whether patients with poorly differentiated tumors (Gleason score >/=7) at diagnosis had greater benefit from D3 compared with M3 than patients with better differentiated tumors (Gleason score </=6).Using a Cox model, we compared overall survival (OS) between the treatment groups within each subgroup of Gleason score.RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: The TAX 327 data showed that the OS benefit of D3 versus M3 was greater in patients with high-grade tumors (median OS: 18.9 vs 14.5 mo; p=0.009) than in patients with low-grade tumors (median OS: 21.6 vs 20.7 mo; p=0.674).Limitations of a retrospective analysis apply.CONCLUSIONS: The survival benefit obtained with docetaxel is most pronounced in patients with high-Gleason-score tumors (Gleason >/=7).In a time of shifting paradigms in mCRPC, with abiraterone becoming available prior to docetaxel chemotherapy, Gleason score may help in selecting patients who obtain the greatest benefit from docetaxel as first-line treatment for mCRPC.Prospective validation of these findings is warranted.",1,1,1,1

23261355,"Risk of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia during follow-up in HPV-positive women according to baseline p16-INK4A results: a prospective analysis of a nested substudy of the NTCC randomised controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Immunostaining for p16-INK4A (henceforth p16) is a sensitive and specific method for detection of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) in women infected with human papillomavirus (HPV), but longitudinal data have not been obtained.We investigated the relation between p16 status and risk of CIN during 3 years of follow-up.METHODS: Women aged 25-60 years were enrolled between June 10, 2003, and Dec 31, 2004, in a multicentre randomised trial comparing HPV testing with cytology.HPV-positive women were referred for colposcopy and, in seven of nine centres, were tested for p16 overexpression by immunostaining.If no CIN was detected, these women were followed up at yearly intervals until clearance of HPV infection.The primary endpoint was histologically confirmed CIN of grade 2 or worse (CIN of grade 2 [CIN2], CIN of grade 3 [CIN3], or invasive cervical cancer) at recruitment or during follow-up.We calculated the absolute and relative risks by p16 status at recruitment.We also calculated the longitudinal sensitivity of p16 testing.Additionally, we assessed the relative sensitivity of an alternative strategy (referral to colposcopy and follow-up of only HPV-positive, p16-positive women) versus conventional cytology in two age groups.Percentages were weighted by the inverse of the tested fraction.The trial in which this study is nested is registered, number ISRCTN81678807.FINDINGS: Of 1042 HPV-positive women who were tested for p16 with no CIN detected during the first round of screening, 944 (91%) had further HPV tests.793 (84%) of these 944 were followed up until detection of CIN2 or worse, HPV infection clearance, or for at least 3 years.CIN2 or worse was detected during follow-up in more p16-positive women (31 of 365, 8.8% [95% CI 5.8-11.8]) than in p16-negative women (17 of 579, 3.7% [1.9-5.4]; relative risk [RR] 2.61 [95% CI 1.49-4.59]).RR was higher in women aged 35-60 years at recruitment (3.37 [1.39-8.15]) than in those aged 25-34 years (2.15 [1.00-4.61]), but age was not a significant modifier.CIN3 or worse was detected during follow-up in more p16-positive women (16 of 365, 4.4% [2.3-6.6]) than in p16-negative women (six of 579, 1.3% [0.2-2.3]; RR 3.90 [95% CI 1.57-9.68]).Longitudinal sensitivity of p16 testing for detection of CIN3 or worse during follow-up at all ages was 77.8% (95% CI 63.9-91.6).The relative sensitivity of the alternative strategy compared with conventional cytology was 2.08 (1.13-3.56) in women aged 35-60 years and 2.86 (1.28-5.36) in those aged 25-34 years.HPV-positive, p16-negative women aged 35-60 years had a higher cumulative risk of CIN3 or worse during recruitment or follow-up (2.0%, 95% CI 0.3-3.7) than did HPV-negative women (0.01%, 0-0.04) or those who were cytologically normal (0.04%, 0.02-0.09) at recruitment.INTERPRETATION: p16 overexpression is a marker for CIN2 or worse or for development of CIN2 or worse within 3 years in HPV-positive women, especially those aged 35-60 years.HPV-positive, p16-positive women need immediate colposcopy and, if the assessment is negative, annual follow-up.Immediate colposcopy can be avoided in HPV-positive, p16-negative women, who can be safely managed with repeat screening after 2-3 year intervals.FUNDING: European Union; Italian Ministry of Health; Regional Health Administrations of Piemonte, Tuscany, Veneto and Emilia Romagna; and Public Health Agency of Lazio Region.",0,0,0,0
22526159,"A prospective multicenter study of treosulfan in elderly patients with recurrent ovarian cancer: results of a planned safety analysis.BACKGROUND: Treosulfan, an alkylating agent, has demonstrated activity in recurrent ovarian carcinoma.It is equieffective as oral (p.o.) and intravenous (i.v.) formulation.To explore the preference and compliance of elderly patients regarding p.o. or i.v. treosulfan for the treatment of relapsed ovarian carcinoma, women aged 65 years or older were included in this prospective multicenter study.Since elderly patients usually have several concomitant diseases and experience more treatment toxicity, an interim safety analysis was planned and performed after 25 patients finished therapy to assess the tolerability of the treatment regimens.METHODS: Patients had a free choice of treosulfan i.v.(7,000 mg/m(2) day 1 of a 28-day cycle) or p.o. (600 mg/m(2) day 1-28 of a 56-day cycle) for a maximum of 12 cycles (i.v.) or 12 months (p.o.).Indecisive patients were randomized.Toxicity was evaluated according to the NCI-CTC version 2.0.RESULTS: Twenty-five of 51 recruited patients completed therapy at the time of the planned interim analysis (median age, 75 years; range, 70-82).Median ECOG was 1, and median number of prior chemotherapy regimens was 2.A median number of 4 cycles (range, 1-12) were administered per patient.Anemia was the most common hematological toxicity (88 % of patients).Most frequent non-hematological toxicities were nausea (76 %), constipation (68 %), and fatigue (64 %).CONCLUSION: Treatment was generally well tolerated despite the fact that most patients suffered from multiple comorbidities and were heavily pretreated.There were no unexpected hematological or non-hematological toxicities.Based on this safety analysis, the next step of study recruitment was continued.",0,0,0,0
30482661,"Comparative Effectiveness of Bladder-preserving Tri-modality Therapy Versus Radical Cystectomy for Muscle-invasive Bladder Cancer.INTRODUCTION: There are limited randomized data comparing radical cystectomy (RC) with bladder-sparing tri-modality therapy (TMT) in the treatment of muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC).Both strategies are thought to have similar survival outcomes with different morbidity profiles.We compare the effectiveness of TMT and RC using decision-analytic modeling and the endpoint of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using a Markov model, we simulated the lifetime outcomes after TMT versus RC +/- neoadjuvant chemotherapy for 67-year-old patients with clinical stage T2-T4aN0M0 MIBC.Model probabilities and utilities were extracted from the literature.The incremental effectiveness was reported in QALYs and sensitivity analyses were performed.RESULTS: For all patients with MIBC, although the model showed identical survival, TMT was the most effective strategy with an incremental gain of 0.59 QALYs over RC (7.83 vs. 7.24 QALYs, respectively).When limiting the model to favorable, contemporary cohorts in both the TMT and RC strategies, TMT remained more effective with an incremental gain of 1.61 QALYs (9.37 vs. 7.76 QALYs, respectively).One-way sensitivity analyses demonstrated the model was sensitive to the quality of life parameters (ie, the utilities) for RC and TMT.When testing the 95% confidence interval of the RC utility parameter the model demonstrated an incremental gain with TMT from -0.54 to 4.23 QALYs.Probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that TMT was more effective than RC for 63% of model iterations.CONCLUSIONS: This modeling study found that treatment of MIBC with organ-sparing TMT in appropriately-selected patients may result in a gain of QALYs relative to RC.",0,0,0,0
31473189,"Accrual of older adults to cancer clinical trials led by the Canadian cancer trials group - Is trial design a barrier?BACKGROUND: Older adults (OA), aged 65years and over, are under-represented in studies.Strict exclusion criteria have been identified as a potential barrier to accrual of OA.This study aims to determine: 1) whether accrual of OA to trials led by the Canadian Cancer Trials Group (CCTG) has increased since 2003; 2) whether exclusion criteria have broadened over time; 3) whether exclusion criteria are associated with lower accrual of OA.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Phase III and randomized phase II CCTG-led trials initiated from 1990 onwards were included.Trial protocols were reviewed for exclusion criteria.Associations between trial characteristics and percentage of OA accrued were compared using multivariate linear regression modelling.The frequency of exclusion criteria in trials initiated pre- and post-2003 was compared using the Chi-Square test or Fisher exact test.RESULTS: Sixty-nine trials involving 34,957 patients were included.Accrual of OA to trials remained low compared to OA diagnosed with cancer in Canada (40.8% vs. 56.1%, p<.001).There was a small increase in the accrual of OA since 2003 (42.8% vs. 39.3%, p=.04).There was no relaxation of exclusion criteria over time.Studies initiated prior to 2003, breast cancer studies and studies with exclusion criteria based on renal dysfunction were associated with lower accrual of OA (p<.05).Central nervous system studies were associated with higher accrual of OA (p=.03).CONCLUSION: OA remain under-represented in trials.While there has been minimal change in exclusion criteria over time, renal dysfunction was the only exclusion criteria associated with lower accrual of OA.",0,0,0,0
27209164,"BEVERLY: Rationale and Design of a Randomized Open-Label Phase III Trial Comparing Bevacizumab Plus Erlotinib Versus Erlotinib Alone as First-Line Treatment of Patients With EGFR-Mutated Advanced Nonsquamous Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.BACKGROUND: About 20% of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases harbor somatic mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene.In these patients, the standard first-line treatments are the EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as gefitinib, erlotinib, or afatinib.Most of these patients develop resistance and relapse within about 1 year of initiation of an EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor.Consequently, it is important to develop new combination strategies to delay this resistance.Preclinical data have showed that EGFR and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) share a common downstream pathway, suggesting the important role of VEGF in the resistance to EGFR blockade.The combination of erlotinib and bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF agent, showed very interesting clinical results.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The bevacizumab plus erlotinib study (BEVERLY) is a randomized, open-label, phase III trial investigating first-line erlotinib plus bevacizumab versus erlotinib in patients with advanced NSCLC harboring activating EGFR mutations.The co-primary endpoints are investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) and blinded, independent centrally reviewed PFS.The secondary endpoints include overall survival, quality of life, objective response rate, and safety.A total of 200 patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive oral erlotinib (150 mg daily) plus bevacizumab (15 mg/kg, intravenously, on day 1 of every 21-day cycle) or erlotinib alone, until objective disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or the patient's or physician's motivated decision to stop the treatment.CONCLUSION: If the primary endpoint of PFS is met, the erlotinib plus bevacizumab combination will be confirmed as the best first-line treatment for patients with advanced NSCLC harboring activating EGFR mutations.",1,1,1,1
22890582,"Oral supplementation of branched-chain amino acids reduces early recurrence after hepatic resection in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma: a prospective study.PURPOSES: The long-term outcomes of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) administration after hepatic resection in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unclear.This study assessed the effect of oral supplementation with BCAA on the development of liver tumorigenesis after hepatic resection in HCC patients.METHODS: Fifty-six patients were randomly assigned to receive either BCAA supplementation (Livact group, n = 26) or a conventional diet (Control group, n = 30).Twenty-six patients in the BCAA group were treated orally for 2 weeks before and 6 months after hepatic resection.Postoperative tumor recurrence was continuously evaluated in all patients by measuring various clinical parameters.RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the overall survival rate between the two patient groups; however, the recurrence rate at 30 months after surgery was significantly better in the Livact group in comparison to the Control group.Interestingly, the tumor markers, such as AFP and PIVKA-II, significantly decreased at 36 months after liver resection in the Livact group in comparison to the Control group.CONCLUSIONS: Oral supplementation of BCAA reduces early recurrence after hepatic resection in patients with HCC.This treatment regimen offers potential benefits for clinical use in such patients, even in cases with a well-preserved preoperative liver function.",1,1,1,1
22075171,"Overall efficacy of HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine against grade 3 or greater cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: 4-year end-of-study analysis of the randomised, double-blind PATRICIA trial.BACKGROUND: Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or greater (CIN2+) is the surrogate endpoint used in licensure trials of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines.Vaccine efficacy against CIN3+, the immediate precursor to invasive cervical cancer, is more difficult to measure because of its lower incidence, but provides the most stringent evidence of potential cancer prevention.We report vaccine efficacy against CIN3+ and adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) in the end-of-study analysis of PATRICIA (PApilloma TRIal against Cancer In young Adults).METHODS: Healthy women aged 15-25 years with no more than six lifetime sexual partners were included in PATRICIA, irrespective of their baseline HPV DNA status, HPV-16 or HPV-18 serostatus, or cytology.Women were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive an HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine or a control hepatitis A vaccine via an internet-based central randomisation system using a minimisation algorithm to account for age ranges and study sites.The patients and study investigators were masked to allocated vaccine.The primary endpoint of PATRICIA has been reported previously.In the present end-of-study analysis, we focus on CIN3+ and AIS in the populations of most clinical interest, the total vaccinated cohort (TVC) and the TVC-naive.The TVC comprised all women who received at least one vaccine dose, approximating catch-up populations and including sexually active women (vaccine n=9319; control=9325).The TVC-naive comprised women with no evidence of oncogenic HPV infection at baseline, approximating early adolescent HPV exposure (vaccine n=5824; control=5820).This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00122681.FINDINGS: Vaccine efficacy against CIN3+ associated with HPV-16/18 was 100% (95% CI 85.5-100) in the TVC-naive and 45.7% (22.9-62.2) in the TVC.Vaccine efficacy against all CIN3+ (irrespective of HPV type in the lesion and including lesions with no HPV DNA detected) was 93.2% (78.9-98.7) in the TVC-naive and 45.6% (28.8-58.7) in the TVC.In the TVC-naive, vaccine efficacy against all CIN3+ was higher than 90% in all age groups.In the TVC, vaccine efficacy against all CIN3+ and CIN3+ associated with HPV-16/18 was highest in the 15-17 year age group and progressively decreased in the 18-20 year and 21-25 year age groups.Vaccine efficacy against all AIS was 100% (31.0-100) and 76.9% (16.0-95.8) in the TVC-naive and TVC, respectively.Serious adverse events occurred in 835 (9.0%) and 829 (8.9%) women in the vaccine and control groups, respectively; only ten events (0.1%) and five events (0.1%), respectively, were considered to be related to vaccination.INTERPRETATION: PATRICIA end-of-study results show excellent vaccine efficacy against CIN3+ and AIS irrespective of HPV DNA in the lesion.Population-based vaccination that incorporates the HPV-16/18 vaccine and high coverage of early adolescents might have the potential to substantially reduce the incidence of cervical cancer.FUNDING: GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals.",0,0,0,0
30807234,"Cyclin E1 Expression and Palbociclib Efficacy in Previously Treated Hormone Receptor-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer.PURPOSE: A large-panel gene expression analysis was conducted to identify biomarkers associated with the effectiveness of adding palbociclib to fulvestrant.METHODS: The PALOMA-3 ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01942135) trial randomly assigned 521 endocrine-pretreated patients with metastatic breast cancer to receive palbociclib plus fulvestrant or placebo plus fulvestrant.Primary analysis was first conducted on 10 genes on the basis of pathway biology and evidence from previous studies followed by a systematic panel-wide search among 2,534 cancer-related genes.The association of gene expression with the effect of palbociclib on progression-free survival (PFS) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, with gene expression as a continuous variable or dichotomized by median.An independent breast cancer cohort from the Preoperative Palbociclib (POP) Clinical Trial ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02008734) was used for validation, in 61 patients with primary breast cancer treated with 2 weeks of palbociclib.RESULTS: In the PALOMA-3 trial, 302 patients had tumor tissue analyzed (palbociclib arm, 194 patients; placebo arm, 108 patients).Palbociclib efficacy was lower in patients with high versus low cyclin E1 (CCNE1) mRNA expression (median PFS: palbociclib arm, 7.6 v 14.1 months; placebo arm, 4.0 v 4.8 months, respectively; interaction P unadjusted = .00238; false discovery rate-adjusted P = .0238).CCNE1 mRNA was more predictive in metastatic than in archival primary biopsy tissue samples.No significant interaction was found between treatment and expression levels of CDK4, CDK6, cyclin D1, and RB1.Palbociclib was efficacious in both luminal A and luminal B tumors.High CCNE1 mRNA expression was associated with poor antiproliferative activity of palbociclib in the POP trial (P = .005).CONCLUSION: Addition of palbociclib to fulvestrant demonstrated efficacy in all biomarker groups, although high CCNE1 mRNA expression was associated with relative resistance to palbociclib.",1,1,1,1

23053638,"A randomized phase II trial of platinum salts in basal-like breast cancer patients in the neoadjuvant setting. Results from the GEICAM/2006-03, multicenter study.Chemotherapy remains as the only systemic treatment option available for basal-like breast cancer (BC) patients.Preclinical models and several phase II studies suggested that platinum salts are active drugs in this BC subtype though there is no randomized study supporting this hypothesis.This study investigates if the addition of carboplatin to a combination of an alkylating agent together with anthracyclines and taxanes is able to increase the efficacy in the neoadjuvant treatment context.Patients with operable breast cancer and immunophenotypically defined basal-like disease (ER-/PR-/HER2- and cytokeratin 5/6+ or EGFR+) were recruited.Patients were randomized to receive EC (epirubicin 90 mg/m(2) plus cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2) for 4 cycles) followed either by D (docetaxel 100 mg/m(2) x 4 cycles; EC-D) or DCb (docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) plus carboplatin AUC 6 x 4 cycles; EC-DCb).The primary end point was pathological complete response (pCR) in the breast following the Miller and Payne criteria.Ninety-four patients were randomized (46 EC-D, 48 EC-DCb).pCR rate in the breast was seen in 16 patients (35 %) with EC-D and 14 patients (30 %) with EC-DCb (P value = 0.61).pCR in the breast and axilla was seen in 30 % of patients in both arms.The overall clinical response rate was 70 % (95 % CI 56-83) in the EC-D arm and 77 % (95 % CI 65-87) in the EC-DCb arm.Grade 3/4 toxicity was similar in both arms.The addition of carboplatin to conventional chemotherapy with EC-D in basal-like breast cancer patients did not improve the efficacy probably because they had already received an alkylating agent.These findings should be taken into consideration when developing new agents for this disease.",1,1,1,1
30150014,"Erlotinib versus vinorelbine plus cisplatin as adjuvant therapy in Chinese patients with stage IIIA EGFR mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (EVAN): a randomised, open-label, phase 2 trial.BACKGROUND: Adjuvant chemotherapy after radical resection of stage IIIA non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has quite poor outcomes.We aimed to investigate whether adjuvant erlotinib therapy improves 2-year disease-free survival compared with chemotherapy in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation-positive stage IIIA NSCLC.METHODS: In this randomised, open-label, phase 2 trial, eligible patients aged 18-75 years who had undergone complete (R0) resection of histologically or pathologically confirmed stage IIIA EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC and had not received any previous anticancer therapies were enrolled.Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either adjuvant erlotinib (150 mg once daily administered orally) or vinorelbine and cisplatin chemotherapy (four cycles of vinorelbine [25 mg/m(2) intravenously on days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle] plus cisplatin [75 mg/m(2) intravenously on day 1 of each 21-day cycle]).Randomisation was done by Simon's minimisation with a random element and was stratified by EGFR activating mutation type (exon 19 vs 21), histology (adenocarcinoma vs non-adenocarcinoma), and smoking status (smoker vs non-smoker).The primary endpoint in the unblinded intention-to-treat analysis was 2-year disease-free survival.This ongoing study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01683175.FINDINGS: Between Sept 8, 2012, and May 21, 2015, 102 patients from 16 centres across China were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive erlotinib (n=51) or chemotherapy (n=51).Median follow-up was 33.0 months (IQR 17.8-43.1).2-year disease-free survival was 81.4% (95% CI 69.6-93.1) in the erlotinib group and 44.6% (26.9-62.4) in the chemotherapy group (relative risk 1.823 [95% CI 1.194-2.784; p=0.0054).The difference in 2-year disease-free survival between the groups was 36.7% (95% CI 15.5-58.0; p=0.0007).Adverse events of any grade occurred in 29 (58%) of 50 patients in the erlotinib group and 28 (65%) of 43 patients in the chemotherapy group.Grade 3 or worse adverse events occurred in six (12%) of 50 patients in the erlotinib group versus 11 (26%) of 43 in the chemotherapy group; the most common of these in the erlotinib group was rash (in two [4%] of 50 patients) and in the chemotherapy group were decreased neutrophil count (in seven [16%] of 43 patients) and myelosuppression (in four [9%]).No treatment-related deaths were reported.INTERPRETATION: Adjuvant erlotinib improved 2-year disease-free survival in patients with EGFR mutation-positive stage IIIA NSCLC compared with chemotherapy, with a better tolerability profile.This study suggests that tyrosine kinase inhibitors could have a potentially important role as adjuvant therapy in EGFR mutation-positive stage IIIA NSCLC.However, this trial was a phase 2 study.Mature overall survival data are also needed.Ongoing studies will hopefully confirm the role of adjuvant EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy in patients with NSCLC.FUNDING: National Key Research and Development Program of China and Shanghai Roche Pharmaceuticals Ltd.",1,1,1,1
29327085,"Acceptance and commitment therapy for symptom interference in metastatic breast cancer patients: a pilot randomized trial.PURPOSE: Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality in women worldwide.With medical advances, metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients often live for years with many symptoms that interfere with activities.However, there is a paucity of efficacious interventions to address symptom-related suffering and functional interference.Thus, this study examined the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of telephone-based acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) for symptom interference with functioning in MBC patients.METHODS: Symptomatic MBC patients (N = 47) were randomly assigned to six telephone sessions of ACT or six telephone sessions of education/support.Patients completed measures of symptom interference and measures assessing the severity of pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance, depressive symptoms, and anxiety.RESULTS: The eligibility screening rate (64%) and high retention (83% at 8 weeks post-baseline) demonstrated feasibility.When examining within-group change, ACT participants showed decreases in symptom interference (i.e., fatigue interference and sleep-related impairment; Cohen's d range = - 0.23 to - 0.31) at 8 and 12 weeks post-baseline, whereas education/support participants showed minimal change in these outcomes (d range = - 0.03 to 0.07).Additionally, at 12 weeks post-baseline, ACT participants showed moderate decreases in fatigue and sleep disturbance (both ds = - 0.43), whereas education/support participants showed small decreases in these outcomes (ds = - 0.24 and - 0.18 for fatigue and sleep disturbance, respectively).Both the ACT and education/support groups showed reductions in depressive symptoms (ds = - 0.27 and - 0.28) at 12 weeks post-baseline.Group differences in all outcomes were not statistically significant.CONCLUSIONS: ACT shows feasibility and promise in improving fatigue and sleep-related outcomes in MBC patients and warrants further investigation.",0,0,0,0
23415048,"A prospective trial of real-time magnetic resonance-guided catheter placement in interstitial gynecologic brachytherapy.PURPOSE: To present outcome and toxicity results of the first real-time intraoperative MRI-guided interstitial approach to gynecologic cancer.METHODS AND MATERIALS: From February 2004 to December 2006, 25 patients with gynecologic malignancies were enrolled and treated in a prospective clinical trial of real-time MRI-guided interstitial brachytherapy.This was followed by a confirmatory CT imaging scan.Statistical analyses included Kaplan-Meier estimates for overall and relapse-free survival.RESULTS: MRI visualization of needles during placement permitted accurate placement with no inadvertent insertions.This prevented unnecessary normal-tissue perforation as confirmed by CT simulation.With a mean followup of 3.8 years (range, 2-6.8), 1-, 2-, and 3-year overall survival rates were 80%, 60% and 43%, respectively; corresponding relapse-free survival rates were 79%, 65%, and 59%, respectively.Actuarial acute toxicity rates for any grade were 0% at 0-14 days and 80% (all grade 1) at 14-90 days.Long-term (>180 days) actuarial toxicity rates were 8% gastrointestinal, 4% bladder and 4% vaginal.CONCLUSIONS: Real-time MRI guidance during insertion of interstitial needles followed by 3D-planning maximized opportunities for tumor targeting and sparing of normal tissues.Although image guidance requires additional anesthesia time, clinical outcomes indicate potential for a successful reduction in toxicity using 3D image-guided in addition to 3D image-planned brachytherapy.",0,0,0,0
25130401,"A randomized, open-label, multicentre, phase 2/3 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lumiliximab in combination with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab versus fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab alone in subjects with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.Lumiliximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody that targets CD23 on the surface of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) B-cells.Early phase clinical studies with lumiliximab alone and in combination with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab (FCR) established its potential efficacy and tolerability.The 152CL201 trial [Lumiliximab with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab (FCR) versus FCR alone in subjects with relapsed CLL; LUCID] was a phase 2/3, randomized (1:1), open-label, multicentre study of lumiliximab in combination with FCR versus FCR alone in patients with relapsed CLL.Six hundred and twenty-seven patients were randomized to either arm.Overall the combination of lumiliximab with FCR was not significantly better than FCR alone (overall response rate 71% vs. 72%, complete response rate 16% vs. 15%, median progression-free survival 24.6 vs. 23.9 months respectively, for FCR with and without lumiliximab).There was a slightly increased incidence of adverse events with lumiliximab but these increases did not appear to lead to differences in eventual outcomes.An interim analysis failed to show sufficient efficacy of the combination of lumiliximab with FCR.The study was therefore stopped early for lack of efficacy.Despite the eventual outcome, the LUCID trial is one of the largest studies that provides valuable insight into the efficacy and tolerability of FCR as a therapeutic option for patients with relapsed CLL.",1,1,1,1
29567321,"Effect of early fasting and total parenteral nutrition support on the healing of incision and nutritional status in patients after sacrectomy.INTRODUCTION: Surgical site infection is one of the most common complications for patients after sacrectomy, which often accompanied by poor wound healing, sinus formation and serious metabolic disturbance.HYPOTHESIS: We tried to avoid the surgical site infection caused by feces during early period after surgery through early fasting and total parenteral nutrition (TPN) support, then compared the clinical results of these patients with other patients that received enteral nutrition (EN) early after sacrectomy.METHODS: Forty-eight patients after sacrectomy (the level of sacrectomy above S2) were randomly divided into two groups: TPN group and EN group.The patients of two groups received different nutrition support from the first day to the seventh day after surgery, then the factors such as nutritional and metabolic status after surgery, incidence of complications as well as the time of incision healing and hospitalization were observed.RESULTS: The p-value of total serum protein, albumin, serum alanine aminotransferase, total bilirubin at seventh day after sacrectomy between TPN group and EN group is <0.0005.The p-value of hemoglobin at seventh day after sacrectomy between TPN group and EN group is 0.001.The p-value of total serum protein at fourteenth day after sacrectomy between TPN group and EN group is 0.003.The p-value of albumin and total bilirubin at fourteenth day after sacrectomy between TPN group and EN group is 0.001.The p-value of hemoglobin, serum alanine aminotransferase at fourteenth day after sacrectomy between TPN group and EN group is <0.0005.The incidence of gastrointestinal complication and delay of apparition of feces in EN group were lower than that in TPN group (p=0.041, p<0.0005).The incidence of surgical site infection, the time of incision healing and hospitalization in TPN group were lower than that in EN group (p=0.048, p=0.008, p<0.0005).CONCLUSIONS: The method of fasting and supported by TPN during the early period after sacrectomy contribute to the incision healing, meanwhile, it shortens the hospitalization time and abates the incidence of complications in patients after sacrectomy.TYPE OF STUDY: It is a comparative randomized study.LEVEL OF PROOF: High-powered prospective randomized trial.",0,0,0,0

29234923,"Non-inferiority multicenter prospective randomized controlled study of rectal cancer T2-T3s (superficial) N0, M0 undergoing neoadjuvant treatment and local excision (TEM) vs total mesorectal excision (TME).PURPOSE: The standard treatment of rectal adenocarcinoma is total mesorectal excision (TME), in many cases requires a temporary or permanent stoma.TME is associated with high morbidity and genitourinary alterations.Transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) allows access to tumors up to 20 cm from the anal verge, achieves minimal postoperative morbidity and mortality rates, and does not require an ostomy.The treatment of T2, N0, and M0 cancers remains controversial.Preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in association with TEM reduces local recurrence and increases survival.The TAU-TEM study aims to demonstrate the non-inferiority of the oncological outcomes and the improvement in morbidity and quality of life achieved with TEM compared with TME.METHODS: Prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled non-inferiority trial includes patients with rectal adenocarcinoma less than 10 cm from the anal verge and up to 4 cm in size, staged as T2 or T3-superficial N0-M0.Patients will be randomized to two areas: CRT plus TEM or radical surgery (TME).Postoperative morbidity and mortality will be recorded and patients will complete the quality of life questionnaires before the start of treatment, after CRT in the CRT/TEM arm, and 6 months after surgery in both arms.The estimated sample size for the study is 173 patients.Patients will attend follow-up controls for local and systemic relapse.CONCLUSIONS: This study aims to demonstrate the preservation of the rectum after preoperative CRT and TEM in rectal cancer stages T2-3s, N0, M0 and to determine the ability of this strategy to avoid the need for radical surgery (TME).TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01308190.Numero de registro del Comite de Etica e Investigacion Clinica (CEIC) del Hospital universitario Parc Tauli: TAU-TEM-2009-01.",0,0,0,0
22071311,"Cognitive performance after postoperative pituitary radiotherapy: a dosimetric study of the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex.OBJECTIVE: The hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC) are important for memory and executive functioning and are known to be sensitive to radiotherapy (RT).Radiation dosimetry relates radiation exposure to specific brain areas.The effects of various pituitary RT techniques were studied by relating detailed dosimetry of the hippocampus and PFC to cognitive performance.METHODS: In this cross-sectional design, 75 non-functioning pituitary macroadenoma (NFA) patients (61+/-10 years) participated and were divided into irradiated (RT+, n=30) and non-irradiated (RT-, n=45) groups.The RT+ group (who all received 25 fractions of 1.8 Gy; total dose: 45 Gy) consisted of three RT technique groups: three-field technique, n=10; four-field technique, n=15; and five-field technique, n=5.Memory and executive functioning were assessed by standardized neuropsychological tests.A reconstruction of the dose distributions for the three RT techniques was made.The RT doses on 30, 50, and 70% of the volume of the left and right hippocampus and PFC were calculated.RESULTS: Cognitive test performance was not different between the four groups, despite differences in radiation doses applied to the hippocampi and PFC.Age at RT, time since RT, and the use of thyroid hormone varied significantly between the groups; however, they were not related to cognitive performance.CONCLUSION: This study showed that there were no significant differences on cognitive performance between the three-, four-, and five-field RT groups and the non-irradiated patient group.A dose-response relationship could not be established, even with a radiation dose that was higher on most of the volume of the hippocampus and PFC in case of a four-field RT technique compared with the three- and five-field RT techniques.",0,0,0,0

26822397,"Gastrectomy plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone for advanced gastric cancer with a single non-curable factor (REGATTA): a phase 3, randomised controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy is the standard of care for incurable advanced gastric cancer.Whether the addition of gastrectomy to chemotherapy improves survival for patients with advanced gastric cancer with a single non-curable factor remains controversial.We aimed to investigate the superiority of gastrectomy followed by chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone with respect to overall survival in these patients.METHODS: We did an open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial at 44 centres or hospitals in Japan, South Korea, and Singapore.Patients aged 20-75 years with advanced gastric cancer with a single non-curable factor confined to either the liver (H1), peritoneum (P1), or para-aortic lymph nodes (16a1/b2) were randomly assigned (1:1) in each country to chemotherapy alone or gastrectomy followed by chemotherapy by a minimisation method with biased-coin assignment to balance the groups according to institution, clinical nodal status, and non-curable factor.Patients, treating physicians, and individuals who assessed outcomes and analysed data were not masked to treatment assignment.Chemotherapy consisted of oral S-1 80 mg/m(2) per day on days 1-21 and cisplatin 60 mg/m(2) on day 8 of every 5-week cycle.Gastrectomy was restricted to D1 lymphadenectomy without any resection of metastatic lesions.The primary endpoint was overall survival, analysed by intention to treat.This study is registered with UMIN-CTR, number UMIN000001012.FINDINGS: Between Feb 4, 2008, and Sept 17, 2013, 175 patients were randomly assigned to chemotherapy alone (86 patients) or gastrectomy followed by chemotherapy (89 patients).After the first interim analysis on Sept 14, 2013, the predictive probability of overall survival being significantly higher in the gastrectomy plus chemotherapy group than in the chemotherapy alone group at the final analysis was only 13.2%, so the study was closed on the basis of futility.Overall survival at 2 years for all randomly assigned patients was 31.7% (95% CI 21.7-42.2) for patients assigned to chemotherapy alone compared with 25.1% (16.2-34.9) for those assigned to gastrectomy plus chemotherapy.Median overall survival was 16.6 months (95% CI 13.7-19.8) for patients assigned to chemotherapy alone and 14.3 months (11.8-16.3) for those assigned to gastrectomy plus chemotherapy (hazard ratio 1.09, 95% CI 0.78-1.52; one-sided p=0.70).The incidence of the following grade 3 or 4 chemotherapy-associated adverse events was higher in patients assigned to gastrectomy plus chemotherapy than in those assigned to chemotherapy alone: leucopenia (14 patients [18%] vs two [3%]), anorexia (22 [29%] vs nine [12%]), nausea (11 [15%] vs four [5%]), and hyponatraemia (seven [9%] vs four [5%]).One treatment-related death occurred in a patient assigned to chemotherapy alone (sudden cardiopulmonary arrest of unknown cause during the second cycle of chemotherapy) and one occurred in a patient assigned to chemotherapy plus gastrectomy (rapid growth of peritoneal metastasis after discharge 12 days after surgery).INTERPRETATION: Since gastrectomy followed by chemotherapy did not show any survival benefit compared with chemotherapy alone in advanced gastric cancer with a single non-curable factor, gastrectomy cannot be justified for treatment of patients with these tumours.FUNDING: The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan and the Korean Gastric Cancer Association.",0,0,0,0
25641199,"Efficacy and tolerability of intranasal fentanyl spray in cancer patients with breakthrough pain.PURPOSE: The aims of this study were to explore the efficacy of intranasal fentanyl spray* (INFS) 400 mug to evaluate 12-week tolerability of the nasal mucosa and to explore safety data for all dose strengths of INFS in patients with cancer-related breakthrough pain (BTP).METHODS: Patients received a test dose of INFS 50 mug, followed by a titration phase.Those patients with doses titrated to 200 or 400 mug entered a randomized, double-blind, cross-over efficacy phase, in which 8 episodes of BTP were randomly treated with INFS 400 mug (6 episodes) and placebo (2 episodes), followed by a tolerability phase.Patients with doses titrated to 50 or 100 mug entered the tolerability phase directly.Primary outcome was measured by pain intensity difference at 10 minutes, analyzed using ANCOVA, and presented as least square mean difference.Examination of the nasal cavity was conducted at inclusion and after 12 weeks of treatment by an otorhinolaryngologist.FINDINGS: Forty-six patients were included.Thirty-eight patients' doses were titrated to an effective dose of INFS; 50 mug (n = 8), 100 mug (n = 9), 200 mug (n = 9), and 400 mug (n = 12); 15 patients entered the efficacy phase and 31 entered the tolerability phase.In the efficacy phase, 88 and 29 episodes of BTP were treated with INFS 400 mug and placebo, respectively.Pain intensity difference at 10 minutes least square mean for INFS 400 mug was 2.5 (95% CI, 1.42-3.49) (P < 0.001) and least square mean difference between INFS 400 mug and placebo was 1.1 (95% CI, 0.41-1.79) (P = 0.002).Runny nose (10%) and change in color of the mucosa (9%) were the most frequent findings of nasal examination, and nausea and dizziness were the most frequent treatment-related adverse events.One serious adverse event (ie, respiratory depression) was considered related to INFS.IMPLICATIONS: INFS 400 mug is effective and nasal tolerability and overall safety profile is acceptable during 12 weeks of use.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01429051.",0,0,0,0
22511495,"High-dose imatinib induction followed by standard-dose maintenance in pre-treated chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia patients--final analysis of a randomized, multicenter, phase III trial.BACKGROUND: Previous data suggest that the response of chronic myeloid leukemia cells to imatinib is dose-dependent.The potential benefit of initial dose intensification of imatinib in pre-treated patients with chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia remains unknown.DESIGN AND METHODS: Two hundred and twenty-seven pre-treated patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase were randomly assigned to continuous treatment with a standard dose of imatinib (400 mg/day; n=113) or to 6 months of high-dose induction with imatinib (800 mg/day) followed by a standard dose of imatinib as maintenance therapy (n=114).RESULTS: The rates of major and complete cytogenetic responses were significantly higher in the high-dose arm than in the standard-dose arm at both 3 and 6 months (major cytogenetic responses: 36.8% versus 21.2%, P=0.01 and 50.0% versus 34.5%, P=0.018; complete cytogenetic responses: 22.8% versus 6.2%, P<0.001 and 40.4% versus 16.8%, P<0.001) on the basis of an intention-to-treat analysis.At 12 months, the difference between treatment arms remained statistically significant for complete cytogenetic responses (40.4% versus 24.8%, P=0.012) but not for major cytogenetic responses (49.1% versus 44.2%, P=0.462).The rate of major molecular responses was also significantly better at 3 and 6 months in the high-dose arm (month 3: 14.9% versus 3.5%, P=0.003; month 6: 32.5% versus 8.8%, P<0.001).Overall and progression-free survival rates were comparable between arms, but event-free survival was significantly worse in the high-dose arm (P=0.014).CONCLUSIONS: Standard-dose imatinib remains the standard of care for pre-treated patients with chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT00327262).",1,1,1,1
30975219,"Re-endothelialisation after Synergy stent and Absorb bioresorbable vascular scaffold implantation in acute myocardial infarction: COVER-AMI study.BACKGROUND/AIMS: Drug eluting stent (DES) decrease the risk of restenosis by reducing the neointimal response.However, DES may impair strut coverage, and this has been associated with late stent/scaffold thrombosis.Bioresorbable vascular scaffold (BVS) may overcome the risk of stent/scaffold thrombosis when completely resorbed.The purpose of this randomised trial was to compare the arterial healing response in the short term, as a surrogate for safety and efficacy, between the metallic everolimus-eluting stent (Synergy; Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA, USA) and the everolimus BVS (Absorb; Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, CA, USA) in the particular setting of acute myocardial infarction (AMI).This pilot study sought to compare the neointimal response of metallic everolimus DES (Synergy) with polymeric everolimus BVS (Absorb) by optical coherence tomography (OCT) 3 months after an AMI.METHODS: COVER-AMI was a single-centre, single-blind, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial.Patients with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) who underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention were randomly allocated (1:1) to treatment with the Synergy DES or Absorb BVS.The primary endpoint was the 3-month neointimal response assessed as the percentage of uncovered struts, neointimal thickness, in-stent/scaffold area obstruction, and pattern of neointima.The main secondary endpoint included the device-oriented composite endpoint according to the Academic Research Consortium definition.RESULTS: Twenty patients without clinical and/or angiographic complications (Synergy (n = 10) or BVS (n = 10); mean age 59.0 years; 20% female) were enrolled in our centre.The stent diameter was higher in the Synergy group (3.7 +/- 0.4 mm vs 3.4 +/- 0.4 mm in the BVS group, p = 0.01).At 3 months, no significant differences in angiographic lumen loss were observed between the everolimus DES and everolimus BVS (0.04 mm (IQR 0.00-0.07) vs 0.11 mm (IQR 0.04-0.31), p = 0.165).OCT analysis of 420 cross-sections showed that the total neointimal area and in-stent obstruction were lower in the Synergy group, while OCT analysis at the strut level (n = 3942 struts) showed that the rate of uncovered struts was lower in the BVS group.CONCLUSIONS: Stenting of culprit lesions in the setting of STEMI resulted in a nearly complete arterial healing for both the Synergy and the BVS devices.Lower neointimal thickness and in-stent obstruction but a higher rate of uncovered struts were observed in the Synergy group.These findings provide the basis for further exploration in clinically oriented outcome trials.",0,0,0,0
28111430,"Incorporating Erlotinib or Irinotecan Plus Cisplatin into Chemoradiotherapy for Stage III Non-small Cell Lung Cancer According to EGFR Mutation Status.PURPOSE: Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) is the standard care for stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients; however, a more effective regimen is needed to improve the outcome by better controlling occult metastases.We conducted two parallel randomized phase II studies to incorporate erlotinib or irinotecan-cisplatin (IP) into CCRT for stage III NSCLC depending on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation status.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with EGFR-mutant tumors were randomized to receive three cycles of erlotinib first and then either CCRT with erlotinib followed by erlotinib (arm A) or CCRT with IP only (arm B).Patients with EGFR unknown or wild-type tumors were randomized to receive either three cycles of IP before (arm C) or after CCRT with IP (arm D).RESULTS: Seventy-three patients were screened and the study was closed early because of slow accrual after 59 patients were randomized.Overall, there were seven patients in arm A, five in arm B, 22 in arm C, and 25 in arm D. The response rate was 71.4% and 80.0% for arm A and B, and 70.0% and 73.9% for arm C and D. The median overall survival (OS) was 39.3 months versus 31.2 months for arm A and B (p=0.442), and 16.3 months versus 25.3 months for arm C and D (p=0.050).Patients with sensitive EGFR mutations had significantly longer OS than EGFR-wild patients (74.8 months vs. 25.3 months, p=0.034).There were no unexpected toxicities.CONCLUSION: Combined-modality treatment by molecular diagnostics is feasible in stage III NSCLC.EGFR-mutant patients appear to be a distinct subset with longer survival.",1,1,1,1
28707168,"Acupuncture for cancer-related fatigue in lung cancer patients: a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled pilot trial.BACKGROUND: Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is a distressing symptom that is the most common unpleasant side effect experienced by lung cancer patients and is challenging for clinical care workers to manage.METHODS: We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot trial to evaluate the clinical effect of acupuncture on CRF in lung cancer patients.Twenty-eight patients presenting with CRF were randomly assigned to active acupuncture or placebo acupuncture groups to receive acupoint stimulation (LI-4, Ren-6, St-36, KI-3, and Sp-6) twice per week for 4 weeks, followed by 2 weeks of follow-up.The primary outcome was the change in intensity of CFR based on the Chinese version of the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI-C).As the secondary endpoint, the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lung Cancer Subscale (FACT-LCS) was adopted to assess the influence of acupuncture on patients' quality of life (QOL).Adverse events and safety of treatments were monitored throughout the trial.RESULTS: Our pilot study demonstrated feasibility among patients with appropriate inclusion criteria and good compliance with acupuncture treatment.A significant reduction in the BFI-C score was observed at 2 weeks in the 14 participants who received active acupuncture compared with those receiving the placebo (P < 0.01).At week 6, symptoms further improved according to the BFI-C (P < 0.001) and the FACT-LCS (P = 0.002).There were no significant differences in the incidence of adverse events in either group (P > 0.05).CONCLUSION: Fatigue is a common symptom experienced by lung cancer patients.Acupuncture may be a safe and feasible optional method for adjunctive treatment in cancer palliative care, and appropriately powered trials are warranted to evaluate the effects of acupuncture.",1,1,0,0
27573561,"Subgroup analysis in RAISE: a randomized, double-blind phase III study of irinotecan, folinic acid, and 5-fluorouracil (FOLFIRI) plus ramucirumab or placebo in patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma progression.BACKGROUND: The RAISE phase III clinical trial demonstrated that ramucirumab + FOLFIRI improved overall survival (OS) [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.844, P = 0.0219] and progression-free survival (PFS) (HR = 0.793, P < 0.0005) compared with placebo + FOLFIRI for second-line metastatic colorectal carcinoma (mCRC) patients previously treated with first-line bevacizumab, oxaliplatin, and a fluoropyrimidine.Since some patient or disease characteristics could be associated with differential efficacy or safety, prespecified subgroup analyses were undertaken.This report focuses on three of the most relevant ones: KRAS status (wild-type versus mutant), age (<65 versus >/=65 years), and time to progression (TTP) on first-line therapy (<6 versus >/=6 months).PATIENTS AND METHODS: OS and PFS were evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier analysis, with HR determined by the Cox proportional hazards model.Treatment-by-subgroup interaction was tested to determine whether treatment effect was consistent between subgroup pairs.RESULTS: Patients with both wild-type and mutant KRAS benefited from ramucirumab + FOLFIRI treatment over placebo + FOLFIRI (interaction P = 0.526); although numerically, wild-type KRAS patients benefited more (wild-type KRAS: median OS = 14.4 versus 11.9 months, HR = 0.82, P = 0.049; mutant KRAS: median OS = 12.7 versus 11.3 months, HR = 0.89, P = 0.263).Patients with both longer and shorter first-line TTP benefited from ramucirumab (interaction P = 0.9434), although TTP <6 months was associated with poorer OS (TTP >/=6 months: median OS = 14.3 versus 12.5 months, HR = 0.86, P = 0.061; TTP <6 months: median OS = 10.4 versus 8.0 months, HR = 0.86, P = 0.276).The subgroups of patients >/=65 versus <65 years also derived a similar ramucirumab survival benefit (interaction P = 0.9521) (>/=65 years: median OS = 13.8 versus 11.7 months, HR = 0.85, P = 0.156; <65 years: median OS = 13.1 versus 11.9 months, HR = 0.86, P = 0.098).The safety profile of ramucirumab + FOLFIRI was similar across subgroups.CONCLUSIONS: These analyses revealed similar efficacy and safety among patient subgroups with differing KRAS mutation status, longer or shorter first-line TTP, and age.Ramucirumab is a beneficial addition to second-line FOLFIRI treatment for a wide range of patients with mCRC.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01183780.",1,1,1,1

23281805,"Randomized Phase II trial of paclitaxel and carboplatin followed by gemcitabine switch-maintenance therapy versus gemcitabine and carboplatin followed by gemcitabine continuation-maintenance therapy in previously untreated advanced non-small cell lung cancer.BACKGROUND: In recent years, maintenance chemotherapy is increasingly being recognized as a new treatment strategy to improve the outcome of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).However, the optimal maintenance strategy is still controversial.Gemcitabine is a promising candidate for single-agent maintenance therapy because of little toxicity and good tolerability.We have conducted a randomized phase II study to evaluate the validity of single-agent maintenance chemotherapy of gemcitabine and to compare continuation- and switch-maintenance.METHODS: Chemonaive patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC were randomly assigned 1:1 to either arm A or B. Patients received paclitaxel (200 mg/m2, day 1) plus carboplatin (AUC 6 mg/mL/min, day 1) every 3 weeks in arm A, or gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2, days 1 and 8) plus carboplatin (AUC 5 mg/mL/min, day1) every 3 weeks in arm B. Non-progressive patients following 3 cycles of induction chemotherapy received maintenance gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2, days 1 and 8) every 3 weeks.( TRIAL REGISTRATION: UMIN000008252)RESULTS: The study was stopped because of delayed accrual at interim analysis.Of the randomly assigned 50 patients, 49 except for one in arm B were evaluable.Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 4.6 months for arm A vs. 3.5 months for arm B (HR = 1.03; 95% CI, 0.45-2.27; p = 0.95) and median overall survival (OS) was 15.0 months for arm A vs. 14.8 months for arm B (HR = 0.79; 95% CI, 0.40-1.51; p = 0.60), showing no difference between the two arms.The response rate, disease control rate, and the transit rate to maintenance phase were 36.0% (9/25), 64.0% (16/25), and 48% (12/25) for arm A vs. 16.7% (4/24), 50.0% (12/24), and 33% (8/24) for arm B, which were also statistically similar between the two arms (p = 0.13, p = 0.32, and p = 0.30, respectively).Both induction regimens were tolerable, except that more patients experienced peripheral neuropathy in arm A.

28430159,"Efficacy of Low-Molecular-Weight Fucoidan as a Supplemental Therapy in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Patients: A Double-Blind Randomized Controlled Trial.BACKGROUND: Low-molecular-weight fucoidan (LMF) is widely used as a food supplement for cancer patients.However, all of the studies are in vitro or were conducted using mice.Therefore, powerful clinical evidence for LMF use is relatively weak.This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of LMF as a supplemental therapy to chemo-target agents in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients.METHODS: We conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of LMF as a supplemental therapy to chemotarget agents in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).Sixty eligible patients with mCRC were included.Finally, 54 patients were enrolled, of whom 28 were included in the study group and 26 in the control group.The primary endpoint was the disease control rate (DCR), and secondary endpoints included the overall response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), adverse effects (AEs), and quality of life (QOL).RESULTS: The DCRs were 92.8% and 69.2% in the study and control groups, respectively (p = 0.026), in a median follow-up period of 11.5 months.The OS, PFS, ORR, AEs, and QOL did not significantly differ between the two groups.CONCLUSION: This is the first clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of LMF as a supplemental therapy in the management of patients with mCRC.The results indicate that LMF combined with chemotarget agents significantly improved the DCR.",1,1,1,1
29034009,"A multicenter, randomized study of decitabine as epigenetic priming with induction chemotherapy in children with AML.BACKGROUND: Decitabine is a deoxycytidine nucleoside derivative inhibitor of DNA-methyltransferases, which has been studied extensively and is approved for myelodysplastic syndrome in adults but with less focus in children.Accordingly, we conducted a phase 1 multicenter, randomized, open-label study to evaluate decitabine pre-treatment before standard induction therapy in children with newly diagnosed AML to assess safety and tolerability and explore a number of biologic endpoints.RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were fully assessable for all study objectives per protocol (10 in Arm A = epigenetic priming induction, 14 in Arm B = standard induction).All patients experienced neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.The most common grade 3 and 4 non-hematologic adverse events observed were gastrointestinal toxicities and hypophosphatemia.Plasma decitabine PK were similar to previously reported adult data.Overall CR/CRi was similar for the two arms.MRD negativity at end-induction was 85% in Arm A versus 67% in Arm B patients.DNA methylation measured in peripheral blood over the course of treatment tracked with blast clearance and matched marrow aspirates at day 0 and day 21.Unlike end-induction marrow analyses, promoter methylation in blood identified an apparent reversal of response in the lone treatment failure, 1 week prior to the patient's marrow aspirate confirming non-response.Decitabine-induced effects on end-induction (day 35-43 following initiation of treatment) marrows in Arm A were reflected by changes in DNA methylation in matched paired marrow diagnostic aspirates.CONCLUSIONS: This first-in-pediatrics trial demonstrates that decitabine prior to standard combination chemotherapy is feasible and well tolerated in children with newly diagnosed AML.Pre-treatment with decitabine may represent a newer therapeutic option for pediatric AML, especially as it appears to induce important epigenetic alterations.The novel biological correlates studied in this trial offer a clinically relevant window into disease progression and remission.Additional studies are needed to definitively assess whether decitabine can enhance durability responses in children with AML.TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT01177540.",1,1,1,1
27810483,"Tea, coffee, and caffeinated beverage consumption and risk of epithelial ovarian cancers.BACKGROUND: The risk for epithelial ovarian cancer associated with the consumption of caffeinated beverages (tea, coffee, and soft drinks) and green tea is inconclusive.However, few studies have investigated the type of caffeinated beverage or the type of tea.OBJECTIVE: We assessed consumption of tea (black/caffeinated tea and green tea separately), coffee, and caffeinated soft drinks, as well as level of consumption, and the risk for epithelial ovarian cancer and its histotypes.STUDY DESIGN: This study was conducted within a population-based case-control study in Alberta and British Columbia, Canada from 2001 to 2012.After restricting to cases of epithelial invasive cancers and controls aged 40-79 years who completed an interview that included coffee, soft drink, and tea consumption (ascertained starting in 2005 in British Columbia and 2008 in Alberta), there were a total of 524 cases and 1587 controls.Those that did not meet the threshold for beverage consumption (at least once per month for 6 months or more) were classified as non-drinkers.Adult lifetime cumulative consumption (cup-years=cups/day*years) was calculated.Unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) to describe the association between the relevant drink consumption and risk.RESULTS: No excess risk was seen for coffee or caffeinated soft drinks.Similarly, any tea consumption was not associated with risk, but when stratified by the type of tea, there was an increase in risk in black tea only drinkers (aOR=1.56; 95% CI:1.07-2.28 for >40 cup-years), but no excess risk for the exclusive green tea drinkers.Similar findings were observed for post-menopausal women.The association for black tea only consumption was mainly seen in the endometrioid histotype (aOR=3.19; 95% CI: 1.32-7.69).CONCLUSION: Black tea consumption may be associated with an increased risk epithelial ovarian carcinoma.The excess risk is seen only in the endometrioid histotype but not in serous or clear cell.Further studies are required to confirm these findings and identify the constituents in black tea that may increase the risk.",0,0,0,0

29564720,"Evaluation of the effect of the accordion suturing technique on wound lengths in breast cancer surgery: a randomised clinical trial.BACKGROUND: Cosmetic outcomes and scar lengths remain important considerations in breast cancer surgery.Suturing techniques should decrease scar tissue formation and provide good cosmetic results.The use of an accordion suturing technique may result in decreased surgical wound lengths and better cosmetic outcomes.We compared the outcomes of the accordion suturing technique with the standard suturing technique in breast cancer surgeries.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Female patients undergoing wide local excision of breast cancers were randomised to undergo closure of their surgical wound by either the accordion or the non-accordion (standard) suturing techniques between the months of May and October 2015.Pre-closure and post-closure wound lengths were measured intra-operatively.The primary outcome was a reduction of the surgical wound length at 6 weeks.The secondary outcome was a composite of the absence of hypertrophic scar tissue formation and optimal cosmesis.RESULTS: Thirty eligible women for wide local excision of breast tumours were randomly assigned to the accordion and non-accordion groups (15 accordion and 15 non-accordion).Seven women were excluded from the study because they underwent re-excision of margins for their breast tumours before the end of 6 weeks, and one woman was lost to follow-up.We therefore compared the outcomes of 12 women who underwent closure of their surgical wound by way of the accordion suturing technique to the outcomes of 10 women who underwent closure with the non-accordion (standard) suturing technique.The percentage reduction of wound length at 6 weeks was significantly greater in the accordion group than in the non-accordion group (M = 24.4, SD = 10.2 vs. M = 8.6, SD = 11.5, p = 0.0026).There was no significant difference in the cosmetic outcome between both groups using the James Quinn's wound evaluation score.CONCLUSION: The accordion suturing technique was associated with a significant reduction in surgical wound lengths in breast conserving surgery at 6 weeks without compromising the cosmetic result.",0,0,0,0

29678994,"Can exercise delay transition to active therapy in men with low-grade prostate cancer? A multicentre randomised controlled trial.INTRODUCTION: Active surveillance is a strategy for managing low-risk, localised prostate cancer, where men are observed with serial prostate-specific antigen assessments to identify signs of disease progression.Currently, there are no strategies to support active surveillance compliance nor are there interventions that can prevent or slow disease progression, ultimately delaying transition to active treatment before it is clinically required.Recently, we proposed that exercise may have a therapeutic potential in delaying the need for active treatment in men on active surveillance.METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A single-blinded, two arm, multicentre randomised controlled trial will be undertaken with 168 patients randomly allocated in a ratio of 1:1 to exercise or usual care.Exercise will consist of supervised resistance and aerobic exercise performed three times per week for the first 6 months in an exercise clinical setting, and during months 7-12, a progressive stepped down approach will be used with men transitioning to once a week supervised training.Thereafter, for months 13 to 36, the men will self-manage their exercise programme.The primary endpoint will be the time until the patients begin active therapy.Secondary endpoints include disease progression (prostate specific antigen), body composition and muscle density, quality of life, distress and anxiety and an economic analysis will be performed.Measurements will be undertaken at 6 and 12 months (postintervention) and at 24 and 36 months follow-up.The primary outcome (time to initiation of curative therapy) will be analysed using Cox proportional hazards regression.Outcomes measured repeatedly will be analysed using mixed effects models to examine between-group differences.Data will be analysed using an intention-to-treat approach.ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Outcomes from the study will be published in peer-reviewed academic journals and presented in scientific, consumer and clinical meetings.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER:",0,0,0,0

30088226,"The Effect of Counseling on Breast Cancer Awareness in Rural Iranian Women: a Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial.In a community such as Iran where late presentation is predominant and the majority of breast cancer patients are diagnosed at advanced stages of the disease, there is an urgent need for improving the level of awareness about breast cancer and early detection measures.Given that rural residents are at higher risk for late diagnosis of breast cancer because they have less education, income, and access to advanced screening technologies, this study was conducted to determine the effect of counseling on breast cancer awareness of rural Iranian women.This randomized clinical trial was conducted on 60 rural women from the Abish Ahmad area in northwestern Iran in 2017.The randomized cluster method was used for sampling.From 20 rural health houses and centers, about one third were selected randomly.From the six selected clusters, three were randomly allocated as the control group and three as the intervention group.Using convenience sampling, 30 women between the ages of 40 and 69 were selected from the control group and 30 from the intervention group.The intervention group attended six group counseling sessions.Data was gathered using a demographic and obstetrical information questionnaire and breast cancer awareness measures.The chi-square, independent t test and ANCOVA by controlling for the baseline scores were used to analyze the data.After counseling, the mean knowledge about breast cancer score was significantly higher in the intervention group than in the control group (adjusted mean difference, 17.02; confidence interval (CI) 95%, 15.44 to 18.59; p < 0.001).The mean barriers to breast cancer screening score showed a significant decrease in the intervention group compared to the control group (AMD, - 1.74; 95% CI - 3.12 to - 0.36, p < 0.001).After intervention, the frequency of breast self-exam showed a significant difference between groups (p < 0.001); but for confidence about noticing breast changes, no significant difference was observed between groups (p = 0.08).Group counseling had a significant effect on enhancing breast cancer awareness of rural Iranian women, except for confidence about noticing breast changes.",0,0,0,0
25712847,"Feasibility and safety of early chest tube removal after complete video-assisted thoracic lobectomy.OBJECTIVE: The aim was to evaluate the feasibility and safety of early chest tube removal after complete video-assisted thoracic lobectomy (CVATL).METHODS: Retrospective analysis was performed on effects of chest tube removal on patients with lung cancer after pulmonary lobectomy between November 2013 and October 2014.154 eligible patients included 97 cases for CVATL and 57 cases for open thoracic lobectomy.Patients with CVATL were divided randomly into experimental group (EG) and control group (CG), in which 51 patients in EG had chest tube removal on the 2 nd day after operation; 46 patients in CG had the tube removal when the drainage volume <100 ml/day.Patients in open thoracic lobectomy group (OG) had the tubes removal as CG.The drainage volumes of the 1 st and 2 nd 24 h after operation, duration of chest tubes, cases of pain alleviation, and recurrent pleural effusions requiring reintervention were measured.RESULTS: The average drainage volume of the 1 st 24 h after operation of CVATL group from EG and CG was significantly reduced than that in OG (260.41 ml vs. 353.16 ml, P < 0.001).The average drainage volume of the 2 nd 24 h after operation of CG was significantly reduced than that in OG (163.91 ml vs. 222.98 ml, P < 0.001).The average duration of chest tube of CG for 2.98 days showed significant different compared with OG for 3.81 days (P < 0.001).Chest tube removal in CVATL group increased more chest pain alleviation than OG (80.4% vs. 56.1%, P = 0.001).The frequencies of recurrent pleural effusions requiring reintervention were 5.88% (3/51), 4.35% (2/46) and 5.26% (3/57), respectively, which had no significant differences between three groups (P = 1.000).CONCLUSIONS: Complete video-assisted thoracic lobectomy brings less drainage volume after operation.Early removal of chest tube in CVATL shows feasible and safe and demonstrates that it may reduce postoperative pain and help fast recovery.",0,0,0,0
30033035,"Comparison of heart dose in early-stage left-sided breast cancers treated with intraoperative radiation therapy or whole-breast irradiation with deep inspiratory breath hold.PURPOSE: To compare heart dose between patients treated with lumpectomy and either intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) with CT-guided high-dose-rate brachytherapy (precision breast IORT [PB-IORT]) or whole-breast irradiation with deep inspiratory breath hold (WBI-DIBH) for early-stage left-sided breast cancers.METHODS AND MATERIALS: We retrospectively identified the 17 patients with left-sided breast cancers treated with PB-IORT on a phase I clinical trial and 17 patients with left-sided tumors who had undergone lumpectomy and adjuvant WBI-DIBH.Dosimetric data were obtained.T-testing was performed and biologically effective doses (BEDs) were calculated using an alpha/beta ratio of 2 Gy.RESULTS: Mean heart dose was significantly lower with WBI-DIBH compared with PB-IORT (0.61 vs. 0.87 Gy, p = 0.006).Mean heart BED was lower with WBI-DIBH (0.62 vs. 1.3 Gy2, p = 0.0001).Nominal maximum heart dose was higher with WBI-DIBH (11.37 vs. 4.81 Gy, p = 0.004).Maximum heart dose BED was similar between WBI-DIBH and IORT, 16.63 vs. 19.36 Gy (p = 0.64), respectively.No difference was found in mean left anterior descending artery dose: 2.18 Gy with WBI-DIBH and 1.89 Gy with IORT (p = 0.446).The maximum left anterior descending doses were 9.63 Gy and 3.62 Gy with WBI-DIBH and IORT, respectively (p = 0.016).Distance from the heart to the lumpectomy cavity was inversely associated with heart dose for PB-IORT, but not for WBI-IORT.CONCLUSIONS: Heart doses were low in both groups.Expected increase in cardiac risk at these doses is minimal.It is unlikely that there will be a clinically significant difference in cardiac toxicity in patients treated with WBI-DIBH or PB-IORT.Further research is needed to evaluate the actual clinical impact of the observed cardiac doses delivered with these modalities.",0,0,0,0
30345906,"Atezolizumab and Nab-Paclitaxel in Advanced Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.BACKGROUND: Unresectable locally advanced or metastatic triple-negative (hormone-receptor-negative and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [HER2]-negative) breast cancer is an aggressive disease with poor outcomes.Nanoparticle albumin-bound (nab)-paclitaxel may enhance the anticancer activity of atezolizumab.METHODS: In this phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned (in a 1:1 ratio) patients with untreated metastatic triple-negative breast cancer to receive atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel or placebo plus nab-paclitaxel; patients continued the intervention until disease progression or an unacceptable level of toxic effects occurred.Stratification factors were the receipt or nonreceipt of neoadjuvant or adjuvant taxane therapy, the presence or absence of liver metastases at baseline, and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression at baseline (positive vs. negative).The two primary end points were progression-free survival (in the intention-to-treat population and PD-L1-positive subgroup) and overall survival (tested in the intention-to-treat population; if the finding was significant, then it would be tested in the PD-L1-positive subgroup).RESULTS: Each group included 451 patients (median follow-up, 12.9 months).In the intention-to-treat analysis, the median progression-free survival was 7.2 months with atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel, as compared with 5.5 months with placebo plus nab-paclitaxel (hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.69 to 0.92; P=0.002); among patients with PD-L1-positive tumors, the median progression-free survival was 7.5 months and 5.0 months, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.49 to 0.78; P<0.001).In the intention-to-treat analysis, the median overall survival was 21.3 months with atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel and 17.6 months with placebo plus nab-paclitaxel (hazard ratio for death, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.69 to 1.02; P=0.08); among patients with PD-L1-positive tumors, the median overall survival was 25.0 months and 15.5 months, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.86).No new adverse effects were identified.Adverse events that led to the discontinuation of any agent occurred in 15.9% of the patients who received atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel and in 8.2% of those who received placebo plus nab-paclitaxel.CONCLUSIONS: Atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel prolonged progression-free survival among patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer in both the intention-to-treat population and the PD-L1-positive subgroup.Adverse events were consistent with the known safety profiles of each agent.(Funded by F.

25403578,"FOLFOX4 versus sequential dose-dense FOLFOX7 followed by FOLFIRI in patients with resectable metastatic colorectal cancer (MIROX): a pragmatic approach to chemotherapy timing with perioperative or postoperative chemotherapy from an open-label, randomized phase III trial.BACKGROUND: Perioperative FOLFOX4 (oxaliplatin plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin) chemotherapy is the current standard in patients with resectable metastases from colorectal cancer (CRC).We aimed to determine whether a sequential chemotherapy with dose-dense oxaliplatin (FOLFOX7) and irinotecan (FOLFIRI; irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin) is superior to FOLFOX4.The chemotherapy timing was not imposed, and was perioperative or postoperative.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this open-label, phase III trial, patients with resectable or resected metastases were randomly assigned either to 12 cycles of FOLFOX4 (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m(2)) or 6 cycles of FOLFOX7 (oxaliplatin 130 mg/m(2)) followed by 6 cycles of FOLFIRI (irinotecan 180 mg/m(2)).Randomization was done centrally, with stratification by chemotherapy timing, type of local treatment (surgery versus radiofrequency ablation with/without surgery), and Fong's prognostic score.The primary end point was 2-year disease-free survival (DFS).RESULTS: A total of 284 patients were randomized, 142 in each treatment group.Chemotherapy was perioperative in 168 (59.2%) patients and postoperative in 116 (40.8%) patients.Perioperative chemotherapy was preferentially proposed for synchronous metastases, whereas postoperative chemotherapy was more frequently used for metachronous metastases.Two-year DFS was 48.5% in the FOLFOX4 group and 50.0% in the FOLFOX7-FOLFIRI group.In the multivariable analysis, more than one metastasis [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.15] and synchronous metastases (HR = 1.63) were independent prognostic factors for shorter DFS.Five-year overall survival (OS) rate was 69.5% with FOLFOX4 versus 66.6% with FOLFOX7-FOLFIRI.CONCLUSIONS: FOLFOX7-FOLFIRI is not superior to FOLFOX4 in patients with resectable metastatic CRC.Five-year OS rates observed in both groups are the highest ever reported in this setting, possibly reflecting the pragmatic approach to chemotherapy timing.CLINICAL TRIALS NUMBER: NCT00268398.",1,1,1,1
23536720,"HGF as a circulating biomarker of onartuzumab treatment in patients with advanced solid tumors.The objective of this study was to evaluate circulating hepatocyte growth factor (cHGF) as a pharmacodynamic biomarker of Met inhibition for onartuzumab (MetMAb, OA5D5v2) in a phase I trial in patients with advanced cancers and a phase II trial in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).The phase I study was a dose escalation trial with onartuzumab administered i.v.once every three weeks.The phase II study was a randomized two-arm trial in which onartuzumab or placebo was administered in combination with erlotinib in 137 patients with second and third line (2/3L) NSCLC.cHGF levels were evaluated by ELISA at multiple time points over the treatment period.Onartuzumab administration resulted in an acute and sustained rise in cHGF in both the phase I and phase II studies.Elevation in cHGF was independent of dose or drug exposure and was restricted to onartuzumab treatment.Neither higher baseline nor elevated change in cHGF levels upon treatment could simply be attributed to tumor burden or number of liver metastasis.We have shown that elevated cHGF can consistently and reproducibly be measured as a pharmacodynamic biomarker of onartuzumab activity.The elevation in cHGF is independent of tumor type, dose administered, or dose duration.Although these studies were not powered to directly address the contribution of cHGF as a predictive, on-treatment, circulating biomarker, these data suggest that measurement of cHGF in future expanded studies is warranted.",0,0,0,0
27951450,"Dose-dense adjuvant chemotherapy in premenopausal breast cancer patients: A pooled analysis of the MIG1 and GIM2 phase III studies.BACKGROUND: No evidence exists to recommend a specific chemotherapy regimen in young breast cancer patients.We performed a pooled analysis of two randomised clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of adjuvant dose-dense chemotherapy in premenopausal breast cancer patients and its impact on the risk of treatment-induced amenorrhoea.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the MIG1 study, node-positive or high-risk node-negative patients were randomised to 6 cycles of fluorouracil/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide every 2 (dose-dense) or 3 (standard-interval) weeks.In the GIM2 study, node-positive patients were randomised to 4 cycles of dose-dense or standard-interval EC or FEC followed by 4 cycles of dose-dense or standard-interval paclitaxel.Using individual patient data, the hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival by means of a Cox proportional hazards model and the odds ratio for treatment-induced amenorrhoea through a logistic regression model were calculated for each study.A meta-analysis of the two studies was performed using the random effect model to compute the parameter estimates.RESULTS: A total of 1,549 patients were included.Dose-dense chemotherapy was associated with a significant improved overall survival as compared to standard-interval chemotherapy (HR, 0.71; 95% confidence intervals [CI], 0.54-0.95; p = 0.021).The pooled HRs were 0.78 (95% CI, 0.54-1.12) and 0.65 (95% CI, 0.40-1.06) for patients with hormone receptor-positive and -negative tumours, respectively (interaction p = 0.330).No increased risk of treatment-induced amenorrhoea was observed with dose-dense chemotherapy (odds ratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.80-1.25; p = 0.989).CONCLUSION: Dose-dense adjuvant chemotherapy may be considered the preferred treatment option in high-risk premenopausal breast cancer patients.",1,1,1,1

31792878,"Oral morphine drops for prompt relief of breathlessness in patients with advanced cancer-a randomized, double blinded, crossover trial of morphine sulfate oral drops vs. morphine hydrochloride drops with ethanol (red morphine drops).PURPOSE: Episodic breathlessness is frequent in palliative cancer patients.Opioids are the only pharmacological agents with sufficient evidence in treatment.In Denmark, the main recommendation is red morphine drops (RMD), an off-label solution of morphine, ethanol, and red color (cochenille) described since 1893 (Pharmacopoea Danica).In 2015, the Danish Medicines Agency increased focus on off-label medicines and recommended registered morphine drops without ethanol instead.However, our palliative patients told us that RMD was better.For that reason, we conducted a clinical trial to clarify any perceived difference between the two types of drops.METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double blinded, crossover trial.Patients were asked to perform standardized activity (2-min walk) aiming to provoke breathlessness.Primary endpoint (breathlessness NRS) and secondary endpoints (saturation, pulse, respiratory frequency) were measured before (t = 0) and after test medicine at t = 1, t = 3, t = 5, t = 10, and t = 20 min.After 2-4 days (washout period), the patients repeated the test, receiving the alternative drops in a blinded setup (crossover).RESULTS: In the first 3 min, the relative drop in breathlessness for morphine drops with ethanol (RMD) was significant more than for morphine drops without ethanol.We found no significant difference in secondary endpoints.CONCLUSIONS: A conclusion could be that ethanol might facilitate morphine absorption in the mouth.Our results needs further research of opioid absorption in the mouth as well as trials, testing morphine vs. more lipophilic opioids.The RMD drops are cheap, easy to use, and noninvasive and keep the patient independent of health care professionals.",0,0,0,0

Results from the GEICAM/2006-03, multicenter study.Chemotherapy remains as the only systemic treatment option available for basal-like breast cancer (BC) patients.Preclinical models and several phase II studies suggested that platinum salts are active drugs in this BC subtype though there is no randomized study supporting this hypothesis.This study investigates if the addition of carboplatin to a combination of an alkylating agent together with anthracyclines and taxanes is able to increase the efficacy in the neoadjuvant treatment context.Patients with operable breast cancer and immunophenotypically defined basal-like disease (ER-/PR-/HER2- and cytokeratin 5/6+ or EGFR+) were recruited.Patients were randomized to receive EC (epirubicin 90 mg/m(2) plus cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2) for 4 cycles) followed either by D (docetaxel 100 mg/m(2) x 4 cycles; EC-D) or DCb (docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) plus carboplatin AUC 6 x 4 cycles; EC-DCb).The primary end point was pathological complete response (pCR) in the breast following the Miller and Payne criteria.Ninety-four patients were randomized (46 EC-D, 48 EC-DCb).pCR rate in the breast was seen in 16 patients (35 %) with EC-D and 14 patients (30 %) with EC-DCb (P value = 0.61).pCR in the breast and axilla was seen in 30 % of patients in both arms.The overall clinical response rate was 70 % (95 % CI 56-83) in the EC-D arm and 77 % (95 % CI 65-87) in the EC-DCb arm.Grade 3/4 toxicity was similar in both arms.The addition of carboplatin to conventional chemotherapy with EC-D in basal-like breast cancer patients did not improve the efficacy probably because they had already received an alkylating agent.These findings should be taken into consideration when developing new agents for this disease.",1,1,1,1

26438237,"The effects of short-term fasting on tolerance to (neo) adjuvant chemotherapy in HER2-negative breast cancer patients: a randomized pilot study.BACKGROUND: Preclinical evidence shows that short-term fasting (STF) protects healthy cells against side effects of chemotherapy and makes cancer cells more vulnerable to it.This pilot study examines the feasibility of STF and its effects on tolerance of chemotherapy in a homogeneous patient group with early breast cancer (BC).METHODS: Eligible patients had HER2-negative, stage II/III BC.Women receiving (neo)-adjuvant TAC (docetaxel/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide) were randomized to fast 24 h before and after commencing chemotherapy, or to eat according to the guidelines for healthy nutrition.Toxicity in the two groups was compared.Chemotherapy-induced DNA damage in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was quantified by the level of gamma-H2AX analyzed by flow cytometry.RESULTS: Thirteen patients were included of whom seven were randomized to the STF arm.STF was well tolerated.Mean erythrocyte- and thrombocyte counts 7 days post-chemotherapy were significantly higher (P = 0.007, 95 % CI 0.106-0.638 and P = 0.00007, 95 % CI 38.7-104, respectively) in the STF group compared to the non-STF group.Non-hematological toxicity did not differ between the groups.Levels of gamma-H2AX were significantly increased 30 min post-chemotherapy in CD45 + CD3- cells in non-STF, but not in STF patients.CONCLUSIONS: STF during chemotherapy was well tolerated and reduced hematological toxicity of TAC in HER2-negative BC patients.Moreover, STF may reduce a transient increase in, and/or induce a faster recovery of DNA damage in PBMCs after chemotherapy.Larger studies, investigating a longer fasting period, are required to generate more insight into the possible benefits of STF during chemotherapy.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01304251 , March 2011.",1,1,1,1
27209164,"BEVERLY: Rationale and Design of a Randomized Open-Label Phase III Trial Comparing Bevacizumab Plus Erlotinib Versus Erlotinib Alone as First-Line Treatment of Patients With EGFR-Mutated Advanced Nonsquamous Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.BACKGROUND: About 20% of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases harbor somatic mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene.In these patients, the standard first-line treatments are the EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as gefitinib, erlotinib, or afatinib.Most of these patients develop resistance and relapse within about 1 year of initiation of an EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor.Consequently, it is important to develop new combination strategies to delay this resistance.Preclinical data have showed that EGFR and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) share a common downstream pathway, suggesting the important role of VEGF in the resistance to EGFR blockade.The combination of erlotinib and bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF agent, showed very interesting clinical results.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The bevacizumab plus erlotinib study (BEVERLY) is a randomized, open-label, phase III trial investigating first-line erlotinib plus bevacizumab versus erlotinib in patients with advanced NSCLC harboring activating EGFR mutations.The co-primary endpoints are investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) and blinded, independent centrally reviewed PFS.The secondary endpoints include overall survival, quality of life, objective response rate, and safety.A total of 200 patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive oral erlotinib (150 mg daily) plus bevacizumab (15 mg/kg, intravenously, on day 1 of every 21-day cycle) or erlotinib alone, until objective disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or the patient's or physician's motivated decision to stop the treatment.CONCLUSION: If the primary endpoint of PFS is met, the erlotinib plus bevacizumab combination will be confirmed as the best first-line treatment for patients with advanced NSCLC harboring activating EGFR mutations.",1,1,1,1
23281805,"Randomized Phase II trial of paclitaxel and carboplatin followed by gemcitabine switch-maintenance therapy versus gemcitabine and carboplatin followed by gemcitabine continuation-maintenance therapy in previously untreated advanced non-small cell lung cancer.BACKGROUND: In recent years, maintenance chemotherapy is increasingly being recognized as a new treatment strategy to improve the outcome of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).However, the optimal maintenance strategy is still controversial.Gemcitabine is a promising candidate for single-agent maintenance therapy because of little toxicity and good tolerability.We have conducted a randomized phase II study to evaluate the validity of single-agent maintenance chemotherapy of gemcitabine and to compare continuation- and switch-maintenance.METHODS: Chemonaive patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC were randomly assigned 1:1 to either arm A or B. Patients received paclitaxel (200 mg/m2, day 1) plus carboplatin (AUC 6 mg/mL/min, day 1) every 3 weeks in arm A, or gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2, days 1 and 8) plus carboplatin (AUC 5 mg/mL/min, day1) every 3 weeks in arm B. Non-progressive patients following 3 cycles of induction chemotherapy received maintenance gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2, days 1 and 8) every 3 weeks.( TRIAL REGISTRATION: UMIN000008252)RESULTS: The study was stopped because of delayed accrual at interim analysis.Of the randomly assigned 50 patients, 49 except for one in arm B were evaluable.Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 4.6 months for arm A vs. 3.5 months for arm B (HR = 1.03; 95% CI, 0.45-2.27; p = 0.95) and median overall survival (OS) was 15.0 months for arm A vs. 14.8 months for arm B (HR = 0.79; 95% CI, 0.40-1.51; p = 0.60), showing no difference between the two arms.The response rate, disease control rate, and the transit rate to maintenance phase were 36.0% (9/25), 64.0% (16/25), and 48% (12/25) for arm A vs. 16.7% (4/24), 50.0% (12/24), and 33% (8/24) for arm B, which were also statistically similar between the two arms (p = 0.13, p = 0.32, and p = 0.30, respectively).Both induction regimens were tolerable, except that more patients experienced peripheral neuropathy in arm A. Toxicities during the maintenance phase were also minimal.CONCLUSION: Survival and overall response were not significantly different between the two arms.Gemcitabine may be well-tolerable and feasible for maintenance therapy.",1,1,1,1

A prospective, randomized trial.BACKGROUND: Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (E.R.A.S.) programs are now widely accepted in colonic laparoscopic resections because of faster recovery and less perioperative complications.The aim of this study was to assess safety and feasibility of discharging patients operated on by laparoscopic colectomy on postoperative day 2, so long as the first flatus has passed and in the absence of complication-related symptoms.METHODS: This study was a non-inferiority, open-label, single-center, prospective, randomized study comparing ""Ultra"" to Classic E.R.A.S. with discharge on POD 2 and 4, respectively.Seven hundred and sixty-five patients with resectable non-metastatic colonic cancer were analyzed: 384 patients were assigned to ""Ultra"" E.R.A.S. and 381 to Classic E.R.A.S. Primary end-point was mortality; secondary end-points were morbidity, readmission and reoperation rate.Limitations are: it is a single-center experience; it is not double-blind, with the intrinsic risk of intentional or unconscious bias; exclusion criteria because of ""non-compliance"" may be considered arbitrary.RESULTS: Mortality was 0.89 % in ""Ultra"" E.R.A.S. group and 0.59 % in Classic E.R.A.S. (p = 0.571).Morbidity was 34.1 % for ""Ultra"" E.R.A.S. arm and 35.4 % for Classic E.R.A.S. (p = 0.753).Readmissions were 5.6 % for ""Ultra"" E.R.A.S. and 5.9 % for Classic E.R.A.S. (p = 0.359).Reoperation rate was 3.8 % for ""Ultra"" ERAS and 4.7 % for Classic E.R.A.S. (p = 0.713).Multivariate regression analyses using Cox's proportional hazard model showed that mortality (primary end-point), morbidity, reoperation and readmission (secondary end-points) were not significantly influenced by the two different perioperative regimens; conversely, the global cost of ""Ultra"" E.R.A.S. regimen was more economically effective.CONCLUSION: ""Ultra"" E.R.A.S. showed to be safe, actual and effective; discharge on postoperative day 2 after the first flatus passage, in the absence of complication-related symptoms, should be actively considered in a modern, multidisciplinary, multimodal laparoscopic management of colonic cancer.",0,0,0,0

29554321,"Robotic Radiosurgery for Brain Metastases Diagnosed With Either SPACE or MPRAGE Sequence (CYBER-SPACE)-A Single-Center Prospective Randomized Trial.BACKGROUND: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) of brain metastases (BM) is recommended in oligometastatic scenarios as a less toxic treatment alternative to whole-brain radiotherapy.Recent findings support SRS for patients with multiple (>3) BM.Furthermore, advances in MR imaging have facilitated the detection of very small BM, as advances in SRS technology have facilitated the highly conformal and simultaneous treatment of multiple target lesions.OBJECTIVE: To compare efficacy and toxicity of repeated frameless robotic SRS of up to 10 simultaneous BM through a single-center prospective randomized trial.METHODS: Two hundred patients will be randomized and receive imaging and treatment based on either the highly sensitive SPACE (sampling perfection with application optimized contrasts using different flip angle evolution) or the MPRAGE (magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo) magnetic resonance imaging sequence.If during follow-up new metastases are detected, treatment is repeated.The primary endpoint is reached when a patient develops more than 10 simultaneous new BM and is thus deemed unsuitable for further SRS.Overall survival will be assessed as secondary endpoint.Quality of life and neurocognition will be evaluated every 3 mo using CANTAB tests and EORTC (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer) questionnaires.EXPECTED OUTCOMES: We expect to show that repeated SRS based on sensitive imaging can delay intracranial dissemination while preserving neurocognitive function and quality of life.DISCUSSION: The present study is the first to prospectively assess the benefit of sensitive imaging and repeated stereotactic irradiation in the treatment of patients with multiple BM.It represents a novel approach, where in a palliative setting advanced technology in treatment and diagnostics is employed to improve tumor control while also reducing toxicity and preserving quality of life.",0,0,0,0
31468214,"Assessment of DIEP Flap Perfusion with Intraoperative Indocyanine Green Fluorescence Imaging in Vasopressor-Dominated Hemodynamic Support Versus Liberal Fluid Administration: A Randomized Controlled Trial With Breast Cancer Patients.BACKGROUND: Dogmatic denial of vasopressor agents for blood pressure regulation during free-flap surgery is associated with concomitant large-volume intraoperative fluid administration.Yet, the doctrinal banning of vasopressors during microvascular breast reconstruction still is a subject of controversy.Several retrospective observations have recently drawn attention to serious iatrogenic consequences of intravenous crystalloid overload in microsurgery such as thrombus formation and increased flap failure rates.METHODS: This prospective randomized controlled trial investigated the potential effects of fluid-restrictive vasopressor-dominated hemodynamic support (FRV) compared with vasopressor-restrictive liberal fluid administration (LFA) on clinically relevant perfusion of the deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap via intraoperative indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging.The primary end point of the study was quantitative assessment of the percentage of insufficiently perfused tissue (NP) on the overall flap.Major complications were assessed as secondary end points.RESULTS: In 44 DIEP flap breast reconstructions after mastectomy, FRV circulatory support resulted in no statistically significant difference in total flap perfusion as detected via ICG fluorescence imaging in direct comparison with a traditional LFA strategy (NPFRV, 31.8% +/- 12.2% vs NPLFA, 29.5% +/- 13.3%; p = 0.559).One flap failure was registered with LFA, whereas no major complication occurred in the FRV cohort.CONCLUSIONS: According to the results of this study, neither a norepinephrine concentration of 0.065 +/- 0.020 mug/kg/min (FRV) nor fluid administration of 5.1 +/- 2.2 ml/kg/h (LFA) has a clinically significant impact on microperfusion in a standard DIEP flap procedure for breast reconstruction.Consistent with the current literature reporting a rise in complications with intraoperative fluid over-resuscitation, one flap failure occurred in the LFA cohort.",0,0,0,0

29904989,"Psychosocial mediators of dietary change among Hispanic/Latina breast cancer survivors in a culturally tailored dietary intervention.OBJECTIVE: To examine psychosocial mediators of the effect of a culturally tailored dietary intervention on dietary change among Hispanic/Latina breast cancer survivors.METHODS: Hispanic/Latina breast cancer survivors (n = 70) were randomized to receive either a 12-week theory-based and culturally tailored dietary change program (intervention group, n = 34), or standard-of-care printed recommendations (control group, n = 36) (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01414062).Fruit/vegetable intake (F/V), % calories from fat, and hypothesized psychosocial mediators were assessed at baseline, 6 and 12 months.Analysis of covariance assessed intervention effects on psychosocial mediators at 6 and 12 months.Mediation analysis using the bootstrap method evaluated the indirect intervention effects on dietary intake at 6 and 12 months through changes in psychosocial mediators at 6 and 12 months.RESULTS: Compared with controls, at 6 and 12 months, the intervention group reported greater improvements in stages of change (P < .001, P < .001, respectively), self-efficacy (P = .009, P = .002, respectively), snack preference for F/snack preference for F/V (P = .045, P = .002, respectively); at 12 months, the intervention group reported a decrease in chance-oriented external locus of control (P = .02).At 6 months, mediation analysis showed that the intervention effect was associated with an increase of 1.0 (95% CI, -0.1-2.4) serving/day of F/V, compared with the control group, although no indirect effect through the hypothesized psychosocial mediators was observed.At 12 months, the intervention was associated with an increase in 0.5 serving/day F/V through improved taste/snack preference for F/V at 6 and 12 months (95% CIs, 0.1-1.3, 0.0-1.4, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: Future programs can target improving taste/snack preference for F/V to promote dietary change in Hispanic/Latina breast cancer survivors.",0,0,0,0
26324738,"Clinical and Translational Results of a Phase II, Randomized Trial of an Anti-IGF-1R (Cixutumumab) in Women with Breast Cancer That Progressed on Endocrine Therapy.PURPOSE: This phase II trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of cixutumumab, a human anti-insulin-like growth factor receptor 1 (IGF-1R) monoclonal IgG1 antibody, and explored potential biomarkers in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer that progressed on antiestrogen therapy received (2:1 randomization) cixutumumab 10 mg/kg and the same antiestrogen (arm A) or cixutumumab alone (arm B) every 2 weeks (q2w).Primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS); secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS) and safety.Correlative analyses of IGF-1R, total insulin receptor (IR), and IR isoforms A (IR-A) and B (IR-B) expression in tumor tissue were explored.RESULTS: Ninety-three patients were randomized (arm A, n = 62; arm B, n = 31).Median PFS was 2.0 and 3.1 months for arm A and arm B, respectively.Secondary efficacy measures were similar between the arms.Overall, cixutumumab was well tolerated.IGF-1R expression was not associated with clinical outcomes.Regardless of the treatment, lower IR-A, IR-B, and total IR mRNA expression in tumor tissue was significantly associated with longer PFS [IR-A: HR, 2.62 (P = 0.0062); IR-B: HR, 2.21 (P = 0.0202); and total IR: HR, 2.18 (P = 0.0230)] and OS [IR-A: HR, 2.94 (P = 0.0156); IR-B: HR, 2.69 (P = 0.0245); and total IR: HR, 2.72 (P = 0.0231)].CONCLUSIONS: Cixutumumab (10 mg/kg) with or without antiestrogen q2w had an acceptable safety profile, but no significant clinical efficacy.Patients with low total IR, IR-A, and IR-B mRNA expression levels had significantly longer PFS and OS, independent of the treatment.The prognostic or predictive value of IR as a biomarker for IGF-1R-targeted therapies requires further validation.",1,1,1,1

25596266,"The genotype of MLH1 identifies a subgroup of follicular lymphoma patients who do not benefit from doxorubicin: FIL-FOLL study.Though most follicular lymphoma biomarkers rely on tumor features, the host genetic background may also be relevant for outcome.Here we aimed at verifying the contribution of candidate polymorphisms of FCgamma receptor, DNA repair and detoxification genes to prognostic stratification of follicular lymphoma treated with immunochemotherapy.The study was based on 428 patients enrolled in the FOLL05 prospective trial that compared three standard-of-care regimens (rituximab-cyclophosphamide-vincristine-prednisone versus rituximab-cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-vincristine-prednisone versus rituximab-fludarabine-mitoxantrone) for the first line therapy of advanced follicular lymphoma.Polymorphisms were genotyped on peripheral blood DNA samples.The primary endpoint was time to treatment failure.Polymorphisms of FCGR2A and FCGR3A, which have been suggested to influence the activity of rituximab as a single agent, did not affect time to treatment failure in the pooled analysis of the three FOLL05 treatment arms that combined rituximab with chemotherapy (P=0.742, P=0.252, respectively).These results were consistent even when the analysis was conducted by intention to treat, indicating that different chemotherapy regimens and loads did not interact differentially with the FCGR2A and FCGR3A genotypes.The genotype of MLH1, which regulates the genotoxic effect of doxorubicin, significantly affected time to treatment failure in patients in the rituximab-cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-vincristine-prednisone arm (P=0.001; q<0.1), but not in arms in which patients did not receive doxorubicin (i.e., the rituximab-cyclophosphamide-vincristine-prednisone and rituximab-fludarabine-mitoxantrone arms).The impact of MLH1 on time to treatment failure was independent after adjusting for the Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index and other potential confounding variables by multivariate analysis.These data indicate that MLH1 genotype is a predictor of failure to benefit from rituximab-cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-vincristine-prednisone treatment in advanced follicular lymphoma and confirm that FCGR2A and FCGR3A polymorphisms have no impact when follicular lymphoma is treated with rituximab plus chemotherapy (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT00774826).",0,0,0,0
27197280,"Alcohol Use and Breast Cancer Survival among Participants in the Women's Health Initiative.BACKGROUND: Alcohol increases the risk of breast cancer even at moderate levels of intake.However, the relationship between alcohol consumption and mortality among breast cancer patients is less clear.METHODS: This study included women from the Women's Health Initiative observational study and randomized trial diagnosed with breast cancer (n = 7,835).Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate adjusted HRs and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for overall and breast cancer-specific (BCS) mortality associated with drinking alcohol before or after a breast cancer diagnosis.We also assessed whether changes in drinking habits after diagnosis are related to mortality.RESULTS: Women who were consuming alcohol prior to their breast cancer diagnosis had a nonstatistically significant 24% (95% CI, 0.56-1.04) reduced risk of BCS mortality and a 26% (95% CI, 0.61-0.89) reduced risk of all-cause mortality.Some variation was observed by estrogen receptor (ER) status as alcohol consumption was associated with a 49% (95% CI, 0.31-0.83) reduced risk of BCS mortality among ER(-) patients with no change in risk observed among ER(+) patients (HR = 0.97; 95% CI, 0.31-1.54), though the difference between these risks was not statistically significant (P for interaction = 0.39).Postdiagnosis alcohol consumption, and change in consumption patterns after diagnosis, did not appear to be associated with all-cause or BCS mortality.CONCLUSION: In this large study, consumption of alcohol before or after breast cancer diagnosis did not increase risks of overall or cause-specific mortality.IMPACT: Coupled with existing evidence, alcohol consumption is unlikely to have a substantial impact on mortality among breast cancer patients.Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 25(8); 1268-73.(c)2016 AACR.",0,0,0,0

26121998,"A telephone-delivered multiple health behaviour change intervention for colorectal cancer survivors: making the case for cost-effective healthcare.UNLABELLED: In patients with colorectal cancer, a trial of a telephone-delivered multiple health behaviour change intervention, using acceptance commitment therapy strategies, found benefits for health and psychosocial outcomes including increased physical activity, improved dietary habits and lower body mass index.Our aim was to address the health economic outcomes by assessing the health system cost and health utility impacts of the intervention.A cost-consequences analysis was performed using data from a two-group randomised controlled intervention trial (n = 410).Outcomes included health-related quality of life (HRQoL), health utility and health system costs.At 12 months, clinically meaningful improvements were found for SF-6D over time but no significant differences were found between groups (P = 0.95).The cost of delivering the 6-month intervention was on average euro280 per person and made up 21% of overall healthcare costs for participants during the intervention period.Excluding intervention costs, costs were similar for health professional visits and medications across groups.Despite significant positive intervention effects on health behaviours, health utility and HRQoL scores were similar across groups.On the basis that intervention costs were small and physical activity, diet and weight management improved, on balance the intervention is potentially a worthwhile investment in healthcare funds.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ACTRN12608000399392.",0,0,0,0
22610153,"Extended benefit from sequential administration of docetaxel after standard fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide regimen for node-positive breast cancer: the 8-year follow-up results of the UNICANCER-PACS01 trial.PURPOSE: The initial report from the Programme Action Concertee Sein (PACS) PACS01 trial demonstrated a benefit at 5 years for disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) rates with the sequential administration of docetaxel after FEC100 (fluorouracil 500 mg/m(2), epirubicin 100 mg/m(2), and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m(2)) for patients with node-positive, operable breast cancer.We evaluate here the impact of this regimen at 8 years.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between June 1997 and March 2000, a total of 1,999 patients (age <65) with localized, resectable, non-pretreated, unilateral breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive either standard FEC100 for 6 cycles or 3 cycles of FEC100 followed by 3 cycles of 100 mg/m(2) docetaxel (FEC-D), both given every 21 days.Radiotherapy was mandatory after conservative surgery and tamoxifen was given for 5 years to hormone receptor (HR)-positive patients.Five-year DFS was the trial's main endpoint.Updated 8-year survival data are presented.RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 92.8 months, 639 patients experienced at least one event.A total number of 383 deaths were registered.Eight-year DFS rates were 65.8% with FEC alone and 70.2% with FEC-D. OS rates at 8 years were 78% with FEC alone and 83.2% with FEC-D. Cox regression analysis adjusted for age and number of positive nodes showed a 15% reduction in the relative risk of relapse and a 25% reduction in the relative risk of death in favor of FEC-D. Significant relative risk reductions were observed in the HR-positive, HER2-positive, and Ki67 >/=20% subpopulations.CONCLUSION: Benefits for DFS and OS rates with the sequential FEC-D regimen are fully confirmed at 8 years.",1,1,1,1
26474517,"Cediranib combined with carboplatin and paclitaxel in patients with metastatic or recurrent cervical cancer (CIRCCa): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial.BACKGROUND: Patients treated with standard chemotherapy for metastatic or relapsed cervical cancer respond poorly to conventional chemotherapy (response achieved in 20-30% of patients) with an overall survival of less than 1 year.High tumour angiogenesis and high concentrations of intratumoural VEGF are adverse prognostic features.Cediranib is a potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor of VEGFR1, 2, and 3.In this trial, we aimed to assess the effect of the addition of cediranib to carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy in patients with metastatic or recurrent cervical cancer.METHODS: In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial, which was done in 17 UK cancer treatment centres, patients aged 18 years or older initially diagnosed with metastatic carcinoma or who subsequently developed metastatic disease or local pelvic recurrence after radical treatment that was not amenable to exenterative surgery were recruited.Eligible patients received carboplatin AUC of 5 plus paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2) by infusion every 3 weeks for a maximum of six cycles and were randomised centrally (1:1) through a minimisation approach to receive cediranib 20 mg or placebo orally once daily until disease progression.The stratification factors were disease site, disease-free survival after primary therapy or primary stage IVb disease, number of lines of previous treatment, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, and investigational site.All patients, investigators, and trial personnel were masked to study drug allocation.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival.Efficacy analysis was by intention to treat, and the safety analysis included all patients who received at least one dose of study drug.This trial is registered with the ISCRTN registry, number ISRCTN23516549, and has been completed.FINDINGS: Between Aug 19, 2010, and July 27, 2012, 69 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to cediranib (n=34) or placebo (n=35).After a median follow-up of 24.2 months (IQR 21.9-29.5), progression-free survival was longer in the cediranib group (median 8.1 months [80% CI 7.4-8.8]) than in the placebo group (6.7 months [6.2-7.2]), with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.58 (80% CI 0.40-0.85; one-sided p=0.032).Grade 3 or worse adverse events that occurred in the concurrent chemotherapy and trial drug period in more than 10% of patients were diarrhoea (five [16%] of 32 patients in the cediranib group vs one [3%] of 35 patients in the placebo group), fatigue (four [13%] vs two [6%]), leucopenia (five [16%] vs three [9%]), neutropenia (10 [31%] vs four [11%]), and febrile neutropenia (five [16%] vs none).The incidence of grade 2-3 hypertension was higher in the cediranib group than in the control group (11 [34%] vs four [11%]).Serious adverse events occurred in 18 patients in the placebo group and 19 patients in the cediranib group.INTERPRETATION: Cediranib has significant efficacy when added to carboplatin and paclitaxel in the treatment of metastatic or recurrent cervical cancer.This finding was accompanied by an increase in toxic effects (mainly diarrhoea, hypertension, and febrile neutropenia).FUNDING: Cancer Research UK and AstraZeneca.",0,0,0,0
29864379,"Improvement in Overall Survival in a Randomized Study That Compared Dacomitinib With Gefitinib in Patients With Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer and EGFR-Activating Mutations.Purpose ARCHER 1050, a randomized, open-label, phase III study of dacomitinib versus gefitinib in treatment-naive patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and activating mutations in EGFR, reported significant improvement in progression-free survival with dacomitinib.The mature overall survival (OS) analysis for the intention-to-treat population is presented here.Patients and Methods In this multinational, multicenter study, patients age 18 years or older (>/= 20 years in Japan and Korea) who had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 and newly diagnosed NSCLC with activating mutations in EGFR (exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R) were enrolled and randomly assigned in a 1:1 manner to dacomitinib (n = 227) or gefitinib (n = 225).Random assignment was stratified by race (Japanese, Chinese, other East Asian, or non-Asian) and EGFR mutation type.The final OS analysis was conducted with a data cutoff date of February 17, 2017; at that time 220 deaths (48.7%) were observed.Results During a median follow-up time of 31.3 months, 103 (45.4%) and 117 (52.0%) deaths occurred in the dacomitinib and gefitinib arms, respectively.The estimated hazard ratio for OS was 0.760 (95% CI, 0.582 to 0.993; two-sided P = .044).The median OS was 34.1 months with dacomitinib versus 26.8 months with gefitinib.The OS probabilities at 30 months were 56.2% and 46.3% with dacomitinib and gefitinib, respectively.Preliminary subgroup analyses for OS that are based on baseline characteristics were consistent with the primary OS analysis.Conclusion In patients with advanced NSCLC and EGFR activating mutations, dacomitinib is the first second-generation epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) to show significant improvement in OS in a phase III randomized study compared with a standard-of-care TKI.Dacomitinib should be considered one of the standard treatment options for these patients.",1,1,1,1

23850170,"Which patients benefit most from primary surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy in stage IIIC or IV ovarian cancer? An exploratory analysis of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer 55971 randomised trial.BACKGROUND: To investigate whether biomarkers consisting of baseline characteristics of advanced stage ovarian cancer patients can help in identifying subgroups of patients who would benefit more from primary surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy.METHODS: We used data of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 55971 trial in which 670 patients were randomly assigned to primary surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy.The primary outcome was overall survival.Ten baseline clinical and pathological characteristics were selected as potential biomarkers.Using Subpopulation Treatment Effect Pattern Plots (STEPP), biomarkers with a statistically significant qualitative additive interaction with treatment were considered as potentially informative for treatment selection.We also combined selected biomarkers to form a multimarker treatment selection rule.FINDINGS: The size of the largest metastatic tumour and clinical stage were significantly associated with the magnitude of the benefit from treatment, in terms of five-year survival (p for interaction: 0.008 and 0.016, respectively).Stage IIIC patients with metastatic tumours 45 mm benefited more from primary surgery while stage IV patients with metastatic tumours >45 mm benefited more from neoadjuvant chemotherapy.In stage IIIC patients with larger metastatic tumours and in stage IV patients with less extensive metastatic tumours both treatments were equally effective.We estimated that by selecting treatments for patients based on largest metastatic tumour and clinical stage, the potential five-year survival rate in the population of treated patients would be 27.3% (95% confidence interval (CI) 21.9-33.0), 7.8% higher than if all were treated with primary surgery, and 5.6% higher if all were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.INTERPRETATION: Although survival was comparable after primary surgery and neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the overall group of patients with ovarian cancer in the EORTC 55971 trial, we found in this exploratory analysis that patients with stage IIIC and less extensive metastatic tumours had higher survival with primary surgery, while patients with stage IV disease and large metastatic tumours had higher survival with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.For patients who did not meet these criteria, both treatment options led to comparable survival rates.",1,1,1,1

24573743,"A phase II open-label randomized multicenter trial of TSU-68 in combination with S-1 and oxaliplatin versus S-1 in combination with oxaliplatin in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide.The combination of oxaliplatin-based treatments (oxaliplatin plus infusional 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin [FOLFOX] or oxaliplatin plus capecitabine [CapeOX]) and bevacizumab is a standard chemotherapy regimen for metastatic CRC (mCRC).However, several clinical studies that tested S-1 plus oxaliplatin (SOX) indicate that SOX is also a treatment option for mCRC.TSU-68 is an oral compound that inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptor and platelet-derived growth factor receptor.The recommended dose of TSU-68 + SOX was previously determined in a phase I study of mCRC patients.The goal of this trial was to evaluate the efficacy of TSU-68 in combination with SOX.METHODS: This open-label multicenter randomized phase II trial was performed in Korea.Treatment-naive mCRC patients with a performance status of 0 or 1 were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either TSU-68 + SOX or SOX alone.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS).RESULTS: A total of 105 patients (TSU-68 + SOX, 52 patients; SOX alone, 53 patients) were randomized.The median PFS was 7.0 months in the TSU-68 + SOX group (hazard ratio [HR], 1.057) and 7.2 months in the SOX group (p = 0.8401).The most frequent grade 3 and 4 adverse events were thrombocytopenia (9.6 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 26.4 % [SOX]), neutropenia (13.5 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 15.1 % [SOX]), and anemia (3.8 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 13.2 % [SOX]).We observed a difference between the 2 groups for all grades of anemia (15.4 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 32.1 % [SOX]), diarrhea (30.8 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 47.2 % [SOX]), vomiting (50.0 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 26.4 % [SOX]), and chromaturia (23.1 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 0.0 % [SOX]).Analysis using a Cox proportional hazard model showed that baseline interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels were associated with a survival benefit of TSU-68 (p = 0.012).CONCLUSION: TSU-68 + SOX had a favorable safety profile.However, TSU-68 did not have a synergistic effect on the efficacy of SOX.The baseline serum IL-6 level could be a prognostic factor for TSU-68 efficacy.",1,1,1,1

30866887,"Improving cancer symptom awareness and help-seeking among adults living in socioeconomically deprived communities in the UK using a facilitated health check: A protocol for the Awareness and Beliefs About Cancer (ABACus) Randomised Control Trial.BACKGROUND: Cancer survival is lower in socioeconomically deprived communities, partly due to low awareness of symptoms, negative beliefs and delayed help-seeking.We developed an interactive health check questionnaire facilitated by trained lay advisors.It entails 29 questions about background, lifestyle and health with tailored behaviour change advice.Personalised results are printed using a traffic light (red/amber/green) system, highlighting areas where action should be taken.This is an individually randomised control trial to test effectiveness of the health check on symptom recognition.METHODS: A total 246 participants aged 40+ years will be recruited from community and healthcare settings in socioeconomically deprived areas of Yorkshire and South Wales.Participants will be randomised to receive the health check or standard care (1:1 ratio).Outcome measures include: adapted Awareness and Beliefs about Cancer (primary outcome), brief State Trait Anxiety Inventory, intentions and motivation to adopt recommended health behaviours (early symptom presentation, cancer screening and lifestyle behaviours), adapted Client Service Receipt Inventory, brief medical history/screening and demographic questionnaire at: baseline; 2-weeks; and 6-months post-randomisation.A purposive sample of intervention sessions will be audio-recorded (n = 24) and half will additionally be observed (n = 12).Semi-structured interviews will take place at 2-weeks (n = 30) and 6-months (n = 15-20) post-randomisation.The primary analysis will compare cancer symptom recognition scores between arms at 2-weeks.Secondary analysis will assess cancer beliefs, barriers/time to presentation, screening and lifestyle behaviours, anxiety and costs.A process evaluation will assess intervention fidelity, dose and contamination.The London-Surrey NHS Research Ethics Committee (Ref: 17/LO/1507) approved this trial.DISCUSSION: This is a trial of a theoretically underpinned complex intervention which has undergone phase 1 and 2 development work.The findings will evaluate evidence about the effect of the health check on symptom awareness.Although there are few exclusion criteria there are limitations regarding the population we are able to reach, who may have even higher risks of late diagnosis and poor cancer prognosis.However, the health check has the potential to improve cancer symptom awareness and encourage early help-seeking behaviour in deprived populations, thereby reducing inequalities in longer term cancer outcomes.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Retrospectively registered with ISRCTN (Ref: ISRCTN16872545 ) on 12.01.2018.",0,0,0,0
30089078,"Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy Followed by Surgery Versus Surgery Alone for Locally Advanced Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Esophagus (NEOCRTEC5010): A Phase III Multicenter, Randomized, Open-Label Clinical Trial.Purpose The efficacy of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NCRT) plus surgery for locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remains controversial.In this trial, we compared the survival and safety of NCRT plus surgery with surgery alone in patients with locally advanced ESCC.Patients and Methods From June 2007 to December 2014, 451 patients with potentially resectable thoracic ESCC, clinically staged as T1-4N1M0/T4N0M0, were randomly allocated to NCRT plus surgery (group CRT; n = 224) and surgery alone (group S; n = 227).In group CRT, patients received vinorelbine 25 mg/m(2) intravenously (IV) on days 1 and 8 and cisplatin 75 mg/m(2) IV day 1, or 25 mg/m(2) IV on days 1 to 4 every 3 weeks for two cycles, with a total concurrent radiation dose of 40.0 Gy administered in 20 fractions of 2.0 Gy on 5 days per week.In both groups, patients underwent McKeown or Ivor Lewis esophagectomy.The primary end point was overall survival.Results The pathologic complete response rate was 43.2% in group CRT.Compared with group S, group CRT had a higher R0 resection rate (98.4% v 91.2%; P = .002), a better median overall survival (100.1 months v 66.5 months; hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.96; P = .025), and a prolonged disease-free survival (100.1 months v 41.7 months; hazard ratio, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.78; P < .001).Leukopenia (48.9%) and neutropenia (45.7%) were the most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events during chemoradiotherapy.Incidences of postoperative complications were similar between groups, with the exception of arrhythmia (group CRT: 13% v group S: 4.0%; P = .001).Peritreatment mortality was 2.2% in group CRT versus 0.4% in group S ( P = .212).Conclusion This trial shows that NCRT plus surgery improves survival over surgery alone among patients with locally advanced ESCC, with acceptable and manageable adverse events.",1,1,1,0
27795558,"Expression of CD33 is a predictive factor for effect of gemtuzumab ozogamicin at different doses in adult acute myeloid leukaemia.It remains unclear in adult acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) whether leukaemic expression of CD33, the target antigen for gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO), adds prognostic information on GO effectiveness at different doses.CD33 expression quantified in 1583 patients recruited to UK-NCRI-AML17 (younger adults) and UK-NCRI-AML16 (older adults) trials was correlated with clinical outcomes and benefit from GO including a dose randomisation.CD33 expression associated with genetic subgroups, including lower levels in both adverse karyotype and core-binding factor (CBF)-AML, but was not independently prognostic.When comparing GO versus no GO (n=393, CBF-AMLs excluded) by stratified subgroup-adjusted analysis, patients with lowest quartile (Q1) %CD33-positivity had no benefit from GO (relapse risk, HR 2.41 (1.27-4.56), P=0.009 for trend; overall survival, HR 1.52 (0.92-2.52)).However, from the dose randomisation (NCRI-AML17, n=464, CBF-AMLs included), 6 mg/m(2) GO only had a relapse benefit without increased early mortality in CD33-low (Q1) patients (relapse risk HR 0.64 (0.36-1.12) versus 1.70 (0.99-2.92) for CD33-high, P=0.007 for trend).Thus CD33 expression is a predictive factor for GO effect in adult AML; although GO does not appear to benefit the non-CBF AML patients with lowest CD33 expression a higher GO dose may be more effective for CD33-low but not CD33-high younger adults.",0,0,0,0

24560287,"A comparison of two methods for estimating DCE-MRI parameters via individual and cohort based AIFs in prostate cancer: a step towards practical implementation.Multi-parametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging, and specifically Dynamic Contrast Enhanced (DCE) MRI, play increasingly important roles in detection and staging of prostate cancer (PCa).One of the actively investigated approaches to DCE MRI analysis involves pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling to extract quantitative parameters that may be related to microvascular properties of the tissue.It is well-known that the prescribed arterial blood plasma concentration (or Arterial Input Function, AIF) input can have significant effects on the parameters estimated by PK modeling.The purpose of our study was to investigate such effects in DCE MRI data acquired in a typical clinical PCa setting.First, we investigated how the choice of a semi-automated or fully automated image-based individualized AIF (iAIF) estimation method affects the PK parameter values; and second, we examined the use of method-specific averaged AIF (cohort-based, or cAIF) as a means to attenuate the differences between the two AIF estimation methods.Two methods for automated image-based estimation of individualized (patient-specific) AIFs, one of which was previously validated for brain and the other for breast MRI, were compared.cAIFs were constructed by averaging the iAIF curves over the individual patients for each of the two methods.Pharmacokinetic analysis using the Generalized kinetic model and each of the four AIF choices (iAIF and cAIF for each of the two image-based AIF estimation approaches) was applied to derive the volume transfer rate (K(trans)) and extravascular extracellular volume fraction (ve) in the areas of prostate tumor.Differences between the parameters obtained using iAIF and cAIF for a given method (intra-method comparison) as well as inter-method differences were quantified.The study utilized DCE MRI data collected in 17 patients with histologically confirmed PCa.Comparison at the level of the tumor region of interest (ROI) showed that the two automated methods resulted in significantly different (p<0.05) mean estimates of ve, but not of K(trans).Comparing cAIF, different estimates for both ve, and K(trans) were obtained.Intra-method comparison between the iAIF- and cAIF-driven analyses showed the lack of effect on ve, while K(trans) values were significantly different for one of the methods.Our results indicate that the choice of the algorithm used for automated image-based AIF determination can lead to significant differences in the values of the estimated PK parameters.K(trans)estimates are more sensitive to the choice between cAIF/iAIF as compared to ve, leading to potentially significant differences depending on the AIF method.These observations may have practical consequences in evaluating the PK analysis results obtained in a multi-site setting.",0,0,0,0
30866088,"Effects of empagliflozin on metabolic parameters in polycystic ovary syndrome: A randomized controlled study.BACKGROUND: Empagliflozin is a sodium-glucose-cotransporter-2 inhibitor that improves cardiovascular risk and promotes weight loss in patients with type-2 diabetes.Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with obesity and increased cardiovascular risk; therefore, empagliflozin may be of benefit for these women.The aim of this study was to compare the effects of empagliflozin vs metformin on anthropometric and body composition, hormonal and metabolic parameters in women with PCOS.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A randomized open-label study was conducted in women with PCOS who were randomized to either empagliflozin 25 mg (n = 19) or metformin 1500 mg (n = 20) daily for 12 weeks.The main outcomes assessed were changes in anthropometric and body composition, hormonal and metabolic parameters.RESULTS: Univariate analysis showed significant differences in weight (empagliflozin: -1.4 +/- 3.2% vs metformin: 1.2 +/- 2.3%; P = 0.006), body mass index (empagliflozin: -1.4 +/- 3.2% vs metformin: 1.1 +/- 2.2%; P = 0.006), waist circumference (empagliflozin: -1.6 +/- 2.8% vs metformin: 0.2 +/- 2.1%; P = 0.029) and hip circumference (empagliflozin: -2.0 +/- 3.0% vs metformin: 1.1 +/- 1.9%; P = 0.001), basal metabolic rate (empagliflozin: -1.8 +/- 2.9% vs metformin: 0.1 +/- 1.9%, P = 0.024) and fat mass (empagliflozin: -0.7 +/- 4.9% vs metformin, 3.2 +/- 5.0%; P = 0.023) between the empagliflozin and the metformin groups.These differences were confirmed in linear regression analysis after adjustment for relevant covariates.There were no significant changes in hormonal or metabolic parameters between both groups.CONCLUSION: There was a significant improvement in anthropometric parameters and body composition, in overweight and obese women with PCOS after 12 weeks of treatment with empagliflozin compared to metformin, although no changes were seen in hormonal or metabolic parameters.",0,0,0,0

30596812,"Weekly paclitaxel, carboplatin, cetuximab, and cetuximab, docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil, followed by local therapy in previously untreated, locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.BACKGROUND: The survival advantage of induction chemotherapy (IC) followed by locoregional treatment is controversial in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (LAHNSCC).We previously showed feasibility and safety of cetuximab-based IC (paclitaxel/carboplatin/cetuximab-PCC, and docetaxel/cisplatin/5-fluorouracil/cetuximab-C-TPF) followed by local therapy in LAHNSCC.The primary end point of this phase II clinical trial with randomization to PCC and C-TPF followed by combined local therapy in patients with LAHNSCC stratified by human papillomavirus (HPV) status and T-stage was 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) compared with historical control.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients were >/=18 years with squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx, oral cavity, nasopharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx with measurable stage IV (T0-4N2b-2c/3M0) and known HPV by p16 status.Stratification was by HPV and T-stage into one of the two risk groups: (i) low-risk: HPV-positive and T0-3 or HPV-negative and T0-2; (ii) intermediate/high-risk: HPV-positive and T4 or HPV-negative and T3-4.Patient reported outcomes were carried out.RESULTS: A total of 136 patients were randomized in the study, 68 to each arm.With a median follow up of 3.2 years, the 2-year PFS in the PCC arm was 89% in the overall, 96% in the low-risk and 67% in the intermediate/high-risk groups; in the C-TPF arm 2-year PFS was 88% in the overall, 88% in the low-risk and 89% in the intermediate/high-risk groups.CONCLUSION: The observed 2-year PFS of PCC in the low-risk group and of C-TPF in the intermediate/high-risk group showed a 20% improvement compared with the historical control derived from RTOG-0129, therefore reaching the primary end point of the trial.",1,1,1,1
26442791,"Shared Medical Decision Making in Lung Cancer Screening: Experienced versus Descriptive Risk Formats.BACKGROUND: Annual lung cancer screening using low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) scans is associated with a survival benefit, but it is also associated with potential harm.Unlike descriptive probability formats, experienced tasks have been shown to decrease perceptions of rare events.The objective of this study was to compare descriptive versus experienced probability formats on patients' knowledge, beliefs, endorsement of screening for heavy smokers, and preference (choice predisposition) to undergo screening.METHODS: A total of 276 patients attending an outpatient pulmonary practice were randomized to learn about screening using 1 of 3 formats: numbers only, numbers + icon arrays, numbers + a set of slides illustrating LDCT scans of 250 people in random order that displayed the number of normal scans, false-positive lung nodules, cancers found leading to a life saved, and cancers found leading to death despite treatment.RESULTS: Knowledge differed between the 3 formats (P= 0.001), with participants randomized to the numbers + icon array format having the highest knowledge score.Beliefs were more favorable among participants randomized to the numbers + experienced format compared with the numbers + icon array format (difference between means [95% confidence interval]= 1.6 [0.4-2.8]).Differences in participants' endorsement of screening (P= 0.4) and choice predisposition (P= 0.6) across probability format mirrored those of beliefs but were not statistically significant.DISCUSSION: Contrary to what we expected, the experienced format increased propensity toward screening compared with the numbers + icon array format, as indicated by more favorable beliefs and nonsignificant trends toward stronger choice predisposition and endorsement.Experienced risk formats may not be a practical approach to improve risk communication for patients deciding whether or not to undergo annual lung cancer screening.",0,0,0,0

PN was one of the symptoms assessed in a QOL substudy.Statistical methods included simple and mixed ordinal logistic regression and general linear models.All statistical tests were two-sided.Results: Of 1512 patients, 41.9% reported PN two years after treatment initiation.Treatment with AT and ACT was associated with less severe long-term PN compared with AC-->T (odds ratio [OR] = 0.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.35 to 0.58; OR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.46 to 0.75).Preexisting PN, older age, obesity, mastectomy, and greater number of positive nodes were also associated with higher risk of long-term PN.Patients who reported worse PN symptoms at 24 months had statistically significantly worse QOL (Ptrend < .001).Conclusions: The administration of docetaxel is associated with long-term PN.The lower rate of long-term PN in AT and ACT patients might be an important consideration in supporting choosing these therapies for individuals with preexisting neuropathic symptoms or other risk factors for neuropathy.",0,0,0,0

25704725,"Lottery ticket was more effective than a prize draw in increasing questionnaire response among cancer survivors.OBJECTIVES: Compare the effect of financial incentives on response to a cancer survivors' postal questionnaire.STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Prostate cancer survivors in Ireland, 1.5-18 years after diagnosis, were randomized to the (1) ""lottery"" arm [a euro 1 lottery scratch card sent with the questionnaire (n = 2,413)] or (2) ""prize"" arm [entry into a draw on return of a completed questionnaire (n = 2,407)].Impact of interventions on response overall and by survival period (""short term"": < 5 years after diagnosis; ""long term"": >/= 5 years after diagnosis) was compared as was cost-effectiveness.RESULTS: Adjusted response rate was 54.4%.Response was higher among younger men (P < 0.001) and those with earlier stage disease (P = 0.002).A modest 2.6% higher response rate was observed in the lottery compared with the prize arm [multivariate relative risk (RR) = 1.06; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.00, 1.11].When stratified by survival period, higher response in the lottery arm was only observed among long-term survivors (multivariate RR = 1.10; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.19; short-term survivors: RR = 1.01; 95% CI: 0.94, 1.09).Costs per completed questionnaire were euro 4.54 and euro 3.57 for the lottery and prize arms, respectively.Compared with the prize arm, cost per additional questionnaire returned in the lottery arm was euro 25.65.CONCLUSION: Although more expensive, to optimize response to postal questionnaires among cancer survivors, researchers might consider inclusion of a lottery scratch card.",1,1,0,0
22887343,"Phase 3 clinical trial investigating the effect of selenium supplementation in men at high-risk for prostate cancer.PURPOSE: This study was conducted to investigate the effect of Se supplementation on prostate cancer incidence in men at high risk for prostate cancer.METHODS: A Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted in 699 men at high risk for prostate cancer (prostate specific antigen (PSA) >4 ng/ml and/or suspicious digital rectal examination and/or PSA velocity >0.75 ng/ml/year), but with a negative prostate biopsy.Participants were randomized to receive daily oral placebo (N = 232), 200 microg selenium (N = 234), or 400 microg selenium (N = 233) as selenized yeast.They were followed every 6 months for up to 5 years.The time to diagnosis of prostate cancer was compared between treatment groups using the Cox proportional hazards model.RESULT: Compared to placebo, the hazard ratios [95% confidence intervals] for risk of developing prostate cancer in the selenium 200 microg/day or the selenium 400 microg/day group were 0.94 [0.52, 1.7] and 0.90 [0.48, 1.7], respectively.PSA velocity in the selenium arms was not significantly different from that observed in the placebo group (P = 0.18 and P = 0.17, respectively).CONCLUSION: Selenium supplementation appeared to have no effect on the incidence of prostate cancer in men at high risk.In conjunction with results of other studies, these data indicate that selenium supplementation may not have a role in prostate cancer chemoprevention.",0,0,0,0
29768118,"Final Overall Survival Analysis From a Study Comparing First-Line Crizotinib Versus Chemotherapy in ALK-Mutation-Positive Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.Purpose The phase III PROFILE 1014 trial compared crizotinib with chemotherapy as first-line treatment in patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) -positive advanced nonsquamous non-small-cell lung cancer.Here, we report the final overall survival (OS) results.Patients and Methods Patients were randomly assigned to receive oral crizotinib 250 mg twice daily (n = 172) or intravenous pemetrexed 500 mg/m(2) plus cisplatin 75 mg/m(2) or carboplatin (area under the concentration-time curve of 5 to 6 mg.mL/min) every 3 weeks for a maximum of six cycles (n = 171).Crossover to crizotinib was permitted after disease progression.OS was analyzed using a stratified log-rank test and a prespecified rank-preserving structural failure time model to account for crossover.Results Median follow-up duration for OS was approximately 46 months for both arms.In the chemotherapy arm, 144 patients (84.2%) received crizotinib in subsequent lines.Hazard ratio for OS was 0.760 (95% CI, 0.548 to 1.053; two-sided P = .0978).Median OS was not reached (NR) with crizotinib (95% CI, 45.8 months to NR) and 47.5 months with chemotherapy (95% CI, 32.2 months to NR).Survival probability at 4 years was 56.6% (95% CI, 48.3% to 64.1%) with crizotinib and 49.1% (95% CI, 40.5% to 57.1%) with chemotherapy.After crossover adjustment, there was an improvement in OS that favored crizotinib (hazard ratio, 0.346; 95% bootstrap CI, 0.081 to 0.718).The longest OS was observed in crizotinib-treated patients who received a subsequent ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor.No new safety signals were identified.Conclusion The final analysis of the PROFILE 1014 study provides a new benchmark for OS in patients with ALK-rearranged non-small-cell lung cancer and highlights the benefit of crizotinib for prolonging survival in this patient population.",1,1,1,1
31526892,"Impact of choice of volumetry software and nodule management guidelines on recall rates in lung cancer screening.PURPOSE: Appropriate lung nodule management is essential to minimizing unnecessary patient recall in lung cancer screening.Two European guidelines provide differing recommendations in that participants with nodules >/=100 mm(3) or >/=80 mm(3) respectively should be recalled, at baseline.Nodule size estimation is known to vary between volumetry software packages (VSPs).The aim of this study was to examine the impact of choice of VSP on participant recall rates, when applying different European nodule management guidelines.An additional aim was to compare recall rates between 7 VSPs and manual diameter measurements.METHODS: 156 small-sized lung nodules (50-150 mm(3)) from the UK Lung Screening trial were measured using 7 different VSPs (VSP1-7) and also using manual diameter.The type of VSP used in the NELSON study (VSP1), on which European nodule management guidelines are based, provided the reference standard.Nodule size was compared using Bland Altman, and recall rates by Mcnemar's test.RESULTS: Compared to the reference standard, a 100 mm(3) threshold for recall, resulted in no difference in recall rates only for VSP 5 & 7.Using an 80mm(3) threshold resulted in no difference in recall rates for VSP2 & 6.Recall rates were significantly higher for VSP 4 regardless of threshold and when using manual diameter measurements.CONCLUSIONS: Appropriate nodule size thresholds for recall in screening depend on the type of volumetry software used.The results highlight the importance of benchmarking of volumetry packages.",0,0,0,0

31676670,"Safety and Efficacy of Durvalumab and Tremelimumab Alone or in Combination in Patients with Advanced Gastric and Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma.PURPOSE: This randomized, multicenter, open-label, phase Ib/II study assessed durvalumab and tremelimumab in combination or as monotherapy for chemotherapy-refractory gastric cancer or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Second-line patients were randomized 2:2:1 to receive durvalumab plus tremelimumab (arm A), or durvalumab (arm B) or tremelimumab monotherapy (arm C), and third-line patients received durvalumab plus tremelimumab (arm D).A tumor-based IFNgamma gene signature was prospectively evaluated as a potential predictive biomarker in second- and third-line patients receiving the combination (arm E).The coprimary endpoints were objective response rate and progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 6 months.RESULTS: A total of 113 patients were treated: 6 in phase Ib and 107 (arm A, 27; arm B, 24; arm C, 12; arm D, 25; arm E, 19) in phase II.Overall response rates were 7.4%, 0%, 8.3%, 4.0%, and 15.8% in the five arms, respectively.PFS rates at 6 months were 6.1%, 0%, 20%, 15%, and 0%, and 12-month overall survival rates were 37.0%, 4.6%, 22.9%, 38.8%, and NA, respectively.Treatment-related grade 3/4 adverse events were reported in 17%, 4%, 42%, 16%, and 11% of patients, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Response rates were low regardless of monotherapy or combination strategies.No new safety signals were identified.Including use of a tumor-based IFNgamma signature and change in baseline and on-treatment circulating tumor DNA are clinically feasible and may be novel strategies to improve treatment response in this difficult-to-treat population.",1,1,1,1
31680625,"Examining key sociodemographic characteristics of adolescents and young adults with cancer: A post hoc analysis of the Promoting Resilience in Stress Management randomized clinical trial.BACKGROUND: The ""Promoting Resilience in Stress Management"" intervention is a skills-based, early palliative care intervention with demonstrated efficacy in adolescents and young adults with cancer.AIM: Utilizing data from a randomized clinical trial of Promoting Resilience in Stress Management versus Usual Care, we examined whether response to Promoting Resilience in Stress Management differed across key sociodemographic characteristics.DESIGN: Adolescents and young adults with cancer completed patient-reported outcome measures of resilience, hope, benefit-finding, quality of life, and distress at enrollment and 6 months.Participants were stratified by sex, age, race, and neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage based on home address (Area Deprivation Index scores with 8-10 = most disadvantaged).Differences in the magnitude of effect sizes between stratification subgroups were noted using a conservative cutoff of d > 0.5.SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 12 to 25 years old, English-speaking, and receiving cancer care at Seattle Children's Hospital.RESULTS: In total, 92 adolescents and young adults (48 Promoting Resilience in Stress Management, 44 Usual Care) completed baseline measures.They were 43% female, 73% 12 to 17 years old, 64% White, and 24% most disadvantaged.Effect sizes stratified by sex, age, and race were in an expected positive direction and of similar magnitude for the majority of outcomes with some exceptions in magnitude of treatment effect.Those who lived in less disadvantaged neighborhoods benefited more from Promoting Resilience in Stress Management, and those living in most disadvantaged neighborhoods benefited less.CONCLUSION: The ""Promoting Resilience in Stress Management"" intervention demonstrated a positive effect for the majority of outcomes regardless of sex, age, and race.It may not be as helpful for adolescents and young adults living in disadvantaged neighborhoods.Future studies must confirm its generalizability and integrate opportunities for improvement by targeting individual needs.",0,0,0,0
25990554,"The impact of DNA input amount and DNA source on the performance of whole-exome sequencing in cancer epidemiology.BACKGROUND: Whole-exome sequencing (WES) has recently emerged as an appealing approach to systematically study coding variants.However, the requirement for a large amount of high-quality DNA poses a barrier that may limit its application in large cancer epidemiologic studies.We evaluated the performance of WES with low input amount and saliva DNA as an alternative source material.METHODS: Five breast cancer patients were randomly selected from the Pathways Study.From each patient, four samples, including 3 mug, 1 mug, and 0.2 mug blood DNA and 1 mug saliva DNA, were aliquoted for library preparation using the Agilent SureSelect Kit and sequencing using Illumina HiSeq2500.Quality metrics of sequencing and variant calling, as well as concordance of variant calls from the whole exome and 21 known breast cancer genes, were assessed by input amount and DNA source.RESULTS: There was little difference by input amount or DNA source on the quality of sequencing and variant calling.The concordance rate was about 98% for single-nucleotide variant calls and 83% to 86% for short insertion/deletion calls.For the 21 known breast cancer genes, WES based on low input amount and saliva DNA identified the same set variants in samples from a same patient.CONCLUSIONS: Low DNA input amount, as well as saliva DNA, can be used to generate WES data of satisfactory quality.IMPACT: Our findings support the expansion of WES applications in cancer epidemiologic studies where only low DNA amount or saliva samples are available.",0,0,0,0

Patients received 7 treatment cycles in median (1-35) with a median treatment duration of 4.7 months (141 days, 8-765).PFS rate at 6 months was 54% in patients treated with cisplatin/gemcitabine and panitumumab but was 73% in patients treated with cisplatin/gemcitabine without antibody, respectively.Secondary end-points were an ORR of 45% in treatment arm A compared with 39% receiving treatment B and a median OS of 12.8 months (arm A) and of 20.1 months (arm B), respectively.In contrast to the p53-status, genetic alterations in IDH1/2 were linked to a high response after chemotherapy and prolonged survival.In accordance with our results, the meta-analysis of 12 trials did not reveal a survival advantage for patients treated with EGFR antibodies compared with chemotherapy alone.CONCLUSIONS: Panitumumab in combination with chemotherapy does not improve ORR, PFS and OS in patients with KRAS wild-type, advanced biliary cancer.Genetic profiling should be included in CCA trials to identify and validate predictive and prognostic biomarkers.CLINICAL TRIALS NUMBER: The trial was registered with NCT01320254.",1,1,1,1
30479292,"Assessing the Psychological Impact of Daily Bowel Preparation on Prostate Patients Who Receive Radiation Therapy.PURPOSE: Evidence has shown that the prostate moves depending on filling of the rectum and, to a lesser extent, the bladder; many radiation therapy departments have adopted standardized bladder filling/rectal emptying protocols for radiotherapy treatment.Daily treatments may be delayed until appropriate volumes are attained; the resultant psychological impact of these delays on patients is unknown.The purpose of this study was to determine levels of anxiety, depression, distress, and bother related to bowel preparation for prostate cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy treatment.METHODS: A prospective cohort analysis of prostate cancer patients undergoing external beam radiation therapy was completed.Patients were assigned to one of three groups; Group A was standard of care, Group B was standard of care plus increased educational information regarding bowel preparation, Group C was standard of care plus increased educational information regarding bowel preparation plus an anti-flatulent medication.Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Distress Thermometer, and a Bowel Status Bother survey were completed by participants at the start of theircourse of radiation treatment, mid-way through, and at the end.Analysis of variance testing was completed to determine differences in mean scores between the three groups.RESULTS: Mean age of patients (N = 30) was 66 years; 50% of the participants had a university education; 80% were married.Anxiety levels decreased over time in all groups (P = .039) with no difference between groups (P = 0.447).Depression levels across time for each group remained low (P = .577).Overall distress levels associated with bowel preparation were low among each group, and no significant differences were reported (P = .978).All groups reported high rates of quality of life.CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study indicate that collectively across three groups and over time, there were low levels of anxiety, depression, and distress from bowel preparation.Amount, timing, quality, and approach to educational information are important factors to ensure patients feel prepared for their radiation therapy treatments.",0,0,0,0
28961845,"Borealis-1: a randomized, first-line, placebo-controlled, phase II study evaluating apatorsen and chemotherapy for patients with advanced urothelial cancer.Background: Five-year survival of patients with inoperable, advanced urothelial carcinoma treated with the first-line chemotherapy is 5%-15%.We assessed whether the Hsp27 inhibitor apatorsen combined with gemcitabine plus cisplatin (GC) could improve overall survival (OS) in these patients.Patients and methods: This placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase II trial randomized 183 untreated urothelial carcinoma patients (North America and Europe) to receive GC plus either placebo (N = 62), 600 mg apatorsen (N = 60), or 1000 mg apatorsen (N = 61).In the experimental arm, treatment included loading doses of apatorsen followed by up to six cycles of apatorsen plus GC.Patients receiving at least four cycles could continue apatorsen monotherapy as maintenance until progression or unacceptable toxicity.The primary end point was OS.Results: OS was not significantly improved in the single or combined 600- or 1000-mg apatorsen arms versus placebo [hazard ratio (HR), 0.86 and 0.90, respectively].Exploratory study of specific statistical modeling showed a trend for improved survival in patients with baseline poor prognostic features treated with 600 mg apatorsen compared with placebo (HR = 0.72).Landmark analysis of serum Hsp27 (sHsp27) levels showed a trend toward survival benefit for poor-prognosis patients in 600- and 1000-mg apatorsen arms who achieved lower area under the curve sHsp27 levels, compared with the placebo arm (HR = 0.45 and 0.62, respectively).Higher baseline circulating tumor cells (>/=5 cells/7.5 ml) was observed in patients with poor prognosis in correlation with poor survival.Treatment-emergent adverse events were manageable and more common in both apatorsen-treatment arms.Conclusions: Even though apatorsen combined with standard chemotherapy did not demonstrate a survival benefit in the overall study population, patients with poor prognostic features might benefit from this combination.Serum Hsp27 levels may act as a biomarker to predict treatment outcome.Further exploration of apatorsen in poor-risk patients is warranted.",1,1,1,1

30303516,"NCI 8628: A randomized phase 2 study of ziv-aflibercept and high-dose interleukin 2 or high-dose interleukin 2 alone for inoperable stage III or IV melanoma.BACKGROUND: Interleukin 2 (IL-2) is a growth factor for T and natural killer cells, promotes proinflammatory cytokines, and can lead to durable responses in patients with melanoma.Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) promotes angiogenesis and modulates host innate and adaptive immunity.High VEGF levels were found to be associated with nonresponse to IL-2.Ziv-aflibercept may deplete VEGF and thereby enhance antitumor T-cell responses, thus supporting a combination immunotherapeutic strategy with IL-2.METHODS: NCI 8628 was a phase 2 trial of ziv-aflibercept and IL-2 (arm A) versus IL-2 alone (arm B) randomized at 2:1, respectively.Eligible patients had inoperable American Joint Committee on Cancer stage III or stage IV melanoma.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS).RESULTS: A total of 89 patients were enrolled and 84 patients were treated.The median follow-up was 41.4 months.Among treated patients (55 patients in arm A and 29 patients in arm B), PFS was significantly improved in favor of arm A, with a median of 6.9 months (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 4.1-8.7 months) versus 2.3 months (95% CI, 1.6-3.5 months) (P<.001).No significant difference was noted with regard to overall survival, with a median of 26.9 months (95% CI, 14.4-63.6 months) for arm A and 24.2 months (95% CI, 11.3-36.4 months) for arm B. The response rate (according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors [RECIST]) was 22% in arm A (4 complete responses [CRs] and 8 partial responses [PRs]) and 17% in arm B (1 CR and 4 PRs).Stable disease or PR or CR was noted in 65% of patients in arm A and 48% of patients in arm B. The combination was found to be superior to monotherapy in patients with high and low levels of serum VEGF and VEGF receptor 2.Adverse events were consistent with the expected profiles of monotherapy with IL-2 and ziv-aflibercept.CONCLUSIONS: Ziv-aflibercept and IL-2 were found to significantly improve PFS compared with IL-2 alone, thereby meeting the primary endpoint of the current study.These findings support further study of immunotherapeutic combination strategies involving VEGF inhibitors.",1,1,1,1

29034009,"A multicenter, randomized study of decitabine as epigenetic priming with induction chemotherapy in children with AML.BACKGROUND: Decitabine is a deoxycytidine nucleoside derivative inhibitor of DNA-methyltransferases, which has been studied extensively and is approved for myelodysplastic syndrome in adults but with less focus in children.Accordingly, we conducted a phase 1 multicenter, randomized, open-label study to evaluate decitabine pre-treatment before standard induction therapy in children with newly diagnosed AML to assess safety and tolerability and explore a number of biologic endpoints.RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were fully assessable for all study objectives per protocol (10 in Arm A = epigenetic priming induction, 14 in Arm B = standard induction).All patients experienced neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.The most common grade 3 and 4 non-hematologic adverse events observed were gastrointestinal toxicities and hypophosphatemia.Plasma decitabine PK were similar to previously reported adult data.Overall CR/CRi was similar for the two arms.MRD negativity at end-induction was 85% in Arm A versus 67% in Arm B patients.DNA methylation measured in peripheral blood over the course of treatment tracked with blast clearance and matched marrow aspirates at day 0 and day 21.Unlike end-induction marrow analyses, promoter methylation in blood identified an apparent reversal of response in the lone treatment failure, 1 week prior to the patient's marrow aspirate confirming non-response.Decitabine-induced effects on end-induction (day 35-43 following initiation of treatment) marrows in Arm A were reflected by changes in DNA methylation in matched paired marrow diagnostic aspirates.CONCLUSIONS: This first-in-pediatrics trial demonstrates that decitabine prior to standard combination chemotherapy is feasible and well tolerated in children with newly diagnosed AML.Pre-treatment with decitabine may represent a newer therapeutic option for pediatric AML, especially as it appears to induce important epigenetic alterations.The novel biological correlates studied in this trial offer a clinically relevant window into disease progression and remission.Additional studies are needed to definitively assess whether decitabine can enhance durability responses in children with AML.TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT01177540.",1,1,1,1

22498022,"A community-based randomized trial of a faith-placed intervention to reduce cervical cancer burden in Appalachia.OBJECTIVE: Faith Moves Mountains assessed the effectiveness of a faith-placed lay health advisor (LHA) intervention to increase Papanicolaou (Pap) test use among middle-aged and older women in a region disproportionately affected by cervical cancer and low screening rates (regionally, only 68% screened in prior 3 years).METHOD: This community-based RCT was conducted in four Appalachian Kentucky counties (December 2005-June 2008).Women aged 40-64 and overdue for screening were recruited from churches and individually randomized to treatment (n=176) or wait-list control (n=169).The intervention provided LHA home visits and newsletters addressing barriers to screening.Self-reported Pap test receipt was the primary outcome.RESULTS: Intention-to-treat analyses revealed that treatment group participants (17.6% screened) had over twice the odds of wait-list controls (11.2% screened) of reporting Pap test receipt post-intervention, OR=2.56, 95% CI: 1.03-6.38, p=0.04.Independent of group, recently screened participants (last Pap >1 but <5 years ago) had significantly higher odds of obtaining screening during the study than rarely or never screened participants (last Pap >/=5 years ago), OR=2.50, 95% CI: 1.48-4.25, p=0.001.CONCLUSIONS: The intervention was associated with increased cervical cancer screening.The faith-placed LHA addressing barriers comprises a novel approach to reducing cervical cancer disparities among Appalachian women.",0,0,0,0
29648580,"Bevacizumab plus hypofractionated radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone in elderly patients with glioblastoma: the randomized, open-label, phase II ARTE trial.Background: The addition of bevacizumab to temozolomide-based chemoradiotherapy (TMZ/RT --> TMZ) did not prolong overall survival (OS) in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma in phase III trials.Elderly and frail patients are underrepresented in clinical trials, but early reports suggested preferential benefit in this population.Patients and methods: ARTE was a 2 : 1 randomized, multi-center, open-label, non-comparative phase II trial of hypofractionated RT (40 Gy in 15 fractions) with bevacizumab (10 mg/kgx14 days) (arm A, N = 50) or without bevacizumab (arm B, N = 25) in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma aged >/=65 years.The primary objective was to obtain evidence for prolongation of median OS by the addition of bevacizumab to RT.Response was assessed by RANO criteria.Quality of life (QoL) was monitored by the EORTC QLQ-C30/BN20 modules.Exploratory studies included molecular subtyping by 450k whole methylome and gene expression analyses.Results: Median PFS was longer in arm A than in arm B (7.6 and 4.8 months, P = 0.003), but OS was similar (12.1 and 12.2 months, P = 0.77).Clinical deterioration was delayed and more patients came off steroids in arm A. Prolonged PFS in arm A was confined to tumors with the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) I methylation subtype (HR 0.25, P = 0.014) and proneural gene expression (HR 0.29, P = 0.025).In a Cox model of OS controlling for established prognostic factors, associations with more favorable outcome were identified for age <70 years (HR 0.52, P = 0.018) and Karnofsky performance score 90%-100% (HR 0.51, P = 0.026).Including molecular subtypes into that model identified an association of the RTK II gene methylation subtype with inferior OS (HR 1.73, P = 0.076).Conclusion: Efficacy outcomes and exploratory analyses of ARTE do not support the hypothesis that the addition of bevacizumab to RT generally prolongs survival in elderly glioblastoma patients.Molecular biomarkers may identify patients with preferential benefit from bevacizumab.Clinical trial registration number: NCT01443676.",1,1,1,1

29573941,"Encorafenib plus binimetinib versus vemurafenib or encorafenib in patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma (COLUMBUS): a multicentre, open-label, randomised phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Combined BRAF-MEK inhibitor therapy is the standard of care for BRAF(V600)-mutant advanced melanoma.We investigated encorafenib, a BRAF inhibitor with unique target-binding properties, alone or in combination with the MEK inhibitor binimetinib, versus vemurafenib in patients with advanced BRAF(V600)-mutant melanoma.METHODS: COLUMBUS was conducted as a two-part, randomised, open-label phase 3 study at 162 hospitals in 28 countries.Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older and had histologically confirmed locally advanced (American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] stage IIIB, IIIC, or IV), unresectable or metastatic cutaneous melanoma, or unknown primary melanoma; a BRAF(V600E) or BRAF(V600K) mutation; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1; and were treatment naive or had progressed on or after previous first-line immunotherapy.In part 1 of the study, patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) via interactive response technology to receive either oral encorafenib 450 mg once daily plus oral binimetinib 45 mg twice daily (encorafenib plus binimetinib group), oral encorafenib 300 mg once daily (encorafenib group), or oral vemurafenib 960 mg twice daily (vemurafenib group).The primary endpoint was progression-free survival by blinded independent central review for encorafenib plus binimetinib versus vemurafenib.Efficacy analyses were by intention-to-treat.Safety was analysed in patients who received at least one dose of study drug and one postbaseline safety assessment.The results of part 2 will be published separately.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01909453, and EudraCT, number 2013-001176-38.FINDINGS: Between Dec 30, 2013, and April 10, 2015, 577 of 1345 screened patients were randomly assigned to either the encorafenib plus binimetinib group (n=192), the encorafenib group (n=194), or the vemurafenib group (n=191).With a median follow-up of 16.6 months (95% CI 14.8-16.9), median progression-free survival was 14.9 months (95% CI 11.0-18.5) in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group and 7.3 months (5.6-8.2) in the vemurafenib group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.54, 95% CI 0.41-0.71; two-sided p<0.0001).The most common grade 3-4 adverse events seen in more than 5% of patients in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group were increased gamma-glutamyltransferase (18 [9%] of 192 patients), increased creatine phosphokinase (13 [7%]), and hypertension (11 [6%]); in the encorafenib group they were palmoplantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (26 [14%] of 192 patients), myalgia (19 [10%]), and arthralgia (18 [9%]); and in the vemurafenib group it was arthralgia (11 [6%] of 186 patients).There were no treatment-related deaths except for one death in the combination group, which was considered possibly related to treatment by the investigator.INTERPRETATION: Encorafenib plus binimetinib and encorafenib monotherapy showed favourable efficacy compared with vemurafenib.Overall, encorafenib plus binimetinib appears to have an improved tolerability profile compared with encorafenib or vemurafenib.Encorafenib plus binimetinib could represent a new treatment option for patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma.FUNDING: Array BioPharma, Novartis.",1,1,1,1
28049139,"A randomized phase 2 study of MK-2206 versus everolimus in refractory renal cell carcinoma.Background: Activation of the phosphoinisitide-3 kinase (PI3K) pathway through mutation and constitutive upregulation has been described in renal cell carcinoma (RCC), making it an attractive target for therapeutic intervention.We performed a randomized phase II study in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy refractory patients to determine whether MK-2206, an allosteric inhibitor of AKT, was more efficacious than the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor everolimus.Patients and methods: A total of 43 patients were randomized in a 2:1 distribution, with 29 patients assigned to the MK-2206 arm and 14 to the everolimus arm.Progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary endpoint.Results: The trial was closed at the first futility analysis with an observed PFS of 3.68 months in the MK-2206 arm and 5.98 months in the everolimus arm.Dichotomous response rate profiles were seen in the MK-2206 arm with one complete response and three partial responses in the MK-2206 arm versus none in the everolimus arm.On the other hand, progressive disease was best response in 44.8% of MK2206 versus 14.3% of everolimus-treated patients.MK-2206 induced significantly more rash and pruritis than everolimus, and dose reduction occurred in 37.9% of MK-2206 versus 21.4% of everolimus-treated patients.Genomic analysis revealed that 57.1% of the patients in the PD group had either deleterious TP53 mutations or ATM mutations or deletions.In contrast, none of the patients in the non-PD group had TP53 or ATM defects.No predictive marker for response was observed in this small dataset.Conclusions: Dichotomous outcomes are observed when VEGF therapy refractory patients are treated with MK-2206, and MK-2206 does not demonstrate superiority to everolimus.Additionally, mutations in DNA repair genes are associated with early disease progression, indicating that dysregulation of DNA repair is associated with a more aggressive tumor phenotype in RCC.",1,1,1,1
22548907,"Improved surgical safety after laparoscopic compared to open surgery for apparent early stage endometrial cancer: results from a randomised controlled trial.AIM: To compare Total Laparoscopic Hysterectomy (TLH) and Total Abdominal Hysterectomy (TAH) with regard to surgical safety.METHODS: Between October 2005 and June 2010, 760 patients with apparent early stage endometrial cancer were enroled in a multicentre, randomised clinical trial (LACE) comparing outcomes following TLH or TAH.The main study end points for this analysis were surgical adverse events (AE), hospital length of stay, conversion from laparoscopy to laparotomy, including 753 patients who completed at least 6 weeks of follow-up.Postoperative AEs were graded according to Common Toxicity Criteria (V3), and those immediately life-threatening, requiring inpatient hospitalisation or prolonged hospitalisation, or resulting in persistent or significant disability/incapacity were regarded as serious AEs.RESULTS: The incidence of intra-operative AEs was comparable in either group.The incidence of post-operative AE CTC grade 3+ (18.6% in TAH, 12.9% in TLH, p 0.03) and serious AE (14.3% in TAH, 8.2% in TLH, p 0.007) was significantly higher in the TAH group compared to the TLH group.Mean operating time was 132 and 107 min, and median length of hospital stay was 2 and 5 days in the TLH and TAH group, respectively (p<0.0001).The decline of haemoglobin from baseline to day 1 postoperatively was 2g/L less in the TLH group (p 0.006).CONCLUSIONS: Compared to TAH, TLH is associated with a significantly decreased risk of major surgical AEs.A laparoscopic surgical approach to early stage endometrial cancer is safe.",0,0,0,0
27114605,"Response to Cetuximab With or Without Irinotecan in Patients With Refractory Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Harboring the KRAS G13D Mutation: Australasian Gastro-Intestinal Trials Group ICECREAM Study.PURPOSE: RAS mutations predict lack of response to epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody therapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), but preclinical studies and retrospective clinical data suggest that patients with tumors harboring the exon 2 KRAS G13D mutation may benefit from cetuximab.We aimed to assess cetuximab monotherapy and cetuximab plus irinotecan in patients with molecularly selected (G13D mutation) chemotherapy-refractory mCRC in a randomized phase II trial of this rare molecular subtype.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with chemotherapy-refractory KRAS G13D mutation-positive mCRC who had progressed within 6 months of irinotecan therapy were randomly assigned to cetuximab 400 mg/m(2) loading dose and then 250 mg/m(2) once per week with or without irinotecan 180 mg/m(2) once every 2 weeks.The primary end point was 6-month progression-free survival; secondary end points were response rate, overall survival, quality of life, and toxicity.RESULTS: Fifty-one of 53 patients recruited over 2 years were eligible.The 6-month progression-free survival rate was 10% (95% CI, 2% to 26%) for cetuximab versus 23% (95% CI, 9% to 40%) for cetuximab plus irinotecan with a hazard ratio of 0.74 (95% CI, 0.42 to 1.32).Response and stable disease rates were 0% and 58% for monotherapy versus 9% and 70% for combination treatment, respectively.Overall survival and quality of life were similar; toxicities were higher with combination therapy.CONCLUSION: In patients with G13D-mutated chemotherapy-refractory mCRC, there was no statistically significant improvement in disease control at 6 months with either cetuximab monotherapy or cetuximab plus irinotecan.No responses were seen with single-agent cetuximab.The responses observed with the combination of cetuximab and irinotecan may reflect true drug synergy or persistent irinotecan sensitivity.The ICECREAM (Irinotecan Cetuximab Evaluation and Cetuximab Response Evaluation Among Patients with a G13D Mutation) study demonstrates the need to prospectively evaluate hypotheses that were previously supported by retrospective analyses and exemplifies the value of international collaboration in trials of rare molecular subtypes.",1,1,1,1

23823157,"Transurethral surgery and twice-daily radiation plus paclitaxel-cisplatin or fluorouracil-cisplatin with selective bladder preservation and adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer (RTOG 0233): a randomised multicentre phase 2 trial.BACKGROUND: We assessed effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of paclitaxel or fluorouracil when added to radiation plus cisplatin followed by adjuvant chemotherapy in a programme of selected bladder preservation for patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer.METHODS: In our randomised phase 2 trial, we enrolled patients with T2-4a transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder at 24 medical centres in the USA.We randomly allocated patients to receive paclitaxel plus cisplatin (paclitaxel group) or fluorouracil plus cisplatin (fluorouracil group) with twice-daily radiation in random block sizes per site on the basis of clinical T-stage (T2 vs T3-4).Patients and physicians were aware of treatment assignment.All patients had transurethral resection of bladder tumour and twice-daily radiotherapy to 40.3 Gy, along with allocated chemotherapy, followed by cystoscopic and biopsy assessment of response.Patients who had a tumour response with downstaging to T0, Tcis, or Ta received consolidation chemoradiotherapy to 64.3 Gy, with the same chemotherapy regimen as in the induction phase.Patients received adjuvant cisplatin-gemcitabine-paclitaxel after the end of chemoradiotherapy.If, after induction, persistent disease was graded as T1 or worse, we recommended patients undergo cystectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy.We assessed the primary endpoints of rates of treatment completion and toxic effects in all randomly allocated patients.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00055601.FINDINGS: Between Dec 13, 2002, and Jan 11, 2008, we enrolled 97 patients, of whom 93 were eligible for analysis.Median follow-up was 5.0 years (IQR 5.0-6.2).Of 46 patients in the paclitaxel group, 45 (98%) completed induction (16 [35%] with grade 3-4 toxicity), 39 (85%) completed induction and consolidation (11 [24%] with grade 3-4 toxicity due to consolidation), and 31 (67%) completed the entire protocol with adjuvant chemotherapy.34 (85%) of 40 assessable patients in the paclitaxel group had grade 3-4 toxicity during adjuvant chemotherapy.Of 47 patients in the fluorouracil group, 45 (96%) completed induction (nine [19%] with grade 3-4 toxicity), 39 (83%) completed induction and consolidation (12 [26%] had grade 3-4 toxicity due to consolidation), and 25 (53%) completed the entire protocol with adjuvant chemotherapy.31 (76%) of 41 assessable patients in the fluorouracil group had grade 3-4 toxicity during adjuvant chemotherapy.Five (11%) patients treated with the paclitaxel regimen and three (6%) patients treated with the fluorouracil regimen developed late grade 3-4 radiotherapy toxicities.11 (24%) patients treated with the paclitaxel regimen and 16 (34%) patients treated with the fluorouracil regimen developed late grade 3-4 toxicities unrelated to radiotherapy.One patient (in the fluorouracil group) died during follow-up.Six (13%) patients in the paclitaxel group and in three (6%) patients in the fluorouracil group discontinued due to treatment-related toxicity.INTERPRETATION: In the absence of phase 3 data, our findings could inform selection of a bladder-sparing trimodality chemotherapy regimen for patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer.FUNDING: US National Cancer Institute.",0,0,0,0
23281805,"Randomized Phase II trial of paclitaxel and carboplatin followed by gemcitabine switch-maintenance therapy versus gemcitabine and carboplatin followed by gemcitabine continuation-maintenance therapy in previously untreated advanced non-small cell lung cancer.BACKGROUND: In recent years, maintenance chemotherapy is increasingly being recognized as a new treatment strategy to improve the outcome of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).However, the optimal maintenance strategy is still controversial.Gemcitabine is a promising candidate for single-agent maintenance therapy because of little toxicity and good tolerability.We have conducted a randomized phase II study to evaluate the validity of single-agent maintenance chemotherapy of gemcitabine and to compare continuation- and switch-maintenance.METHODS: Chemonaive patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC were randomly assigned 1:1 to either arm A or B. Patients received paclitaxel (200 mg/m2, day 1) plus carboplatin (AUC 6 mg/mL/min, day 1) every 3 weeks in arm A, or gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2, days 1 and 8) plus carboplatin (AUC 5 mg/mL/min, day1) every 3 weeks in arm B. Non-progressive patients following 3 cycles of induction chemotherapy received maintenance gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2, days 1 and 8) every 3 weeks.( TRIAL REGISTRATION: UMIN000008252)RESULTS: The study was stopped because of delayed accrual at interim analysis.Of the randomly assigned 50 patients, 49 except for one in arm B were evaluable.Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 4.6 months for arm A vs. 3.5 months for arm B (HR = 1.03; 95% CI, 0.45-2.27; p = 0.95) and median overall survival (OS) was 15.0 months for arm A vs. 14.8 months for arm B (HR = 0.79; 95% CI, 0.40-1.51; p = 0.60), showing no difference between the two arms.The response rate, disease control rate, and the transit rate to maintenance phase were 36.0% (9/25), 64.0% (16/25), and 48% (12/25) for arm A vs. 16.7% (4/24), 50.0% (12/24), and 33% (8/24) for arm B, which were also statistically similar between the two arms (p = 0.13, p = 0.32, and p = 0.30, respectively).Both induction regimens were tolerable, except that more patients experienced peripheral neuropathy in arm A. Toxicities during the maintenance phase were also minimal.CONCLUSION: Survival and overall response were not significantly different between the two arms.Gemcitabine may be well-tolerable and feasible for maintenance therapy.",1,1,1,1
25795410,"Nivolumab versus chemotherapy in patients with advanced melanoma who progressed after anti-CTLA-4 treatment (CheckMate 037): a randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Nivolumab, a fully human IgG4 PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor antibody, can result in durable responses in patients with melanoma who have progressed after ipilimumab and BRAF inhibitors.We assessed the efficacy and safety of nivolumab compared with investigator's choice of chemotherapy (ICC) as a second-line or later-line treatment in patients with advanced melanoma.METHODS: In this randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 3 trial, we recruited patients at 90 sites in 14 countries.Eligible patients were 18 years or older, had unresectable or metastatic melanoma, and progressed after ipilimumab, or ipilimumab and a BRAF inhibitor if they were BRAF(V 600) mutation-positive.Participating investigators randomly assigned (with an interactive voice response system) patients 2:1 to receive an intravenous infusion of nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks or ICC (dacarbazine 1000 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks or paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2) combined with carboplatin area under the curve 6 every 3 weeks) until progression or unacceptable toxic effects.We stratified randomisation by BRAF mutation status, tumour expression of PD-L1, and previous best overall response to ipilimumab.We used permuted blocks (block size of six) within each stratum.Primary endpoints were the proportion of patients who had an objective response and overall survival.Treatment was given open-label, but those doing tumour assessments were masked to treatment assignment.We assessed objective responses per-protocol after 120 patients had been treated with nivolumab and had a minimum follow-up of 24 weeks, and safety in all patients who had had at least one dose of treatment.The trial is closed and this is the first interim analysis, reporting the objective response primary endpoint.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01721746.FINDINGS: Between Dec 21, 2012, and Jan 10, 2014, we screened 631 patients, randomly allocating 272 patients to nivolumab and 133 to ICC.Confirmed objective responses were reported in 38 (31.7%, 95% CI 23.5-40.8) of the first 120 patients in the nivolumab group versus five (10.6%, 3.5-23.1) of 47 patients in the ICC group.Grade 3-4 adverse events related to nivolumab included increased lipase (three [1%] of 268 patients), increased alanine aminotransferase, anaemia, and fatigue (two [1%] each); for ICC, these included neutropenia (14 [14%] of 102), thrombocytopenia (six [6%]), and anaemia (five [5%]).We noted grade 3-4 drug-related serious adverse events in 12 (5%) nivolumab-treated patients and nine (9%) patients in the ICC group.No treatment-related deaths occurred.INTERPRETATION: Nivolumab led to a greater proportion of patients achieving an objective response and fewer toxic effects than with alternative available chemotherapy regimens for patients with advanced melanoma that has progressed after ipilimumab or ipilimumab and a BRAF inhibitor.Nivolumab represents a new treatment option with clinically meaningful durable objective responses in a population of high unmet need.FUNDING: Bristol-Myers Squibb.",1,1,1,1
29377317,"A turning point: Head and neck cancer patients' exercise preferences and barriers before and after participation in an exercise intervention.This study examined the exercise barriers and preferences of head and neck cancer (HNC) survivors in relation to exercise experience.Participants (n = 22; 46.8% response rate) completed retrospective self-report questionnaires on demographic and medical information, exercise barriers and preferences.A subset of participants then completed semi-structured interviews (n = 18).Participants had previously engaged in the ENHANCE trial during, or immediately following, radiation treatment, an average of 22.1 +/- 5.8 months before.Retrospective questionnaires revealed that before ENHANCE participation, lack of interest and time were the primary exercise barriers.After participation, there was a significant decrease in typical barriers including lack of interest (p = .008), exercise not a priority (p = .039) and exercise not in routine (p = .004).Number of barriers experienced after ENHANCE participation was negatively correlated with age, quality of life and minutes of resistance exercise training per week.After ENHANCE participation, significant increases were found in preference for exercising at a cancer centre (p = .031) and with other cancer survivors (p = .016).Four higher order themes emerged inductively from interview data analysis pertaining to preferences (i.e., class format) and three higher order themes regarding barriers (physical, psychological and external).By investigating participants' perspectives after ENHANCE participation, key factors for effective HNC exercise programme design were identified.",0,0,0,0
27428073,"Phase II randomised trial of autologous tumour lysate dendritic cell plus best supportive care compared with best supportive care in pre-treated advanced colorectal cancer patients.BACKGROUND: Autologous tumour lysate dendritic cell vaccine (ADC) has T-cell stimulatory capacity and, therefore, potential antitumour activity.We designed a phase II randomised trial of ADC + best supportive care (BSC) (experimental arm [EA]) compared with BSC (control arm [CA]), in pre-treated metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with progressive mCRC, at least to two chemotherapy regimens and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) 0-2, were randomised to EA versus CA.Stratification criteria: ECOG PS (0-1 versus 2) and lactate dehydrogenase (<Upper Limit of Normal [ULN] versus >ULN).EA was administered subcutaneously till progressive disease.Primary end-point was progression-free survival (PFS) at 4 months.RESULTS: Fifty-two patients were included (28 EA/24 CA).An interim analysis recommended early termination for futility.No objective radiological response was observed in EA.Median PFS in EA was 2.7 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.3-3.2 months) versus 2.3 months (95% CI, 2.1-2.5 months) in CA (p = 0.628).Median overall survival (OS) was 6.2 months (95% CI, 4.4-7.9 months) in EA versus 4.7 months (95% CI, 2.3-7 months) in CA (p = 0.41).No ADC-related adverse events were reported.Immunization induces tumour-specific T-cell response in 21 of 25 (84%) patients.Responder patients have an OS of 7.3 months (95% CI, 5.2-9.4 months) versus 3.8 months (95% CI, 0.6-6.9 months) in non-responders; p = 0.026).CONCLUSION: Our randomised clinical trial comparing ADC + BSC versus BSC in mCRC demonstrates that ADC generates a tumour-specific immune response but not benefit on PFS and OS.Our results do not support the use of ADC alone, in a phase III trial.",1,1,1,1
29698447,"Celecoxib use and circulating oxylipins in a colon polyp prevention trial.Drugs that inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and the metabolism of arachidonic acid (ARA) to prostaglandin E2 are potent anti-inflammatory agents used widely in the treatment of joint and muscle pain.Despite their benefits, daily use of these drugs has been associated with hypertension, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal toxicities.It is now recognized that ARA is metabolized to a number of bioactive oxygenated lipids (oxylipins) by cyclooxygenase (COX), lipoxygenase (LOX), and cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes.Currently, the contribution of individual variability in ARA metabolism in response to the COX-2 inhibitors and potential adverse effects remains poorly understood.Using patient samples from the randomized, placebo-controlled phase III selenium/celecoxib (Sel/Cel) trial for the prevention of colorectal adenomatous polyps, we analyzed plasma concentrations of 74 oxylipins in a subset of participants who received celecoxib (n = 90) or placebo (n = 95).We assessed the effect of celecoxib (with and without low dose aspirin) on circulating oxylipins and systolic blood pressure (SBP).Individual CYP450- and LOX- but not COX-derived metabolites were higher with celecoxib than placebo (P<0.05) and differences were greater among non-aspirin users.LOX derived 5- and 8-HETE were elevated with celecoxib and positively associated with systolic blood pressure (P = 0.011 and P = 0.019 respectively).20-HETE, a prohypertensive androgen-sensitive CYP450 metabolite was higher with celecoxib absent aspirin and was positively associated with SBP in men (P = 0.040) but not women.Independent of celecoxib or aspirin, LOX derived metabolites from ARA were strongly associated with SBP including 5- and 8-HETE.These findings support oxylipins, particularly the ARA LOX-derived, in blood pressure control and indicate that pharmacologic inhibition of COX-2 has effects on LOX and CYP450 ARA metabolism that contribute to hypertension in some patients.",0,0,0,0
30115593,"Bevacizumab and temozolomide in patients with first recurrence of WHO grade II and III glioma, without 1p/19q co-deletion (TAVAREC): a randomised controlled phase 2 EORTC trial.BACKGROUND: Bevacizumab is frequently used in the treatment of recurrent WHO grade II and III glioma, but without supporting evidence from randomised trials.Therefore, we assessed the use of bevacizumab in patients with first recurrence of grade II or III glioma who did not have 1p/19q co-deletion.METHODS: The TAVAREC trial was a randomised, open-label phase 2 trial done at 32 centres across Europe in patients with locally diagnosed grade II or III glioma without 1p/19q co-deletion, with a first and contrast-enhancing recurrence after initial radiotherapy or chemotherapy, or both.Previous chemotherapy must have been stopped at least 6 months before enrolment and radiotherapy must have been stopped at least 3 months before enrolment.Random group assignment was done electronically through the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer web-based system, stratified by a minimisation procedure using institution, initial histology (WHO grade II vs III), WHO performance status (0 or 1 vs 2), and previous treatment (radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or both).Patients were assigned to receive either temozolomide (150-200 mg/m(2), orally) monotherapy on days 1-5 every 4 weeks for a maximum of 12 cycles, or the same temozolomide regimen in combination with bevacizumab (10 mg/kg, intravenously) every 2 weeks until progression.The primary endpoint was overall survival at 12 months in the per-protocol population.Safety analyses were done in all patients who started their allocated treatment.The study is registered at EudraCT (2009-017422-39) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01164189), and is complete.FINDINGS: Between Feb 8, 2011, and July 31, 2015, 155 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive either monotherapy (n=77) or combination therapy (n=78).Overall survival in the per-protocol population at 12 months was achieved by 44 (61% [80% CI 53-69]) of 72 patients in the temozolomide group and 38 (55% [47-69]) of 69 in the combination group.The most frequent toxicity was haematological: 17 (23%) of 75 patients in the monotherapy group and 25 (33%) of 76 in the combination group developed grade 3 or 4 haematological toxicity.Other than haematological toxicities, the most common adverse events were nervous system disorders (59 [79%] of 75 patients in the monotherapy group vs 65 [86%] of 76 in the combination group), fatigue (53 [70%] vs 61 [80%]), and nausea (39 [52%] vs 43 [56%]).Infections were more frequently reported in the combination group (29 [38%] of 76 patients) than in the monotherapy group (17 [23%] of 75).One treatment-related death was reported in the combination group (infection after intratumoral haemorrhage during a treatment-related grade 4 thrombocytopenia).INTERPRETATION: We found no evidence of improved overall survival with bevacizumab and temozolomide combination treatment versus temozolomide monotherapy.The findings from this study provide no support for further phase 3 studies on the role of bevacizumab in this disease.FUNDING: Roche Pharmaceuticals.",0,0,0,0

24447190,"Trait and state disgust: an experimental investigation of disgust and avoidance in colorectal cancer decision scenarios.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether trait and experimentally manipulated state disgust independently and/or interactively predict immediate and anticipated avoidance in decision scenarios related to colorectal cancer (CRC).METHOD: Eighty participants, aged 18 to 66 years, completed questionnaires assessing trait disgust prior to a laboratory session.Participants were gender block randomized to disgust or control conditions before completing tasks assessing immediate avoidance of a CRC disgust elicitor (stoma bag) and anticipated avoidance in hypothetical CRC scenarios.RESULTS: Manipulation checks confirmed the elicitation of disgust in the experimental condition.Persons in the experimental condition were more likely to exhibit immediate avoidance behaviors in response to a commonly used bowel disease device (stoma bag), and trait disgust predicted time to touch the device.Trait disgust also moderated the influence of state disgust on anticipated avoidance, namely delay in help seeking for bowel symptoms and predicted rating disgusting side effects as more deterring to adherence.CONCLUSIONS: The current report suggests the importance of examining disgust in CRC contexts and provides the first empirical demonstration that state and trait aspects of disgust may interactively operate to deter certain types of decisions.It thus furthers understanding of emotions and avoidance in a health context that has had surprisingly little focus to date.",0,0,0,0

23650416,"Randomized phase II, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of exemestane with or without entinostat in postmenopausal women with locally recurrent or metastatic estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer progressing on treatment with a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor.PURPOSE: Entinostat is an oral isoform selective histone deacetylase inhibitor that targets resistance to hormonal therapies in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer.This randomized, placebo-controlled, phase II study evaluated entinostat combined with the aromatase inhibitor exemestane versus exemestane alone.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Postmenopausal women with ER+ advanced breast cancer progressing on a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor were randomly assigned to exemestane 25 mg daily plus entinostat 5 mg once per week (EE) or exemestane plus placebo (EP).The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS).Blood was collected in a subset of patients for evaluation of protein lysine acetylation as a biomarker of entinostat activity.RESULTS: One hundred thirty patients were randomly assigned (EE group, n = 64; EP group, n = 66).Based on intent-to-treat analysis, treatment with EE improved median PFS to 4.3 months versus 2.3 months with EP (hazard ratio [HR], 0.73; 95% CI, 0.50 to 1.07; one-sided P = .055; two-sided P = .11 [predefined significance level of .10, one-sided]).Median overall survival was an exploratory end point and improved to 28.1 months with EE versus 19.8 months with EP (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.97; P = .036).Fatigue and neutropenia were the most frequent grade 3/4 toxicities.Treatment discontinuation because of adverse events was higher in the EE group versus the EP group (11% v 2%).Protein lysine hyperacetylation in the EE biomarker subset was associated with prolonged PFS.CONCLUSION: Entinostat added to exemestane is generally well tolerated and demonstrated activity in patients with ER+ advanced breast cancer in this signal-finding phase II study.Acetylation changes may provide an opportunity to maximize clinical benefit with entinostat.Plans for a confirmatory study are underway.",1,1,1,1
28210843,"Updated results from GEST study: a randomized, three-arm phase III study for advanced pancreatic cancer.PURPOSE: The GEST study showed non-inferiority of S-1 but not superiority of gemcitabine plus S-1 (GS) to gemcitabine alone for overall survival with the data by the cut-off date of 31st July in 2010 for chemo-naive patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.We considered it important to determine whether S-1 maintains non-inferiority after a long-term follow-up in the GEST study and to obtain a firm positive conclusion.In addition, it may be an interesting challenge to explore the efficacious profile of GS in the long-term follow-up study.Using the data from the follow-up period, background and efficacy in patients from Taiwan and Japan, as well as the rates of tumor shrinkage in locally advanced and metastatic patients (Waterfall plot) were also analyzed.METHODS: The results of the primary analysis were reconfirmed, and subset analysis of overall survival and progression-free survival was performed based on the overall survival data updated by the cut-off date of 31st July in 2011.RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 29.8 months, and 795 deaths occurred (95.6%).The median overall survival was 8.8 months for gemcitabine, 9.7 months for S-1 (hazard ratio [HR], 0.96; 97.5% confidence interval [CI], 0.79-1.17), and 9.9 months for GS (HR 0.91; 97.5% CI 0.75-1.11).In patients with performance status (PS) 0, the median overall survival was 9.8 months for gemcitabine, 10.9 months for S-1, and 10.5 months for GS.In patients with PS 1, the median overall survival was 6.2 months for gemcitabine, 6.3 months for S-1, and 9.6 months for GS.CONCLUSION: Our survey reconfirmed the non-inferiority of S-1 to gemcitabine and showed S-1 can be used as one of the standard treatment options for advanced pancreatic cancer.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00498225.",0,0,0,0
23725233,"A randomized controlled trial of a cardiopulmonary resuscitation video in advance care planning for progressive pancreas and hepatobiliary cancer patients.BACKGROUND: Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is an important advance directive (AD) topic in patients with progressive cancer; however such discussions are challenging.OBJECTIVE: This study investigates whether video educational information about CPR engenders broader advance care planning (ACP) discourse.METHODS: Patients with progressive pancreas or hepatobiliary cancer were randomized to an educational CPR video or a similar CPR narrative.The primary end-point was the difference in ACP documentation one month posttest between arms.Secondary end-points included study impressions; pre- and post-intervention knowledge of and preferences for CPR and mechanical ventilation; and longitudinal patient outcomes.RESULTS: Fifty-six subjects were consented and analyzed.Rates of ACP documentation (either formal ADs or documented discussions) were 40% in the video arm (12/30) compared to 15% in the narrative arm (4/26), OR=3.6 [95% CI: 0.9-18.0], p=0.07.Post-intervention knowledge was higher in both arms.Posttest, preferences for CPR had changed in the video arm but not in the narrative arm.Preferences regarding mechanical ventilation did not change in either arm.The majority of subjects in both arms reported the information as helpful and comfortable to discuss, and they recommended it to others.More deaths occurred in the video arm compared to the narrative arm, and more subjects died in hospice settings in the video arm.CONCLUSIONS: This pilot randomized trial addressing downstream ACP effects of video versus narrative decision tools demonstrated a trend towards more ACP documentation in video subjects.This trend, as well as other video effects, is the subject of ongoing study.",0,0,0,0

26946057,"BRCA1-like profile predicts benefit of tandem high dose epirubicin-cyclophospamide-thiotepa in high risk breast cancer patients randomized in the WSG-AM01 trial.BRCA1 is an important protein in the repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), which are induced by alkylating chemotherapy.A BRCA1-like DNA copy number signature derived from tumors with a BRCA1 mutation is indicative for impaired BRCA1 function and associated with good outcome after high dose (HD) and tandem HD DSB inducing chemotherapy.We investigated whether BRCA1-like status was a predictive biomarker in the WSG AM 01 trial.WSG AM 01 randomized high-risk breast cancer patients to induction (2x epirubicin-cyclophosphamide) followed by tandem HD chemotherapy with epirubicin, cyclophosphamide and thiotepa versus dose dense chemotherapy (4x epirubicin-cyclophospamide followed by 3x cyclophosphamide-methotrexate-5-fluorouracil).We generated copy number profiles for 143 tumors and classified them as being BRCA1-like or non-BRCA1-like.Twenty-six out of 143 patients were BRCA1-like.BRCA1-like status was associated with high grade and triple negative tumors.With regard to event-free-survival, the primary endpoint of the trial, patients with a BRCA1-like tumor had a hazard rate of 0.2, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.07-0.63, p = 0.006.In the interaction analysis, the combination of BRCA1-like status and HD chemotherapy had a hazard rate of 0.19, 95% CI: 0.067-0.54, p = 0.003.Similar results were observed for overall survival.These findings suggest that BRCA1-like status is a predictor for benefit of tandem HD chemotherapy with epirubicin-thiotepa-cyclophosphamide.",1,1,1,1
21626049,"A randomized phase II trial of two different 4-drug combinations in advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma: cisplatin, capecitabine, gemcitabine plus either epirubicin or docetaxel (PEXG or PDXG regimen).PURPOSE: PEFG regimen (P:cisplatin, E:epirubicin, F:5-fluorouracil, G:gemcitabine) significantly prolonged progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients with advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PA) with respect to standard gemcitabine.The current trial was aimed at assessing whether the replacement of E with docetaxel (D) may improve 6 months PFS (PFS6).METHODS: Chemo-naive patients with stage III or metastatic PA received P (30 mg/m(2) day 1 and 15), G (800 mg/m(2) day 1 and 15), and capecitabine (1,250 mg/m(2)/day days 1-28, without a break) and were randomized to receive either D at 25-30 mg/m(2) day 1 and 15 (arm A: PDXG regimen) or E at 30 mg/m(2) day 1 and 15 (arm B: PEXG regimen).Cycles were repeated every 28 days for a maximum of 6 months.The Fleming design was used to calculate the sample size on the probability of being PFS6.Assuming P0 = 40% and P1 = 60%, alpha = 0.05 and beta = 0.10; the study was to enroll 52 patients per arm.RESULTS: Between July 2005 and September 2008, 105 patients were enrolled, stratified by stage and randomized.Patients' characteristics were (A/B) the following: median age 61/59, PS >70 92/88%, metastatic disease 66/65%.PFS6 was 58%, and median OS was 11 months in both arms.A partial response was observed in 60/37% of patients.Main per cycle G3-4 toxicity was the following: neutropenia 4/13%, thrombocytopenia 2/4%, anemia 4/4%, and fatigue 6/3%.CONCLUSIONS: The inclusion of D instead of E yielded more objective response and less G3-4 neutropenia but did not improve PFS and OS.The present trial confirms the relevant impact on outcome of advanced PA of 4-drug regimens.",1,1,1,0
25678394,"Double-blinded, randomized phase II study using embolization with or without granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor in uveal melanoma with hepatic metastases.PURPOSE: To investigate the effects of immunoembolization with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in patients with uveal melanoma (UM) with liver-only metastasis.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this double-blind phase II clinical trial, patients were randomized to undergo immunoembolization or bland embolization (BE).Lobar treatment was performed with GM-CSF or normal saline solution mixed with ethiodized oil followed by embolization with gelatin sponge emulsified with iodinated contrast medium.Fifty-two patients (immunoembolization, n = 25; BE, n = 27) were enrolled.Response was assessed after every two treatments.The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR) of liver metastases.Progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and immunologic responses were secondary endpoints.RESULTS: There were five partial responses in the immunoembolization group (ORR, 21.2%; 90% confidence interval [CI], 10.3%-30.5%) and three in the BE group (ORR, 16.7%; 90% CI, 6.3%-26.9%).Stable disease was seen in 12 patients in the immunoembolization group and 19 in the BE group.OS times were 21.5 months (95% CI, 18.5-24.8 mo) with immunoembolization and 17.2 months (95% CI, 11.9-22.4 mo) with BE.The degree of proinflammatory cytokine production was more robust after immunoembolization and correlated with time to ""systemic"" extrahepatic progression.In the immunoembolization group, interleukin (IL)-6 levels at 1 hour (P = .001) and IL-8 levels at 18 hours after the procedure (P < .001) were significant predictors of longer systemic PFS.Moreover, a dose-response pattern was evident between posttreatment serum cytokine concentrations and systemic PFS.CONCLUSIONS: Immunoembolization induced more robust inflammatory responses, which correlated with the delayed progression of extrahepatic systemic metastases.",1,1,1,1
27596353,"Health-related quality of life in the randomised KEYNOTE-002 study of pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy in patients with ipilimumab-refractory melanoma.BACKGROUND: In KEYNOTE-002, pembrolizumab significantly prolonged progression-free survival and was associated with a better safety profile compared with chemotherapy in patients with advanced melanoma that progressed after ipilimumab.We present health-related quality of life (HRQoL) outcomes from KEYNOTE-002.METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to pembrolizumab 2 or 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks (Q3W) or investigator-choice chemotherapy.HRQoL was assessed using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire-Core 30 instrument.A constrained longitudinal data analysis model was implemented to assess between-arm differences in HRQoL scores.The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01704287.RESULTS: Of the 540 patients enrolled, 520 were included in the HRQoL analysis.Baseline global health status (GHS) was similar across treatment arms.Compliance rates at week 12 were 76.6% (n = 108), 82.3% (n = 121), and 86.4% (n = 133) for the control, pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg Q3W, and pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg Q3W arms, respectively.From baseline to week 12, GHS/HRQoL scores were maintained to a higher degree in the pembrolizumab arms compared with the chemotherapy arm (decrease of -2.6 for each pembrolizumab arm versus -9.1 for chemotherapy; P = 0.01 for each pembrolizumab arm versus chemotherapy).Fewer patients treated with pembrolizumab experienced deterioration in GHS at week 12 (31.8% for pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg, 26.6% for 10 mg/kg, and 38.3% for chemotherapy), with similar trends observed for the individual functioning and symptoms scales.CONCLUSIONS: HRQoL was better maintained with pembrolizumab than with chemotherapy in KEYNOTE-002, supporting the use of pembrolizumab in patients with ipilimumab-refractory melanoma.",0,0,0,0
31558480,"Randomized Phase II Trial and Tumor Mutational Spectrum Analysis from Cabozantinib versus Chemotherapy in Metastatic Uveal Melanoma (Alliance A091201).PURPOSE: The surface receptor MET is highly expressed on primary uveal melanoma; MET inhibitors demonstrated early clinical signals of efficacy in slowing uveal melanoma growth.The primary objective of our study was to compare the progression-free survival rate at 4 months (PFS4) of patients with uveal melanoma treated with cabozantinib or chemotherapy.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with metastatic uveal melanoma and RECIST measurable disease were randomized 2:1 to receive either cabozantinib (arm 1) versus temozolomide or dacarbazine (arm 2) with restaging imaging every two cycles.Cross-over from arm 2 to cabozantinib after progression was allowed (arm 2X).Available tumor specimens were analyzed by whole-exome sequencing (WES) and results were correlated with outcome.RESULTS: Forty-six eligible patients were accrued with 31, 15, and 9 in arms 1, 2, and 2X, respectively.Median lines of prior therapy, including hepatic embolization, were two.Rates of PFS4 in arm 1 and arm 2 were 32.3% and 26.7% (P = 0.35), respectively, with median PFS time of 60 and 59 days (P = 0.964; HR = 0.99).Median overall survival (OS) was 6.4 months and 7.3 months (P = 0.580; HR = 1.21), respectively.Grade 3-4 Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events were present in 61.3%, 46.7%, and 37.5% in arms 1, 2, and 2X, respectively.WES demonstrated a mean tumor mutational burden of 1.53 mutations/Mb and did not separate OS </= or >1 year (P = 0.14).Known mutations were identified by WES and novel mutations were nominated.CONCLUSIONS: MET/VEGFR blockade with cabozantinib demonstrated no improvement in PFS but an increase in toxicity relative to temozolomide/dacarbazine in metastatic uveal melanoma.",1,1,1,1
28188670,"A randomized phase II trial of personalized peptide vaccine with low dose cyclophosphamide in biliary tract cancer.Since the prognosis of advanced biliary tract cancer (aBTC) still remains very poor, new therapeutic approaches, including immunotherapies, need to be developed.In the current study, we conducted an open-label randomized phase II study to test whether low dose cyclophosphamide (CPA) could improve antigen-specific immune responses and clinical efficacy of personalized peptide vaccination (PPV) in 49 previously treated aBTC patients.Patients with aBTC refractory to at least one regimen of chemotherapies were randomly assigned to receive PPV with low dose CPA (100 mg/day for 7 days before vaccination) (PPV/CPA, n = 24) or PPV alone (n = 25).A maximum of four HLA-matched peptides were selected based on the pre-existing peptide-specific IgG responses, followed by subcutaneous administration.T cell responses to the vaccinated peptides in the PPV/CPA arm tended to be greater than those in the PPV alone arm.The PPV/CPA arm showed significantly better progression-free survival (median time: 6.1 vs 2.9 months; hazard ratio (HR): 0.427; P = 0.008) and overall survival (median time: 12.1 vs 5.9 months; HR: 0.376; P = 0.004), compared to the PPV alone arm.The PPV alone arm, but not the PPV/CPA arm, showed significant increase in plasma IL-6 after vaccinations, which might be associated with inhibition of antigen-specific T cell responses.These results suggested that combined treatment with low dose CPA could provide clinical benefits in aBTC patients under PPV, possibly through prevention of IL-6-mediated immune suppression.Further clinical studies would be recommended to clarify the clinical efficacy of PPV/CPA in aBTC patients.",1,1,1,1

23182660,"Second-line pemetrexed versus docetaxel in Chinese patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer: a randomized, open-label study.INTRODUCTION: This randomized, open-label study compared pemetrexed versus docetaxel as second-line therapy for Chinese patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).The primary endpoint tested non-inferiority of overall survival (OS) on the combined data from these patients and those in the global registration trial.Data from patients in the current study only (Chinese patients) were the basis for the study's secondary objectives.METHODS: Patients with stage IIIB/IV disease were randomized (1:1) to receive pemetrexed (500 mg/m(2); 107 randomized; 106 treated) or docetaxel (75 mg/m(2); 104 randomized; 102 treated) on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle.Treatment continued until progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity or patient/investigator decision.All efficacy and safety data were analyzed at the pre-specified study completion; supplementary OS analyses were performed later, after additional events had been recorded.RESULTS: The primary endpoint of OS noninferiority of pemetrexed to docetaxel was not met, the lower CL was <50% and P>0.025 (efficacy retained=97.9% [95% CLs: 47.1, 141.9]; P=0.0276), in the combined population (pemetrexed: n=390, docetaxel: n=392).Supplementary values were 101.3% (95% CLs: 57.9, 148.8), P=0.0186.For the secondary objectives, assessed in the population from the current study (pemetrexed: n=107, docetaxel: n=104), median OS was 11.7 and 12.2 months for the pemetrexed and docetaxel arms, respectively (HR [95% CLs]: 1.14 [0.78, 1.68], P=0.492).Supplementary values were 11.4 and 11.5 months, respectively (HR [95% CLs]: 1.02 [0.74, 1.40], P=0.926).Median PFS values were 2.8 and 3.1 months (HR [95% CLs]: 1.05 [0.75, 1.46], P=0.770) and ORR values were 9.6% and 4.1% (odds ratio [95% CLs]: 2.50 [0.76, 8.25], P=0.133) for pemetrexed and docetaxel, respectively.Pemetrexed-treated patients had significantly fewer drug-related grade 3-4 adverse events (pemetrexed: 20.8%, docetaxel: 40.2%; P=0.003).Few drug-related serious adverse events were reported (pemetrexed: 5 patients, docetaxel: 8 patients).CONCLUSION: The comparable efficacy and superior tolerability of pemetrexed compared with docetaxel in this study supports the use of single-agent, second-line pemetrexed for advanced non-squamous NSCLC in Chinese patients.ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00391274.",0,0,0,0
29445029,"Pantoprazole, an Inhibitor of the Organic Cation Transporter 2, Does Not Ameliorate Cisplatin-Related Ototoxicity or Nephrotoxicity in Children and Adolescents with Newly Diagnosed Osteosarcoma Treated with Methotrexate, Doxorubicin, and Cisplatin.LESSONS LEARNED: Using a randomized crossover design and continuous variables such as change in hearing threshold and biomarkers of acute renal injury as short-term endpoints, it was determined that pantoprazole, an organic cation transporter 2 inhibitor, did not ameliorate cisplatin-associated nephrotoxicity or ototoxicity.Cystatin C is a robust method to estimate glomerular filtration rate in patients with cancer.Using a patient-reported outcome survey, all patients identified tinnitus and subjective hearing loss occurring ""at least rarely"" after cycle 1, prior to objective high-frequency hearing loss measured by audiograms.New therapies that improve outcome with less acute and long-term toxicity are needed.BACKGROUND: Organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2), which is a cisplatin uptake transporter expressed on renal tubules and cochlear hair cells but not on osteosarcoma cells, mediates cisplatin uptake.Pantoprazole inhibits OCT2 and could ameliorate cisplatin ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity.Using a randomized crossover design, we evaluated audiograms, urinary acute kidney injury (AKI) biomarkers, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimated from cystatin C (GFRcysC) in patients receiving cisplatin with and without pantoprazole.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cisplatin (60 mg/m(2) x 2 days per cycle) was administered concurrently with pantoprazole (intravenous [IV], 1.6 mg/kg over 4 hours) on cycles 1 and 2 or cycles 3 and 4 in 12 patients with osteosarcoma (OS) with a median (range) age of 12.8 (5.6-19) years.Audiograms, urinary AKI biomarkers, and serum cystatin C were monitored during each cycle.RESULTS: Pantoprazole had no impact on decrements in hearing threshold at 4-8 kHz, post-treatment elevation of urinary AKI biomarkers, or GFRcysC (Fig. 1, Table 1).Histological response (percent necrosis) after two cycles was similar with or without pantoprazole.All eight patients with localized OS at diagnosis are alive and in remission; three of four patients with metastases at diagnosis have died.CONCLUSION: Pantoprazole did not ameliorate cisplatin ototoxicity or nephrotoxicity.The decrease in GFRcysC and increase in N-acetyl-ss-glucosaminidase (NAG) and creatinine demonstrate that these biomarkers can quantify cisplatin glomerular and proximal tubular toxicity.OCT2 inhibition by pantoprazole did not appear to alter antitumor response or survival.",1,1,1,1

30179056,"Acute hematological toxicity during post-operative bowel sparing image-guided intensity modulated radiation with concurrent cisplatin.OBJECTIVE: To report acute hematological toxicity (HT) in patients receiving post-operative bowel sparing intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and cisplatin and its dosimetric predictors.METHODS: Clinical database of Phase III trial (NCT01279135), that randomized patients to post-operative conformal or intensity modulated radiation therapy, was searched to select patient strata that received bowel sparing IMRT (50 Gy/25#/5 wks) and concurrent cisplatin (40 mg m(-)(2)).Pelvic bone marrow (BM) was retrospectively delineated in two sets: whole bone (WB), and freehand (FH) inner cavity of bone.Dose volume histograms (DVH) of BM were obtained.Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve identified DVH thresholds that predicted for Grade>/= II HT with highest specificity.Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed.RESULTS: Overall 75 patients received concurrent cisplatin.Grades I-V HT was observed in 38.7%, 42.7%, 14.7%, 0%, and 0% patients, respectively.Grade >/= II leukopenia, neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia were observed in 26%, 40%, 26.5%, and 1.4% respectively.None of the HT resulted in treatment break.On univariate analysis, whole pelvis+ lumbar FH V30 >55% & V40>35%, whole pelvis WB and FH V40 > 35%, and lower pelvis WB and FH V40 >20% correlated for Grade >/= II leucopenia and neutropenia.None of the BM dose volume constraints predicted for overall HT or neutropenia on multivariate analysis.CONCLUSION: The IMRT arm of NCT01279135 (PARCER study) that employed strict bowel constraints had unintentional but desirable BM sparing.None of the BM subvolume DVH parameters could be validated on multivariate analysis.ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: The prospective study reports feasibility of bone marrow sparing with bowel sparing post-operative pelvic IMRT and concurrent chemotherapy for cervical cancer.The present study reports low incidence of hematological and gastrointestinal toxicity during post-operative chemoradiation with IMRT.As both whole bone and freehand pelvis BM contours predicted for HT, hence an easier method of whole bone contouring should continue to be used till further validation of more specific BM subvolumes becomes available.The study results highlight the need for further research into dose volume constraints during post-operative IMRT.",0,0,0,0
24076063,"Neoadjuvant treatment of endometrial cancer using anastrozole: a randomised pilot study.OBJECTIVE: Excessive oestrogenic stimulation is a well-known risk factor for the development and progression of endometrial cancer.Aromatase is the key enzyme which catalyses the conversion of androgens to oestrogens in postmenopausal women.Inhibition of aromatase may therefore be a useful strategy in the management of endometrial cancer.A pilot study was designed to assess the feasibility of a neoadjuvant model and understand the biological effects of anastrozole, an aromatase inhibitor, in the treatment of endometrial cancer.METHODS: Patients with endometrial cancer who consented to participate in the study were randomised to receive anastrozole or placebo for a minimum of 14 days prior to definitive surgery.Endometrial samples were obtained before and after treatment.Immunohistochemistry was performed to ascertain the expression of oestrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha), progesterone receptor (PR), androgen receptor (AR), ki-67 and Bcl2 before and after treatment in glands and stroma of the endometrium.RESULTS: A total of 16 patients were randomised to the anastrozole arm and 8 to the placebo arm (2:1 randomisation).A significant decrease in the glandular expression of ERalpha and AR was observed in the anastrozole arm.There was no significant change in the expression of PR or Bcl2.Expression of ki-67, a proliferation marker, also decreased significantly following treatment with anastrozole.CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with anastrozole caused a significant decrease in proliferation as demonstrated by decreased ki-67 expression.A large randomised controlled trial is warranted to fully assess the role of anastrozole in the neoadjuvant treatment of endometrial cancer.",1,1,1,1
22840231,"Influence of perioperative oxygen fraction on pulmonary function after abdominal surgery: a randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: A high perioperative inspiratory oxygen fraction (FiO2) may reduce the frequency of surgical site infection.Perioperative atelectasis is caused by absorption, compression and reduced function of surfactant.It is well accepted, that ventilation with 100% oxygen for only a few minutes is associated with significant formation of atelectasis.However, it is still not clear if a longer period of 80% oxygen results in more atelectasis compared to a low FiO2.Our aim was to assess if a high FiO2 is associated with impaired oxygenation and decreased pulmonary functional residual capacity (FRC).METHODS: Thirty-five patients scheduled for laparotomy for ovarian cancer were randomized to receive either 30% oxygen (n = 15) or 80% oxygen (n = 20) during and for 2 h after surgery.The oxygenation index (PaO2/FiO2) was measured every 30 min during anesthesia and 90 min after extubation.FRC was measured the day before surgery and 2 h after extubation by a rebreathing method using the inert gas SF6.RESULTS: Five min after intubation, the median PaO2/FiO2 was 69 kPa [53-71] in the 30%-group vs. 60 kPa [47-69] in the 80%-group (P = 0.25).At the end of anesthesia, the PaO2/FiO2 was 58 kPa [40-70] vs. 57 kPa [46-67] in the 30%- and 80%-group, respectively (P = 0.10).The median FRC was 1993 mL [1610-2240] vs. 1875 mL [1545-2048] at baseline and 1615 mL [1375-2318] vs. 1633 mL [1343-1948] postoperatively in the 30%- and 80%-group, respectively (P = 0.70).CONCLUSION: We found no significant difference in oxygenation index or functional residual capacity between patients given 80% and 30% oxygen for a period of approximately 5 hours.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00637936.",0,0,0,0
25968598,"Effect of Sulforaphane in Men with Biochemical Recurrence after Radical Prostatectomy.Increases in serum levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) occur commonly in prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy and are designated ""biochemical recurrence."" Because the phytochemical sulforaphane has been studied extensively as an anticancer agent, we performed a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter trial with sulforaphane in 78 patients (mean age, 69 +/- 6 years) with increasing PSA levels after radical prostatectomy.Treatment comprised daily oral administration of 60 mg of a stabilized free sulforaphane for 6 months (M0-M6) followed by 2 months without treatment (M6-M8).The study was designed to detect a 0.012 log (ng/mL)/month decrease in the log PSA slope in the sulforaphane group from M0 to M6.The primary endpoint was not reached.For secondary endpoints, median log PSA slopes were consistently lower in sulforaphane-treated men.Mean changes in PSA levels between M6 and M0 were significantly lower in the sulforaphane group (+0.099 +/- 0.341 ng/mL) than in placebo (+0.620 +/- 1.417 ng/mL; P = 0.0433).PSA doubling time was 86% longer in the sulforaphane than in the placebo group (28.9 and 15.5 months, respectively).PSA increases >20% at M6 were significantly greater in the placebo group (71.8%) than in the sulforaphane group (44.4%); P = 0.0163.Compliance and tolerance were very good.Sulforaphane effects were prominent after 3 months of intervention (M3-M6).After treatment, PSA slopes from M6 to M8 remained the same in the 2 arms.Daily administration of free sulforaphane shows promise in managing biochemical recurrences in prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.",1,1,1,0
30564933,"Adoption and implementation of a web-based self-management application ""Oncokompas"" in routine cancer care: a national pilot study.PURPOSE: A web-based self-management application ""Oncokompas"" was developed to monitor health-related quality of life and to support cancer survivors in finding and obtaining optimal supportive care.Access to this application is provided via a healthcare professional (HCP).The aim of this study was to explore the adoption and implementation of Oncokompas in routine clinical practice and to obtain insights in potentially relevant determinants of implementation.METHODS: A pilot study was carried out among 65 hospitals throughout The Netherlands.HCPs filled out a questionnaire on the implementation of Oncokompas in their organization, consisting of study specific items and items based on the Measurement Instrument for Determinants of Innovations (MIDI).The MIDI comprises 29 determinants in four domains that predict the use of innovations: the innovation itself (Oncokompas), the user (HCP), the organization (hospital), and socio-political context.RESULTS: In total, 20/65 eligible hospitals agreed to implement Oncokompas (adoption rate 31%).In these 20 adopting hospitals, the majority of the responding HCPs (72/205) in this study (44/61) indicated their patients were offered access to Oncokompas (implementation rate 72%).Comparing those HCPs who did and did not implement Oncokompas, the groups differed significantly on innovation-related (procedural clarity, complexity) and user-related determinants (importance of outcome expectations, professional obligation, social support, and self-efficacy).CONCLUSIONS: During this 1-year study, nationwide adoption rate of Oncokompas was at 31%, and subsequent implementation rate was at 72%.The results of this study contribute to further optimize interventions and strategies to adopt and implement (online) self-management applications in cancer care.",0,0,0,0
30762141,"Effects of live music during chemotherapy in lymphoma patients: a randomized, controlled, multi-center trial.PURPOSE: Chemotherapy is associated with both somatic and psychological side effects.Music might ease these problems.Several randomized controlled trials have investigated the effect of music, but the results are inconclusive.We aimed to examine whether live or pre-recorded music listening decreases anxiety during chemotherapy in newly diagnosed lymphoma patients.METHODS: A total of 143 patients with non-Hodgkin and Hodgkin lymphomas were randomly assigned into three groups receiving either 30 min of patient-preferred live music (n = 47), 30 min of patient-preferred pre-recorded music (n = 47), or standard care (n = 49) during up to five outpatient chemotherapy sessions.The primary endpoint was anxiety measured by the Spielberger's State Anxiety Inventory.Secondary endpoints included blood pressure, pulse rate, nausea and vomiting, serum catecholamine levels pre- and post-intervention to measure arousal levels, and health-related quality of life.The Musical Ability Test was used to link musical ability to the primary endpoint.RESULTS: When adjusting for age, sex, diagnosis, number of sessions, and baseline anxiety, the linear mixed model showed a borderline statistically significant reduction in the primary outcome anxiety in the live music group compared to standard care (7% (95% CI, - 14% to 0%, p = 0.05), while the effect of pre-recorded music was non-significant (5% (95% CI, - 12% to + 3%, p = 0.18).No intervention effects were seen in secondary outcomes.CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that patient-preferred live music reduces anxiety among patients with malignant lymphomas undergoing chemotherapy.Musical ability among this group of cancer patients seems not to be a determining factor for effect of music intervention.",0,0,0,0
27869649,"Randomized trial of calcipotriol combined with 5-fluorouracil for skin cancer precursor immunotherapy.BACKGROUND: Actinic keratosis is a precursor to cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.Long treatment durations and severe side effects have limited the efficacy of current actinic keratosis treatments.Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is an epithelium-derived cytokine that induces a robust antitumor immunity in barrier-defective skin.Here, we investigated the efficacy of calcipotriol, a topical TSLP inducer, in combination with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) as an immunotherapy for actinic keratosis.METHODS: The mechanism of calcipotriol action against skin carcinogenesis was examined in genetically engineered mouse models.The efficacy and safety of 0.005% calcipotriol ointment combined with 5% 5-FU cream were compared with Vaseline plus 5-FU for the field treatment of actinic keratosis in a randomized, double-blind clinical trial involving 131 participants.The assigned treatment was self-applied to the entirety of the qualified anatomical sites (face, scalp, and upper extremities) twice daily for 4 consecutive days.The percentage of reduction in the number of actinic keratoses (primary outcome), local skin reactions, and immune activation parameters were assessed.RESULTS: Calcipotriol suppressed skin cancer development in mice in a TSLP-dependent manner.Four-day application of calcipotriol plus 5-FU versus Vaseline plus 5-FU led to an 87.8% versus 26.3% mean reduction in the number of actinic keratoses in participants (P < 0.0001).Importantly, calcipotriol plus 5-FU treatment induced TSLP, HLA class II, and natural killer cell group 2D (NKG2D) ligand expression in the lesional keratinocytes associated with a marked CD4+ T cell infiltration, which peaked on days 10-11 after treatment, without pain, crusting, or ulceration.CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate the synergistic effects of calcipotriol and 5-FU treatment in optimally activating a CD4+ T cell-mediated immunity against actinic keratoses and, potentially, cancers of the skin and other organs.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02019355.FUNDING: Not applicable (investigator-initiated clinical trial).",1,1,1,1

28209746,"A Phase II Randomized Trial (GO27827) of First-Line FOLFOX Plus Bevacizumab with or Without the MET Inhibitor Onartuzumab in Patients with Metastatic Colorectal Cancer.BACKGROUND: Dysregulated hepatocyte growth factor/mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) signaling is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to vascular endothelial growth factor inhibition in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).We report outcomes from a double-blind, multicenter phase II trial of the MET inhibitor onartuzumab in combination with mFOLFOX-6 and bevacizumab for mCRC (GO27827; NCT01418222).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive onartuzumab (10 mg/kg intravenously [IV]) or placebo plus mFOLFOX-6 and bevacizumab (5 mg/kg IV).Oxaliplatin was given for 8-12 cycles; other agents were continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or death.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) in the intent-to-treat (ITT) and MET immunohistochemistry (IHC) expression-positive populations.RESULTS: Between September 2011 and November 2012, 194 patients were enrolled.In September 2013, an interim analysis recommended stopping onartuzumab treatment due to lack of efficacy.At the time of the final analysis in February 2014, no significant improvement in PFS was seen with onartuzumab versus placebo in either the ITT or MET IHC-positive populations.An improvement in PFS was noted in the MET IHC-negative population.Neither overall survival nor response rate was improved with onartuzumab.The incidence of fatigue, peripheral edema, and deep vein thrombosis was increased with onartuzumab relative to placebo.CONCLUSION: Onartuzumab combined with mFOLFOX-6 and bevacizumab did not significantly improve efficacy outcomes in either the ITT or MET IHC-positive populations.MET expression by IHC was not a predictive biomarker in this setting.The Oncologist 2017;22:264-271 IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The addition of onartuzumab to mFOLFOX-6 plus bevacizumab did not improve outcomes in patients with previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer in this randomized, phase II study.Although initial results with onartuzumab were promising, a number of phase II/III clinical trials have reported a lack of improvement in efficacy with onartuzumab combined with standard-of-care therapies in several tumor types.Furthermore, negative study data have been published for rilotumumab and ficlatuzumab, both of which block hepatocyte growth factor binding to the mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) receptor.MET immunohistochemistry was not a predictive biomarker.It remains to be seen if other biomarkers or small molecule inhibitors may be more appropriate for inhibiting this oncogenic pathway.",1,1,1,1
27634489,"Hughes Abdominal Repair Trial (HART) - Abdominal wall closure techniques to reduce the incidence of incisional hernias: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Incisional hernias are common complications of midline closure following abdominal surgery and cause significant morbidity, impaired quality of life and increased health care costs.The 'Hughes Repair' combines a standard mass closure with a series of horizontal and two vertical mattress sutures within a single suture.This theoretically distributes the load along the incision length as well as across it.There is evidence to suggest that this technique is as effective as mesh repair for the operative management of incisional hernias; however, no trials have compared the Hughes Repair with standard mass closure for the prevention of incisional hernia formation following a midline incision.METHODS/DESIGN: This is a 1:1 randomised controlled trial comparing two suture techniques for the closure of the midline abdominal wound following surgery for colorectal cancer.Full ethical approval has been gained (Wales REC 3, MREC 12/WA/0374).Eight hundred patients will be randomised from approximately 20 general surgical units within the United Kingdom.Patients undergoing open or laparoscopic (more than a 5-cm midline incision) surgery for colorectal cancer, elective or emergency, are eligible.Patients under the age of 18 years, those having mesh inserted or undergoing musculofascial flap closure of the perineal defect in abdominoperineal wound closure, and those unable to give informed consent will be excluded.Patients will be randomised intraoperatively to either the Hughes Repair or standard mass closure.The primary outcome measure is the incidence of incisional hernias at 1 year as assessed by standardised clinical examination.The secondary outcomes include quality of life patient-reported outcome measures, cost-utility analysis, incidence of complete abdominal wound dehiscence and C-POSSUM scores.The incidence of incisional hernia at 1 year, assessed by computerised tomography, will form a tertiary outcome.DISCUSSION: A feasibility phase has been completed.The results of the study will be used to inform current and future practice and potentially reduce the risk of incisional hernia formation following midline incisions.TRIAL REGISTRATION: TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN 25616490 .Registered on 1 January 2012.",0,0,0,0
25884881,"The effect of individualized nutritional counseling on muscle mass and treatment outcome in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer undergoing chemotherapy: a randomized controlled trial protocol.BACKGROUND: A low muscle mass is prevalent in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) and has been associated with poor treatment outcome.Chemotherapeutic treatment has an additional unfavorable effect on muscle mass.Sufficient protein intake and physical activity are known to induce muscle protein anabolism in healthy individuals, however it is unclear whether optimal nutrition is effective to preserve muscle mass in patients with mCRC during first-line chemotherapy as well.We hypothesize that individual nutritional counseling by a trained dietitian during first-line chemotherapy is effective in preserving muscle mass and may improve clinical outcomes in patients with mCRC.METHODS/DESIGN: In this multi-center single-blind randomized controlled trial, patients with mCRC scheduled for first-line combination chemotherapy consisting of oxaliplatin and fluoropyrimidine, with or without bevacizumab (n = 110), will be randomized to receive either individualized nutritional counseling by a trained dietitian to achieve a sufficient dietary intake and an adequate physical activity level, or usual care.Outcome measures will be assessed at baseline and after two and four months of treatment.The primary endpoint will be the change in skeletal muscle area (measured by CT-scan) at the first treatment evaluation.Secondary endpoints will be quality of life, physical functioning, treatment toxicity, treatment intensity and survival.Statistical analyses include one-sided t-tests for the primary endpoint and mixed models and the Kaplan-Meier method for secondary endpoints.DISCUSSION: This randomized controlled trial will provide evidence whether individualized nutritional counseling during chemotherapy is effective in preventing loss of muscle mass in patients with mCRC.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01998152 ; Netherlands Trial Register NTR4223.",0,0,0,0

28692586,"Bioactivity and prostate tissue distribution of metformin in a preprostatectomy prostate cancer cohort.Metformin has recently been shown to have potential to reduce prostate cancer risk.We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine the modulating effects of metformin on tissue and systemic biomarkers of drug activity and its distribution into the prostate tissue.Twenty patients with prostate cancer scheduled to undergo prostatectomy were randomly assigned to receive either extended-release metformin or placebo for a median of 34 days before surgery.Prostatectomy and serum samples were analyzed for metformin concentrations, serum biomarkers of drug activity (prostate-specific antigen, insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3, sex hormone-binding globulin, and testosterone) and tissue biomarkers of proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, and mTOR inhibition.For participants in the metformin arm, the prostate tissue and serum metformin concentrations ranged from 0.88 to 51.2 mug/g tissue and from not detectable to 3.6 mug/ml, respectively.There were no differences between the two groups in either the postintervention tissue biomarker expression in the prostatectomy tissue or pre to postintervention changes in serum biomarkers.We conclude that metformin distributes to human prostate tissue, suggesting that metformin could exert its effects directly on tissue targets.However, there was no difference in tissue and systemic drug effect biomarkers between the two treatment arms.Future studies with longer intervention duration and larger sample size should be considered in order to evaluate the potential of metformin for prostate cancer prevention.",1,1,1,1
30071296,"Daily Versus Weekly Prostate Cancer Image Guided Radiation Therapy: Phase 3 Multicenter Randomized Trial.PURPOSE: The optimal frequency of prostate cancer image guided radiation therapy (IGRT) has not yet been clearly identified.This study sought to compare the safety and efficacy of daily versus weekly IGRT.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This phase 3 randomized trial recruited patients with N0 localized prostate cancer.The total IGRT doses in the prostate ranged from 70 Gy to 80 Gy, sparing the lymph nodes.Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to 2 prostate IGRT frequency groups: daily and weekly (ie, on days 1, 2, and 3 and then weekly).The primary outcome was 5-year recurrence-free survival.Secondary outcomes included overall survival and toxicity.Post hoc analyses included biochemical progression-free interval, clinical progression-free interval, and other cancer-free interval.RESULTS: Between June 2007 and November 2012, 470 men from 21 centers were randomized into the 2 groups.Median follow-up was 4.1 years.There was no statistically significant difference in recurrence-free survival between the groups (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.81; P = .330).Overall survival was worse in the daily group than in the weekly group (HR = 2.12 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03-4.37]; P = .042).Acute rectal bleeding (grade >/=1) was significantly lower in the daily group (6%) (n = 14) than in the weekly group (11%) (n = 26) (P = .014).Late rectal toxicity (grade >/=1) was significantly lower in the daily group (HR = 0.71 [95% CI, 0.53-0.96]; P = .027).Biochemical progression-free interval (HR = 0.45 [95% CI, 0.25 - 0.80]; P = .007) and clinical progression-free interval (HR = 0.50 [95% CI, 0.24-1.02]; P = .057) were better in the daily group, whereas other cancer-free interval was worse in the daily group (HR = 2.21 [95% CI, 1.10-4.44]; P = .026).CONCLUSIONS: Compared with weekly control, daily IGRT control in prostate cancer significantly improves biochemical progression-free and clinical progression-free interval, and rectal toxicity.",0,0,0,0
23425564,"Effect of everolimus on bone marker levels and progressive disease in bone in BOLERO-2.BACKGROUND: Breast Cancer Trials of Oral Everolimus 2 (BOLERO-2), a phase III study in postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer progressing despite nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor therapy, showed statistically significant benefits with adding everolimus to exemestane.Moreover, in preclinical studies, mammalian target of rapamycin inhibition was associated with decreased osteoclast survival and activity.Exploratory analyses in BOLERO-2 evaluated the effect of everolimus on bone marker levels and progressive disease in bone.METHODS: Patients were treated with exemestane (25mg/day) and randomized (2:1) to everolimus (10mg/day; combination) or placebo (exemestane only).Exploratory endpoints included changes in bone turnover marker levels vs baseline and progressive disease in bone, defined as unequivocal progression of a preexisting bone lesion or the appearance of a new bone lesion.RESULTS: Baseline disease characteristics were well balanced between arms (N = 724); baseline bisphosphonate use was not (43.9% combination vs 54.0% exemestane only).At a median of 18 months of follow-up, median progression-free survival (primary endpoint) was statistically significantly longer with the combination vs exemestane only (Cox proportional hazard ratio = 0.45, 95% confidence interval = 0.38 to 0.54; log-rank, 1-sided P < .0001).Bone marker levels at 6 and 12 weeks increased with exemestane only, as expected, but decreased with the combination.The cumulative incidence rate of progressive disease in bone was lower in the combination arm.Bone-related adverse events occurred with similar frequency in both arms (3.3% combination vs 4.2% exemestane only).CONCLUSION: These exploratory analyses suggest that everolimus has beneficial effects on bone turnover and progressive disease in bone in patients receiving exemestane for hormone receptor-positive breast cancer progressing during/after nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor therapy.",0,0,0,0
27589688,"Primary analysis of a prospective, randomized, single-blinded phase II trial evaluating the HER2 peptide GP2 vaccine in breast cancer patients to prevent recurrence.GP2 is a HER2-derived, HLA-A2+ restricted peptide.Phase I studies showed GP2 administered with GM-CSF to be safe and immunogenic.Here we report the primary analysis of a prospective, randomized, multicenter phase II adjuvant trial conducted to determine the vaccine's efficacy.The trial enrolled HLA-A2+, clinically disease-free, node-positive and high-risk node-negative breast cancer patients with tumors expressing HER2 (immunohistochemistry[IHC] 1+-3+).Patients were randomized to GP2+GM-CSF versus GM-CSF alone.Disease-free survival (DFS) was analyzed in intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-treatment cohorts; pre-specified subgroup analyses were performed for patients with IHC 3+ or FISH+ disease.The trial enrolled 180 patients; 89 received GP2+GM-CSF and 91 received GM-CSF alone.The groups were well-matched for clinicopathologic characteristics.Toxicities have been minimal.The Kaplan-Meier estimated 5-year DFS rate in the ITT analyses was 88% (95% CI:78-94%) in vaccinated vs. 81% (95% CI:69-89%) (P = 0.43) in control patients after a 34 month median follow-up.In the per-treatment analysis, the estimated 5-year DFS rates were 94% (95% CI:83-98%) and 85% (73-92%) (P = 0.17).In IHC 3+/FISH+ patients, the estimated 5-year DFS rate was 94% (82-98%) in vaccinated patients (n = 51) vs. 89% (71-96%) in control patients (n = 50), (P = 0.86) in the ITT analyses and 100% vs. 89% (71-96%) in vaccinated vs. control patients in the per-treatment analyses (P = 0.08).While the overall ITT analysis did not demonstrate benefit to vaccination, this trial confirmed that the GP2 vaccine is safe and suggests that vaccination may have clinical activity, particularly in patients with HER2 overexpression who received the full vaccine series (ie per-treatment group).",1,1,1,1

31628954,"Underwater versus conventional endoscopic resection of nondiminutive nonpedunculated colorectal lesions: a prospective randomized controlled trial (with video).BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Incomplete resection of colorectal neoplasia decreases the efficacy of colonoscopy.Conventional resection (CR) of polyps, performed in a gas-distended colon, is the current standard, but incomplete resection rates of approximately 2% to 30% for nondiminutive (>5 mm), nonpedunculated lesions are reported.Underwater resection (UR) is a novel technique.The aim of this study was to determine the incomplete resection rates of colorectal lesions removed by UR versus CR.METHODS: In a randomized controlled trial, patients with small (6-9 mm) and large (>/=10 mm) nonpedunculated lesions were assigned to CR (gas-distended lumen) or UR (water-filled, gas-excluded lumen).Small lesions in both arms were removed with a dedicated cold snare.For CR, large lesions were removed with a hot snare after submucosal injection.For UR, large lesions were removed with a hot snare without submucosal injection.Four-quadrant biopsy samples around the resection sites were used to evaluate for incomplete resection.RESULTS: Four hundred sixty-two eligible polyps (248 UR vs 214 CR) from 255 patients were removed.Incomplete resection rates for UR and CR were low and did not differ (2% vs 1.9%, P = .91).UR was performed significantly faster for lesions >/=10mm in size (10-19 mm, 2.9 minutes vs 5.6 minutes, P < .0001); >/=20 mm, 7.3 minutes vs 9.5 minutes, P = .015).CONCLUSIONS: Low incomplete resection rates are achievable with UR and CR.UR is effective and safe with the advantage of faster resection and potential cost savings for removal of larger (>/=10 mm) lesions by avoiding submucosal injection.As an added approach, UR has potential to improve the cost-effectiveness of colonoscopy by increasing efficiency and reducing cost while maintaining quality.(Clinical trial registration number: NCT02889679.).",0,0,0,0

29034009,"A multicenter, randomized study of decitabine as epigenetic priming with induction chemotherapy in children with AML.BACKGROUND: Decitabine is a deoxycytidine nucleoside derivative inhibitor of DNA-methyltransferases, which has been studied extensively and is approved for myelodysplastic syndrome in adults but with less focus in children.Accordingly, we conducted a phase 1 multicenter, randomized, open-label study to evaluate decitabine pre-treatment before standard induction therapy in children with newly diagnosed AML to assess safety and tolerability and explore a number of biologic endpoints.RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were fully assessable for all study objectives per protocol (10 in Arm A = epigenetic priming induction, 14 in Arm B = standard induction).All patients experienced neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.The most common grade 3 and 4 non-hematologic adverse events observed were gastrointestinal toxicities and hypophosphatemia.Plasma decitabine PK were similar to previously reported adult data.Overall CR/CRi was similar for the two arms.MRD negativity at end-induction was 85% in Arm A versus 67% in Arm B patients.DNA methylation measured in peripheral blood over the course of treatment tracked with blast clearance and matched marrow aspirates at day 0 and day 21.Unlike end-induction marrow analyses, promoter methylation in blood identified an apparent reversal of response in the lone treatment failure, 1 week prior to the patient's marrow aspirate confirming non-response.Decitabine-induced effects on end-induction (day 35-43 following initiation of treatment) marrows in Arm A were reflected by changes in DNA methylation in matched paired marrow diagnostic aspirates.CONCLUSIONS: This first-in-pediatrics trial demonstrates that decitabine prior to standard combination chemotherapy is feasible and well tolerated in children with newly diagnosed AML.Pre-treatment with decitabine may represent a newer therapeutic option for pediatric AML, especially as it appears to induce important epigenetic alterations.The novel biological correlates studied in this trial offer a clinically relevant window into disease progression and remission.Additional studies are needed to definitively assess whether decitabine can enhance durability responses in children with AML.TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT01177540.",1,1,1,1

24314223,"[Evaluation of induction chemotherapy with vinorelbine plus cisplatin (NP) or docetaxel plus cisplatin (TP) combined with concurrent chemoradiotherapy for patients with locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma].OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and side effects of induction chemotherapy with vinorelbine plus cisplatin (NP) or docetaxel plus cisplatin (TP) combined with concurrent chemoradiotherapy in treating locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).METHODS: From January 2005 to December 2009, 146 patients with locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma treated in our department were randomized into NP group (76 patients) or TP group (70 patients).Both groups received two cycles of induction chemotherapy and concurrent chemoradiotherapy.After three weeks of induction chemotherapy, the patients received concurrent chemoradiotherapy.The chemotherapy was recycled every three weeks.Two groups were treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy.RESULTS: The short-term efficacy of NP group was similar to that of TP group.The 3-year overall survival rates, disease-free-survival rates, locoregional relapse-free survival rates and distant metastasis-free survival rates in the NP and TP groups were 84.2% and 82.9%, 71.1% and 74.3%, 89.5% and 91.4%, 81.6% and 77.1%, respectively (P > 0.05).The occurrence rates of leucopenia, anemia and acute mucositis were significantly higher in the TP group than those in the NP group (P < 0.05).The gastrointestinal toxicity, dermatitis and liver toxicity were similar in the two groups.CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of NP regimen induction chemotherapy plus concurrent chemordiotherapy for advanced NPC is similar to that of TP regimen.The toxicity of the NP regimen is lower than that of NP regimen, tolerable, and with a good compliance.",1,1,1,1
23355041,"A randomized phase II study of gemcitabine and S-1 combination therapy versus gemcitabine monotherapy for advanced biliary tract cancer.PURPOSE: In order to confirm the impact of adding S-1 to gemcitabine, we conducted a randomized phase II study to compare the combination therapy of gemcitabine plus S-1 to gemcitabine monotherapy in patients with advanced biliary tract cancer.METHODS: Sixty-two patients with advanced cholangiocarcinoma or gallbladder cancer were randomized to either the combination therapy of gemcitabine and S-1 (gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 15 and S-1 40 mg/m(2) b.i.d.on days 1-14, repeated every 4 weeks) or gemcitabine monotherapy (gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m(2) on days 1, 8, and 15, repeated every 4 weeks).The primary endpoint of this study was response rate, and the regimen which showed the better response rate was selected as a candidate of phase III study.Tumor response was assessed every two cycles using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria version 1.0.RESULTS: The response rates of the combination therapy and the monotherapy were 20.0 and 9.4 %, respectively.The median time-to-progressions and overall survivals of these two treatments were nearly the same (5.6 vs. 4.3 months; 8.9 vs. 9.2 months).Adverse events occurred more frequently in the combination arm.CONCLUSIONS: The combination therapy of gemcitabine and S-1 showed the better response rate, but the superiority of this combination therapy was not clear in total.Because the standard of care changed to the combination therapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin during this study, it is difficult to select this combination therapy with a 4-week regimen as a candidate of phase III study.",1,1,1,1

27428073,"Phase II randomised trial of autologous tumour lysate dendritic cell plus best supportive care compared with best supportive care in pre-treated advanced colorectal cancer patients.BACKGROUND: Autologous tumour lysate dendritic cell vaccine (ADC) has T-cell stimulatory capacity and, therefore, potential antitumour activity.We designed a phase II randomised trial of ADC + best supportive care (BSC) (experimental arm [EA]) compared with BSC (control arm [CA]), in pre-treated metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with progressive mCRC, at least to two chemotherapy regimens and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) 0-2, were randomised to EA versus CA.Stratification criteria: ECOG PS (0-1 versus 2) and lactate dehydrogenase (<Upper Limit of Normal [ULN] versus >ULN).EA was administered subcutaneously till progressive disease.Primary end-point was progression-free survival (PFS) at 4 months.RESULTS: Fifty-two patients were included (28 EA/24 CA).An interim analysis recommended early termination for futility.No objective radiological response was observed in EA.Median PFS in EA was 2.7 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.3-3.2 months) versus 2.3 months (95% CI, 2.1-2.5 months) in CA (p = 0.628).Median overall survival (OS) was 6.2 months (95% CI, 4.4-7.9 months) in EA versus 4.7 months (95% CI, 2.3-7 months) in CA (p = 0.41).No ADC-related adverse events were reported.Immunization induces tumour-specific T-cell response in 21 of 25 (84%) patients.Responder patients have an OS of 7.3 months (95% CI, 5.2-9.4 months) versus 3.8 months (95% CI, 0.6-6.9 months) in non-responders; p = 0.026).CONCLUSION: Our randomised clinical trial comparing ADC + BSC versus BSC in mCRC demonstrates that ADC generates a tumour-specific immune response but not benefit on PFS and OS.Our results do not support the use of ADC alone, in a phase III trial.",1,1,1,1
29409923,"Hot snare polypectomy with or without saline solution/epinephrine lift for the complete resection of small colorectal polyps.BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The criteria for a standard polypectomy technique for complete removal of small colorectal polyps has not yet been established.This study aimed to compare the complete resection rate of hot snare polypectomy (HSP) with that of EMR for small, sessile, or flat polyps.METHODS: Patients with 5- to 9-mm non-pedunculated colorectal polyps were prospectively randomized to the HSP or EMR group.The presence of residual polyps was assessed by performing histologic assessment of 4-quadrant forceps biopsy specimens taken from the edges of the polypectomy site.The primary outcome was the complete resection rate after HSP or EMR; the secondary outcomes were the proportion of procedure-related adverse events and specimen-loss rate.Sample size was estimated using a superiority trial design.We assumed that the complete resection rate of the EMR group would be at least 8% higher than that of the HSP group.RESULTS: A total of 382 polyps in 269 patients were assessed and randomly assigned to each method using 4 x 4 block randomization.Of these, 353 polyps were finally analyzed based on the pathology results.The mean polyp size was 6.3 +/- 1.3 mm.The complete resection rate did not differ between the HSP and EMR groups (88.4% [152/172] vs 92.8% [168/181], respectively; P = .2).The intraprocedural bleeding rate, immediately after polypectomy, was significantly higher in the HSP group than in the EMR group (5.2% vs 0.6%, respectively; P = .009).However, clinically significant bleeding and tissue retrieval failure rates did not differ between the groups.In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, sessile serrated adenoma/polyps or hyperplastic polyps were almost 3 times (odds ratio, 2.824; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-7.75; P = .044) more likely to be incompletely resected compared with other conventional adenomatous polyps.Except for pathology, we found no significant independent predictors for incomplete resection.CONCLUSION: EMR for small non-pedunculated colorectal polyps is not superior to HSP in terms of complete resection or safety.Both methods can be performed according to the endoscopist's preference.(Clinical trial registration number: KCT0001640; cris.nih.go.kr.).",0,0,0,0

30902613,"Updated Efficacy and Safety Data and Impact of the EML4-ALK Fusion Variant on the Efficacy of Alectinib in Untreated ALK-Positive Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer in the Global Phase III ALEX Study.INTRODUCTION: At the prior data cutoff (February 9, 2017) the ALEX trial showed superior investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) for alectinib versus crizotinib in untreated, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive, advanced NSCLC (hazard ratio = 0.47, 95% confidence interval: 0.34-0.65, p < 0.001).The median PFS in the alectinib arm was not reached versus 11.1 months with crizotinib.Retrospective analyses suggest that the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 gene-ALK variant (EML4-ALK) may influence ALK-inhibitor treatment benefit.We present updated analyses, including exploratory subgroup analysis by EML4-ALK variant, after an additional 10 months' follow-up (cutoff December 1, 2017).METHODS: Patients were randomized to receive twice-daily alectinib, 600 mg, or crizotinib, 250 mg, until disease progression, toxicity, death, or withdrawal.PFS was determined by the investigators.Baseline plasma and tissue biomarker samples were analyzed by using hybrid-capture, next-generation sequencing to determine EML4-ALK variant.RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were balanced.Investigator-assessed PFS was prolonged with alectinib (stratified hazard ratio = 0.43, 95% confidence interval: 0.32-0.58).The median PFS times were 34.8 months with alectinib and 10.9 months with crizotinib.EML4-ALK fusions were detectable in 129 patient plasma samples and 124 tissue samples; variants 1, 2, and 3/ab did not affect PFS, objective response rate, or duration of response.Investigator-assessed PFS was longer for alectinib than for crizotinib across EML4-ALK variants 1, 2, and 3a/b in plasma and tissue.Despite longer treatment duration (27.0 months in the case of alectinib versus 10.8 months in the case of crizotinib), the safety of alectinib compared favorably with that of crizotinib.CONCLUSION: Alectinib continues to demonstrate superior investigator-assessed PFS versus crizotinib in untreated ALK-positive NSCLC, irrespective of EML4-ALK variant.",1,1,1,1
26803435,"Body mass index and age are additional prognostic factors in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors.PURPOSE: Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are the preferred treatment drugs for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC).The aim of this study was to analyze prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) in patients with mRCC treated with TKIs.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical data on 155 patients enrolled in 5 clinical trials conducted at our hospital from 2006 to 2014 were reviewed retrospectively.All patients received first-line TKI therapy (sunitinib, sorafenib, pazopanib, or famitinib).Survival rates were determined by the Kaplan-Meier method.RESULTS: Median OS (mOS) was 36.2 months.A total of 4 of the 5 adverse prognostic factors identified by the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) were found to be independent predictors of shorter survival, anemia, hypercalcemia, lactate dehydrogenase>1.5xupper limit of normal, and diagnosis to treatment time<1 year.In addition, we found that age</=45 years (P = 0.002), low or high body mass index ([BMI]<19 or>30kg/m(2)) (P = 0.003), and presence of>/=3 metastatic sites (P = 0.000) were also independent adverse prognostic factors.According to the MSKCC model, the mOS time in the favorable-risk, intermediate-risk, and poor-risk groups were 46.6, 30.4 and 16.7 months, respectively (P = 0.005).When we integrated age and BMI into the MSKCC model to set up a 7-factor prognostic model, we found the mOS time for these 3 groups was 71.1, 41.6 and 15.3 months, respectively (P = 0.000).CONCLUSION: Age and BMI are additional independent prognostic factors for patients with mRCC receiving vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-targeted TKI treatment, and the MSKCC prognostic model is also applicable to them.A 7-factor prognostic model might help to identify patients with the best prognosis.Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.",0,0,0,0
22456329,"Endostatin inhibits angiogenesis in hepatocellular carcinoma after transarterial chemoembolization.BACKGROUND/AIMS: This study aims to investigate the influence of endostatin on angiogenesis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after transarterial chemoembolization (TACE).METHODOLOGY: Ninety-five patients with HCC were enrolled.Twenty-six patients received initial liver resection without preoperative TACE (non-TACE), 24 received preoperative TACE without endostatin (TACE), 22 received endostatin (15mg/m2) right after TACE intravenously (TACE-V) and 23 received endostatin (15mg/m2) through the hepatic artery during TACE (TACE-A).TACE was performed using Gemcitabine 1000mg/m2 (emulsified with lipiodol, 10-12mL), cisplatin 40 mg/m2 and 5-fluorouracil 500mg/m2 through the hepatic artery feeding the tumor.Patients received liver resection 4 weeks after second course of TACE.RESULTS: The mean microvessel density (MVD) was 32.23+/-12.71, 57.46+/-18.38, 44.36+/-15.13 and 43.48+/-15.59 in non-TACE, TACE, TACE-V and TACE-A group respectively.The positive rate of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression was 46.15%, 91.67%, 77.27% and 73.91% in non-TACE, TACE, TACE-V and TACE-A groups, respectively.Compared to the non-TACE group, MVD and VEGF expression in TACE, TACE-V and TACE-A groups were significantly higher (p<0.05).MVD and VEGF expression in the TACE-V and TACE-A groups were significantly lower than in the TACE group (p<0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Endostatin could significantly repress angiogenesis in HCC after TACE by down-regulating expression of VEGF.",0,0,0,0

28961845,"Borealis-1: a randomized, first-line, placebo-controlled, phase II study evaluating apatorsen and chemotherapy for patients with advanced urothelial cancer.Background: Five-year survival of patients with inoperable, advanced urothelial carcinoma treated with the first-line chemotherapy is 5%-15%.We assessed whether the Hsp27 inhibitor apatorsen combined with gemcitabine plus cisplatin (GC) could improve overall survival (OS) in these patients.Patients and methods: This placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase II trial randomized 183 untreated urothelial carcinoma patients (North America and Europe) to receive GC plus either placebo (N = 62), 600 mg apatorsen (N = 60), or 1000 mg apatorsen (N = 61).In the experimental arm, treatment included loading doses of apatorsen followed by up to six cycles of apatorsen plus GC.Patients receiving at least four cycles could continue apatorsen monotherapy as maintenance until progression or unacceptable toxicity.The primary end point was OS.Results: OS was not significantly improved in the single or combined 600- or 1000-mg apatorsen arms versus placebo [hazard ratio (HR), 0.86 and 0.90, respectively].Exploratory study of specific statistical modeling showed a trend for improved survival in patients with baseline poor prognostic features treated with 600 mg apatorsen compared with placebo (HR = 0.72).Landmark analysis of serum Hsp27 (sHsp27) levels showed a trend toward survival benefit for poor-prognosis patients in 600- and 1000-mg apatorsen arms who achieved lower area under the curve sHsp27 levels, compared with the placebo arm (HR = 0.45 and 0.62, respectively).Higher baseline circulating tumor cells (>/=5 cells/7.5 ml) was observed in patients with poor prognosis in correlation with poor survival.Treatment-emergent adverse events were manageable and more common in both apatorsen-treatment arms.Conclusions: Even though apatorsen combined with standard chemotherapy did not demonstrate a survival benefit in the overall study population, patients with poor prognostic features might benefit from this combination.Serum Hsp27 levels may act as a biomarker to predict treatment outcome.Further exploration of apatorsen in poor-risk patients is warranted.",1,1,1,1
21827579,"Comparison of success rates of 'transvaginal aspiration and tetracycline sclerotherapy' versus 'only aspiration' in the management of non-neoplastic ovarian cysts.AIM: To investigate the value of tetracycline sclerotherapy for management of recurrent or persisting non-neoplastic ovarian cysts in comparison to the aspiration without sclerotherapy.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ninety-six patients with proven non-neoplastic ovarian cysts were randomized into two groups.Group 1 patients underwent cyst aspiration together with tetracycline sclerotherapy (n=48).Group 2 patients underwent only cyst aspiration without tetracycline sclerotherapy (n=48).Then, all patients were followed up monthly with ultrasonography for 12months.The procedure was considered to have failed if the recurring cyst, detected by ultrasound, was 4cm in size or greater.RESULTS: There were no differences between the two groups regarding demographic data, initial cyst volume and tumor markers.Recurrence rates within 12months were 14.6% in group 1 and 50% in group 2 (P<0.001).CONCLUSION: Based on the recurrence rates, we suggest transvaginal aspiration together with tetracycline sclerotherapy rather than only simple transvaginal aspiration in the management of non-neoplastic ovarian cysts.",0,0,0,0
23497452,"A randomized trial to assess the biological activity of short-term (pre-surgical) fulvestrant 500 mg plus anastrozole versus fulvestrant 500 mg alone or anastrozole alone on primary breast cancer.INTRODUCTION: Fulvestrant shows dose-dependent biological activity.Greater estrogen-receptor (ER) blockade may feasibly be achieved by combining fulvestrant with anastrozole.This pre-surgical study compared fulvestrant plus anastrozole versus either agent alone in patients with ER-positive breast cancer.METHODS: In this double-blind, multicenter trial, 121 patients received fulvestrant 500 mg on Day 1 plus anastrozole 1 mg/day for 14 to 21 days (F + A); fulvestrant plus anastrozole placebo (F); or fulvestrant placebo plus anastrozole (A), 2 to 3 weeks before surgery.ER, progesterone-receptor (PgR) and Ki67 expression were determined from tumor biopsies before treatment and at surgery.RESULTS: A total of 103 paired samples were available (F, n = 35; F+A, n = 31; A, n = 37).All treatments significantly reduced mean ER expression from baseline (F: -41%, P = 0.0001; F + A: -39%, P = 0.0001; A: -13%, P = 0.0034).F and F + A led to greater reductions in ER versus A (both P = 0.0001); F + A did not lead to additional reductions versus F. PgR and Ki67 expression were significantly reduced with all treatments (means were -34% to -45%, and -75% to -85%, respectively; all P = 0.0001), with no differences between groups.CONCLUSIONS: In this short-term study, all treatments reduced ER expression, although F and F + A showed greater reductions than A. No significant differences were detected between the treatment groups in terms of PgR and Ki67 expression.No additional reduction in tumor biomarkers with combination treatment was observed, suggesting that F + A is unlikely to have further clinical benefit over F alone.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00259090.",1,1,1,1
28240635,"Comparison of the Timing of Hepatic Arterial Phase and Image Quality Using Test-Bolus and Bolus-Tracking Techniques in Gadolinium-Ethoxybenzyl-Diethylenetriamine Pentaacetic Acid-Enhanced Hepatic Dynamic Magnetic Resonance Imaging.OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare the image quality, the degree of artifacts and the percentage of timing of the optimal hepatic arterial phase (HAP) between test-bolus and bolus-tracking methods on gadolinium-ethoxybenzyl-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA)-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).METHODS: In this prospective study, 60 patients who underwent 3-dimensional dynamic Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced hepatic 3-T MRI were enrolled in this study.We randomly assigned the 30 patients to the bolus-tracking method, and another 30 patients to the test-bolus method.Signal-to-noise ratios of the liver and spleen in HAP were compared in the 2 groups.Two radiologists independently assessed the ratio of optimal timing of HAP and the degree of ringing and motion artifacts of the 2 protocols.RESULTS: The signal-to-noise ratios of the liver (24.0 [SD, 6.4] vs 20.4 [SD, 4.0]) and spleen (30.0 [SD, 13.3] vs 23.6 [SD, 9.9]) were significantly higher in the test-bolus protocol than in the bolus-tracking protocol.The ratio of optimal timing was also significantly higher with the test-bolus protocol than with the bolus-tracking protocol (76.7% vs 40.0%).The degree of ringing and motion artifacts of test-bolus protocol was significantly lower than that of the bolus-tracking protocol (P < 0.01).CONCLUSIONS: The test-bolus protocol in dynamic 3-T MRI can yield better qualitative image quality and more optimal timing of HAP images, while reducing the degree of artifacts compared with the bolus-tracking protocol.",1,0,0,0
23660628,"Correlation between eight-gene expression profiling and response to therapy of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients treated with thalidomide-dexamethasone incorporated into double autologous transplantation.We performed a molecular study aimed at identifying a gene expression profile (GEP) signature predictive of attainment of at least near complete response (CR) to thalidomide-dexamethasone (TD) as induction regimen in preparation for double autologous stem cell transplantation in 112 younger patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.A GEP supervised analysis was performed on a training set of 32 patients, allowing to identify 157 probe sets differentially expressed in patients with CR versus those failing CR to TD.We then generated an eight-gene GEP signature whose performance was subsequently validated in a training set of 80 patients.A correct prediction of response to TD was found in 71 % of the cases analyzed.The eight genes were downregulated in patients who achieved CR to TD.Comparisons between post-autotransplantation outcomes of the 44 non-CR-predicted patients and of the 36 CR-predicted patients showed that this latter subgroup had a statistically significant benefit in terms of higher rate of CR after autotransplant(s) and longer time to progression, event-free survival, and overall survival.These results can be an important first step to identify at diagnosis those patients who will respond more favourably to a particular treatment strategy.",0,0,0,0
24314223,"[Evaluation of induction chemotherapy with vinorelbine plus cisplatin (NP) or docetaxel plus cisplatin (TP) combined with concurrent chemoradiotherapy for patients with locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma].OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and side effects of induction chemotherapy with vinorelbine plus cisplatin (NP) or docetaxel plus cisplatin (TP) combined with concurrent chemoradiotherapy in treating locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).METHODS: From January 2005 to December 2009, 146 patients with locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma treated in our department were randomized into NP group (76 patients) or TP group (70 patients).Both groups received two cycles of induction chemotherapy and concurrent chemoradiotherapy.After three weeks of induction chemotherapy, the patients received concurrent chemoradiotherapy.The chemotherapy was recycled every three weeks.Two groups were treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy.RESULTS: The short-term efficacy of NP group was similar to that of TP group.The 3-year overall survival rates, disease-free-survival rates, locoregional relapse-free survival rates and distant metastasis-free survival rates in the NP and TP groups were 84.2% and 82.9%, 71.1% and 74.3%, 89.5% and 91.4%, 81.6% and 77.1%, respectively (P > 0.05).The occurrence rates of leucopenia, anemia and acute mucositis were significantly higher in the TP group than those in the NP group (P < 0.05).The gastrointestinal toxicity, dermatitis and liver toxicity were similar in the two groups.CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of NP regimen induction chemotherapy plus concurrent chemordiotherapy for advanced NPC is similar to that of TP regimen.The toxicity of the NP regimen is lower than that of NP regimen, tolerable, and with a good compliance.",1,1,1,1
31477558,"Aspirin as an adjuvant treatment for cancer: feasibility results from the Add-Aspirin randomised trial.BACKGROUND: Preclinical, epidemiological, and randomised data indicate that aspirin might prevent tumour development and metastasis, leading to reduced cancer mortality, particularly for gastro-oesophageal and colorectal cancer.Randomised trials evaluating aspirin use after primary radical therapy are ongoing.We present the pre-planned feasibility analysis of the run-in phase of the Add-Aspirin trial to address concerns about toxicity, particularly bleeding after radical treatment for gastro-oesophageal cancer.METHODS: The Add-Aspirin protocol includes four phase 3 randomised controlled trials evaluating the effect of daily aspirin on recurrence and survival after radical cancer therapy in four tumour cohorts: gastro-oesophageal, colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer.An open-label run-in phase (aspirin 100 mg daily for 8 weeks) precedes double-blind randomisation (for participants aged under 75 years, aspirin 300 mg, aspirin 100 mg, or matched placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio; for patients aged 75 years or older, aspirin 100 mg or matched placebo in a 2:1 ratio).A preplanned analysis of feasibility, including recruitment rate, adherence, and toxicity was performed.The trial is registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trials Number registry (ISRCTN74358648) and remains open to recruitment.FINDINGS: After 2 years of recruitment (October, 2015, to October, 2017), 3494 participants were registered (115 in the gastro-oesophageal cancer cohort, 950 in the colorectal cancer cohort, 1675 in the breast cancer cohort, and 754 in the prostate cancer cohort); 2719 (85%) of 3194 participants who had finished the run-in period proceeded to randomisation, with rates consistent across tumour cohorts.End of run-in data were available for 2253 patients; 2148 (95%) of the participants took six or seven tablets per week.11 (0.5%) of the 2253 participants reported grade 3 toxicity during the run-in period, with no upper gastrointestinal bleeding (any grade) in the gastro-oesophageal cancer cohort.The most frequent grade 1-2 toxicity overall was dyspepsia (246 [11%] of 2253 participants).INTERPRETATION: Aspirin is well-tolerated after radical cancer therapy.Toxicity has been low and there is no evidence of a difference in adherence, acceptance of randomisation, or toxicity between the different cancer cohorts.Trial recruitment continues to determine whether aspirin could offer a potential low cost and well tolerated therapy to improve cancer outcomes.FUNDING: Cancer Research UK, The National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment Programme, The MRC Clinical Trials Unit at UCL.",1,1,1,1
27228369,"Baseline AMH Level Associated With Ovulation Following Ovulation Induction in Women With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome.CONTEXT: Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) reduces aromatase activity and sensitivity of follicles to FSH stimulation.Therefore, elevated serum AMH may indicate a higher threshold for response to ovulation induction in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).OBJECTIVE: This study sought to determine the association between AMH levels and ovulatory response to treatment among the women enrolled into the Pregnancy in PCOS II (PPCOS II) trial.DESIGN AND SETTING: This was a secondary analysis of data from a randomized clinical trial in academic health centers throughout the United States Participants: A total of 748 women age 18-40 years, with PCOS and measured AMH levels at baseline, were included in this study.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Couples were followed for up to five treatment cycles to determine ovulation (midluteal serum progesterone > 5 ng/mL) and the dose required to achieve ovulation.RESULTS: A lower mean AMH and AMH per follicle was observed among women who ovulated compared with women who never achieved ovulation during the study (geometric mean AMH, 5.54 vs 7.35 ng/mL; P = .0001; geometric mean AMH per follicle, 0.14 vs 0.18; P = .01) after adjustment for age, body mass index, T, and insulin level.As AMH levels increased, the dose of ovulation induction medication needed to achieve ovulation also increased.No associations were observed between antral follicle count and ovulation.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that high serum AMH is associated with a reduced response to ovulation induction among women with PCOS.Women with higher AMH levels may require higher doses of medication to achieve ovulation.",0,0,0,0

24123482,"Mediators of physical exercise for improvement in cancer survivors' quality of life.OBJECTIVE: Mediating mechanisms of a 12-week group-based exercise intervention on cancer survivors' quality of life (QoL) were examined to inform future exercise intervention development.METHODS: Two hundred nine cancer survivors >/= 3 months posttreatment (57% breast cancer) aged 49.5 (+/- 10.4) years were assigned to physical exercise (n = 147) or wait-list control (n = 62).QoL, fatigue, emotional distress, physical activity, general self-efficacy and mastery were assessed at baseline and post-intervention using questionnaires.Path analysis was conducted using Mplus to explore whether improved physical activity, general self-efficacy and mastery mediated the effects of exercise on fatigue and distress and consequently QoL. RESULTS: The intervention was associated with increased physical activity (beta = 0.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.14;0.59), general self-efficacy (beta = 2.41, 95%CI = 0.35;4.73), and mastery (beta = 1.75, 95%CI = 0.36;2.78).Further, the intervention had both a direct effect on fatigue (beta = -1.09, 95%CI = -2.12;0.01), and an indirect effect (beta = -0.54, 95%CI = -1.00;-0.21) via physical activity (beta = -0.29, 95%CI = -0.64;-0.07) and general self-efficacy (beta = -0.25, 95%CI = -0.61;-0.05).The intervention had a borderline significant direct effect on reduced distress (beta = -1.32, 95%CI = -2.68;0.11), and a significant indirect effect via increased general self-efficacy and mastery (beta = -1.06, 95%CI = -1.89;-0.38).Reductions in fatigue (beta = -1.33, 95%CI =-1.85;-0.83) and distress (beta = -0.86, 95%CI = -1.25;-0.52) were associated with improved QoL. Further, increased physical activity was directly associated with improved QoL (beta = 3.37, 95%CI = 1.01;5.54).CONCLUSION: The beneficial effect of group-based physical exercise on QoL was mediated by increased physical activity, general self-efficacy and mastery, and subsequent reductions in fatigue and distress.In addition to physical activity, future interventions should target self-efficacy and mastery.This may lead to reduced distress and fatigue, and consequently improved QoL of cancer survivors.",1,1,0,0

31157963,"Maintenance Olaparib for Germline BRCA-Mutated Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer.BACKGROUND: Patients with a germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation make up a small subgroup of those with metastatic pancreatic cancer.The poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor olaparib has had antitumor activity in this population.METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial to evaluate the efficacy of olaparib as maintenance therapy in patients who had a germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation and metastatic pancreatic cancer and disease that had not progressed during first-line platinum-based chemotherapy.Patients were randomly assigned, in a 3:2 ratio, to receive maintenance olaparib tablets (300 mg twice daily) or placebo.The primary end point was progression-free survival, which was assessed by blinded independent central review.RESULTS: Of the 3315 patients who underwent screening, 154 underwent randomization and were assigned to a trial intervention (92 to receive olaparib and 62 to receive placebo).The median progression-free survival was significantly longer in the olaparib group than in the placebo group (7.4 months vs. 3.8 months; hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.35 to 0.82; P = 0.004).An interim analysis of overall survival, at a data maturity of 46%, showed no difference between the olaparib and placebo groups (median, 18.9 months vs. 18.1 months; hazard ratio for death, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.56 to 1.46; P = 0.68).There was no significant between-group difference in health-related quality of life, as indicated by the overall change from baseline in the global quality-of-life score (on a 100-point scale, with higher scores indicating better quality of life) based on the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (between-group difference, -2.47 points; 95% CI, -7.27 to 2.33).The incidence of grade 3 or higher adverse events was 40% in the olaparib group and 23% in the placebo group (between-group difference, 16 percentage points; 95% CI, -0.02 to 31); 5% and 2% of the patients, respectively, discontinued the trial intervention because of an adverse event.CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with a germline BRCA mutation and metastatic pancreatic cancer, progression-free survival was longer with maintenance olaparib than with placebo.(Funded by AstraZeneca and others; POLO ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02184195.).",1,1,1,1
30612238,"A new model of early, integrated palliative care: palliative rehabilitation for newly diagnosed patients with non-resectable cancer.PURPOSE: The aim of this paper is to describe a model of palliative rehabilitation for newly diagnosed advanced cancer patients and present data on how it was utilised during a randomised controlled trial (RCT).METHODS: We designed a highly flexible, multidisciplinary model of palliative rehabilitation consisting of a ""basic offer"" and tailored elements.The model was evaluated in the setting on an RCT investigating the effect of systematic referral to a palliative rehabilitation clinic concurrently with standard oncology treatment or standard treatment alone.The basic offer of palliative rehabilitation was two consultations and a 12-week possibility of contacting a palliative rehabilitation team, if needed.In addition, patients and family caregivers could be offered participation in a 12-week patient/caregiver school combined with individually tailored physical exercise in groups, individual consultations, or both.Contacts with the palliative rehabilitation team and participant evaluation were registered prospectively.RESULTS: Between December 2014 and December 2017, 132 adults with newly diagnosed advanced cancer were seen in the palliative rehabilitation outpatient clinic.Twenty percent of the participants received the basic offer only (n = 26), 45% additionally participated in the group program (n = 59), and 35% received supplementary individual consultations without participating in the group program (n = 47).The intervention was primarily led by nurses, and the main themes of the individual consultations were coping, pain, and nutrition.When asked if they would recommend the intervention to others in the same situation, 93% of the respondents agreed, 7% partly agreed, and no one disagreed.CONCLUSION: The new model of palliative rehabilitation presented here had a flexibility to meet the needs of the participants and led to a very high degree of patient satisfaction.It could serve as an inspiration to other cancer centres wanting to integrate palliative care into standard oncology services.",0,0,0,0
23310947,"Body mass index at diagnosis and survival among colon cancer patients enrolled in clinical trials of adjuvant chemotherapy.BACKGROUND: Although obesity is an established risk factor for developing colon cancer, its prognostic impact and relation to patient sex in colon cancer survivors remains unclear.METHODS: The authors examined the prognostic and predictive impact of the body mass index (BMI) in patients with stage II and III colon carcinoma (N = 25,291) within the Adjuvant Colon Cancer Endpoints (ACCENT) database.BMI was measured at enrollment in randomized trials of 5-fluorouracil-based adjuvant chemotherapy.Association of BMI with the time to recurrence (TTR), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) were determined using Cox regression models.Statistical tests were 2-sided.RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 7.8 years, obese and underweight patients had significantly poorer survival compared with overweight and normal-weight patients.In a multivariable analysis, the adverse prognostic impact of BMI was observed among men but not among women (Pinteraction = .0129).Men with class 2 and 3 obesity (BMI >/= 35.0 kg/m(2) ) had a statistically significant reduction in DFS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.16; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.33; P = .0297) compared with normal-weight patients.Underweight patients had a significantly shorter TTR and reduced DFS (HR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.09-1.28; P < .0001) that was more significant among men (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.15-1.50; P < .0001) than among women (HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.01-1.23; P = .0362; Pinteraction = .0340).BMI was not predictive of a benefit from adjuvant treatment.CONCLUSIONS: Obesity and underweight status were associated independently with inferior outcomes in patients with colon cancer who received treatment in adjuvant chemotherapy trials.",0,0,0,0
22474202,"Effect of oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and leucovorin with or without cetuximab on survival among patients with resected stage III colon cancer: a randomized trial.CONTEXT: Leucovorin, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) is the standard adjuvant therapy for resected stage III colon cancer.Adding cetuximab to FOLFOX benefits patients with metastatic wild-type KRAS but not mutated KRAS colon cancer.OBJECTIVE: To assess the potential benefit of cetuximab added to the modified sixth version of the FOLFOX regimen (mFOLFOX6) in patients with resected stage III wild-type KRAS colon cancer.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A randomized trial of 2686 patients aged 18 years or older at multiple institutions across North America enrolled following resection and informed consent between February 10, 2004, and November 25, 2009.The primary randomized comparison was 12 biweekly cycles of mFOLFOX6 with and without cetuximab.KRAS mutation status was centrally determined.The trial was halted after a planned interim analysis of 48% of predicted events (246/515) occurring in 1863 (of 2070 planned) patients with tumors having wild-type KRAS.A total of 717 patients with mutated KRAS and 106 with indeterminate KRAS were accrued.The 2070 patients with wild-type KRAS provided 90% power to detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.33 (2-sided alpha = .05), with planned interim efficacy analyses after 25%, 50%, and 75% of expected relapses.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Disease-free survival in patients with wild-type KRAS mutations.Secondary end points included overall survival and toxicity.RESULTS: Median (range) follow-up was 28 (0-68) months.The trial demonstrated no benefit when adding cetuximab.Three-year disease-free survival for mFOLFOX6 alone was 74.6% vs 71.5% with the addition of cetuximab (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.98-1.49; P = .08) in patients with wild-type KRAS, and 67.1% vs 65.0% (HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.86-1.46; P = .38) in patients with mutated KRAS, with no significant benefit in any subgroups assessed.Among all patients, grade 3 or higher adverse events (72.5% vs 52.3%; odds ratio [OR], 2.4; 95% CI, 2.1-2.8; P < .001) and failure to complete 12 cycles (33% vs 23%; OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.4-1.9; P < .001) were significantly higher with cetuximab.Increased toxicity and greater detrimental differences in all outcomes were observed in patients aged 70 years or older.CONCLUSION: Among patients with stage III resected colon cancer, the use of cetuximab with adjuvant mFOLFOX6 compared with mFOLFOX6 alone did not result in improved disease-free survival.TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00079274.",1,1,1,1
24882434,"Olaparib maintenance therapy in patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed serous ovarian cancer: a preplanned retrospective analysis of outcomes by BRCA status in a randomised phase 2 trial.BACKGROUND: Maintenance monotherapy with the PARP inhibitor olaparib significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) versus placebo in patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent serous ovarian cancer.We aimed to explore the hypothesis that olaparib is most likely to benefit patients with a BRCA mutation.METHODS: We present data from the second interim analysis of overall survival and a retrospective, preplanned analysis of data by BRCA mutation status from our randomised, double-blind, phase 2 study that assessed maintenance treatment with olaparib 400 mg twice daily (capsules) versus placebo in patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent serous ovarian cancer who had received two or more platinum-based regimens and who had a partial or complete response to their most recent platinum-based regimen.Randomisation was by an interactive voice response system, stratified by time to progression on penultimate platinum-based regimen, response to the most recent platinum-based regimen before randomisation, and ethnic descent.The primary endpoint was PFS, analysed for the overall population and by BRCA status.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00753545.FINDINGS: Between Aug 28, 2008, and Feb 9, 2010, 136 patients were assigned to olaparib and 129 to placebo.BRCA status was known for 131 (96%) patients in the olaparib group versus 123 (95%) in the placebo group, of whom 74 (56%) versus 62 (50%) had a deleterious or suspected deleterious germline or tumour BRCA mutation.Of patients with a BRCA mutation, median PFS was significantly longer in the olaparib group than in the placebo group (11.2 months [95% CI 8.3-not calculable] vs 4.3 months [3.0-5.4]; HR 0.18 [0.10-0.31]; p<0.0001); similar findings were noted for patients with wild-type BRCA, although the difference between groups was lower (7.4 months [5.5-10.3] vs 5.5 months [3.7-5.6]; HR 0.54 [0.34-0.85]; p=0.0075).At the second interim analysis of overall survival (58% maturity), overall survival did not significantly differ between the groups (HR 0.88 [95% CI 0.64-1.21]; p=0.44); similar findings were noted for patients with mutated BRCA (HR 0.73 [0.45-1.17]; p=0.19) and wild-type BRCA (HR 0.99 [0.63-1.55]; p=0.96).The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events in the olaparib group were fatigue (in ten [7%] patients in the olaparib group vs four [3%] in the placebo group) and anaemia (seven [5%] vs one [<1%]).Serious adverse events were reported in 25 (18%) patients who received olaparib and 11 (9%) who received placebo.Tolerability was similar in patients with mutated BRCA and the overall population.INTERPRETATION: These results support the hypothesis that patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent serous ovarian cancer with a BRCA mutation have the greatest likelihood of benefiting from olaparib treatment.FUNDING: AstraZeneca.",1,1,1,1
29733908,"The Impact of Staging by Positron-Emission Tomography on Overall Survival and Progression-Free Survival in Patients With Locally Advanced NSCLC.INTRODUCTION: We investigated the potential impact of stage migration because of positron-emission tomography (PET) scan staging on survival in the locally advanced (stage IIIA/B) NSCLC setting.METHODS: In PROCLAIM, 598 patients with stage IIIA/B nonsquamous NSCLC (intent-to-treat population) were randomized to either pemetrexed plus cisplatin and concurrent thoracic radiotherapy for 3 cycles followed by 4 cycles of pemetrexed consolidation or etoposide plus cisplatin and concurrent thoracic radiotherapy for 2 cycles followed by a consolidation platinum-based doublet regimen for up to 2 cycles.Baseline PET scan (PET Yes versus No) was one of the stratification factors.Subgroup analyses (PET Yes versus No) of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were conducted on the intent-to-treat population regardless of treatment, as the study did not show superior efficacy for either arm.RESULTS: Majority (491 of 598; 82.1%) of patients had a baseline PET scan staging performed.A longer median OS (PET Yes versus No: 27.2 versus 20.8; hazard ratio = 0.81, p = 0.130) and an improved median PFS (PET Yes versus No: 11.3 versus 9.2; hazard ratio = 0.73, p = 0.012) were observed for patients with PET scans compared to those with conventional staging in both treatment arms.CONCLUSIONS: Both a significantly improved PFS and a numerically longer OS in the PET Yes subgroup, compared to patients with conventional staging, are consistent with improved survival due to stage migration.The magnitude of differences in OS and PFS based on PET scan is a reminder of the potential for factors other than the therapeutic intervention to affect outcomes.",1,1,1,1

31790344,"Pembrolizumab As Second-Line Therapy in Patients With Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma in KEYNOTE-240: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Phase III Trial.PURPOSE: Pembrolizumab demonstrated antitumor activity and safety in the phase II KEYNOTE-224 trial in previously treated patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).KEYNOTE-240 evaluated the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab in this population.PATIENTS AND METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, phase III study was conducted at 119 medical centers in 27 countries.Eligible patients with advanced HCC, previously treated with sorafenib, were randomly assigned at a two-to-one ratio to receive pembrolizumab plus best supportive care (BSC) or placebo plus BSC.Primary end points were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS; one-sided significance thresholds, P = .0174 [final analysis] and P = .002 [first interim analysis], respectively).Safety was assessed in all patients who received >/= 1 dose of study drug.RESULTS: Between May 31, 2016, and November 23, 2017, 413 patients were randomly assigned.As of January 2, 2019, median follow-up was 13.8 months for pembrolizumab and 10.6 months for placebo.Median OS was 13.9 months (95% CI, 11.6 to 16.0 months) for pembrolizumab versus 10.6 months (95% CI, 8.3 to 13.5 months) for placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 0.781; 95% CI, 0.611 to 0.998; P = .0238).Median PFS for pembrolizumab was 3.0 months (95% CI, 2.8 to 4.1 months) versus 2.8 months (95% CI, 2.5 to 4.1 months) for placebo at the first interim analysis (HR, 0.775; 95% CI, 0.609 to 0.987; P = .0186) and 3.0 months (95% CI, 2.8 to 4.1 months) versus 2.8 months (95% CI, 1.6 to 3.0 months) at final analysis (HR, 0.718; 95% CI, 0.570 to 0.904; P = .0022).Grade 3 or higher adverse events occurred in 147 (52.7%) and 62 patients (46.3%) for pembrolizumab versus placebo; those that were treatment related occurred in 52 (18.6%) and 10 patients (7.5%), respectively.No hepatitis C or B flares were identified.CONCLUSION: In this study, OS and PFS did not reach statistical significance per specified criteria.The results are consistent with those of KEYNOTE-224, supporting a favorable risk-to-benefit ratio for pembrolizumab in this population.",1,1,1,1
29727544,"[Clinical efficacy of integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine for castration-resistant prostate cancer].Objective: To investigate the clinical effects of integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine in the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).METHODS: A total of 54 CRPC patients were randomly divided into a control and a trial group, all treated by endocrine therapy (oral Bicalutamide at 50 mg per d plus subcutaneous injection of Goserelin at 3.6 mg once every 4 wk) and chemotherapy (intravenous injection of Docetaxel at 75 mg/m2 once every 3 wk plus oral Prednisone at 5 mg bid), while the latter group by Fuyang Huayu Prescription (a Traditional Chinese Medicine TCM prescription for tonifying yang and dispersing blood stasis) in addition, for a course of 24 weeks.Comparisons were made between the two groups of patients in the level of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA), Karnofsky physical condition scores, function assessment of cancer therapy-prostate (FACT-P) scores, and TCM symptoms scores before and after 12 or 24 weeks of treatment.RESULTS: Compared with the baseline, the serum PSA level was significantly decreased after 12 weeks of treatment both in the control (25.9 +/- 39.3 vs 20.0 +/- 21.1 mug/L, P <0.05) and in the trial group (22.1 +/- 33.9 vs 17.9 +/- 19.1 mug/L, P <0.05), with no statistically significant differences between the two groups (P >0.05).At 24 weeks, however, the PSA levels in the control and trial groups were slightly increased to (23.1 +/- 28.4) and (19.6 +/- 23.5) mug/L, respectively, with no statistically significant differences in between (P >0.05).Karnofsky, FACT-P and TCM symptoms scores were all markedly improved in the trial group after 12 weeks of treatment (P <0.05) and remained stable at 24 weeks, but not in the control group either at 12 or at 24 weeks (P >0.05).CONCLUSIONS: TCM Fuyang Huayu Prescription combined with endocrine therapy and chemotherapy is effective for CRPC.",0,0,0,0
23374147,"Immunomodulatory effects of total intravenous and balanced inhalation anesthesia in patients with bladder cancer undergoing elective radical cystectomy: preliminary results.BACKGROUND: Although surgery and anesthesia induce immunesuppression, remains largely unknown whether various anesthetic techniques have different immunosuppressive effects on cancer patients.Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the influence of total intravenous anesthesia with target-controlled infusion (TIVA-TCI) and balanced inhalation anesthesia (BAL) on the peri-operative levels of inflammatory cytokines and regulatory T cells (Tregs) in patients with bladder cancer undergoing surgery.METHODS: Twenty eight consecutive patients with bladder cancer who underwent radical cystectomy were prospectively randomized into two groups to receive TIVA-TCI (n = 14) or BAL (n = 14).Before the induction of anesthesia (T0), 6-8 hours (T1) post-surgery, and 5 days post-surgery (T2), Tregs and serum levels of interleukin -1beta (IL-1beta), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin -2 (IL-2), interleukin -6 (IL-6), and interleukin -10 (IL-10) were measured.RESULTS: In the peri-operative period all cancer patients showed a marked and significant increase in IL-6.Moreover, TIVA-TCI patients also showed a higher increase in IFN-gamma, whereas in BAL patients Tregs were reduced by approximately 30% during surgery.The incidence of infections, metastases, and death was similar in both groups.CONCLUSIONS: The increase in the Th1 response in the TIVA-TCI group and the reduction in Tregs in the BAL group seem to balance the immunosuppressive effect induced by IL-6.Therefore TIVA-TCI and BAL can be both used in major surgery in patients with bladder cancer without worsening the outcome.",0,0,0,0
24575793,"Multicenter randomized, open-label phase II trial of sequential erlotinib and gemcitabine compared with gemcitabine monotherapy as first-line therapy in elderly or ECOG PS two patients with advanced NSCLC.AIM: The potential beneficial interaction between erlotinib and chemotherapy may require sequencing or pharmacodynamic separation.The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerance of sequential erlotinib and gemcitabine versus gemcitabine monotherapy as first-line therapy in elderly or ECOG PS-2 patients with advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma.METHODS: The primary objective of this multicenter randomized Phase II study was progression-free survival (PFS).Secondary objectives were overall response rate (ORR), disease control rate, response duration, overall survival and safety.Patients were randomized to either gemcitabine (1250 mg/m2 Day 1, 8 q28 days) followed by erlotinib (150 mg/day on day 15 through day 28), (EG-arm), or gemcitabine monotherapy (1000 mg/m2 Days 1, 8, 15 q28 days), (G-arm) for up to six cycles.RESULTS: Fifty-four patients were recruited, 28 G-arm and 26 EG-arm.Overall, efficacy results were not significantly different between study arms.Median PFS and ORR for the G- versus EG-arms were 8.0 versus 10.3 weeks (hazard ratio 1.3; 95% confidence interval [0.63;2.68]; P=0.48) and 7.1 versus 3.8 percent respectively (difference -3.30; 95% confidence interval [-17.5;10.9]).The majority of adverse events (AEs) in both arms were Grade 1-2.The commonest AEs recorded in the EG- and G-arms were rash-like events (65 percent) and nausea (42 percent) respectively.Four patients (17 percent) in EG-arm and five (16 percent) in G-arm experienced at least one treatment-related serious AE.CONCLUSIONS: In this study, patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma at ECOG PS-2 or aged >/=70 years derived no efficacy advantage from sequential erlotinib in combination with gemcitabine relative to gemcitabine alone.No unexpected safety findings were noted.",0,0,0,0
27951450,"Dose-dense adjuvant chemotherapy in premenopausal breast cancer patients: A pooled analysis of the MIG1 and GIM2 phase III studies.BACKGROUND: No evidence exists to recommend a specific chemotherapy regimen in young breast cancer patients.We performed a pooled analysis of two randomised clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of adjuvant dose-dense chemotherapy in premenopausal breast cancer patients and its impact on the risk of treatment-induced amenorrhoea.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the MIG1 study, node-positive or high-risk node-negative patients were randomised to 6 cycles of fluorouracil/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide every 2 (dose-dense) or 3 (standard-interval) weeks.In the GIM2 study, node-positive patients were randomised to 4 cycles of dose-dense or standard-interval EC or FEC followed by 4 cycles of dose-dense or standard-interval paclitaxel.Using individual patient data, the hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival by means of a Cox proportional hazards model and the odds ratio for treatment-induced amenorrhoea through a logistic regression model were calculated for each study.A meta-analysis of the two studies was performed using the random effect model to compute the parameter estimates.RESULTS: A total of 1,549 patients were included.Dose-dense chemotherapy was associated with a significant improved overall survival as compared to standard-interval chemotherapy (HR, 0.71; 95% confidence intervals [CI], 0.54-0.95; p = 0.021).The pooled HRs were 0.78 (95% CI, 0.54-1.12) and 0.65 (95% CI, 0.40-1.06) for patients with hormone receptor-positive and -negative tumours, respectively (interaction p = 0.330).No increased risk of treatment-induced amenorrhoea was observed with dose-dense chemotherapy (odds ratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.80-1.25; p = 0.989).CONCLUSION: Dose-dense adjuvant chemotherapy may be considered the preferred treatment option in high-risk premenopausal breast cancer patients.",1,1,1,1

31520215,"Inverse association between changes in energetic cost of walking and vertical accelerations in non-metastatic breast cancer survivors.PURPOSE: With accelerometry, the utility to detect changes in physical activity are predicated on the assumption that walking energetics and gait mechanics do not change.The present work examined associations between changes () in walking energetics, exercise self-efficacy, and several accelerometer-derived metrics.METHODS: Secondary analyses were performed among a sub-sample (n = 29) of breast cancer survivors participating in a larger randomized trial.During 4 min of treadmill walking (0.89 m s(-1), 0% grade), indirect calorimetry quantified steady-state energy expenditure (EE), wherein, participants were fitted with a heart rate monitor and hip-worn triaxial accelerometer.Exercise self-efficacy was measured using a 9-item questionnaire, while vector magnitude (VM) and individual planes (e.g., mediolateral, vertical, and anteroposterior) of the movement were extracted for data analyses.Evaluations were made at baseline and after 3 months.RESULTS: From baseline to 3 months, the energetic cost of walking (kcals min(-1)) significantly decreased by an average of - 5.1% (p = 0.001; d = 0.46).Conversely, VM significantly increased (p = 0.007; d = 0.53), exclusively due to greater vertical accelerations (acc) (+ 5.7 +/- 7.8 acc; p = 0.001; d = 0.69).Changes in vertical accelerations were inversely and positively associated with walking EE (r = - 0.37; p = 0.047) and exercise self-efficacy (r = 0.39; p = 0.034), respectively.CONCLUSION: Hip-worn accelerometers do not appear well-suited to correctly detect changes in ease of walking as evidenced by reduced energetic cost.Further research should determine if a divergence between measured EE and vertical accelerations could contribute to erroneous inferences in free-living physical activity.",0,0,0,0

28412590,"Baseline carcinoembryonic antigen as a predictive factor of ramucirumab efficacy in RAISE, a second-line metastatic colorectal carcinoma phase III trial.BACKGROUND: The RAISE phase III clinical trial demonstrated that ramucirumab + (folinic acid plus 5-fluorouracil plus irinotecan) FOLFIRI significantly improved overall survival (OS) versus placebo + FOLFIRI for second-line metastatic colorectal carcinoma (mCRC) patients failing bevacizumab- and oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.73-0.98, P = 0.022).Post hoc analyses of RAISE patient data examined the association of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) subgroups with efficacy parameters.METHODS: CEA subgroups (</=10 versus >10 ng/ml) were based on 2X upper limit of normal (ULN) (5 ng/ml).The Kaplan-Meier method estimated the median OS and the progression-free survival (PFS).Log-rank test compared the survival distributions within the subgroups.Hazard ratio (HR) (95% confidence interval [CI]) and treatment-by-subgroup interaction p-values were calculated by Cox proportional hazards model.RESULTS: Ramucirumab treatment prolonged survival for the CEA </=10 subgroup (HR = 0.68; 95% CI = 0.50-0.92; P = 0.013) and CEA >10 subgroup (HR = 0.90; 95% CI = 0.76-1.07; P = 0.233).However, the ramucirumab OS benefit over placebo was greater for the CEA </=10 subgroup than for the CEA >10 subgroup (median OS: 3.6 versus 0.8 months greater, respectively).The interaction P-value between CEA level and treatment effect on OS was 0.088.This trend was observed across randomisation strata and to a lesser extent for PFS (P = 0.594).CONCLUSIONS: Although patients in both high- and low-CEA subgroups derive OS and PFS benefits from ramucirumab treatment, the low baseline CEA level may identify a subgroup of patients with mCRC who obtain greater benefit from ramucirumab.",1,1,1,1
26819451,"Next-Generation Sequencing in Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma Highlights Molecular Divergence and Therapeutic Opportunities: a LYSA Study.PURPOSE: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has detailed the genomic characterization of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) by identifying recurrent somatic mutations.We set out to design a clinically feasible NGS panel focusing on genes whose mutations hold potential therapeutic impact.Furthermore, for the first time, we evaluated the prognostic value of these mutations in prospective clinical trials.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A Lymphopanel was designed to identify mutations in 34 genes, selected according to literature and a whole exome sequencing study of relapsed/refractory DLBCL patients.The tumor DNA of 215 patients with CD20(+)de novo DLBCL in the prospective, multicenter, and randomized LNH-03B LYSA clinical trials was sequenced to deep, uniform coverage with the Lymphopanel.Cell-of-origin molecular classification was obtained through gene expression profiling with HGU133+2.0 Affymetrix GeneChip arrays.RESULTS: The Lymphopanel was informative for 96% of patients.A clear depiction of DLBCL subtype molecular heterogeneity was uncovered with the Lymphopanel, confirming that activated B-cell-like (ABC), germinal center B-cell like (GCB), and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBL) are frequently affected by mutations in NF-kappaB, epigenetic, and JAK-STAT pathways, respectively.Novel truncating immunity pathway, ITPKB, MFHAS1, and XPO1 mutations were identified as highly enriched in PMBL.Notably, TNFAIP3 and GNA13 mutations in ABC patients treated with R-CHOP were associated with significantly less favorable prognoses.CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the contribution of NGS with a consensus gene panel to personalized therapy in DLBCL, highlighting the molecular heterogeneity of subtypes and identifying somatic mutations with therapeutic and prognostic impact.Clin Cancer Res; 22(12); 2919-28.(c)2016 AACRSee related commentary by Lim and Elenitoba-Johnson, p. 2829.",0,0,0,0
29573941,"Encorafenib plus binimetinib versus vemurafenib or encorafenib in patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma (COLUMBUS): a multicentre, open-label, randomised phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Combined BRAF-MEK inhibitor therapy is the standard of care for BRAF(V600)-mutant advanced melanoma.We investigated encorafenib, a BRAF inhibitor with unique target-binding properties, alone or in combination with the MEK inhibitor binimetinib, versus vemurafenib in patients with advanced BRAF(V600)-mutant melanoma.METHODS: COLUMBUS was conducted as a two-part, randomised, open-label phase 3 study at 162 hospitals in 28 countries.Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older and had histologically confirmed locally advanced (American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] stage IIIB, IIIC, or IV), unresectable or metastatic cutaneous melanoma, or unknown primary melanoma; a BRAF(V600E) or BRAF(V600K) mutation; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1; and were treatment naive or had progressed on or after previous first-line immunotherapy.In part 1 of the study, patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) via interactive response technology to receive either oral encorafenib 450 mg once daily plus oral binimetinib 45 mg twice daily (encorafenib plus binimetinib group), oral encorafenib 300 mg once daily (encorafenib group), or oral vemurafenib 960 mg twice daily (vemurafenib group).The primary endpoint was progression-free survival by blinded independent central review for encorafenib plus binimetinib versus vemurafenib.Efficacy analyses were by intention-to-treat.Safety was analysed in patients who received at least one dose of study drug and one postbaseline safety assessment.The results of part 2 will be published separately.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01909453, and EudraCT, number 2013-001176-38.FINDINGS: Between Dec 30, 2013, and April 10, 2015, 577 of 1345 screened patients were randomly assigned to either the encorafenib plus binimetinib group (n=192), the encorafenib group (n=194), or the vemurafenib group (n=191).With a median follow-up of 16.6 months (95% CI 14.8-16.9), median progression-free survival was 14.9 months (95% CI 11.0-18.5) in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group and 7.3 months (5.6-8.2) in the vemurafenib group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.54, 95% CI 0.41-0.71; two-sided p<0.0001).The most common grade 3-4 adverse events seen in more than 5% of patients in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group were increased gamma-glutamyltransferase (18 [9%] of 192 patients), increased creatine phosphokinase (13 [7%]), and hypertension (11 [6%]); in the encorafenib group they were palmoplantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (26 [14%] of 192 patients), myalgia (19 [10%]), and arthralgia (18 [9%]); and in the vemurafenib group it was arthralgia (11 [6%] of 186 patients).There were no treatment-related deaths except for one death in the combination group, which was considered possibly related to treatment by the investigator.INTERPRETATION: Encorafenib plus binimetinib and encorafenib monotherapy showed favourable efficacy compared with vemurafenib.Overall, encorafenib plus binimetinib appears to have an improved tolerability profile compared with encorafenib or vemurafenib.Encorafenib plus binimetinib could represent a new treatment option for patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma.FUNDING: Array BioPharma, Novartis.",1,1,1,1
26982446,"Adult Cancer Patient Recruitment and Enrollment into Cell Phone Text Message Trials.INTRODUCTION: Text messaging (TMs) on cell phones is emerging as an effective means of delivering behavioral interventions.However, little is known about TM use in adult cancer patients.The present study aimed to extend knowledge on acceptability of a TM intervention in adult cancer patients; examine factors of those screened and enrolled; and compare recruitment at a large national specialty pharmacy versus community-based cancer clinics.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Screening, enrollment, and baseline data collected in two randomized controlled trials examining the efficacy of TMs on medication adherence or symptom severity in adults prescribed oral anticancer agents were linked.Chi-square, Fisher's exact, t-tests, and generalized linear modeling were used to examine sociodemographics, cancer type and stage, depressive symptoms, self-efficacy, social support, and symptoms.RESULTS: The cancer clinics screened 293 patients, 43% were eligible, and 56% consented.The specialty pharmacy screened 169 patients, 72% were eligible, and 74% consented.Mean age was 58 years and did not differ by recruitment setting.Later stage disease (p = 0.01) and higher number of symptoms (p < 0.01), and symptom severity (p = 0.02) and interference (p = 0.01) were observed among patients recruited at the specialty pharmacy.No group differences were found for depression, physical function, cognition, self-efficacy, or social support.DISCUSSION: Adult cancer patients were likely to participate in a TM intervention trial.Recruiting through the specialty pharmacy reached a population with higher cell phone ownership and TM usage; with greater interest in a TM intervention compared to the cancer clinics.",0,0,0,0

22918524,"Advanced cognitive training for breast cancer survivors: a randomized controlled trial.The purpose of this study was to evaluate the preliminary efficacy and satisfaction/acceptability of training in memory or speed of processing versus wait-list control for improving cognitive function in breast cancer survivors.82 breast cancer survivors completed a three-group randomized, controlled trial.Primary outcomes were objective neuropsychological tests of memory and speed of processing.Secondary outcomes were perceived cognitive functioning, symptom distress (mood disturbance, anxiety, and fatigue), quality of life, and intervention satisfaction/acceptability.Data were collected at baseline, post-intervention, and 2-month follow-up.Using repeated-measures mixed-linear ANCOVA models, each intervention was compared to wait-list control while adjusting for age, education, and baseline measures.The effect sizes for differences in means and the reliable improvement percentage were reported.The results show that domain-specific effects were seen for both interventions: memory training improved memory performance at 2-month follow-up (p = 0.036, d = 0.59); speed of processing training improved processing speed post-intervention (p = 0.040, d = 0.55) and 2-month follow-up (p = 0.016; d = 0.67).Transfer effects to non-trained domains were seen for speed of processing training with improved memory post-intervention (p = 0.007, d = 0.75) and 2-month follow-up (p = 0.004, d = 0.82).Both interventions were associated with improvements in perceived cognitive functioning, symptom distress, and quality of life.Ratings of satisfaction/acceptability were high for both interventions.It was concluded that while both interventions appeared promising, speed of processing training resulted in immediate and durable improvements in objective measures of processing speed and verbal memory.Speed of processing training may have broader benefits in this clinical population.",0,0,0,0
22306907,"Autologous cytokine-induced killer cell transfusion in combination with gemcitabine plus cisplatin regimen chemotherapy for metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma.In this study, we evaluate the efficacy of autologous cytokine-induced killer cells (CIK) transfusion used in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin (GC) chemotherapy to treat nasopharyngeal carcinoma in patients with distant metastasis after radiotherapy.From September 2007 to August 2008, 60 patients with distant metastasis after radiotherapy were followed up and were randomly divided into 2 groups.The 30 patients in the GC+CIK group were treated with adoptive autologous CIK cell transfusion in combination with GC chemotherapy; the 30 patients in the GC group were treated with chemotherapy alone.Short-term efficacy evaluation revealed that in the GC+CIK group, there were 3 cases of complete remission, 18 cases of partial remission, 2 cases of stabilization of disease, and 7 cases of progression of disease and the total effective rate was 70% (21/30).In the GC group, there were 0 cases of complete remission, 14 cases of partial remission, 3 case of stable disease, and 13 cases of progressive disease and the total effective rate was 46.7% (14/21).Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that the overall survival of the GC+CIK group was higher than that of the GC group, but the difference was not significant (P=0.1374, log-rank test).However, the progression-free survival of the GC+CIK group was significantly higher than that of the GC group (P=0.0234, log-rank test).Thus, our study indicated that CIK cell transfusion therapy used in combination with GC chemotherapy may be a more effective treatment for postradiotherapy distant metastasis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients.",1,1,1,1
22978687,"In thyroidectomized patients with thyroid cancer, a serum thyrotropin of 30 muU/mL after thyroxine withdrawal is not always adequate for detecting an elevated stimulated serum thyroglobulin.BACKGROUND: The thyrotropin (TSH) level or duration of thyroid hormone withdrawal (THW) required to detect stimulated thyroglobulin (Tg) in differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) monitoring is unknown.The objective of this study was to evaluate the TSH cutoff of >30 muU/mL as a means to detect stimulated Tg >/=2 ng/mL after THW (THW-Tg>/=2), and sensitivity of the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) questionnaire for detecting hypothyroid symptoms.METHODS: This was a prospective longitudinal cohort study done at a tertiary academic medical center.Forty-seven patients with DTC undergoing their first Tg stimulation or after previously abnormal Tg stimulation had weekly measurements of TSH and Tg during the 4 weeks THW, and repeated questionnaire assessments.RESULTS: TSH did not reach a plateau in any patient, and in those whose Tg did not remain undetectable, Tg continued to rise.Seventy-five percent of patients had an undetectable Tg <0.2 ng/mL at baseline (95% were <0.5 mg/mL) with 16% remaining undetectable throughout THW.The majority of patients (72.7% and 97.8%) achieved TSH >30 muU/mL by 3 and 4 weeks THW, respectively.Of the 15 patients with maximum stimulated THW-Tg>/=2, 38% were detected before the minimal TSH >30 muU/mL cutoff.At 2 weeks THW, 3 had a TSH>30 muU/mL, and none of them had Tg >/=2 ng/mL. At 3 weeks THW, 11 had a TSH >30 muU/mL, and 64% of them had Tg >/=2 ng/mL. Only 60% were detected at 3-week THW regardless of their TSH level.Eighty-six percent were detected by TSH 60-<80 muU/mL. Conversely, all patients whose serum Tg was <0.2 ng/mL when their serum TSH was >20 muU/mL did not achieve a THW-Tg>/=2.CONCLUSION: The minimal TSH cutoff of >30 muU/mL was inadequate to detect many patients with final stimulated THW-Tg>/=2 during complete THW.TSH >80-100 muU/mL was a better cutoff, achieved in only 53% after 4-week THW.Conversely, we propose a preliminary THW-stopping rule for ending THW early in selected patients.In patients with a Tg <0.2 ng/mL when TSH >20 muU/mL, all had a final stimulated Tg </=2 ng/mL, potentially saving qualifying patients 40% of THW duration compared to 4-week THW.FACIT-F correlated with TSH, but was not sensitive to detect mild hypothyroidism.",0,0,0,0
27136318,"Models for change in tumour size, appearance of new lesions and survival probability in patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer.AIMS: The aims of this study were (i) to develop a modelling framework linking change in tumour size during treatment to survival probability in metastatic ovarian cancer; and (ii) to model the appearance of new lesions and investigate their relationship with survival and disease characteristics.METHODS: Data from a randomized Phase III clinical trial comparing carboplatin monotherapy to gemcitabine plus carboplatin combotherapy in 336 patients with metastatic ovarian cancer were used.A population model describing change in tumour size based on drug treatment information was established and its relationship with time to appearance of new lesions and survival were investigated with time to event models.RESULTS: The tumour size profiles were well characterized as evaluated by visual predictive checks.Metastasis in the liver at enrolment and change in tumour size up to week 12 were predictors of time to appearance of new lesions.Survival was predicted based on the patient tumour size and ECOG performance status at enrolment and on appearance of new lesions during treatment and change in tumour size up to week 12.Tumour size and survival data from a separate study were adequately predicted.CONCLUSIONS: The proposed models simulate tumour dynamics following treatment and provide a link to the probability of developing new lesions as well as to survival.The models have potential to be used for optimizing the design of late phase clinical trials in metastatic ovarian cancer based on early phase clinical study results and simulation.",0,0,0,0
27981431,"Adjusting Overall Survival Estimates after Treatment Switching: a Case Study in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.BACKGROUND: If patients in oncology trials receive subsequent therapy, standard intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses may inaccurately estimate the overall survival (OS) effect of the investigational product.In this context, a post-hoc analysis of the phase 3 PREVAIL study was performed with the aim to compare enzalutamide with placebo in terms of OS, adjusting for potential confounding from switching to antineoplastic therapies that are not part of standard metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) treatment pathways in some jurisdictions.METHODS: The PREVAIL study, which included 1717 chemotherapy-naive men with mCRPC randomized to treatment with enzalutamide 160 mg/day or placebo, was stopped after a planned interim survival analysis revealed a benefit in favor of enzalutamide.Data from this cutoff point were confounded by switching from both arms and so were evaluated in terms of OS using two switching adjustment methods: the two-stage accelerated failure time model (two-stage method) and inverse probability of censoring weights (IPCW).RESULTS: Following adjustment for switching to nonstandard antineoplastic therapies by 14.8 (129/872 patients) and 21.3% (180/845 patients) of patients initially randomized to enzalutamide and placebo, respectively, the two-stage and IPCW methods both resulted in numerical reductions in the hazard ratio (HR) for OS [HR 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57-0.81 and HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.52-0.75, respectively] for enzalutamide compared to placebo versus the unadjusted ITT analysis (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.60-0.84).These results suggest a slightly greater effect of enzalutamide on OS than originally reported.CONCLUSION: In the PREVAIL study, switching to nonstandard antineoplastic mCRPC therapies resulted in the ITT analysis of primary data underestimating the benefit of enzalutamide on OS.",1,1,1,1

27339115,"Conventional versus hypofractionated high-dose intensity-modulated radiotherapy for prostate cancer: 5-year outcomes of the randomised, non-inferiority, phase 3 CHHiP trial.BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer might have high radiation-fraction sensitivity that would give a therapeutic advantage to hypofractionated treatment.We present a pre-planned analysis of the efficacy and side-effects of a randomised trial comparing conventional and hypofractionated radiotherapy after 5 years follow-up.METHODS: CHHiP is a randomised, phase 3, non-inferiority trial that recruited men with localised prostate cancer (pT1b-T3aN0M0).Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to conventional (74 Gy delivered in 37 fractions over 7.4 weeks) or one of two hypofractionated schedules (60 Gy in 20 fractions over 4 weeks or 57 Gy in 19 fractions over 3.8 weeks)all delivered with intensity-modulated techniques.Most patients were given radiotherapy with 3-6 months of neoadjuvant and concurrent androgen suppression.Randomisation was by computer-generated random permuted blocks, stratified by National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk group and radiotherapy treatment centre, and treatment allocation was not masked.The primary endpoint was time to biochemical or clinical failure; the critical hazard ratio (HR) for non-inferiority was 1.208.Analysis was by intention to treat.Long-term follow-up continues.The CHHiP trial is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN97182923.FINDINGS: Between Oct 18, 2002, and June 17, 2011, 3216 men were enrolled from 71 centres and randomly assigned (74 Gy group, 1065 patients; 60 Gy group, 1074 patients; 57 Gy group, 1077 patients).Median follow-up was 62.4 months (IQR 53.9-77.0).The proportion of patients who were biochemical or clinical failure free at 5 years was 88.3% (95% CI 86.0-90.2) in the 74 Gy group, 90.6% (88.5-92.3) in the 60 Gy group, and 85.9% (83.4-88.0) in the 57 Gy group.60 Gy was non-inferior to 74 Gy (HR 0.84 [90% CI 0.68-1.03], pNI=0.0018) but non-inferiority could not be claimed for 57 Gy compared with 74 Gy (HR 1.20 [0.99-1.46], pNI=0.48).Long-term side-effects were similar in the hypofractionated groups compared with the conventional group.There were no significant differences in either the proportion or cumulative incidence of side-effects 5 years after treatment using three clinician-reported as well as patient-reported outcome measures.The estimated cumulative 5 year incidence of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) grade 2 or worse bowel and bladder adverse events was 13.7% (111 events) and 9.1% (66 events) in the 74 Gy group, 11.9% (105 events) and 11.7% (88 events) in the 60 Gy group, 11.3% (95 events) and 6.6% (57 events) in the 57 Gy group, respectively.No treatment-related deaths were reported.INTERPRETATION: Hypofractionated radiotherapy using 60 Gy in 20 fractions is non-inferior to conventional fractionation using 74 Gy in 37 fractions and is recommended as a new standard of care for external-beam radiotherapy of localised prostate cancer.FUNDING: Cancer Research UK, Department of Health, and the National Institute for Health Research Cancer Research Network.",1,1,1,1
22357257,"A randomised trial of primary tamoxifen versus mastectomy plus adjuvant tamoxifen in fit elderly women with invasive breast carcinoma of high oestrogen receptor content: long-term results at 20 years of follow-up.BACKGROUND: Long-term analysis of a randomised trial in Nottingham comparing tamoxifen versus surgery as initial treatment demonstrated that in oestrogen receptor (ER)-unselected cases, surgery achieved better local control, with no difference in overall survival.It was suggested that for patients with ER-rich tumours, local control and survival may be comparable.We now present long-term follow-up of a randomised trial designed to address this clinical scenario.PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and fifty three fit elderly (>/=70 years) women with clinically node-negative primary invasive breast carcinoma <5 cm of high ER content [histochemical (H) score >/=100] were randomised 2:1 to primary tamoxifen (Tam) (N = 100) or mastectomy with adjuvant tamoxifen (Mx + Tam) (N = 53).RESULTS: With median follow-up of 78 months, there was no statistically significant difference in 10-year rates of regional recurrence (9.0% versus 7.5%), metastasis (8.0% versus 13.2%), breast cancer-specific survival (89.0% versus 86.8%) or overall survival (64.0% versus 66.0%) between Tam and Mx + Tam; however, local control was inferior with Tam (local failure rates 43.0% versus 1.9%; P < 0.001).CONCLUSION: Irrespective of the degree of ER positivity, surgery achieved better local control.However, there was excellent and similar survival in both groups.Tam could be considered in those who are 'frail', refuse or prefer not to initially undergo surgery.",1,1,1,1
24383843,"Imatinib 800 mg daily induces deeper molecular responses than imatinib 400 mg daily: results of SWOG S0325, an intergroup randomized PHASE II trial in newly diagnosed chronic phase chronic myeloid leukaemia.The standard dose of imatinib for newly diagnosed patients with chronic phase chronic myeloid leukaemia (CP-CML) is 400 mg daily (IM400), but the optimal dose is unknown.This randomized phase II study compared the rates of molecular, haematological and cytogenetic response to IM400 vs. imatinib 400 mg twice daily (IM800) in 153 adult patients with CP-CML.Dose adjustments for toxicity were flexible to maximize retention on study.Molecular response (MR) at 12 months was deeper in the IM800 arm (4-log reduction of BCR-ABL1 mRNA: 25% vs. 10% of patients, P = 0.038; 3-log reduction: 53% vs. 35%, P = 0.049).During the first 12 months BCR-ABL1 levels in the IM800 arm were an average 2.9-fold lower than in the IM400 arm (P = 0.010).Complete haematological response was similar, but complete cytogenetic response was higher with IM800 (85% vs. 67%, P = 0.040).Grade 3-4 toxicities were more common for IM800 (58% vs. 31%, P = 0.0007), and were most commonly haematological.Few patients have relapsed, progressed or died, but both progression-free (P = 0.048) and relapse-free (P = 0.031) survival were superior for IM800.In newly diagnosed CP-CML patients, IM800 induced deeper MRs than IM400, with a trend for improved progression-free and overall survival, but was associated with more severe toxicity.",1,1,1,1
27386647,"[Effect of Tanshinone IIA in Preventing and Treating Oxaliplatin Induced Peripheral Neuropathy].OBJECTIVE: To observe preventive and therapeutic effects of Tanshinone IIA (T II A) on oxaliplatin induced peripheral neuropathy (OlPN) and to explore its effects on the expression of calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) and never growth factor (NGF).METHODS: Totally 36 phase II - III patients with malignant tumor of digestive tract undergoing chemotherapy program with oxaliplatin, were equally assigned to the T II A group (using THA at 80 mg/day 1 day before oxaliplatin chemotherapy for 3 successive days) and the control group (using chemotherapy program with oxaliplatin alone) by segmented randomization.After 4 cycles of chemotherapy, the incidence degree and incidence of OlPN were evaluated.Sensory nerve conduction velocity (SNCV) and motor nerve conduction velocity ( MNCV) were tested by EMGevoked potential device.Serum levels of CGRP and NGF were also detected in the two groups before and after chemotherapy.The correlation of serum levels of CGRP and NGF to OIPN was assessed using linear correlation analysis.RESULTS: After chemotherapy the OlPN incidence was 27.8% (5/18 cases) in the T II A group, obviously lower than that in the control group (55.6%, 10/18 cases; P < 0.05).Compared with before treatment in the same group, SNCV and MNCV of common peroneal nerve were slowed down, serum NGF levels decreased, and serum CGRP levels obviously increased in the two groups (all P < 0.05).Compared with the control group after treatment, SNCV and MNCV of common peroneal nerve were obviously accelerated, serum NGF levels increased, and serum CGRP levels obviously decreased in the THA group (all P < 0.05).Results of linear correlation analysis indicated serum NGF level was negatively correlated with peripheral neuropathy (PN), serum CGRP expression was positively correlated with neurotoxicity (P < 0.05).CONCLUSION: T II A could reduce the incidence of OlPN, which might be associated with inhibiting the expression of CGRP and up-regulating NGF activities.",1,1,1,1
28375706,"Impact of Diabetes, Insulin, and Metformin Use on the Outcome of Patients With Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2-Positive Primary Breast Cancer: Analysis From the ALTTO Phase III Randomized Trial.Purpose Previous studies have suggested an association between metformin use and improved outcome in patients with diabetes and breast cancer.In the current study, we aimed to explore this association in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2 ) -positive primary breast cancer in the context of a large, phase III adjuvant trial.Patients and Methods The ALTTO trial randomly assigned patients with HER2-positive breast cancer to receive 1 year of either trastuzumab alone, lapatinib alone, their sequence, or their combination.In this substudy, we evaluated whether patients with diabetes at study entry-with or without metformin treatment-were associated with different disease-free survival (DFS), distant disease-free survival (DDFS), and overall survival (OS) compared with patients without diabetes.Results A total of 8,381 patients were included in the current analysis: 7,935 patients (94.7%) had no history of diabetes at diagnosis, 186 patients (2.2%) had diabetes with no metformin treatment, and 260 patients (3.1%) were diabetic and had been treated with metformin.Median follow-up was 4.5 years (0.16 to 6.31 years), at which 1,205 (14.38%), 929 (11.08%), and 528 (6.3%) patients experienced DFS, DDFS, and OS events, respectively.Patients with diabetes who had not been treated with metformin experienced worse DFS (multivariable hazard ratio [HR], 1.40; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.94; P = .043), DDFS (multivariable HR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.10 to 2.22; P = .013), and OS (multivariable HR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.23 to 2.85; P = .004).This effect was limited to hormone receptor-positive patients.Whereas insulin treatment was associated with a detrimental effect, metformin had a salutary effect in patients with diabetes who had HER2-positive and hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.Conclusion Metformin may improve the worse prognosis that is associated with diabetes and insulin treatment, mainly in patients with primary HER2-positive and hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.",0,0,0,0
25547902,"Intercalated Dosing Schedule of Erlotinib and Docetaxel as a Therapeutic Strategy to Avoid Antagonism and Optimize Its Benefits in Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer. A Randomized Phase II Clinical Trial.INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to assess whether an intercalated dosing schedule of erlotinib and docetaxel could avoid possible negative interactions and optimize the benefit obtained as second-line therapy in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A phase II randomized clinical trial was designed for advanced NSCLC patients in whom previous chemotherapy treatment had failed.The experimental arm with 33 patients consisted of erlotinib 150 mg/d orally, intermittent administration on days 2 to 16 every 21 days, combined with docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) every 21 days; the control arm with 35 patients consisted of erlotinib 150 mg/d orally, administered continuously.The study's primary end point was the proportion of patients who remained progression-free at 6 months in the 2 arms.RESULTS: The proportion of patients who remained progression-free at 6 months was of 5 patients (15%) in the intercalated arm and 3 patients (9%) in the erlotinib monotherapy arm respectively.Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 3.0 versus 2.1 months (hazard ratio [HR], 0.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.39-1.06; P = .086).Median overall survival (OS) was 7.5 and 5.2 months (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.41-1.19; P = .19).Disease control rates were 51.7% and 36.4%, respectively.No new safety signals were observed.CONCLUSION: Erlotinib and docetaxel with intermittent administration of erlotinib improved PFS, OS, and disease control rates compared with erlotinib alone.All of our results indicated that an intercalated dosing schedule of erlotinib and docetaxel could be more efficient than erlotinib treatment alone.Therefore, further studies should be developed in a larger number of patients.This study has shown the absence of antagonism between docetaxel and erlotinib when given in an intercalated fashion.",0,0,0,0
27081036,"Cardiotoxicity as indicated by LVEF and troponin T sensitivity following two anthracycline-based regimens in lymphoma: Results from a randomized prospective clinical trial.Anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity influences treatment selection and may negatively affect clinical outcomes in lymphoma patients.While epirubicin induced cardiotoxicity less often than the same dose of doxorubicin in breast cancer, higher doses of epirubicin are required in lymphoma regimens for equivalent efficacy.Whether a higher dosage of epirubicin also induces cardiotoxicity less often than doxorubicin in lymphoma remains unknown.We therefore administered 6-8 cycles of cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisone (CEpOP) +/- rituximab (R) with either epirubicin (CEpOP) or doxorubicin (CHOP) to patients (N=398) with untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or follicular lymphoma grade 3 (FLG3).Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and high-sensitivity serum cardiac troponin T (HsTnT) were assessed at baseline and after 4 cycles of treatment.Epirubicin (70 mg/m2/dose) was equivalent to doxorubicin (50 mg/m2/dose) in terms of 3-year progression-free survival.The risk of decreased LVEF was similar between the two regimens.CEpOP+/-R induced HsTnT elevation less often than CHOP+/-R. We conclude that CEpOP+/-R is a more acceptable regimen with short-term efficacy similar to CHOP+/-R in lymphoma patients.Longer follow-up is needed to monitor the risk of cardiac dysfunction and determine whether differences in the induction of elevated HsTnT between epirubicin and doxorubicin justify changes in clinical practice.",0,0,0,0

28743247,"A randomized phase II study of paclitaxel alone versus paclitaxel plus sorafenib in second- and third-line treatment of patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer (PASO).BACKGROUND: We conducted an open-label, randomized, two-arm multi-center study to assess the efficacy and safety of paclitaxel versus paclitaxel + sorafenib in patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer.METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive either paclitaxel monotherapy (80 mg/m(2)) weekly (3 weeks on, 1 week off) plus sorafenib 400 mg orally, twice a day taken continuously throughout 28 day cycles.Sorafenib dose was gradually escalated from a starting dose of 200 mg twice a day.The primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS).RESULTS: A pre-planned efficacy interim analysis was performed on the data of 60 patients, 30 patients in each treatment arm.Median PFS was estimated at 6.6 months (95% CI: 5.1 to 9.0) in patients randomized to single-agent paclitaxel (Arm A) and 5.6 months (95% CI: 3.8 to 6.5) in patients randomized to paclitaxel-sorafenib combination (Arm B) therapy.Contrary to the hypothesis, the treatment effect was statistically significant in favor of paclitaxel monotherapy (hazard ratio 1.80, 95% CI: 1.02 to 3.20; log-rank test P = 0.0409).It was decided to stop the trial early for futility.Median OS was also in favor of Arm A (20.7 months (95% CI: 16.4 to 26.7) versus 12.1 months (95% CI: 5.8 to 20.4) in Arm B. Clinical control was achieved in 28 patients (93.3%) in Arm A and in 21 patients 70.0% in Arm B. Overall response rate was met in 43.3% of patients in Arm A and in 40.0% in Arm B. Toxicities were increased in Arm B with higher rates of diarrhea, nausea, neutropenia, hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) and anorexia, Grad 3 and 4 toxicities were rare.CONCLUSIONS: In this pre-planned interim analysis, paclitaxel-sorafenib combination therapy was not found to be superior to paclitaxel monotherapy with regard to the primary end point, progression-free survival.The trial was therefore discontinued early.There was no indication of more favorable outcomes for combination therapy in secondary efficacy end points.As expected, the safety and toxicity profile of the combination therapy was less favorable compared to monotherapy.Overall, this trial did not demonstrate that adding sorafenib to second- or third-line paclitaxel provides any clinical benefit to patients with HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer.Cautious dosing using a sorafenib ramp up schedule might have contributed to negative results.TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered at EudraCT (No 2009-018025-73) and retrospectively registered at Clinical trials.gov on March 17, 2011 ( NCT01320111 ).",1,1,1,1

24963497,"Low-dose decitabine-based chemoimmunotherapy for patients with refractory advanced solid tumors: a phase I/II report.Aberrant DNA methylation is one of the main drivers of tumor initiation and progression.The reversibility of methylation modulation makes it an attractive target for novel anticancer therapies.Clinical studies have demonstrated that high-dose decitabine, a hypomethylating agent, results in some clinical benefits in patients with refractory advanced tumors; however, they are extremely toxic.Low doses of decitabine minimize toxicity while potentially improving the targeted effects of DNA hypomethylation.Based on these mechanisms, low-dose decitabine combined with chemoimmunotherapy may be a new treatment option for patients with refractory advanced tumors.We proposed the regimen of low-dose decitabine-based chemoimmunotherapy for patients with refractory advanced solid tumors.A favorable adverse event profile was observed in our trial that was highlighted by the finding that most of these adverse events were grades 1-2.Besides, the activity of our cohort was optimistic and the clinical benefit rate was up to 60%, and the median PFS was prolonged compared with PFS to previous treatment.We also identified a significant correlation between the PFS to previous treatment and clinical response.The low-dose DAC decitabine-based chemoimmunotherapy might be a promising protocol for improving the specificity and efficiency of patients with refractory advanced solid tumors.This trial is registered in the ClinicalTrials.gov database (identifier NCT01799083).",0,0,0,0

29505522,"The effects of one-lung ventilation mode on lung function in elderly patients undergoing esophageal cancer surgery.The objective of the present study was to explore the effects of different one-lung ventilation (OLV) modes on lung function in elderly patients undergoing esophageal cancer surgery.A total of 180 consecutive elderly patients (ASA Grades I-II, with OLV indications) undergoing elective surgery were recruited in the study.Patients were randomly divided into 4 groups (n = 45).In Group A, patients received low tidal volume (VT < 8 mL/kg) + pressure controlled ventilation (PCV), low tidal volume (VT < 8 mL/kg) + volume-controlled ventilation (VCV) in Group B, high tidal volume (VT >/= 8 mL/kg) + PCV in Group C and high tidal volume (VT >/= 8 mL/kg) + VCV in Group D. Two-lung ventilation involved routine tidal volume (8-10 mL/kg) at a frequency of 12 to 18 times/min, and VCV mode.Clinical efficacy among 4 groups was compared.The partial pressure of end-tidal carbon dioxide (PetCO2) did not significantly differ among 4 groups (all P > .05), and the oxygenation index and SO2 in Group A were significantly higher than in the other groups (P < .05).The PetCO2, peak airway pressure (Ppeak), platform airway pressure (Pplat), and mean airway pressure (Pmean) in Group A were significantly lower than those in the other groups (all P < .05).However, airway resistance (Raw) among 4 groups did not significantly differ (all P > .05).The incidence of pulmonary infection, anastomotic fistula, ventilator-induced lung injury, lung dysfunction, difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation, and multiple organ dysfunction in Groups A and B were lower than that in Groups C and D (all P < .05).The expression levels of IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and C-reactive protein in lavage fluid in Group A were significantly lower than those in the other groups (all P < .05).OLV with low tidal volume (VT < 8 mL/kg) + PCV (5 cmH2O PEEP) improved lung function and mitigated inflammatory responses in elderly patients undergoing esophageal cancer surgery.",0,0,0,0
29445029,"Pantoprazole, an Inhibitor of the Organic Cation Transporter 2, Does Not Ameliorate Cisplatin-Related Ototoxicity or Nephrotoxicity in Children and Adolescents with Newly Diagnosed Osteosarcoma Treated with Methotrexate, Doxorubicin, and Cisplatin.LESSONS LEARNED: Using a randomized crossover design and continuous variables such as change in hearing threshold and biomarkers of acute renal injury as short-term endpoints, it was determined that pantoprazole, an organic cation transporter 2 inhibitor, did not ameliorate cisplatin-associated nephrotoxicity or ototoxicity.Cystatin C is a robust method to estimate glomerular filtration rate in patients with cancer.Using a patient-reported outcome survey, all patients identified tinnitus and subjective hearing loss occurring ""at least rarely"" after cycle 1, prior to objective high-frequency hearing loss measured by audiograms.New therapies that improve outcome with less acute and long-term toxicity are needed.BACKGROUND: Organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2), which is a cisplatin uptake transporter expressed on renal tubules and cochlear hair cells but not on osteosarcoma cells, mediates cisplatin uptake.Pantoprazole inhibits OCT2 and could ameliorate cisplatin ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity.Using a randomized crossover design, we evaluated audiograms, urinary acute kidney injury (AKI) biomarkers, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimated from cystatin C (GFRcysC) in patients receiving cisplatin with and without pantoprazole.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cisplatin (60 mg/m(2) x 2 days per cycle) was administered concurrently with pantoprazole (intravenous [IV], 1.6 mg/kg over 4 hours) on cycles 1 and 2 or cycles 3 and 4 in 12 patients with osteosarcoma (OS) with a median (range) age of 12.8 (5.6-19) years.Audiograms, urinary AKI biomarkers, and serum cystatin C were monitored during each cycle.RESULTS: Pantoprazole had no impact on decrements in hearing threshold at 4-8 kHz, post-treatment elevation of urinary AKI biomarkers, or GFRcysC (Fig. 1, Table 1).Histological response (percent necrosis) after two cycles was similar with or without pantoprazole.All eight patients with localized OS at diagnosis are alive and in remission; three of four patients with metastases at diagnosis have died.CONCLUSION: Pantoprazole did not ameliorate cisplatin ototoxicity or nephrotoxicity.The decrease in GFRcysC and increase in N-acetyl-ss-glucosaminidase (NAG) and creatinine demonstrate that these biomarkers can quantify cisplatin glomerular and proximal tubular toxicity.OCT2 inhibition by pantoprazole did not appear to alter antitumor response or survival.",1,1,1,1

Race, Gleason score, tumor stage, node stage, pretreatment PSA level, and duration of neoAS were associated with the groups of patients with PSA levels </=0.1 and >0.1 ng/mL. In univariate analyses, post-neoAS, pre-RT PSA level >0.1 ng/mL was associated with increased risks of biochemical failure (hazard ratio [HR], 2.04; P < .0001); local failure (HR, 2.51; P < .0001); distant metastases (HR, 1.73; P = .0006); cause-specific mortality (HR, 2.36; P < .0001); and all-cause mortality (HR, 1.24; P = .005).In multivariable models that also included baseline and treatment variables, post-neoAS, pre-RT PSA level >0.1 ng/mL was independently associated with increased risk of biochemical failure (HR, 2.00; P < .0001); local failure (HR, 2.33; P < .0001); and cause-specific mortality (HR, 1.75; P = .03).CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a PSA level >0.1 ng/mL after neoAS and before the start of RT had less favorable clinical outcomes than patients whose PSA level was </=0.1 ng/mL. The role of post-neoAS, pre-RT PSA level relative to PSA levels obtained along the continuum of medical care is not presently defined but could be tested in future clinical trials.",0,0,0,0

29319209,"Effectiveness of antibacterial prophylaxis during induction chemotherapy in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.BACKGROUND: Pediatric patients receiving induction chemotherapy for newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are at high risk of developing life-threatening infections.We investigated whether uniform antibacterial guidelines, including mandatory antibacterial prophylaxis in afebrile patients during induction, decreases the incidence of microbiologically documented bacteremia.METHODS: Between 2012 and 2015, 230 patients with newly diagnosed ALL (aged 1-21) were enrolled on Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ALL Consortium Protocol 11-001 (DFCI 11-001).Induction therapy, regardless of risk group, included vincristine, prednisone, doxorubicin, methotrexate, and PEG-asparaginase.Afebrile patients received fluoroquinolone prophylaxis at the initiation of induction and those presenting with fever received broad-spectrum antibiotics; antibiotics were continued until blood count recovery.Rates of documented bacteremias and fungal infections on DFCI 11-001 were compared to those on the predecessor protocol (DFCI 05-001), which included the same induction phase without antibiotic prophylaxis guidelines.RESULTS: Sixty-six (28.7%) patients received fluoroquinolone prophylaxis, the remaining patients received broad-spectrum antibiotics.Twenty-four (36.4%) patients on prophylaxis developed fever and seven (10.6%) developed bacteremia.The overall rate of infection during induction on DFCI 11-001 was lower than on DFCl 05-001 (14.3% vs. 26.3%, P < 0.0001) due to a decreased rate of bacteremia (10.9% vs. 24.4%, P < 0.0001).The rate of fungal infections (4.8% vs. 3.6%) and induction death (0.9% vs. 2%) was not significantly different.CONCLUSION: For children with newly diagnosed ALL, uniform antibiotic administration until blood count recovery, including fluoroquinolone prophylaxis for afebrile patients, reduced the incidence of bacteremia during the induction phase.Larger, randomized studies should be performed to confirm these findings.",0,0,0,0
26324738,"Clinical and Translational Results of a Phase II, Randomized Trial of an Anti-IGF-1R (Cixutumumab) in Women with Breast Cancer That Progressed on Endocrine Therapy.PURPOSE: This phase II trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of cixutumumab, a human anti-insulin-like growth factor receptor 1 (IGF-1R) monoclonal IgG1 antibody, and explored potential biomarkers in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer that progressed on antiestrogen therapy received (2:1 randomization) cixutumumab 10 mg/kg and the same antiestrogen (arm A) or cixutumumab alone (arm B) every 2 weeks (q2w).Primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS); secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS) and safety.Correlative analyses of IGF-1R, total insulin receptor (IR), and IR isoforms A (IR-A) and B (IR-B) expression in tumor tissue were explored.RESULTS: Ninety-three patients were randomized (arm A, n = 62; arm B, n = 31).Median PFS was 2.0 and 3.1 months for arm A and arm B, respectively.Secondary efficacy measures were similar between the arms.Overall, cixutumumab was well tolerated.IGF-1R expression was not associated with clinical outcomes.Regardless of the treatment, lower IR-A, IR-B, and total IR mRNA expression in tumor tissue was significantly associated with longer PFS [IR-A: HR, 2.62 (P = 0.0062); IR-B: HR, 2.21 (P = 0.0202); and total IR: HR, 2.18 (P = 0.0230)] and OS [IR-A: HR, 2.94 (P = 0.0156); IR-B: HR, 2.69 (P = 0.0245); and total IR: HR, 2.72 (P = 0.0231)].CONCLUSIONS: Cixutumumab (10 mg/kg) with or without antiestrogen q2w had an acceptable safety profile, but no significant clinical efficacy.Patients with low total IR, IR-A, and IR-B mRNA expression levels had significantly longer PFS and OS, independent of the treatment.The prognostic or predictive value of IR as a biomarker for IGF-1R-targeted therapies requires further validation.",1,1,1,1
26386748,"The Comparative Impact of Mindfulness-Based Cancer Recovery (MBCR) and Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) on Sleep and Mindfulness in Cancer Patients.BACKGROUND: Insomnia is an important but often overlooked side effect of cancer.Dysfunctional sleep beliefs have been identified as an important perpetuating factor for insomnia.Mindfulness practice has been demonstrated to improve sleep quality but it is unknown whether these effects relate to changes in dysfunctional sleep beliefs.PURPOSE: This study is a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial comparing mindfulness-based cancer recovery (MBCR) to cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) in cancer patients with insomnia.This present analysis compares program impact on mindfulness, dysfunctional sleep beliefs, and insomnia severity clinical cutoffs.METHODS: Patients (MBCR, n = 32; CBT-I, n = 40) were assessed at baseline, post-program, and 3-month follow-up.RESULTS: Across both groups, patients showed improvements over time in acting with awareness (P = .021) and not judging experiences (P = .023).Changes in dysfunctional sleep beliefs produced by the CBT-I group exceeded those produced by MBCR at post-program and follow-up (P < .001).Acting with awareness, non-judging, and non-reacting were the facets of mindfulness associated with an overall reduction in dysfunctional sleep beliefs.There were no significant differences between the MBCR and CBT-I groups in the percentage of patients exceeding insomnia severity clinical cutoffs at post-program or follow-up.CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the use of both CBT-I and MBCR to reduce insomnia severity and suggests the development of mindfulness facets as a method of reducing dysfunctional sleep beliefs.",0,0,0,0

An exploratory analysis of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer 55971 randomised trial.BACKGROUND: To investigate whether biomarkers consisting of baseline characteristics of advanced stage ovarian cancer patients can help in identifying subgroups of patients who would benefit more from primary surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy.METHODS: We used data of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 55971 trial in which 670 patients were randomly assigned to primary surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy.The primary outcome was overall survival.Ten baseline clinical and pathological characteristics were selected as potential biomarkers.Using Subpopulation Treatment Effect Pattern Plots (STEPP), biomarkers with a statistically significant qualitative additive interaction with treatment were considered as potentially informative for treatment selection.We also combined selected biomarkers to form a multimarker treatment selection rule.FINDINGS: The size of the largest metastatic tumour and clinical stage were significantly associated with the magnitude of the benefit from treatment, in terms of five-year survival (p for interaction: 0.008 and 0.016, respectively).Stage IIIC patients with metastatic tumours 45 mm benefited more from primary surgery while stage IV patients with metastatic tumours >45 mm benefited more from neoadjuvant chemotherapy.In stage IIIC patients with larger metastatic tumours and in stage IV patients with less extensive metastatic tumours both treatments were equally effective.We estimated that by selecting treatments for patients based on largest metastatic tumour and clinical stage, the potential five-year survival rate in the population of treated patients would be 27.3% (95% confidence interval (CI) 21.9-33.0), 7.8% higher than if all were treated with primary surgery, and 5.6% higher if all were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.INTERPRETATION: Although survival was comparable after primary surgery and neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the overall group of patients with ovarian cancer in the EORTC 55971 trial, we found in this exploratory analysis that patients with stage IIIC and less extensive metastatic tumours had higher survival with primary surgery, while patients with stage IV disease and large metastatic tumours had higher survival with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.For patients who did not meet these criteria, both treatment options led to comparable survival rates.",1,1,1,1

29722789,"The importance of jointly analyzing treatment administration and toxicity associated with targeted therapies: a case study of regorafenib in soft tissue sarcoma patients.Background: Different methods have been proposed to analyze adverse events (AEs) associated with targeted therapies.While these AEs lead to dose adjustments for many patients, conventional reporting methods do not take drug administration into consideration.This paper underlines the importance of jointly reporting AEs and drug administration using prevalence, and proposes a complementary approach to reporting.Patients and methods: The prevalence method estimates the probability of progression-free patients being in a particular health state (state 1: AEs with full dose; state 2: AEs with reduced dose; state 3: no AEs with reduced dose) at different time points.To take into account the impact of dose adjustments on efficacy, the weighted prevalence method can be used by assigning utility weights to the different health states.The benefit of these methods was illustrated using data from a phase II trial of regorafenib.Results: Only 4.6% of progression-free patients developed mucositis/stomatitis (grade >/=2) at 3 months.The prevalence of patients not experiencing this AE but whose dose was reduced or treatment interrupted was 58.1%.The weighted prevalence of the regorafenib toxicity profile and dose reduction was higher in the control arm.Conclusion: This case study confirms the importance of jointly analyzing AEs and drug administration.The weighted prevalence approach is an average score that incorporates the dimension of drug administration into AE assessment.This can be helpful for regulatory agencies as well as for clinicians to evaluate the benefit-risk ratio of therapies in their treatment choice.Clinical trial: NCT01900743.",0,0,0,0

23234763,"Adjuvant lapatinib for women with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer: a randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Worldwide, many patients with HER2-positive early stage breast cancer do not receive trastuzumab-the standard adjuvant treatment.We investigated the efficacy and safety of adjuvant lapatinib for patients with trastuzumab-naive HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer, started at any time after diagnosis.METHODS: This study was a placebo-controlled, multicentre, randomised phase 3 trial.Women outpatients from 405 [corrected] centres in 33 countries [corrected] with HER2-positive early-breast cancer who had previously received adjuvant chemotherapy but not trastuzumab were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive daily lapatinib (1500 mg) or daily placebo for 12 months.Randomisation was done with a computer-generated sequence, stratified by time since diagnosis, lymph node involvement at diagnosis, and tumour hormone-receptor status.Investigators, site staff, and patients were masked to treatment assignment.The primary endpoint was disease-free survival in the intention-to-treat population.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00374322.FINDINGS: Between August, 2006, and May, 2008, 3161 women were enrolled and 3147 were assigned to lapatinib (n=1571) or placebo (n=1576).After a median follow-up of 47.4 months (range 0.4-60.0) in the lapatinib group and 48.3 (0.7-61.3) in the placebo group, 210 (13%) disease-free survival events had occurred in the lapatinib group versus 264 (17%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.83, 95% CI 0.70-1.00; p=0.053).Central review of HER2 status showed that only 2490 (79%) of the randomised women were HER2-positive.157 (13%) of 1230 confirmed HER2-positive patients in the lapatinib group and in 208 (17%) of 1260 in the placebo group had a disease-free survival event (HR 0.82, 95% 0.67-1.00; p=0.04).Serious adverse events occurred in 99 (6%) of 1573 patients taking lapatinib and 77 (5%) of 1574 patients taking placebo, with higher incidences of grade 3-4 diarrhoea (97 [6%] vs nine [<1%]), rash (72 [5%] vs three [<1%]), and hepatobiliary disorders (36 [2%] vs one [<1%]).INTERPRETATION: Our data show that there was no significant difference in disease-free survival between groups when analysed in the intention-to-treat population.However, exploratory analyses restricted to patients who had HER2-positive disease confirmed by central fluorescence in-situ hybridisation review suggested marginal benefit with lapatinib in terms of disease-free survival.Thus lapatinib might be an option for women with HER2-positive breast cancer who do not or cannot receive adjuvant trastuzumab.FUNDING: GlaxoSmithKline.",1,1,1,1
23871490,"2 years versus 1 year of adjuvant trastuzumab for HER2-positive breast cancer (HERA): an open-label, randomised controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Trastuzumab has established efficacy against breast cancer with overexpression or amplification of the HER2 oncogene.The standard of care is 1 year of adjuvant trastuzumab, but the optimum duration of treatment is unknown.We compared 2 years of treatment with trastuzumab with 1 year of treatment, and updated the comparison of 1 year of trastuzumab versus observation at a median follow-up of 8 years, for patients enrolled in the HERceptin Adjuvant (HERA) trial.METHODS: The HERA trial is an international, multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial comparing treatment with trastuzumab for 1 and 2 years with observation after standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy, adjuvant chemotherapy, or both in 5102 patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer.The primary endpoint was disease-free survival.The comparison of 2 years versus 1 year of trastuzumab treatment involved a landmark analysis of 3105 patients who were disease-free 12 months after randomisation to one of the trastuzumab groups, and was planned after observing at least 725 disease-free survival events.The updated intention-to-treat comparison of 1 year trastuzumab treatment versus observation alone in 3399 patients at a median follow-up of 8 years (range 0-10) is also reported.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00045032.FINDINGS: We recorded 367 events of disease-free survival in 1552 patients in the 1 year group and 367 events in 1553 patients in the 2 year group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.99, 95% CI 0.85-1.14, p=0.86).Grade 3-4 adverse events and decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction during treatment were reported more frequently in the 2 year treatment group than in the 1 year group (342 [20.4%] vs 275 [16.3%] grade 3-4 adverse events, and 120 [7.2%] vs 69 [4.1%] decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction, respectively).HRs for a comparison of 1 year of trastuzumab treatment versus observation were 0.76 (95% CI 0.67-0.86, p<0.0001) for disease-free survival and 0.76 (0.65-0.88, p=0.0005) for overall survival, despite crossover of 884 (52%) patients from the observation group to trastuzumab therapy.INTERPRETATION: 2 years of adjuvant trastuzumab is not more effective than is 1 year of treatment for patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer.1 year of treatment provides a significant disease-free and overall survival benefit compared with observation and remains the standard of care.FUNDING: F Hoffmann-La Roche (Roche).",1,1,1,1
24076063,"Neoadjuvant treatment of endometrial cancer using anastrozole: a randomised pilot study.OBJECTIVE: Excessive oestrogenic stimulation is a well-known risk factor for the development and progression of endometrial cancer.Aromatase is the key enzyme which catalyses the conversion of androgens to oestrogens in postmenopausal women.Inhibition of aromatase may therefore be a useful strategy in the management of endometrial cancer.A pilot study was designed to assess the feasibility of a neoadjuvant model and understand the biological effects of anastrozole, an aromatase inhibitor, in the treatment of endometrial cancer.METHODS: Patients with endometrial cancer who consented to participate in the study were randomised to receive anastrozole or placebo for a minimum of 14 days prior to definitive surgery.Endometrial samples were obtained before and after treatment.Immunohistochemistry was performed to ascertain the expression of oestrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha), progesterone receptor (PR), androgen receptor (AR), ki-67 and Bcl2 before and after treatment in glands and stroma of the endometrium.RESULTS: A total of 16 patients were randomised to the anastrozole arm and 8 to the placebo arm (2:1 randomisation).A significant decrease in the glandular expression of ERalpha and AR was observed in the anastrozole arm.There was no significant change in the expression of PR or Bcl2.Expression of ki-67, a proliferation marker, also decreased significantly following treatment with anastrozole.CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with anastrozole caused a significant decrease in proliferation as demonstrated by decreased ki-67 expression.A large randomised controlled trial is warranted to fully assess the role of anastrozole in the neoadjuvant treatment of endometrial cancer.",1,1,1,1
27884679,"Risk-stratified staging in paediatric hepatoblastoma: a unified analysis from the Children's Hepatic tumors International Collaboration.BACKGROUND: Comparative assessment of treatment results in paediatric hepatoblastoma trials has been hampered by small patient numbers and the use of multiple disparate staging systems by the four major trial groups.To address this challenge, we formed a global coalition, the Children's Hepatic tumors International Collaboration (CHIC), with the aim of creating a common approach to staging and risk stratification in this rare cancer.METHODS: The CHIC steering committee-consisting of leadership from the four major cooperative trial groups (the International Childhood Liver Tumours Strategy Group, Children's Oncology Group, the German Society for Paediatric Oncology and Haematology, and the Japanese Study Group for Paediatric Liver Tumours)-created a shared international database that includes comprehensive data from 1605 children treated in eight multicentre hepatoblastoma trials over 25 years.Diagnostic factors found to be most prognostic on initial analysis were PRETreatment EXTent of disease (PRETEXT) group; age younger than 3 years, 3-7 years, and 8 years or older; alpha fetoprotein (AFP) concentration of 100 ng/mL or lower and 101-1000 ng/mL; and the PRETEXT annotation factors metastatic disease (M), macrovascular involvement of all hepatic veins (V) or portal bifurcation (P), contiguous extrahepatic tumour (E), multifocal tumour (F), and spontaneous rupture (R).We defined five clinically relevant backbone groups on the basis of established prognostic factors: PRETEXT I/II, PRETEXT III, PRETEXT IV, metastatic disease, and AFP concentration of 100 ng/mL or lower at diagnosis.We then carried the additional factors into a hierarchical backwards elimination multivariable analysis and used the results to create a new international staging system.RESULTS: Within each backbone group, we identified constellations of factors that were most predictive of outcome in that group.The robustness of candidate models was then interrogated using the bootstrapping procedure.Using the clinically established PRETEXT groups I, II, III, and IV as our stems, we created risk stratification trees based on 5 year event-free survival and clinical applicability.We defined and adopted four risk groups: very low, low, intermediate, and high.INTERPRETATION: We have created a unified global approach to risk stratification in children with hepatoblastoma on the basis of rigorous statistical interrogation of what is, to the best of our knowledge, the largest dataset ever assembled for this rare paediatric tumour.This achievement provides the structural framework for further collaboration and prospective international cooperative study, such as the Paediatric Hepatic International Tumour Trial (PHITT).FUNDING: European Network for Cancer Research in Children and Adolescents, funded through the Framework Program 7 of the European Commission (grant number 261474); Children's Oncology Group CureSearch grant contributed by the Hepatoblastoma Foundation; Practical Research for Innovative Cancer Control and Project Promoting Clinical Trials for Development of New Drugs and Medical Devices, Japan Agency for Medical Research; and Swiss Cancer Research grant.",0,0,0,0

Canadian Cancer Trials Group (CCTG) IND.219.INTRODUCTION: Activation of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway may confer resistance to chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Selumetinib (AZD6244, ARRY142886), a MEK1/2 inhibitor combined with chemotherapy in patients with NSCLC was evaluated in two schedules to evaluate efficacy and toxicity.METHODS: IND.219 was a three-arm study of first line pemetrexed/platinum chemotherapy with two schedules of selumetinib (Arm A: intermittent given on days 2-19; Arm B: continuous given on days 1-21) versus chemotherapy alone (Arm C).The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR); secondary objectives were tolerability, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS).The trial was stopped at the planned interim analysis.RESULTS: Arms A/B/C enrolled 20/21/21 patients, ORR was 35% (95% CI 15-59% median duration 3.8 months), 62% (95% CI 38-82%; median duration 6.3 months), 24% (95% CI 8-47%; median duration 11.6 months) respectively.The PFS (months Arm A, B, C) was 7.5, 6.7, 4.0 respectively (hazard ratio (HR) PFS Arm A over Arm C: 0.76 [95% CI, 0.38-1.51, 2-sided p = 0.42]; Arm B over Arm C 0.75 [95% CI 0.37-1.54, p = 0.43].Skin and gastrointestinal adverse events were more common with the addition of selumetinib.A high incidence of venous thromboembolism was seen in all arms.CONCLUSIONS: Selumetinib combined with chemotherapy was associated with a higher response rate.Continuous selumetinib appeared to be superior to an intermittent schedule.PFS was prolonged with the addition of selumetinib, however this was not statistically significant.",1,1,1,1
27869649,"Randomized trial of calcipotriol combined with 5-fluorouracil for skin cancer precursor immunotherapy.BACKGROUND: Actinic keratosis is a precursor to cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.Long treatment durations and severe side effects have limited the efficacy of current actinic keratosis treatments.Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is an epithelium-derived cytokine that induces a robust antitumor immunity in barrier-defective skin.Here, we investigated the efficacy of calcipotriol, a topical TSLP inducer, in combination with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) as an immunotherapy for actinic keratosis.METHODS: The mechanism of calcipotriol action against skin carcinogenesis was examined in genetically engineered mouse models.The efficacy and safety of 0.005% calcipotriol ointment combined with 5% 5-FU cream were compared with Vaseline plus 5-FU for the field treatment of actinic keratosis in a randomized, double-blind clinical trial involving 131 participants.The assigned treatment was self-applied to the entirety of the qualified anatomical sites (face, scalp, and upper extremities) twice daily for 4 consecutive days.The percentage of reduction in the number of actinic keratoses (primary outcome), local skin reactions, and immune activation parameters were assessed.RESULTS: Calcipotriol suppressed skin cancer development in mice in a TSLP-dependent manner.Four-day application of calcipotriol plus 5-FU versus Vaseline plus 5-FU led to an 87.8% versus 26.3% mean reduction in the number of actinic keratoses in participants (P < 0.0001).Importantly, calcipotriol plus 5-FU treatment induced TSLP, HLA class II, and natural killer cell group 2D (NKG2D) ligand expression in the lesional keratinocytes associated with a marked CD4+ T cell infiltration, which peaked on days 10-11 after treatment, without pain, crusting, or ulceration.CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate the synergistic effects of calcipotriol and 5-FU treatment in optimally activating a CD4+ T cell-mediated immunity against actinic keratoses and, potentially, cancers of the skin and other organs.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02019355.FUNDING: Not applicable (investigator-initiated clinical trial).",1,1,1,1

(J Am Coll Surg 203(6):857-864, 2006) detected a decreased leak rate in patients receiving a traditional closure buttressed with an autologous falciform ligament patch and fibrin glue.METHODS: Between April 2008 and October 2011, all willing patients scheduled to undergo distal pancreatectomy at the authors' institutions were consented and enrolled at the preoperative office visit.Patients were intraoperatively stratified as having hard or soft glands and randomized to one of two groups: (1) closure utilizing stapling or suturing (SS) versus (2) stapled or sutured plus falciform ligament patch and fibrin glue (FF).The trial design and power analysis (alpha = 0.05, beta = 0.2, power 80 %, chi-square test) hypothesized that the FF intervention would reduce the primary endpoint (pancreatic fistula) from 30 % to 15 % and targeted an accrual goal of 190 patients.Secondary endpoints included length of postoperative hospital stay, 30-day mortality, hospital readmission, and ISGPF fistula grade (A, B, and C).RESULTS: The trial accrued 109 patients, 55 in the SS group and 54 in the FF group.Enrollment was closed prior to the target accrual, following an interim analysis and futility calculation.Due to insufficient enrollment, patients stratified as having a hard gland were excluded (n = 8) from analysis, leaving 101 patients in the soft stratum.The overall pancreatic leak rate was 19.8 % (20 patients) for patients with soft glands.Patients randomized to the FF group had a leak rate of 20 %, as compared with 19.6 % in the SS group (p = 1.000).Fistula grades in both groups were identical: 1A, 8B, and 1C in the FF group as compared to 1A, 8B, and 1C in the SS group.Complication rates were comparable between the two groups.The median length of postoperative hospital stay was 5 days in both groups.There was a trend towards a higher 30-day readmission rate in the FF group (28 % vs. 17.6 %, p = 0.243).CONCLUSION: The addition of a falciform ligament patch and fibrin glue to standard stapled or sutured remnant closure did not reduce the rate or severity of pancreatic fistula in patients undergoing distal pancreatectomy (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00889213).",0,0,0,0

27589688,"Primary analysis of a prospective, randomized, single-blinded phase II trial evaluating the HER2 peptide GP2 vaccine in breast cancer patients to prevent recurrence.GP2 is a HER2-derived, HLA-A2+ restricted peptide.Phase I studies showed GP2 administered with GM-CSF to be safe and immunogenic.Here we report the primary analysis of a prospective, randomized, multicenter phase II adjuvant trial conducted to determine the vaccine's efficacy.The trial enrolled HLA-A2+, clinically disease-free, node-positive and high-risk node-negative breast cancer patients with tumors expressing HER2 (immunohistochemistry[IHC] 1+-3+).Patients were randomized to GP2+GM-CSF versus GM-CSF alone.Disease-free survival (DFS) was analyzed in intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-treatment cohorts; pre-specified subgroup analyses were performed for patients with IHC 3+ or FISH+ disease.The trial enrolled 180 patients; 89 received GP2+GM-CSF and 91 received GM-CSF alone.The groups were well-matched for clinicopathologic characteristics.Toxicities have been minimal.The Kaplan-Meier estimated 5-year DFS rate in the ITT analyses was 88% (95% CI:78-94%) in vaccinated vs. 81% (95% CI:69-89%) (P = 0.43) in control patients after a 34 month median follow-up.In the per-treatment analysis, the estimated 5-year DFS rates were 94% (95% CI:83-98%) and 85% (73-92%) (P = 0.17).In IHC 3+/FISH+ patients, the estimated 5-year DFS rate was 94% (82-98%) in vaccinated patients (n = 51) vs. 89% (71-96%) in control patients (n = 50), (P = 0.86) in the ITT analyses and 100% vs. 89% (71-96%) in vaccinated vs. control patients in the per-treatment analyses (P = 0.08).While the overall ITT analysis did not demonstrate benefit to vaccination, this trial confirmed that the GP2 vaccine is safe and suggests that vaccination may have clinical activity, particularly in patients with HER2 overexpression who received the full vaccine series (ie per-treatment group).",1,1,1,1
28679552,"Randomized controlled trial of dietary fiber for the prevention of radiation-induced gastrointestinal toxicity during pelvic radiotherapy.Background: Therapeutic radiotherapy is an important treatment of pelvic cancers.Historically, low-fiber diets have been recommended despite a lack of evidence and potentially beneficial mechanisms of fiber.Objective: This randomized controlled trial compared low-, habitual-, and high-fiber diets for the prevention of gastrointestinal toxicity in patients undergoing pelvic radiotherapy.Design: Patients were randomly assigned to low-fiber [</=10 g nonstarch polysaccharide (NSP)/d], habitual-fiber (control), or high-fiber (>/=18 g NSP/d) diets and received individualized counseling at the start of radiotherapy to achieve these targets.The primary endpoint was the difference between groups in the change in the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire-Bowel Subset (IBDQ-B) score between the starting and nadir (worst) score during treatment.Other measures included macronutrient intake, stool diaries, and fecal short-chain fatty acid concentrations.Results: Patients were randomly assigned to low-fiber (n = 55), habitual-fiber (n = 55), or high-fiber (n = 56) dietary advice.Fiber intakes were significantly different between groups (P < 0.001).The difference between groups in the change in IBDQ-B scores between the start and nadir was not significant (P = 0.093).However, the change in score between the start and end of radiotherapy was smaller in the high-fiber group (mean +/- SD: -3.7 +/- 12.8) than in the habitual-fiber group (-10.8 +/-13.5; P = 0.011).At 1-y postradiotherapy (n = 126) the difference in IBDQ-B scores between the high-fiber (+0.1 +/- 14.5) and the habitual-fiber (-8.4 +/- 13.3) groups was significant (P = 0.004).No significant differences were observed in stool frequency or form or in short-chain fatty acid concentrations.Significant reductions in energy, protein, and fat intake occurred in the low- and habitual-fiber groups only.Conclusions: Dietary advice to follow a high-fiber diet during pelvic radiotherapy resulted in reduced gastrointestinal toxicity both acutely and at 1 y compared with habitual-fiber intake.Restrictive, non-evidence-based advice to reduce fiber intake in this setting should be abandoned.This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT 01170299.",1,1,0,0
26209642,"Value of KRAS as prognostic or predictive marker in NSCLC: results from the TAILOR trial.BACKGROUND: The prognostic and predictive role of KRAS mutations in advanced nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is still unclear.TAILOR prospectively assessed the prognostic and predictive value of KRAS mutations in NSCLC patients treated with erlotinib or docetaxel in second line.PATIENTS AND METHODS: NSCLC patients from 52 Italian hospitals were genotyped for KRAS and EGFR mutational status in two independent laboratories.Wild-type EGFR patients (N = 218) received first-line platinum-based chemotherapy and were randomly allocated at progression to erlotinib or docetaxel.Overall survival (OS) according to KRAS mutational status was the primary end point.RESULTS: KRAS mutations were present in 23% of TAILOR randomized cases.The presence of a KRAS mutation did not adversely affect progression-free (PFS) or overall (OS) survival [hazard ratio (HR) PFS = 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71-1.41, P = 0.977; OS = 1.24, 95% CI 0.87-1.77, P = 0.233], nor influenced treatment outcome (test for interaction: OS P = 0.965; PFS P = 0.417).Patients randomized to docetaxel treatment experienced longer survival independently from the KRAS mutational status of their tumors (HR: mutated KRAS 0.81, 95% CI 0.45-1.47; wild-type KRAS 0.79, 95% CI 0.57-1.10).CONCLUSION: In TAILOR, KRAS was neither prognostic nor predictive of benefit for either docetaxel or erlotinib.Docetaxel remains superior independently from KRAS status for second-line treatment in EGFR wild-type advanced NSCLC patients.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT00637910.",0,0,0,0
24122767,"TRAIL receptor agonist conatumumab with modified FOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab for first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer: A randomized phase 1b/2 trial.BACKGROUND: In patients with previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), we conducted a phase 1b/randomized phase 2 trial to define the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab (mFOLFOX6/bev) with conatumumab, an investigational, fully human monoclonal IgG1 antibody that specifically activates death receptor 5 (DR5).METHODS: Twelve patients were enrolled in a phase 1b open-label dose-escalation trial of conatumumab with mFOLFOX6/bev; thereafter, 190 patients were randomized 1:1:1 to receive mFOLFOX6/bev in combination with 2 mg/kg conatumumab, 10 mg/kg conatumumab, or placebo.Therapy cycles were repeated every 2 weeks until disease progression or the occurrence of unacceptable toxicity.RESULTS: In phase 1b, conatumumab with mFOLFOX6/bev was tolerated without apparent added toxicity over mFOLFOX6/bev alone.In phase 2, conatumumab with mFOLFOX6/bev did not confer a benefit in progression-free survival when compared with placebo with mFOLFOX6/bev.Toxicity was similar in all treatment arms.Following treatment, similar increases in circulating caspase-3 levels were observed in all arms.CONCLUSIONS: Conatumumab with mFOLFOX6/bev did not offer improved efficacy over the same chemotherapy with placebo in first-line treatment of patients with mCRC.These data do not support further development of conatumumab in advanced CRC.",0,0,0,0
24323034,"Targeted androgen pathway suppression in localized prostate cancer: a pilot study.PURPOSE: Ligand-mediated activation of the androgen receptor (AR) is critical for prostate cancer (PCa) survival and proliferation.The failure to completely ablate tissue androgens may limit suppression of PCa growth.We evaluated combinations of CYP17A and 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors for reducing prostate androgen levels, AR signaling, and PCa volumes.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-five men with intermediate/high-risk clinically localized PCa were randomly assigned to goserelin combined with dutasteride (ZD), bicalutamide and dutasteride (ZBD), or bicalutamide, dutasteride, and ketoconazole (ZBDK) for 3 months before prostatectomy.Controls included patients receiving combined androgen blockade with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist and bicalutamide.The primary outcome measure was tissue dihydrotestosterone (DHT) concentration.RESULTS: Prostate DHT levels were substantially lower in all experimental arms (0.02 to 0.04 ng/g v 0.92 ng/g in controls; P < .001).The ZBDK group demonstrated the greatest percentage decline in serum testosterone, androsterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (P < .05 for all).Staining for AR and the androgen-regulated genes prostate-specific antigen and TMPRSS2 was strongly suppressed in benign glands and moderately in malignant glands (P < .05 for all).Two patients had pathologic complete response, and nine had </= 0.2 cm(3) of residual tumor (defined as a near-complete response), with the largest numbers of complete and near-complete responses in the ZBDK group.CONCLUSION: Addition of androgen synthesis inhibitors lowers prostate androgens below that achieved with standard therapy, but significant AR signaling remains.Tissue-based analysis of steroids and AR signaling is critical to informing the search for optimal local and systemic control of high-risk prostate cancer.",1,1,1,1
23850170,"Which patients benefit most from primary surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy in stage IIIC or IV ovarian cancer? An exploratory analysis of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer 55971 randomised trial.BACKGROUND: To investigate whether biomarkers consisting of baseline characteristics of advanced stage ovarian cancer patients can help in identifying subgroups of patients who would benefit more from primary surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy.METHODS: We used data of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 55971 trial in which 670 patients were randomly assigned to primary surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy.The primary outcome was overall survival.Ten baseline clinical and pathological characteristics were selected as potential biomarkers.Using Subpopulation Treatment Effect Pattern Plots (STEPP), biomarkers with a statistically significant qualitative additive interaction with treatment were considered as potentially informative for treatment selection.We also combined selected biomarkers to form a multimarker treatment selection rule.FINDINGS: The size of the largest metastatic tumour and clinical stage were significantly associated with the magnitude of the benefit from treatment, in terms of five-year survival (p for interaction: 0.008 and 0.016, respectively).Stage IIIC patients with metastatic tumours 45 mm benefited more from primary surgery while stage IV patients with metastatic tumours >45 mm benefited more from neoadjuvant chemotherapy.In stage IIIC patients with larger metastatic tumours and in stage IV patients with less extensive metastatic tumours both treatments were equally effective.We estimated that by selecting treatments for patients based on largest metastatic tumour and clinical stage, the potential five-year survival rate in the population of treated patients would be 27.3% (95% confidence interval (CI) 21.9-33.0), 7.8% higher than if all were treated with primary surgery, and 5.6% higher if all were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.INTERPRETATION: Although survival was comparable after primary surgery and neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the overall group of patients with ovarian cancer in the EORTC 55971 trial, we found in this exploratory analysis that patients with stage IIIC and less extensive metastatic tumours had higher survival with primary surgery, while patients with stage IV disease and large metastatic tumours had higher survival with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.For patients who did not meet these criteria, both treatment options led to comparable survival rates.",1,1,1,1

25525672,"Comparing effects in regular practice of e-communication and Web-based self-management support among breast cancer patients: preliminary results from a randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: While Web-based interventions have been shown to assist a wide range of patients successfully in managing their illness, few studies have examined the relative contribution of different Web-based components to improve outcomes.Further efficacy trials are needed to test the effects of Web support when offered as a part of routine care.OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to compare in regular care the effects of (1) an Internet-based patient provider communication service (IPPC), (2) WebChoice, a Web-based illness management system for breast cancer patients (IPPC included), and (3) usual care on symptom distress, anxiety, depression, (primary outcomes), and self-efficacy (secondary outcome).This study reports preliminary findings from 6 months' follow-up data in a 12-month trial.METHODS: We recruited 167 patients recently diagnosed with breast cancer and undergoing treatment from three Norwegian hospitals.The nurse-administered IPPC allowed patients to send secure e-messages to and receive e-messages from health care personnel at the hospital where they were treated.In addition to the IPPC, WebChoice contains components for symptom monitoring, tailored information and self-management support, a diary, and communication with other patients.A total of 20 care providers (11 nurses, 6 physicians, and 3 social workers) were trained to answer questions from patients.Outcomes were measured with questionnaires at study entry and at study months 2, 4, and 6.Linear mixed models for repeated measures were fitted to compare effects on outcomes over time.RESULTS: Patients were randomly assigned to the WebChoice group (n=64), the IPPC group (n=45), or the usual care group (n=58).Response rates to questionnaires were 73.7% (123/167) at 2 months, 65.9 (110/167) at 4 months, and 62.3% (104/167) at 6 months.Attrition was similar in all study groups.Among those with access to WebChoice, 64% (41/64) logged on more than once and 39% (25/64) sent e-messages to care providers.In the IPPC group, 40% (18/45) sent e-messages.Linear mixed models analyses revealed that the WebChoice group reported significantly lower symptom distress (mean difference 0.16, 95% CI 0.06-0.25, P=.001), anxiety (mean difference 0.79, 95% CI 0.09-1.49, P=.03), and depression (mean difference 0.79, 95% CI 0.09-1.49, P=.03) compared with the usual care group.The IPPC group reported significant lower depression scores compared with the usual care group (mean difference 0.69, 95% CI 0.05-1.32, P=.03), but no differences were observed for symptom distress or anxiety.No significant differences in self-efficacy were found among the study groups.CONCLUSIONS: In spite of practice variations and moderate use of the interventions, our results suggest that offering Web support as part of regular care can be a powerful tool to help patients manage their illness.Our finding that a nurse-administered IPPC alone can significantly reduce depression is particularly promising.However, the multicomponent intervention WebChoice had additional positive effects.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov:NCT00971009; http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00971009 (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/6USKezP0Y).",0,0,0,0

26438237,"The effects of short-term fasting on tolerance to (neo) adjuvant chemotherapy in HER2-negative breast cancer patients: a randomized pilot study.BACKGROUND: Preclinical evidence shows that short-term fasting (STF) protects healthy cells against side effects of chemotherapy and makes cancer cells more vulnerable to it.This pilot study examines the feasibility of STF and its effects on tolerance of chemotherapy in a homogeneous patient group with early breast cancer (BC).METHODS: Eligible patients had HER2-negative, stage II/III BC.Women receiving (neo)-adjuvant TAC (docetaxel/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide) were randomized to fast 24 h before and after commencing chemotherapy, or to eat according to the guidelines for healthy nutrition.Toxicity in the two groups was compared.Chemotherapy-induced DNA damage in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was quantified by the level of gamma-H2AX analyzed by flow cytometry.RESULTS: Thirteen patients were included of whom seven were randomized to the STF arm.STF was well tolerated.Mean erythrocyte- and thrombocyte counts 7 days post-chemotherapy were significantly higher (P = 0.007, 95 % CI 0.106-0.638 and P = 0.00007, 95 % CI 38.7-104, respectively) in the STF group compared to the non-STF group.Non-hematological toxicity did not differ between the groups.Levels of gamma-H2AX were significantly increased 30 min post-chemotherapy in CD45 + CD3- cells in non-STF, but not in STF patients.CONCLUSIONS: STF during chemotherapy was well tolerated and reduced hematological toxicity of TAC in HER2-negative BC patients.Moreover, STF may reduce a transient increase in, and/or induce a faster recovery of DNA damage in PBMCs after chemotherapy.Larger studies, investigating a longer fasting period, are required to generate more insight into the possible benefits of STF during chemotherapy.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01304251 , March 2011.",1,1,1,1

25403578,"FOLFOX4 versus sequential dose-dense FOLFOX7 followed by FOLFIRI in patients with resectable metastatic colorectal cancer (MIROX): a pragmatic approach to chemotherapy timing with perioperative or postoperative chemotherapy from an open-label, randomized phase III trial.BACKGROUND: Perioperative FOLFOX4 (oxaliplatin plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin) chemotherapy is the current standard in patients with resectable metastases from colorectal cancer (CRC).We aimed to determine whether a sequential chemotherapy with dose-dense oxaliplatin (FOLFOX7) and irinotecan (FOLFIRI; irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin) is superior to FOLFOX4.The chemotherapy timing was not imposed, and was perioperative or postoperative.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this open-label, phase III trial, patients with resectable or resected metastases were randomly assigned either to 12 cycles of FOLFOX4 (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m(2)) or 6 cycles of FOLFOX7 (oxaliplatin 130 mg/m(2)) followed by 6 cycles of FOLFIRI (irinotecan 180 mg/m(2)).Randomization was done centrally, with stratification by chemotherapy timing, type of local treatment (surgery versus radiofrequency ablation with/without surgery), and Fong's prognostic score.The primary end point was 2-year disease-free survival (DFS).RESULTS: A total of 284 patients were randomized, 142 in each treatment group.Chemotherapy was perioperative in 168 (59.2%) patients and postoperative in 116 (40.8%) patients.Perioperative chemotherapy was preferentially proposed for synchronous metastases, whereas postoperative chemotherapy was more frequently used for metachronous metastases.Two-year DFS was 48.5% in the FOLFOX4 group and 50.0% in the FOLFOX7-FOLFIRI group.In the multivariable analysis, more than one metastasis [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.15] and synchronous metastases (HR = 1.63) were independent prognostic factors for shorter DFS.Five-year overall survival (OS) rate was 69.5% with FOLFOX4 versus 66.6% with FOLFOX7-FOLFIRI.CONCLUSIONS: FOLFOX7-FOLFIRI is not superior to FOLFOX4 in patients with resectable metastatic CRC.Five-year OS rates observed in both groups are the highest ever reported in this setting, possibly reflecting the pragmatic approach to chemotherapy timing.CLINICAL TRIALS NUMBER: NCT00268398.",1,1,1,1
27434595,"TRAPEZE: a randomised controlled trial of the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of chemotherapy with zoledronic acid, strontium-89, or both, in men with bony metastatic castration-refractory prostate cancer.BACKGROUND: Bony metastatic castration-refractory prostate cancer is associated with a poor prognosis and high morbidity.TRAPEZE was a two-by-two factorial randomised controlled trial of zoledronic acid (ZA) and strontium-89 (Sr-89), each combined with docetaxel.All have palliative benefits, are used to control bone symptoms and are used with docetaxel to prolong survival.ZA, approved on the basis of reducing skeletal-related events (SREs), is commonly combined with docetaxel in practice, although evidence of efficacy and cost-effectiveness is lacking.Sr-89, approved for controlling metastatic pain and reducing need for subsequent bone treatments, is generally palliatively used in patients unfit for chemotherapy.Phase II analysis confirmed the safety and feasibility of combining these agents.TRAPEZE aimed to determine the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of each agent.METHODS: Patients were randomised to receive six cycles of docetaxel plus prednisolone: alone, with ZA, with a single Sr-89 dose after cycle 6, or with both.Primary outcomes were clinical progression-free survival (CPFS: time to pain progression, SRE or death) and cost-effectiveness.Secondary outcomes were SRE-free interval (SREFI), total SREs, overall survival (OS) and quality of life (QoL).Log-rank test and Cox regression modelling were used to determine clinical effectiveness.Cost-effectiveness was assessed from the NHS perspective and expressed as cost per additional quality-adjusted life-year (QALY).An additional analysis was carried out for ZA to reflect the availability of generic ZA.RESULTS: PATIENTS: 757 randomised (median age 68.7 years; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group scale score 0, 40%; 1, 52%; 2, 8%; prior radiotherapy, 45%); median prostate-specific antigen 143.78 ng/ml (interquartile range 50.8-353.9 ng/ml).Stratified log-rank analysis of CPFS was statistically non-significant for either agent (Sr-89, p = 0.11; ZA, p = 0.45).Cox regression analysis adjusted for stratification variables showed CPFS benefit for Sr-89 [hazard ratio (HR) 0.845, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 0.99; p = 0.036] and confirmed no effect of ZA (p = 0.46).ZA showed a significant SREFI effect (HR 0.76; 95% CI 0.63 to 0.93; p = 0.008).Neither agent affected OS (Sr-89, p = 0.74; ZA, p = 0.91), but both increased total cost (vs. no ZA and no Sr-89, respectively); decreased post-trial therapies partly offset costs [net difference: Sr-89 pound1341; proprietary ZA (Zometa((R)), East Hanover, NJ, USA) pound1319; generic ZA pound251].QoL was maintained in all trial arms; Sr-89 (0.08 additional QALYs) and ZA (0.03 additional QALYs) showed slight improvements.The resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for Sr-89 was pound16,590, with pound42,047 per QALY for Zometa and pound8005 per QALY for generic ZA.CONCLUSION: Strontium-89 improved CPFS, but not OS.ZA did not improve CPFS or OS but significantly improved SREFI, mostly post progression, suggesting a role as post-chemotherapy maintenance therapy.QoL was well maintained in all treatment arms, with differing patterns of care resulting from the effects of Sr-89 on time to progression and ZA on SREFI and total SREs.The addition of Sr-89 resulted in additional cost and a small positive increase in QALYs, with an ICER below the pound20,000 ceiling per QALY.The additional costs and small positive QALY changes in favour of ZA resulted in ICERs of pound42,047 (Zometa) and pound8005 for the generic alternative; thus, generic ZA represents a cost-effective option.Additional analyses on the basis of data from the Hospital Episode Statistics data set would allow corroborating the findings of this study.Further research into the use of ZA (and other bone-targeting therapies) with newer prostate cancer therapies would be desirable.STUDY REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN12808747.FUNDING: This project was funded by the NIHR Health Technology Assessment programme and will be published in full in Health Technology Assessment; Vol. 20, No. 53.See the NIHR Journals Library website for further project information.",0,0,0,0
28797454,"Impact of early prophylactic feeding on long term tube dependency outcomes in patients with head and neck cancer.OBJECTIVES: Prophylactic gastrostomy tube (PGT) is frequently used in patients with head and neck cancer (HNSCC).There are concerns this leads to tube dependency but this phenomena is not well defined.This study aimed to determine whether early feeding via PGT impacted on longer term tube feeding outcomes.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with HNSCC with PGT were observed monthly post-treatment regarding tube use and time to removal up to twelve months.Patients were from a randomised controlled trial comparing an early feeding intervention via the PGT (n=57) versus usual care which commenced feeding when clinically indicated (n=67).RESULTS: Patient characteristics; male (88%), mean age 60+/-10.1years, oropharyngeal tumours (76%), receiving chemoradiotherapy (82%).Tubes were used by 87% (108/124) on completion of treatment and 66% (83/124) one month post.No differences in tube use between groups at any time point or tube removal rates over 12months (p=0.181).In patients free of disease (n=99), the intervention had higher tube use at 4months (p=0.003) and slower removal rates (p=0.047).Overall ten patients had their tube in-situ at 12months (8%) but five were awaiting removal (4% true dependency rate).Of the five patients legitimately using the tube, only one (<1%) was from severe dysphagia post definitive chemoradiotherapy.CONCLUSION: PGT use is high in the acute phase post-treatment.Encouraging early use may prolong time to tube removal but it does not increase long term dependency rates beyond four months post treatment.Monitoring tube use is important to prevent over-estimation of dependency rates.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial has been registered in the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials registry as ACTRN12612000579897.Available at http://www.anzctr.org.au.",1,1,0,0

31653133,"The Effect of Relaxation Techniques on Anxiety, Fatigue and Sleep Quality of Parents of Children with Leukemia under Chemotherapy in South East Iran.INTRODUCTION: Cancer can cause emotional stress in parents, which has a negative impact on the quality of their life.Also, anxiety and psychological stress have a negative effect on the health of parents, and fatigue causes a sense of weakness and reduces the capacity for mental and physical activity, and insomnia, as well as stress and inability to perform their occupational and social functions.This study aimed to determine the effect of relaxation techniques on anxiety, fatigue, and sleep quality of parents of children with leukemia under chemotherapy in South East Iran in 2015.METHODS: This is a randomized controlled trial study.The study population included parents of children with leukemia undergoing chemotherapy who were admitted to a teaching hospital in South East Iran.One hundred twenty parents were randomly assigned to control and intervention groups, and the experimental group was provided with Benson relaxation technique.Data collection tool included a demographic questionnaire, state-trait anxiety inventory, Brief Fatigue Inventory, and sleep quality inventory.Data analysis was done by SPSS 16 and paired t-test, Wilcoxon, Mann- Whitney, regression, One - Way ANOVA and Pearson tests were performed, and p </= 0.05 was statistically significant.RESULTS: The mean score of state anxiety in the intervention group was 60.86 +/- 8.95 and 35.95 +/- 4.61 before and after the intervention, respectively.The mean score of trait anxiety was 56.56 +/- 4.75 and 34.45 +/- 4.95.The mean score of the fatigue was 73.83 +/- 14.63 and 43.71 +/- 11. 06, and the mean score of the quality of sleep was 13.5 +/- 6.05 and 5.7 +/- 3.43 before and after the intervention respectively.There was a statistically significant difference among state-trait anxiety, fatigue, and sleep quality in intervention and control groups after the intervention.There was a statistically significant negative correlation between fatigue and age, but there was no statistically significant relationship among the mean fatigue, weight, the number of sons and daughters, education, occupation, gender, place of residence and income (p> 0.05).There was no statistically significant relationship among the quality of sleep of parents, education, gender, and place of residence, but there was a statistically significant relationship between state anxiety and education (p</=0.05).CONCLUSION: The results can predispose family-centered nursing care to support more the parents of children with cancer in the face of the stress of illness.Developing programs for training muscle relaxation techniques will improve family functioning and mental health.",0,0,0,0
28475456,"Brigatinib in Patients With Crizotinib-Refractory Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase-Positive Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer: A Randomized, Multicenter Phase II Trial.Purpose Most crizotinib-treated patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene ( ALK)-rearranged non-small-cell lung cancer (ALK-positive NSCLC) eventually experience disease progression.We evaluated two regimens of brigatinib, an investigational next-generation ALK inhibitor, in crizotinib-refractory ALK-positive NSCLC.Patients and Methods Patients were stratified by brain metastases and best response to crizotinib.They were randomly assigned (1:1) to oral brigatinib 90 mg once daily (arm A) or 180 mg once daily with a 7-day lead-in at 90 mg (180 mg once daily [with lead-in]; arm B).Investigator-assessed confirmed objective response rate (ORR) was the primary end point.Results Of 222 patients enrolled (arm A: n = 112, 109 treated; arm B: n = 110, 110 treated), 154 (69%) had baseline brain metastases and 164 of 222 (74%) had received prior chemotherapy.With 8.0-month median follow-up, investigator-assessed confirmed ORR was 45% (97.5% CI, 34% to 56%) in arm A and 54% (97.5% CI, 43% to 65%) in arm B. Investigator-assessed median progression-free survival was 9.2 months (95% CI, 7.4 to 15.6) and 12.9 months (95% CI, 11.1 to not reached) in arms A and B, respectively.Independent review committee-assessed intracranial ORR in patients with measurable brain metastases at baseline was 42% (11 of 26 patients) in arm A and 67% (12 of 18 patients) in arm B. Common treatment-emergent adverse events were nausea (arm A/B, 33%/40%), diarrhea (arm A/B, 19%/38%), headache (arm A/B, 28%/27%), and cough (arm A/B, 18%/34%), and were mainly grades 1 to 2.A subset of pulmonary adverse events with early onset (median onset: day 2) occurred in 14 of 219 treated patients (all grades, 6%; grade >/= 3, 3%); none occurred after escalation to 180 mg in arm B. Seven of 14 patients were successfully retreated with brigatinib.Conclusion Brigatinib yielded substantial whole-body and intracranial responses as well as robust progression-free survival; 180 mg (with lead-in) showed consistently better efficacy than 90 mg, with acceptable safety.",1,1,1,1

26214630,"Important prognostic factors for the long-term survival in non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with combination of chemotherapy and conformal radiotherapy.PURPOSE: Combined modality therapy is standard of care for patients with unresectable locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), however, insufficient data exist regarding prognostic factors in this disease setting.METHODS: To evaluate the treatment results and prognostic variables, 85 NSCLC patients treated from October 2005 to April 2008 were randomly assigned to one of the two treatment arms.In the first arm (sequential arm), 45 patients received sequential chemotherapy with 4 cycles of carboplatin and etoposide followed by conformal 3-dimensional (3D) radiotherapy (RT).In the second arm (concurrent arm), 40 patients received concomitant chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide and conformal RT, followed by two cycles of consolidation chemotherapy with carboplatin and etoposide.RESULTS: The median survival was 13 months for the patients in the sequential arm and 19 months for those in the concurrent treatment arm (p=0.0039).The disease-free survival (DFS) was 9 months in the sequential arm and 16 months in the concurrent treatment arm (p=0.0023).The following prognostic factors significantly influenced the survival of the patients treated with combination of RT and chemotherapy: age (p<0.05), performance status (PS) (p<0.001), weight loss (p<0.001), tumor size (p<0.05), nodal involvement (p<0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Given the higher toxicity in the second arm, this should be reserved for younger patients (<70 years), having good PS and minimal weight loss.We highly recommend precise stage and prognostic factors definitions in such patients so that they receive the most beneficial treatment.",0,0,0,0
28577938,"Evaluation of the VeriStrat((R)) serum protein test in patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the lung treated with second-line afatinib or erlotinib in the phase III LUX-Lung 8 study.OBJECTIVES: Identification of biomarkers associated with clinical benefit may be crucial in establishing optimal treatment choice for patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the lung after first-line chemotherapy.In this study, the ability of the VeriStrat serum protein test to predict differential clinical benefit with afatinib versus erlotinib, and the association of VeriStrat status with clinical outcomes irrespective of EGFR-TKI used, was assessed in a retrospective analysis of the phase III LUX-Lung 8 trial.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pretreatment plasma samples were analyzed using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.Spectra were evaluated to assign a VeriStrat 'Good' (VS-G) or VeriStrat 'Poor' (VS-P) classification.Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival, and other endpoints were assessed with respect to pretreatment VeriStrat status; OS was the primary efficacy variable.Outcomes with other efficacy endpoints were similar.RESULTS: Of 795 patients randomized in LUX-Lung 8, 675 were classified (VS-G: 412; VS-P: 263).In the VS-G group, OS was significantly longer with afatinib versus erlotinib (HR 0.79 [95% CI: 0.63-0.98]).In the VS-P group, there was no significant difference in OS between afatinib and erlotinib (HR 0.90 [0.70-1.16]).However, there was no interaction between VeriStrat classification and treatment group for OS (pinteraction=0.5303).OS was significantly longer in VS-G versus VS-P patients, both in the overall VeriStrat-classified population (HR 0.41 [0.35-0.49]) and afatinib-treated patients (HR 0.40 [0.31-0.51]).Multivariate analysis showed that VeriStrat was an independent predictor of OS in afatinib-treated patients, regardless of ECOG PS or best response to first-line chemotherapy.CONCLUSION: VS-G classification is strongly associated with favorable survival outcomes with either afatinib or erlotinib compared with VS-P classification.In VS-G patients, survival outcomes with afatinib are superior to those with erlotinib.VeriStrat classification may guide treatment decisions in patients with SCC of the lung.ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT01523587.",1,1,1,1
23218945,"Modifiable endoscopic factors that influence the adenoma detection rate in colorectal cancer screening colonoscopies.BACKGROUND: Adenoma detection rate (ADR) has become the most important quality indicator for colonoscopy.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate which modifiable factors, directly related to the endoscopic procedure, influenced the ADR in screening colonoscopies.DESIGN: Observational, nested study.SETTING: Multicenter, randomized, controlled trials.PATIENTS: Asymptomatic people aged 50 to 69 years were eligible for a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial designed to compare colonoscopy and fecal immunochemical testing in colorectal cancer screening.A total of 4539 individuals undergoing a direct screening colonoscopy were included in this study.INTERVENTION: Colonoscopy.MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Bowel cleansing, sedation, withdrawal time in normal colonoscopies, and cecal intubation were analyzed as possible predictors of adenoma detection by using logistic regression analysis, adjusted for age and sex.RESULTS: In multivariate analysis, after adjustment for age and sex, factors independently related to the ADR were a mean withdrawal time longer than 8 minutes (odds ratio [OR] 1.51; 95% CI, 1.17-1.96) in normal colonoscopies and split preparation (OR 1.26; 95% CI, 1.01-1.57).For advanced adenomas, only withdrawal time maintained statistical significance in the multivariate analysis.For proximal adenomas, withdrawal time and cecal intubation maintained independent statistical significance, whereas only withdrawal time longer than 8 minutes and a <10-hour period between the end of preparation and colonoscopy showed independent associations for distal adenomas.LIMITATIONS: Only endoscopic variables have been analyzed.CONCLUSION: Withdrawal time was the only modifiable factor related to the ADR in colorectal cancer screening colonoscopies associated with an increased detection rate of overall, advanced, proximal, and distal adenomas.",1,0,0,0
25975523,"Analysis of incomplete excisions of basal-cell carcinomas after breadloaf microscopy compared with 3D-microscopy: a prospective randomized and blinded study.Basal-cell carcinomas may show irregular, asymmetric subclinical growth.This study analyzed the efficacy of 'breadloaf' microscopy (serial sectioning) and three-dimensional (3D) microscopy in detecting positive tumor margins.Two hundred eighty-three (283) tumors (51.2%) were put into the breadloaf microscopy group; 270 tumors (48.8%) into the 3D microscopy group.The position of any detected tumor outgrowths was identified in clock face fashion.The time required for cutting and embedding the specimens and the examination of the microscopic slides was measured.Patient/tumor characteristics and surgical margins did not differ significantly.Tumor outgrowths at the excision margin were found in 62 of 283 cases (21.9%) in the breadloaf microscopy group and in 115 of 270 cases (42.6%) in the 3D microscopy group, constituting a highly significant difference (p < 0.001).This difference held true with incomplete excision of fibrosing (infiltrative/sclerosing/morpheaform) tumors [32.9% in the breadloaf microscopy group and 57.5% in the 3D microscopy group (p = 0.003)] and also with solid (nodular) tumors [16.1 and 34.2%, respectively (p < 0.001)].The mean overall examination time required showed no important difference.In summary, for detection of tumor outgrowths, 3D microscopy has almost twice the sensitivity of breadloaf microscopy, particularly in the situation of aggressive/infiltrative carcinomas.",0,0,0,0
28961845,"Borealis-1: a randomized, first-line, placebo-controlled, phase II study evaluating apatorsen and chemotherapy for patients with advanced urothelial cancer.Background: Five-year survival of patients with inoperable, advanced urothelial carcinoma treated with the first-line chemotherapy is 5%-15%.We assessed whether the Hsp27 inhibitor apatorsen combined with gemcitabine plus cisplatin (GC) could improve overall survival (OS) in these patients.Patients and methods: This placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase II trial randomized 183 untreated urothelial carcinoma patients (North America and Europe) to receive GC plus either placebo (N = 62), 600 mg apatorsen (N = 60), or 1000 mg apatorsen (N = 61).In the experimental arm, treatment included loading doses of apatorsen followed by up to six cycles of apatorsen plus GC.Patients receiving at least four cycles could continue apatorsen monotherapy as maintenance until progression or unacceptable toxicity.The primary end point was OS.Results: OS was not significantly improved in the single or combined 600- or 1000-mg apatorsen arms versus placebo [hazard ratio (HR), 0.86 and 0.90, respectively].Exploratory study of specific statistical modeling showed a trend for improved survival in patients with baseline poor prognostic features treated with 600 mg apatorsen compared with placebo (HR = 0.72).Landmark analysis of serum Hsp27 (sHsp27) levels showed a trend toward survival benefit for poor-prognosis patients in 600- and 1000-mg apatorsen arms who achieved lower area under the curve sHsp27 levels, compared with the placebo arm (HR = 0.45 and 0.62, respectively).Higher baseline circulating tumor cells (>/=5 cells/7.5 ml) was observed in patients with poor prognosis in correlation with poor survival.Treatment-emergent adverse events were manageable and more common in both apatorsen-treatment arms.Conclusions: Even though apatorsen combined with standard chemotherapy did not demonstrate a survival benefit in the overall study population, patients with poor prognostic features might benefit from this combination.Serum Hsp27 levels may act as a biomarker to predict treatment outcome.Further exploration of apatorsen in poor-risk patients is warranted.",1,1,1,1
30386984,"Short-term surgical outcomes of laparoscopy-assisted versus open D2 distal gastrectomy for locally advanced gastric cancer in North China: a multicenter randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Although laparoscopic surgery has been recommended as an optional therapy for patients with early gastric cancer, whether patients with locally advanced gastric cancer (AGC) could benefit from laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy (LADG) with D2 lymphadenectomy remains elusive due to a lack of comprehensive clinical data.To evaluate the efficacy of LADG, we conducted a multi-institutional randomized controlled trial to compare laparoscopy-assisted versus open distal gastrectomy (ODG) for AGC in North China.METHODS: In this RCT, after patients were enrolled according to the eligibility criteria, they were preoperatively assigned to LADG or ODG arm randomly with a 1:1 allocation ratio.The primary endpoint was the morbidity and mortality within 30 postoperative days to evaluate the surgical safety of LADG.The secondary endpoint was 3-year disease-free survival.This trial was registered at ClinicalTrial.gov as NCT02464215.RESULTS: Between March 2014 and August 2017, a total of 446 patients with cT2-4aN0-3M0 (AJCC 7th staging system) were enrolled.Of these, 222 patients underwent LADG and 220 patients underwent ODG were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis.The compliance rate of D2 lymph node dissection was identical between the LADG and ODG arms (99.5%, P = 1.000).No significant difference was observed regarding the overall postoperative complication rate in two groups (LADG 13.1%, ODG 17.7%, P = 0.174).No operation-related death occurred in both arms.CONCLUSIONS: This trial confirmed that LADG performed by credentialed surgeons was safe and feasible for patients with AGC compared with conventional ODG.",1,1,1,1

The response rate (according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors [RECIST]) was 22% in arm A (4 complete responses [CRs] and 8 partial responses [PRs]) and 17% in arm B (1 CR and 4 PRs).Stable disease or PR or CR was noted in 65% of patients in arm A and 48% of patients in arm B. The combination was found to be superior to monotherapy in patients with high and low levels of serum VEGF and VEGF receptor 2.Adverse events were consistent with the expected profiles of monotherapy with IL-2 and ziv-aflibercept.CONCLUSIONS: Ziv-aflibercept and IL-2 were found to significantly improve PFS compared with IL-2 alone, thereby meeting the primary endpoint of the current study.These findings support further study of immunotherapeutic combination strategies involving VEGF inhibitors.",1,1,1,1
24346102,"Randomized, double-blind, phase II trial comparing gemcitabine-cisplatin plus the LTB4 antagonist LY293111 versus gemcitabine-cisplatin plus placebo in first-line non-small-cell lung cancer.INTRODUCTION: In this phase II study, patients with stage IIIB/IV non-small-cell lung cancer were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive LY293111 (200 mg twice daily [200 LY293111] or 600 mg twice daily [600 LY293111]) or placebo for 7 days, followed by concurrent cisplatin (75 mg/m2; day 1) and gemcitabine (1250 mg/m2; days 1 and 8), every 21 days.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, (PFS), with 75% power to detect 33% improvement compared with placebo (5 months).METHODS: Of 200 randomized patients, 195 were treated.Demographics were well balanced across treatment arms: 65% of the patients were men; median age was 62 years; 85% had stage IV disease; and patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 (36%) or 1 (64%).RESULTS: The most frequent study drug-related toxicities were nausea, vomiting, and fatigue.Response rates were similar across treatment arms (200 LY293111: 20%; 600 LY293111: 25%; placebo: 31%).CONCLUSIONS: Median PFS (95% confidence interval) was not significantly different across treatment arms (200 LY293111: 4.6 months [3.2-5.0]; 600 LY293111: 5.6 months [4.1-6.8]; placebo: 6.0 months [5.2-7.5]).LY293111 combined with gemcitabine-cisplatin did not increase median PFS compared with placebo plus gemcitabine-cisplatin in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer.",1,1,1,1

25081390,"NY-ESO-1 specific antibody and cellular responses in melanoma patients primed with NY-ESO-1 protein in ISCOMATRIX and boosted with recombinant NY-ESO-1 fowlpox virus.Vaccination strategies based on repeated injections of NY-ESO-1 protein formulated in ISCOMATRIX particles (NY-ESO-1 ISCOMATRIX) have shown to elicit combined NY-ESO-1 specific antibody and T cell responses.However, it remains unclear whether heterologous prime-boost strategies based on the combination with NY-ESO-1 ISCOMATRIX with different NY-ESO-1 boosting reagents could be used to increase NY-ESO-1 CD8(+) or CD4(+) T cell responses.To address this question, we carried out a randomized clinical trial in 39 high-risk, resected melanoma patients vaccinated with NY-ESO-1 ISCOMATRIX, and then boosted with repeated injections of either recombinant fowlpox virus encoding full length NY-ESO-1 (rF-NY-ESO-1) (Arm A) or NY-ESO-1 ISCOMATRIX alone (Arm B).We have comprehensively analyzed NY-ESO-1 specific T cells and B cells response in all patients before and after vaccination for a total of seven time points per patient.NY-ESO-1 ISCOMATRIX alone elicited a strong NY-ESO-1 specific CD4(+) T cell and antibody response, which was maintained by both regiments at similar levels.However, CD8(+) T cell responses were significantly boosted in 3 out of 18 patients in Arm A after the first rF-NY-ESO-1 injection and such responses were maintained until the end of the trial, while no patients in Arm B showed similar CD8(+) T cell responses.In addition, our results clearly identified immunodominant regions in the NY-ESO-1 protein: NY-ESO-179-102 and NY-ESO-1115-138 for CD4+ T cells and NY-ESO-185-108 for CD8+ T cells in a large proportion of vaccinated patients.These regions of NY-ESO-1 protein should be considered in future clinical trials as immunodominant epitopes.",1,1,1,1
27498129,"Toxicity of dual HER2-blockade with pertuzumab added to anthracycline versus non-anthracycline containing chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment in HER2-positive breast cancer: The TRAIN-2 study.BACKGROUND: The addition of pertuzumab to neoadjuvant trastuzumab-based chemotherapy improves pathologic complete response rates in HER2-positive breast cancer.However, increased toxicity has been reported with the addition of pertuzumab, and this may differ between various chemotherapy backbone regimens.We evaluated toxicities of pertuzumab when added to either FEC-T (5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide, trastuzumab) or weekly paclitaxel, trastuzumab, carboplatin (PTC).METHODS: The TRAIN-2 study is a neoadjuvant randomized controlled trial in stage II and III HER2-positive breast cancer (NCT01996267).Patients are randomly assigned to receive either three cycles of FEC-T plus pertuzumab or three cycles of PTC plus pertuzumab, followed by six cycles of PTC plus pertuzumab in both arms.Toxicities are described per treatment arm according to the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03.RESULTS: This analysis includes 110 patients balanced over both treatment arms.Neutropenia was the most common hematologic toxicity, with grade 3-4 occurring in 53% in the FEC-T-arm and in 51% in the PTC-arm.Febrile neutropenia occurred in 9% in the FEC-T arm and did not occur in the PTC-arm.Secondary G-CSF prophylaxis was used in 35-40% of patients.Asymptomatic ejection fraction decrease grade 2 was observed in 24% in the FEC-T-arm and 11% in the PTC-arm.The most common grade 3-4 non-hematologic toxicity was diarrhea (5% in the FEC-T-arm and 18% in the PTC-arm).CONCLUSIONS: Pertuzumab in combination with FEC-T mostly causes neutropenia, and when added to PTC mostly causes diarrhea.Significant cardiac toxicity is rare with both regimens, and toxicity is overall well manageable.",1,1,1,1
25018037,"Impact of baseline corticosteroids on survival and steroid androgens in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: exploratory analysis from COU-AA-301.BACKGROUND: Corticosteroids have been used to mitigate mineralocorticoid-related effects and restore sensitivity to abiraterone acetate.Corticosteroids may also mediate glucocorticoid receptor or mutated androgen receptor activation and adversely influence outcome.OBJECTIVE: This post hoc exploratory analysis investigated whether baseline corticosteroids were an independent prognostic factor and its level of contribution in the presence of other prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) in study COU-AA-301.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: COU-AA-301 was a randomised study of abiraterone plus prednisone versus prednisone in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients after docetaxel.INTERVENTION: Patients were randomised 2:1 to abiraterone 1000 mg plus prednisone 5mg by mouth twice daily versus prednisone.OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Association of OS with baseline corticosteroids was determined by univariate and multivariate Cox models.RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: At study entry, 33% of patients received corticosteroids, had worse disease characteristics (p<0.05 except liver metastases), and were more likely to have testosterone levels below the median (odds ratio:2.92; chi-square p<0.0001).Associations between prostate-specific antigen response as well as circulating tumour cell decline and higher baseline androgen levels were demonstrated.Patients taking baseline corticosteroids had inferior OS in univariate analysis (hazard ratio: 1.48; p<0.0001); however, in multivariate stepwise selection modelling, baseline corticosteroids did not add substantially to the model.This analysis is limited as a retrospective analysis and restricted to patients after docetaxel.CONCLUSIONS: In the COU-AA-301 study, baseline corticosteroids were associated with adverse prognostic features, inferior OS, and lower baseline androgen levels but did not add substantial information to the final prognostic model.Thus in these data from study COU-AA-301, concurrent baseline corticosteroids did not have an independent impact on OS.PATIENT SUMMARY: Baseline corticosteroids did not adversely affect abiraterone clinical benefit in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.Their use was associated with patients having worse disease characteristics.",1,1,1,1

28578704,"Dietary supplementation with n-3-fatty acids in patients with pancreatic cancer and cachexia: marine phospholipids versus fish oil - a randomized controlled double-blind trial.BACKGROUND: Like many other cancer patients, most pancreatic carcinoma patients suffer from severe weight loss.As shown in numerous studies with fish oil (FO) supplementation, a minimum daily intake of 1.5 g n-3-fatty acids (n-3-FA) contributes to weight stabilization and improvement of quality of life (QoL) of cancer patients.Given n-3-FA not as triglycerides (FO), but mainly bound to marine phospholipids (MPL), weight stabilization and improvement of QoL has already been seen at much lower doses of n-3-FA (0,3 g), and MPL were much better tolerated.The objective of this double-blind randomized controlled trial was to compare low dose MPL and FO formulations, which had the same n-3-FA amount and composition, on weight and appetite stabilization, global health enhancement (QoL), and plasma FA-profiles in patients suffering from pancreatic cancer.METHODS: Sixty pancreatic cancer patients were included into the study and randomized to take either FO- or MPL supplementation.Patients were treated with 0.3 g of n-3-fatty acids per day over six weeks.Since the n-3-FA content of FO is usually higher than that of MPL, FO was diluted with 40% of medium chain triglycerides (MCT) to achieve the same capsule size in both intervention groups and therefore assure blinding.Routine blood parameters, lipid profiles, body weight, and appetite were measured before and after intervention.Patient compliance was assessed through a patient diary.Quality of life and nutritional habits were assessed with validated questionnaires (EORTC-QLQ-C30, PAN26).Thirty one patients finalized the study protocol and were analyzed (per-protocol-analysis).RESULTS: Intervention with low dose n-3-FAs, either as FO or MPL supplementation, resulted in similar and promising weight and appetite stabilization in pancreatic cancer patients.MPL capsules were slightly better tolerated and showed fewer side effects, when compared to FO supplementation.CONCLUSION: The similar effects between both interventions were unexpected but reliable, since the MPL and FO formulations caused identical increases of n-3-FAs in plasma lipids of included patients after supplementation.The effects of FO with very low n-3-FA content might be explained by the addition of MCT.The results of this study suggest the need for further investigations of marine phospholipids for the improvement of QoL of cancer patients, optionally in combination with MCT.",0,0,0,0
25824556,"Effect of magnesium on functional outcome and paraclinical parameters of patients undergoing supratentorial craniotomy for brain tumors: a randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Several studies have demonstrated that magnesium (Mg) plays an important role in the prevention and treatment of central nervous system (CNS) insults.In this study, we tested the effect of intravenous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) on the outcome of patients with brain tumors who underwent craniotomy.The outcome was defined clinically as the Barthel index score and paraclinically as blood levels of NSE (neuron-specific enloase) and S100Beta protein.METHODS: Sixty patients were randomly divided into two groups of 30 patients: the treatment and control groups.In the treatment group, 5 g of MgSO4 in normal saline was infused in 6 h 2 days before surgery, and the same dosage was repeated the day before and during surgery.The control group received placebo.Serum S100Beta and NSE concentrations were measured at baseline before administration of magnesium, before surgery, and on the 2nd postoperative day.The Barthel index score was evaluated and registered before surgery, 3, and 6 months after the operation.RESULTS: The study results showed a significant change in S100Beta protein levels before and after surgery (p < 0.05), but we could not find similar results for NSE protein and the Barthel index score.There was a correlation between NSE protein and the Barthel index.CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study revealed that administration of intravenous MgSO4 before and during surgery is safe and effective in reducing S100B protein levels in patients undergoing supratentorial craniotomy for brain tumors.Further studies to elucidate the pathophysiology of brain injuries and role of magnesium are warranted.",0,0,0,0
25848883,"High definition bronchoscopy: a randomized exploratory study of diagnostic value compared to standard white light bronchoscopy and autofluorescence bronchoscopy.BACKGROUND: Videobronchoscopy is an essential diagnostic procedure for evaluation of the central airways and pivotal for the diagnosis and staging of lung cancer.Technological improvements have resulted in high definition (HD) images with advanced real time image enhancement techniques (i-scan).OBJECTIVES: In this study we aimed to explore the sensitivity of HD+ i-scan bronchoscopy for detection of epithelial changes like vascular abnormalities and suspicious preinvasive lesions, and tumors.METHODS: In patients scheduled for a therapeutic or diagnostic procedure under general anesthesia videos of the bronchial tree were made using 5 videobronchoscopy modes in random order: normal white light videobronchoscopy (WLB), HD-bronchoscopy (HD), HD bronchoscopy with surface enhancement technique (i-scan1), HD with surface- and tone enhancement technique (i-scan2) and dual mode autofluorescence videobronchoscopy (AFB).The videos were scored in random order by two independent and blinded expert bronchoscopists.RESULTS: In 29 patients all videos were available for analysis.Vascular abnormalities were scored most frequently in HD + i-scan2 bronchoscopy (1.33 +/- 0.29 abnormal or suspicious sites per patient) as compared to 0.12 +/-0.05 site for AFB (P = 0.003).Sites suspicious for preinvasive lesions were most frequently reported using AFB (0.74 +/- 0.12 sites per patient) as compared to 0.17 +/-0.06 for both WLB and HD bronchoscopy (P = 0.003).Tumors were detected equally by all modalities.The preferred modality was HD bronchoscopy with i-scan (tone- plus surface and surface enhancement in respectively 38% and 35% of cases P = 0.006).CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that high definition bronchoscopy with image enhancement technique may result in better detection of subtle vascular abnormalities in the airways.Since these abnormalities may be related to preneoplastic lesions and tumors this is of clinical relevance.Further investigations using this technique relating imaging to histology are warranted.",0,0,0,0
28412590,"Baseline carcinoembryonic antigen as a predictive factor of ramucirumab efficacy in RAISE, a second-line metastatic colorectal carcinoma phase III trial.BACKGROUND: The RAISE phase III clinical trial demonstrated that ramucirumab + (folinic acid plus 5-fluorouracil plus irinotecan) FOLFIRI significantly improved overall survival (OS) versus placebo + FOLFIRI for second-line metastatic colorectal carcinoma (mCRC) patients failing bevacizumab- and oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.73-0.98, P = 0.022).Post hoc analyses of RAISE patient data examined the association of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) subgroups with efficacy parameters.METHODS: CEA subgroups (</=10 versus >10 ng/ml) were based on 2X upper limit of normal (ULN) (5 ng/ml).The Kaplan-Meier method estimated the median OS and the progression-free survival (PFS).Log-rank test compared the survival distributions within the subgroups.Hazard ratio (HR) (95% confidence interval [CI]) and treatment-by-subgroup interaction p-values were calculated by Cox proportional hazards model.RESULTS: Ramucirumab treatment prolonged survival for the CEA </=10 subgroup (HR = 0.68; 95% CI = 0.50-0.92; P = 0.013) and CEA >10 subgroup (HR = 0.90; 95% CI = 0.76-1.07; P = 0.233).However, the ramucirumab OS benefit over placebo was greater for the CEA </=10 subgroup than for the CEA >10 subgroup (median OS: 3.6 versus 0.8 months greater, respectively).The interaction P-value between CEA level and treatment effect on OS was 0.088.This trend was observed across randomisation strata and to a lesser extent for PFS (P = 0.594).CONCLUSIONS: Although patients in both high- and low-CEA subgroups derive OS and PFS benefits from ramucirumab treatment, the low baseline CEA level may identify a subgroup of patients with mCRC who obtain greater benefit from ramucirumab.",1,1,1,1

30902613,"Updated Efficacy and Safety Data and Impact of the EML4-ALK Fusion Variant on the Efficacy of Alectinib in Untreated ALK-Positive Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer in the Global Phase III ALEX Study.INTRODUCTION: At the prior data cutoff (February 9, 2017) the ALEX trial showed superior investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) for alectinib versus crizotinib in untreated, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive, advanced NSCLC (hazard ratio = 0.47, 95% confidence interval: 0.34-0.65, p < 0.001).The median PFS in the alectinib arm was not reached versus 11.1 months with crizotinib.Retrospective analyses suggest that the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 gene-ALK variant (EML4-ALK) may influence ALK-inhibitor treatment benefit.We present updated analyses, including exploratory subgroup analysis by EML4-ALK variant, after an additional 10 months' follow-up (cutoff December 1, 2017).METHODS: Patients were randomized to receive twice-daily alectinib, 600 mg, or crizotinib, 250 mg, until disease progression, toxicity, death, or withdrawal.PFS was determined by the investigators.Baseline plasma and tissue biomarker samples were analyzed by using hybrid-capture, next-generation sequencing to determine EML4-ALK variant.RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were balanced.Investigator-assessed PFS was prolonged with alectinib (stratified hazard ratio = 0.43, 95% confidence interval: 0.32-0.58).The median PFS times were 34.8 months with alectinib and 10.9 months with crizotinib.EML4-ALK fusions were detectable in 129 patient plasma samples and 124 tissue samples; variants 1, 2, and 3/ab did not affect PFS, objective response rate, or duration of response.Investigator-assessed PFS was longer for alectinib than for crizotinib across EML4-ALK variants 1, 2, and 3a/b in plasma and tissue.Despite longer treatment duration (27.0 months in the case of alectinib versus 10.8 months in the case of crizotinib), the safety of alectinib compared favorably with that of crizotinib.CONCLUSION: Alectinib continues to demonstrate superior investigator-assessed PFS versus crizotinib in untreated ALK-positive NSCLC, irrespective of EML4-ALK variant.",1,1,1,1
24646327,"Standardization of D2 lymphadenectomy and surgical quality control (KLASS-02-QC): a prospective, observational, multicenter study [NCT01283893].BACKGROUND: Extended systemic lymphadenectomy (D2) is standard procedure for surgical treatment of advanced gastric cancer (AGC) although less extensive lymphadenectomy (D1) can be applied to early gastric cancer.Complete D2 lymphadenectomy is the mandatory procedure for studies that evaluate surgical treatment results of AGC.However, the actual extent of D2 lymphadenectomy varies among surgeons because of a lacking consensus on the anatomical definition of each lymph node station.This study is aimed to develop a consensus for D2 lymphadenectomy and also to qualify surgeons that can perform both laparoscopic and open D2 gastrectomy.METHODS/DESIGN: This (KLASS-02-QC) is a prospective, observational, multicenter study to qualify the surgeons that will participate in the KLASS-02-RCT, which is a prospective, randomized, clinical trial comparing laparoscopic and open gastrectomy for AGC.Surgeons and reviewers participating in the study will be required to complete a questionnaire detailing their professional experience and specific gastrectomy surgical background/training, and the gastrectomy metrics of their primary hospitals.All surgeons must submit three laparoscopic and three open D2 gastrectomy videos, respectively.Each video will be allocated to five peer reviewers; thus each surgeon's operations will be assessed by a total of 30 reviews.Based on blinded assessment of unedited videos by experts' review, a separate review evaluation committee will decide whether or not the evaluated surgeon will participate in the KLASS-02-RCT.The primary outcome measure is each surgeon's proficiency, as assessed by the reviewers based on evaluation criteria for completeness of D2 lymphadenectomy.DISCUSSION: We believe that our study for standardization of D2 lymphadenectomy and surgical quality control (KLASS-02-QC) will guarantee successful implementation of the subsequent KLASS-02-RCT study.After making consensus on D2 lymphadenectomy, we developed evaluation criteria for completeness of D2 lymphadenectomy.We also developed a unique surgical standardization and quality control system that consists of recording unedited surgical videos, and expert review according to evaluation criteria for completeness of D2 lymphadenectomy.We hope our systematic approach will set a milestone in surgical standardization that is essential for surgical clinical trials.Additionally, our methods will serve as a novel system for educating surgeons and assessing surgical proficiency.TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT01283893.",0,0,0,0
31591063,"Ramucirumab plus erlotinib in patients with untreated, EGFR-mutated, advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (RELAY): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Dual blockade of the EGFR and VEGF pathways in EGFR-mutated metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is supported by preclinical and clinical data, yet the approach is not widely implemented.RELAY assessed erlotinib, an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) standard of care, plus ramucirumab, a human IgG1 VEGFR2 antagonist, or placebo in patients with untreated EGFR-mutated metastatic NSCLC.METHODS: This is a worldwide, double-blind, phase 3 trial done in 100 hospitals, clinics, and medical centres in 13 countries.Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older (20 years or older in Japan and Taiwan) at the time of study entry, had stage IV NSCLC, with an EGFR exon 19 deletion (ex19del) or exon 21 substitution (Leu858Arg) mutation, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, and no CNS metastases.We randomly assigned eligible patients in a 1:1 ratio to receive oral erlotinib (150 mg/day) plus either intravenous ramucirumab (10 mg/kg) or matching placebo once every 2 weeks.Randomisation was done by an interactive web response system with a computer-generated sequence and stratified by sex, geographical region, EGFR mutation type, and EGFR testing method.The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population.Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment.This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02411448, and is ongoing for long-term survival follow-up.FINDINGS: Between Jan 28, 2016, and Feb 1, 2018, 449 eligible patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to treatment with ramucirumab plus erlotinib (n=224) or placebo plus erlotinib (n=225).Median duration of follow-up was 20.7 months (IQR 15.8-27.2).At the time of primary analysis, progression-free survival was significantly longer in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib group (19.4 months [95% CI 15.4-21.6]) than in the placebo plus erlotinib group (12.4 months [11.0-13.5]), with a stratified hazard ratio of 0.59 (95% CI 0.46-0.76; p<0.0001).Grade 3-4 treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 159 (72%) of 221 patients in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib group versus 121 (54%) of 225 in the placebo plus erlotinib group.The most common grade 3-4 treatment-emergent adverse events in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib group were hypertension (52 [24%]; grade 3 only) and dermatitis acneiform (33 [15%]), and in the placebo plus erlotinib group were dermatitis acneiform (20 [9%]) and increased alanine aminotransferase (17 [8%]).Treatment-emergent serious adverse events were reported in 65 (29%) of 221 patients in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib group and 47 (21%) of 225 in the placebo plus erlotinib group.The most common serious adverse events of any grade in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib group were pneumonia (seven [3%]) and cellulitis and pneumothorax (four [2%], each); the most common in the placebo plus erlotinib group were pyrexia (four [2%]) and pneumothorax (three [1%]).One on-study treatment-related death due to an adverse event occurred (haemothorax after a thoracic drainage procedure for a pleural empyema) in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib group.INTERPRETATION: Ramucirumab plus erlotinib demonstrated superior progression-free survival compared with placebo plus erlotinib in patients with untreated EGFR-mutated metastatic NSCLC.Safety was consistent with the safety profiles of the individual compounds in advanced lung cancer.The RELAY regimen is a viable new treatment option for the initial treatment of EGFR-mutated metastatic NSCLC.FUNDING: Eli Lilly.",1,1,1,1

27557302,"Daratumumab, Bortezomib, and Dexamethasone for Multiple Myeloma.BACKGROUND: Daratumumab, a human IgGkappa monoclonal antibody that targets CD38, induces direct and indirect antimyeloma activity and has shown substantial efficacy as monotherapy in heavily pretreated patients with multiple myeloma, as well as in combination with bortezomib in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.METHODS: In this phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 498 patients with relapsed or relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma to receive bortezomib (1.3 mg per square meter of body-surface area) and dexamethasone (20 mg) alone (control group) or in combination with daratumumab (16 mg per kilogram of body weight) (daratumumab group).The primary end point was progression-free survival.RESULTS: A prespecified interim analysis showed that the rate of progression-free survival was significantly higher in the daratumumab group than in the control group; the 12-month rate of progression-free survival was 60.7% in the daratumumab group versus 26.9% in the control group.After a median follow-up period of 7.4 months, the median progression-free survival was not reached in the daratumumab group and was 7.2 months in the control group (hazard ratio for progression or death with daratumumab vs. control, 0.39; 95% confidence interval, 0.28 to 0.53; P<0.001).The rate of overall response was higher in the daratumumab group than in the control group (82.9% vs. 63.2%, P<0.001), as were the rates of very good partial response or better (59.2% vs. 29.1%, P<0.001) and complete response or better (19.2% vs. 9.0%, P=0.001).Three of the most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events reported in the daratumumab group and the control group were thrombocytopenia (45.3% and 32.9%, respectively), anemia (14.4% and 16.0%, respectively), and neutropenia (12.8% and 4.2%, respectively).Infusion-related reactions that were associated with daratumumab treatment were reported in 45.3% of the patients in the daratumumab group; these reactions were mostly grade 1 or 2 (grade 3 in 8.6% of the patients), and in 98.2% of these patients, they occurred during the first infusion.CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with relapsed or relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, daratumumab in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone resulted in significantly longer progression-free survival than bortezomib and dexamethasone alone and was associated with infusion-related reactions and higher rates of thrombocytopenia and neutropenia than bortezomib and dexamethasone alone.(Funded by Janssen Research and Development; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02136134.).",1,1,1,1
24315404,"A phase III randomized study comparing neoadjuvant chemotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy for locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma: updated long-term survival outcomes.OBJECTIVE: To determine whether concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) can improve survival rates compared to the neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) regimen in locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 338 patients with biopsy-proven NPC were randomly assigned to receive NACT followed by radical radiotherapy (RT) then adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) or CCRT followed by AC.RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 60 months, the 5-year overall survival (OS) rate did not differ significantly between two groups (75.5% vs 79.4% in CCRT and NACT group respectively, P=0.47, HR=0.84, 95%CI 0.53-1.33).Metastasis-free survival (MFS) rate was significantly improved by the CCRT (79.0% vs 86.9%, P=0.05, HR=0.59, 95%CI 0.35-1.00).Subgroup analysis indicated that the benefit of CCRT was derived from N0/N1 tumors (78.0% vs 93.5%, P=0.05, HR=0.35, 95%CI 0.12-0.99).Higher rates of mucositis (52.4% vs. 35.9% P=0.02) and vomiting (13.7% vs. 4.7% P=0.00) were noted in the CCRT arm.Late toxicities were similar in two groups.CONCLUSIONS: The updated results demonstrated no significant survival benefit of CCRT over NACT in patients with locoregionally advanced NPC.CCRT only showed significant MFS efficacy in T3-4N0-1 populations.",1,1,1,1
24903230,"Effect of inspiration on airway dimensions measured in maximal inspiration CT images of subjects without airflow limitation.OBJECTIVES: To study the effect of inspiration on airway dimensions measured in voluntary inspiration breath-hold examinations.METHODS: 961 subjects with normal spirometry were selected from the Danish Lung Cancer Screening Trial.Subjects were examined annually for five years with low-dose CT.Automated software was utilized to segment lungs and airways, identify segmental bronchi, and match airway branches in all images of the same subject.Inspiration level was defined as segmented total lung volume (TLV) divided by predicted total lung capacity (pTLC).Mixed-effects models were used to predict relative change in lumen diameter (ALD) and wall thickness (AWT) in airways of generation 0 (trachea) to 7 and segmental bronchi (R1-R10 and L1-L10) from relative changes in inspiration level.RESULTS: Relative changes in ALD were related to relative changes in TLV/pTLC, and this distensibility increased with generation (p < 0.001).Relative changes in AWT were inversely related to relative changes in TLV/pTLC in generation 3--7 (p < 0.001).Segmental bronchi were widely dispersed in terms of ALD (5.7 +/- 0.7 mm), AWT (0.86 +/- 0.07 mm), and distensibility (23.5 +/- 7.7%).CONCLUSIONS: Subjects who inspire more deeply prior to imaging have larger ALD and smaller AWT.This effect is more pronounced in higher-generation airways.Therefore, adjustment of inspiration level is necessary to accurately assess airway dimensions.KEY POINTS: Airway lumen diameter increases and wall thickness decreases with inspiration.The effect of inspiration is greater in higher-generation (more peripheral) airways.Airways of generation 5 and beyond are as distensible as lung parenchyma.Airway dimensions measured from CT should be adjusted for inspiration level.",0,0,0,0
25374187,"Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in non-cardia gastric cancer patients--does it improve survival?BACKGROUND: Survival rates after resection of advanced gastric cancer are extremely poor.An increasing number of patients with gastric carcinomas (GC) are therefore being treated with preoperative chemotherapy.We evaluated 36 month survival rate of GC patients that were treated by adding a neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy before gastrostomy.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with stage II or III gastric adenocarcinomas were enrolled.The patients divided into two groups: (A) Neoadjuvant group that received concurrent chemoradiation before surgery (4,500 cGy of radiation at 180 cGy per day plus chemotherapy with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil, in the first and the end four days of radiotherapy).Resection was attempted 5 to 6 weeks after end of chemoradiotherapy.(B) Adjuvant group that received concurrent chemo-radiation after surgical resection.RESULTS: Two (16.7%) patients out of 12 patients treated with neoadjuvant chemo-radiotherapy and 5 (38.5%) out of 13 in the surgery group survived after 36 months.These rates were not significantly different with per protocol and intention-to-treat analysis.The median survival time of patients in group A and B were 13.4 and 21.6 months , respectively, again not significantly different.Survival was significantly greater in patients with well differentiated adenocarcinoma in group B than in group A (p<0.004).CONCLUSIONS: According to this study we suggest surgery then chemoradiotherapy for patients with well differentiated gastric adenocarcinoma rather than other approaches.Additional studies with greater sample size and accurate matching relying on cancer molecular behavior are recommended.",0,0,0,0

28623628,"Does Patient Preference Measurement in Decision Aids Improve Decisional Conflict? A Randomized Trial in Men with Prostate Cancer.BACKGROUND: Shared decision making (SDM) has been advocated as an approach to medical decision making that can improve decisional quality.Decision aids are tools that facilitate SDM in the context of limited physician time; however, many decision aids do not incorporate preference measurement.OBJECTIVES: We aim to understand whether adding preference measurement to a standard patient educational intervention improves decisional quality and is feasible in a busy clinical setting.METHODS: Men with incident localized prostate cancer (n = 122) were recruited from the Greater Los Angeles Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center urology clinic, Olive View UCLA Medical Center, and Harbor UCLA Medical Center from January 2011 to May 2015 and randomized to education with a brochure about prostate cancer treatment or software-based preference assessment in addition to the brochure.Men undergoing preference assessment received a report detailing the relative strength of their preferences for treatment outcomes used in review with their doctor.Participants completed instruments measuring decisional conflict, knowledge, SDM, and patient satisfaction with care before and/or after their cancer consultation.RESULTS: Baseline knowledge scores were low (mean 62%).The baseline mean total score on the Decisional Conflict Scale was 2.3 (+/-0.9), signifying moderate decisional conflict.Men undergoing preference assessment had a significantly larger decrease in decisional conflict total score (p = 0.023) and the Perceived Effective Decision Making subscale (p = 0.003) post consult compared with those receiving education only.Improvements in satisfaction with care, SDM, and knowledge were similar between groups.CONCLUSIONS: Individual-level preference assessment is feasible in the clinic setting.Patients with prostate cancer who undergo preference assessment are more certain about their treatment decisions and report decreased levels of decisional conflict when making these decisions.",0,0,0,0
31200828,"Selumetinib in patients receiving standard pemetrexed and platinum-based chemotherapy for advanced or metastatic KRAS wildtype or unknown non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer: A randomized, multicenter, phase II study. Canadian Cancer Trials Group (CCTG) IND.219.INTRODUCTION: Activation of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway may confer resistance to chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Selumetinib (AZD6244, ARRY142886), a MEK1/2 inhibitor combined with chemotherapy in patients with NSCLC was evaluated in two schedules to evaluate efficacy and toxicity.METHODS: IND.219 was a three-arm study of first line pemetrexed/platinum chemotherapy with two schedules of selumetinib (Arm A: intermittent given on days 2-19; Arm B: continuous given on days 1-21) versus chemotherapy alone (Arm C).The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR); secondary objectives were tolerability, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS).The trial was stopped at the planned interim analysis.RESULTS: Arms A/B/C enrolled 20/21/21 patients, ORR was 35% (95% CI 15-59% median duration 3.8 months), 62% (95% CI 38-82%; median duration 6.3 months), 24% (95% CI 8-47%; median duration 11.6 months) respectively.The PFS (months Arm A, B, C) was 7.5, 6.7, 4.0 respectively (hazard ratio (HR) PFS Arm A over Arm C: 0.76 [95% CI, 0.38-1.51, 2-sided p = 0.42]; Arm B over Arm C 0.75 [95% CI 0.37-1.54, p = 0.43].Skin and gastrointestinal adverse events were more common with the addition of selumetinib.A high incidence of venous thromboembolism was seen in all arms.CONCLUSIONS: Selumetinib combined with chemotherapy was associated with a higher response rate.Continuous selumetinib appeared to be superior to an intermittent schedule.PFS was prolonged with the addition of selumetinib, however this was not statistically significant.",1,1,1,1
27045811,"Quality of Life in Women Undergoing Breast Irradiation in a Randomized, Controlled Clinical Trial Evaluating Different Tumor Bed Boost Fractionations.PURPOSE: To identify differences in breast cancer patient-reported quality of life (QOL) between 2 radiation tumor bed boost dose regimens.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Four hundred patients with stage 0, I, or II breast cancer who underwent segmental mastectomy with sentinel node biopsy and/or axillary node dissection were treated with either a daily or weekly boost.Patients were treated prone to 40.5 Gy/15 fractions to the whole breast, 5 days per week.Patients were randomized to a concomitant daily boost to the tumor bed of 0.5 Gy, or a weekly boost of 2 Gy on Friday.Patients completed 6 validated QOL survey instruments at baseline, last week of treatment (3 weeks), 45-60 days from the completion of radiation treatment, and at 2-year follow-up.RESULTS: There were no statistically significance differences in responses to the 6 QOL instruments between the daily and weekly radiation boost regimens, even after adjustment for important covariates.However, several changes in responses over time occurred in both arms, including worsening functional status, cosmetic status, and breast-specific pain at the end of treatment as compared with before and 45 to 60 days after the conclusion of treatment.CONCLUSIONS: Whole-breast, prone intensity modulated radiation has similar outcomes in QOL measures whether given with a daily or weekly boost.This trial has generated the foundation for a current study of weekly versus daily radiation boost in women with early breast cancer in which 3-dimensional conformal radiation is allowed as a prospective stratification factor.",0,0,0,0
23045542,"Patient navigation for breast and colorectal cancer treatment: a randomized trial.BACKGROUND: There is limited high-quality evidence about the impact of patient navigation (PN) on outcomes for patients with diagnosed cancer.METHODS: We pooled data from two sites from the national Patient Navigation Research Program.Patients (n = 438) with newly diagnosed breast (n = 353) or colorectal cancer (n = 85) were randomized to PN or usual care.Trained lay navigators met with patients randomized to PN to help them assess treatment barriers and identify resources to overcome barriers.We used intent-to-treat analysis to assess time to completion of primary treatment, psychologic distress (impact of events scale), and satisfaction (patient satisfaction with cancer-related care) within 3 months after initiation of cancer treatment.RESULTS: The sample was predominantly middle-aged (mean age = 57) and female (90%); 44% were race-ethnic minorities (44%), 46% reported lower education levels, 18% were uninsured, and 9% reported a non-English primary language.The randomized groups were comparable in baseline characteristics.Primary analysis showed no statistically significant group differences in time to completion of primary cancer treatment, satisfaction with cancer-related care, or psychologic distress.Subgroup analysis showed that socially disadvantaged patients (i.e., uninsured, low English proficiency, and non-English primary language) who received PN reported higher satisfaction than those receiving usual care (all P < 0.05).Navigated patients living alone reported greater distress than those receiving usual care.CONCLUSIONS: Although the primary analysis showed no overall benefit, the subgroup analysis suggests that PN may improve satisfaction with care for certain disadvantaged individuals.IMPACT: PN for cancer patients may not necessarily reduce treatment time nor distress.",0,0,0,0

Mean day 43 Cmin in Arm A was ~37% lower than that seen in metastatic breast cancer.The safety profiles were similar between arms and treatment was well tolerated.Partial responses were achieved by 86% and 55% of patients in Arms A and B, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the pharmacokinetic and safety data, the 840 mg q3w pertuzumab dose has been selected for a phase III study of pertuzumab, trastuzumab and chemotherapy in HER2-positive aGC.",1,1,1,1
30982687,"Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy versus standard of care palliative treatment in patients with oligometastatic cancers (SABR-COMET): a randomised, phase 2, open-label trial.BACKGROUND: The oligometastatic paradigm suggests that some patients with a limited number of metastases might be cured if all lesions are eradicated.Evidence from randomised controlled trials to support this paradigm is scarce.We aimed to assess the effect of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) on survival, oncological outcomes, toxicity, and quality of life in patients with a controlled primary tumour and one to five oligometastatic lesions.METHODS: This randomised, open-label phase 2 study was done at 10 hospitals in Canada, the Netherlands, Scotland, and Australia.Patients aged 18 or older with a controlled primary tumour and one to five metastatic lesions, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score of 0-1, and a life expectancy of at least 6 months were eligible.After stratifying by the number of metastases (1-3 vs 4-5), we randomly assigned patients (1:2) to receive either palliative standard of care treatments alone (control group), or standard of care plus SABR to all metastatic lesions (SABR group), using a computer-generated randomisation list with permuted blocks of nine.Neither patients nor physicians were masked to treatment allocation.The primary endpoint was overall survival.We used a randomised phase 2 screening design with a two-sided alpha of 0.20 (wherein p<0.20 designates a positive trial).All analyses were intention to treat.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01446744.FINDINGS: 99 patients were randomised between Feb 10, 2012, and Aug 30, 2016.Of 99 patients, 33 (33%) were assigned to the control group and 66 (67%) to the SABR group.Two (3%) patients in the SABR group did not receive allocated treatment and withdrew from the trial; two (6%) patients in the control group also withdrew from the trial.Median follow-up was 25 months (IQR 19-54) in the control group versus 26 months (23-37) in the SABR group.Median overall survival was 28 months (95% CI 19-33) in the control group versus 41 months (26-not reached) in the SABR group (hazard ratio 0.57, 95% CI 0.30-1.10; p=0.090).Adverse events of grade 2 or worse occurred in three (9%) of 33 controls and 19 (29%) of 66 patients in the SABR group (p=0.026), an absolute increase of 20% (95% CI 5-34).Treatment-related deaths occurred in three (4.5%) of 66 patients after SABR, compared with none in the control group.INTERPRETATION: SABR was associated with an improvement in overall survival, meeting the primary endpoint of this trial, but three (4.5%) of 66 patients in the SABR group had treatment-related death.Phase 3 trials are needed to conclusively show an overall survival benefit, and to determine the maximum number of metastatic lesions wherein SABR provides a benefit.FUNDING: Ontario Institute for Cancer Research and London Regional Cancer Program Catalyst Grant.",0,0,0,0
28444114,"Efficacy of everolimus plus octreotide LAR in patients with advanced neuroendocrine tumor and carcinoid syndrome: final overall survival from the randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 RADIANT-2 study.Background: In the phase 3 RADIANT-2 study, everolimus plus octreotide long-acting repeatable (LAR) showed improvement of 5.1 months in median progression-free survival versus placebo plus octreotide LAR among patients with advanced neuroendocrine tumors associated with carcinoid syndrome.The progression-free survival P-value was marginally above the prespecified threshold for statistical significance.Here, we report final overall survival (OS) and key safety update from RADIANT-2.Patients and methods: The RADIANT-2 trial compared everolimus (10 mg/day, orally; n = 216) versus placebo (n = 213), both in conjunction with octreotide LAR (30 mg, intramuscularly, every 28 days).Patients, unblinded at the time of progression or after end of double-blind core phase following primary analysis, were offered open-label everolimus with octreotide LAR (open-label phase).In the open-label phase, patients had similar safety and efficacy assessments as those in the core phase.For OS, hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs using unadjusted Cox model and a Cox model adjusted for prespecified baseline covariates were calculated.Results: A total of 170 patients received open-label everolimus (143 crossed over from the placebo arm; 27 in the everolimus arm continued to receive the same treatment after unblinding).The median OS (95% CI) after 271 events was 29.2 months (23.8-35.9) for the everolimus arm and 35.2 months (30.0-44.7) for the placebo arm (HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.92-1.49).HR adjusted for baseline covariates was 1.08 (95% CI, 0.84-1.38).The most frequent drug-related grade 3 or 4 AEs reported during the open-label phase were diarrhea (5.3%), fatigue (4.7%), and stomatitis (4.1%).Deaths related to pulmonary or cardiac failure were observed more frequently in the everolimus arm.Conclusion: No significant difference in OS was observed for the everolimus plus octreotide LAR and placebo plus octreotide LAR arms of the RADIANT-2 study, even after adjusting for imbalances in the baseline covariates.Clinical Trial Number: NCT00412061, www.clinicaltrials.gov.",1,1,1,0

29070044,"Neoadjuvant everolimus plus letrozole versus fluorouracil, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide for ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer: study protocol for a randomized pilot trial.BACKGROUND: The response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) varies by estrogen receptor (ER) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) statuses, with responses being lower in ER-positive, HER2-negative tumors as compared with ER-negative, HER2-positive or triple-negative tumors.Neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (NET) is an attractive alternative to NAC for ER-positive, HER2-negative cancer.However, a prior trial comparing NET with standard NAC in ER-positive tumor showed that the difference of response was not significant.Studies demonstrated that the mTOR inhibitor everolimus could sensitize breast tumors to endocrine therapy.A pilot open-label, randomized trial has been designed to evaluate the feasibility, efficacy and tolerability of neoadjuvant everolimus plus letrozole versus NAC in treating postmenopausal women with ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer.METHODS: Forty postmenopausal women with non-metastatic ER-positive, HER2-negative invasive breast cancer with a primary tumor > 2 cm or positive axillary lymph node(s) proved by biopsy will be randomly (1:1) enrolled from Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital to receive neoadjuvant everolimus plus letrozole for 18 weeks or fluorouracil, epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide (FEC) for six cycles before surgery.Primary outcome is the feasibility of the trial.Secondary outcome measures include ultrasound response rate, pathological complete response rate, breast-conserving surgery rate, toxicities, and changes in the percentages of peripheral blood CD4(+) T cells, CD8(+) T cells, T helper cells, regulatory T cells, and NK cells.DISCUSSION: This is the first study to determine the feasibility, efficacy and tolerability of head-to-head neoadjuvant everolimus plus letrozole versus neoadjuvant FEC in treating postmenopausal women with ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer.The trial will provide evidence to assess the feasibility of a future multicenter, randomized controlled trial, and will provide valuable clinical data of the immunoregulatory effect of everolimus in breast cancer.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov registry, ID: NCT02742051 .Registered on 7 April 2016.",1,1,1,1
26585118,"Aspirin Reduces Plasma Concentrations of the Oncometabolite 2-Hydroxyglutarate: Results of a Randomized, Double-Blind, Crossover Trial.BACKGROUND: Aspirin use is an effective strategy for the chemoprevention of colorectal cancer, even at low doses.However, in order to implement aspirin interventions, risk-benefit balances and biologic mechanisms need to be better defined; to further this aim, we used a metabolomics approach.METHODS: We metabolically profiled 40 healthy, nonsmoking men and women ages 20 to 45 years enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, crossover trial of 325 mg aspirin/day over a period of 60 days.Gas and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry were used to comprehensively profile participants' plasma samples after aspirin and placebo interventions.RESULTS: A total of 363 metabolites, covering most human biochemical pathways, were measured.Compared with placebo-treated participants, plasma concentrations of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (R+S) decreased after aspirin treatment in both men and women (P = 0.005).This signal proved robust during 20-fold random splitting of the data using 80% of the samples in each split.We subsequently performed functional follow-up studies using targeted, enantiospecific detection in human colorectal cancer cell lines and observed an aspirin-induced reduction of (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate.We further showed that salicylate, the primary aspirin metabolite, inhibits the hydroxyacid-oxoacid transhydrogenase mediated production of (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate, thereby providing mechanistic evidence for the clinically observed effects of aspirin on total-2-hydroxyglutarate.CONCLUSIONS: Using a metabolomics approach with functional follow-up, we propose that a decrease in the oncometabolite (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate may identify an additional mechanism for aspirin or its metabolites in cancer prevention.IMPACT: Reduction of the oncometabolite (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate identifies a novel, non-COX-inhibition-mediated mechanism of aspirin.",0,0,0,0
29445928,"Efficacy and safety of trastuzumab, lapatinib, and paclitaxel neoadjuvant treatment with or without prolonged exposure to anti-HER2 therapy, and with or without hormone therapy for HER2-positive primary breast cancer: a randomised, five-arm, multicentre, open-label phase II trial.BACKGROUND: Dual blockade of HER2 promises increased pathological complete response (pCR) rate compared with single blockade in the presence of chemotherapy for HER2-positive (+) primary breast cancer.Many questions remain regarding optimal duration of treatment and combination impact of endocrine therapy for luminal HER2 disease.METHODS: We designed a randomised phase II, five-arm study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lapatinib and trastuzumab (6 weeks) followed by lapatinib and trastuzumab plus weekly paclitaxel (12 weeks) with/without prolongation of anti-HER2 therapy prior to chemotherapy (18 vs. 6 weeks), and with/without endocrine therapy in patients with HER2+ and/or oestrogen receptor (ER)+ disease.The primary endpoint was comprehensive pCR (CpCR) rate.Among the secondary endpoints, pCR (yT0-isyN0) rate, safety, and clinical response were evaluated.RESULTS: In total, 215 patients were enrolled; 212 were included in the full analysis set (median age 53.0 years; tumour size = T2, 65%; and tumour spread = N0, 55%).CpCR was achieved in 101 (47.9%) patients and was significantly higher in ER- patients than in ER+ patients (ER- 63.0%, ER+ 36.1%; P = 0.0034).pCR with pN0 was achieved in 42.2% of patients (ER- 57.6%, ER+ 30.3%).No significant difference was observed in pCR rate between prolonged exposure groups and standard groups.Better clinical response outcomes were obtained in the prolongation phase of the anti-HER2 therapy.No surplus was detected in pCR rate by adding endocrine treatment.No major safety concern was recognised by prolonging the anti-HER2 treatment or adding endocrine therapy.CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed the therapeutic impact of lapatinib, trastuzumab, and paclitaxel therapy for each ER- and ER+ subgroup of HER2+ patients.Development of further strategies and tools is required, particularly for luminal HER2 disease.",1,1,1,1
25556937,"Opportunistic testing versus organized prostate-specific antigen screening: outcome after 18 years in the Goteborg randomized population-based prostate cancer screening trial.BACKGROUND: It has been shown that organized screening decreases prostate cancer (PC) mortality, but the effect of opportunistic screening is largely unknown.OBJECTIVE: To compare the ability to reduce PC mortality and the risk of overdiagnosis between organized and opportunistic screening.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Goteborg screening study invited 10 000 randomly selected men for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing every 2 yr since 1995, with a prostate biopsy recommended for men with PSA >/=2.5 ng/ml.The control group of 10 000 men not invited has been exposed to a previously reported increased rate of opportunistic PSA testing.Both groups were followed until December 31, 2012.OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Observed cumulative PC incidence and mortality rates in both groups were calculated using the actuarial method.Using historical data from 1990-1994 (pre-PSA era), we calculated expected PC incidence and mortality rates in the absence of any PSA testing.The number needed to invite (NNI) and the number needed to diagnose (NND) were calculated by comparing the expected versus observed incidence and mortality rates.RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: At 18 yr, 1396 men were diagnosed with PC and 79 men died of PC in the screening group, compared to 962 and 122, respectively, in the control group.In the screening group, the observed cumulative PC incidence/mortality was 16%/0.98% compared to expected values of 6.8%/1.7%.The corresponding values for the control group were 11%/1.5% and 6.9%/1.7%.Organized screening was associated with an absolute PC-specific mortality reduction of 0.72% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.50-0.94%) and relative risk reduction of 42% (95% CI 28-54%).There was an absolute reduction in PC deaths of 0.20% (95% CI -0.06% to 0.47%) and a relative risk reduction of 12% (95% CI -5 to 26%) associated with opportunistic PSA testing.NNI and NND were 139 (95% CI 107-200) and 13 for organized biennial screening and 493 (95% CI 213- -1563) and 23 for opportunistic screening.The extent of opportunistic screening could not be measured; incidence trends were used as a proxy.CONCLUSIONS: Organized screening reduces PC mortality but is associated with overdiagnosis.Opportunistic PSA testing had little if any effect on PC mortality and resulted in more overdiagnosis, with almost twice the number of men needed to be diagnosed to save one man from dying from PC compared to men offered an organized biennial screening program.PATIENT SUMMARY: Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening within the framework of an organized program seems more effective than unorganized screening.",0,0,0,0
22156610,"Randomized clinical trial of endobronchial ultrasound needle biopsy with and without aspiration.BACKGROUND: Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) is performed with a dedicated 22- or 21-gauge needle while suction is applied.Fine-needle sampling without suction (capillary sampling) has been studied for endoscopic ultrasound and for biopsies at various body sites and has resulted in similar diagnostic yield and fewer traumatic samples.However, the role of EBUS-guided transbronchial needle capillary sampling (EBUS-TBNCS) is still to be determined.METHODS: Adults with suspicious hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes (LNs) were included in a single-blinded, prospective, randomized trial comparing EBUS-TBNA and EBUS-TBNCS.The primary end point was the concordance rate between the two techniques in terms of adequacy and diagnosis of cytologic samples.The secondary end point was the concordance rate between the two techniques in terms of quality of samples.RESULTS: A total of 115 patients and 192 LNs were studied.Concordance between EBUS-TBNA and EBUS-TBNCS was high, with no significant difference in adequacy (88% vs 88%, respectively [P +/- .858]; concordance rate, 83.9% [95% CI, 77.9-88.8]); diagnosis (36% vs 34%, respectively [P +/- .289]; concordance rate, 95.8% [95% CI, 92-92.8]); diagnosis of malignancy (28% vs 26%, respectively [P +/- .125]; concordance rate, 97.9% [95% CI, 94.8-99.4]); or sample quality (concordance rate, 83.3% [95% CI, 73.3-88.3]).Concordance between EBUS-TBNA and EBUS-TBNCS was high irrespective of LN size (</= 1 cm vs > 1 cm).CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of LN size, no differences in adequacy, diagnosis, or quality were found between samples obtained using EBUS-TBNA and those obtained using EBUS-TBNCS.There is no evidence of any benefit derived from the practice of applying suction to EBUS-guided biopsies.TRIAL REGISTRY: ClinicalTrials.gov; No.: NCT00886847; URL: www.clinicaltrials.gov",0,0,0,0
27498129,"Toxicity of dual HER2-blockade with pertuzumab added to anthracycline versus non-anthracycline containing chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment in HER2-positive breast cancer: The TRAIN-2 study.BACKGROUND: The addition of pertuzumab to neoadjuvant trastuzumab-based chemotherapy improves pathologic complete response rates in HER2-positive breast cancer.However, increased toxicity has been reported with the addition of pertuzumab, and this may differ between various chemotherapy backbone regimens.We evaluated toxicities of pertuzumab when added to either FEC-T (5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide, trastuzumab) or weekly paclitaxel, trastuzumab, carboplatin (PTC).METHODS: The TRAIN-2 study is a neoadjuvant randomized controlled trial in stage II and III HER2-positive breast cancer (NCT01996267).Patients are randomly assigned to receive either three cycles of FEC-T plus pertuzumab or three cycles of PTC plus pertuzumab, followed by six cycles of PTC plus pertuzumab in both arms.Toxicities are described per treatment arm according to the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03.RESULTS: This analysis includes 110 patients balanced over both treatment arms.Neutropenia was the most common hematologic toxicity, with grade 3-4 occurring in 53% in the FEC-T-arm and in 51% in the PTC-arm.Febrile neutropenia occurred in 9% in the FEC-T arm and did not occur in the PTC-arm.Secondary G-CSF prophylaxis was used in 35-40% of patients.Asymptomatic ejection fraction decrease grade 2 was observed in 24% in the FEC-T-arm and 11% in the PTC-arm.The most common grade 3-4 non-hematologic toxicity was diarrhea (5% in the FEC-T-arm and 18% in the PTC-arm).CONCLUSIONS: Pertuzumab in combination with FEC-T mostly causes neutropenia, and when added to PTC mostly causes diarrhea.Significant cardiac toxicity is rare with both regimens, and toxicity is overall well manageable.",1,1,1,1
27743738,"Impact of histology and surgical approach on survival among women with early-stage, high-grade uterine cancer: An NRG Oncology/Gynecologic Oncology Group ancillary analysis.OBJECTIVES: We sought to analyze the clinicopathologic features, recurrence patterns and survival outcomes of women with high-grade uterine cancer (UC) enrolled on The Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) LAP2 trial.METHODS: This is a post-hoc analysis of LAP-2 patients with grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma (ENDO), uterine serous (USC), clear cell (CC) and carcinosarcoma (CS).Demographics, clinicopathologic features, and recurrence patterns, were compared by histology and surgical approach.Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.RESULTS: Of the 2600 patients enrolled in LAP-2, 753 patients had high-grade UC: 350 had ENDO, 289 had USC, 42 had CC and 72 had CS.Compared with the ENDO cohort, those with other high-grade subtypes were older (p<0.001) and were more likely to have positive peritoneal cytology (p<0.001), positive lymph nodes (p=0.05) and higher disease stage on final pathology (p<0.001).With a median follow-up time of 60months, compared to patients with ENDO, those with USC, CCC and CS subtypes had higher recurrence rates (p<0.001), extra-pelvic recurrences (p<0.001) and poorer PFS (p<0.001) and OS (p<0.001).Those diagnosed with USC and CS experienced the worst survival outcomes (p=0.003).Patterns of recurrence and survival were not different in those staged with LSC vs LAP.On multivariable analysis, age, stage, pelvic washings and Type II histology were independently and adversely associated with survival.CONCLUSIONS: Women with apparent early-stage, USC and CS histologies have poorer outcomes than women with grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma.Patterns of recurrence and survival were not impacted by surgical approach.",0,0,0,0
28743247,"A randomized phase II study of paclitaxel alone versus paclitaxel plus sorafenib in second- and third-line treatment of patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer (PASO).BACKGROUND: We conducted an open-label, randomized, two-arm multi-center study to assess the efficacy and safety of paclitaxel versus paclitaxel + sorafenib in patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer.METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive either paclitaxel monotherapy (80 mg/m(2)) weekly (3 weeks on, 1 week off) plus sorafenib 400 mg orally, twice a day taken continuously throughout 28 day cycles.Sorafenib dose was gradually escalated from a starting dose of 200 mg twice a day.The primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS).RESULTS: A pre-planned efficacy interim analysis was performed on the data of 60 patients, 30 patients in each treatment arm.Median PFS was estimated at 6.6 months (95% CI: 5.1 to 9.0) in patients randomized to single-agent paclitaxel (Arm A) and 5.6 months (95% CI: 3.8 to 6.5) in patients randomized to paclitaxel-sorafenib combination (Arm B) therapy.Contrary to the hypothesis, the treatment effect was statistically significant in favor of paclitaxel monotherapy (hazard ratio 1.80, 95% CI: 1.02 to 3.20; log-rank test P = 0.0409).It was decided to stop the trial early for futility.Median OS was also in favor of Arm A (20.7 months (95% CI: 16.4 to 26.7) versus 12.1 months (95% CI: 5.8 to 20.4) in Arm B. Clinical control was achieved in 28 patients (93.3%) in Arm A and in 21 patients 70.0% in Arm B. Overall response rate was met in 43.3% of patients in Arm A and in 40.0% in Arm B. Toxicities were increased in Arm B with higher rates of diarrhea, nausea, neutropenia, hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) and anorexia, Grad 3 and 4 toxicities were rare.CONCLUSIONS: In this pre-planned interim analysis, paclitaxel-sorafenib combination therapy was not found to be superior to paclitaxel monotherapy with regard to the primary end point, progression-free survival.The trial was therefore discontinued early.There was no indication of more favorable outcomes for combination therapy in secondary efficacy end points.As expected, the safety and toxicity profile of the combination therapy was less favorable compared to monotherapy.Overall, this trial did not demonstrate that adding sorafenib to second- or third-line paclitaxel provides any clinical benefit to patients with HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer.Cautious dosing using a sorafenib ramp up schedule might have contributed to negative results.TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered at EudraCT (No 2009-018025-73) and retrospectively registered at Clinical trials.gov on March 17, 2011 ( NCT01320111 ).",1,1,1,1

23850170,"Which patients benefit most from primary surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy in stage IIIC or IV ovarian cancer? An exploratory analysis of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer 55971 randomised trial.BACKGROUND: To investigate whether biomarkers consisting of baseline characteristics of advanced stage ovarian cancer patients can help in identifying subgroups of patients who would benefit more from primary surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy.METHODS: We used data of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 55971 trial in which 670 patients were randomly assigned to primary surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy.The primary outcome was overall survival.Ten baseline clinical and pathological characteristics were selected as potential biomarkers.Using Subpopulation Treatment Effect Pattern Plots (STEPP), biomarkers with a statistically significant qualitative additive interaction with treatment were considered as potentially informative for treatment selection.We also combined selected biomarkers to form a multimarker treatment selection rule.FINDINGS: The size of the largest metastatic tumour and clinical stage were significantly associated with the magnitude of the benefit from treatment, in terms of five-year survival (p for interaction: 0.008 and 0.016, respectively).Stage IIIC patients with metastatic tumours 45 mm benefited more from primary surgery while stage IV patients with metastatic tumours >45 mm benefited more from neoadjuvant chemotherapy.In stage IIIC patients with larger metastatic tumours and in stage IV patients with less extensive metastatic tumours both treatments were equally effective.We estimated that by selecting treatments for patients based on largest metastatic tumour and clinical stage, the potential five-year survival rate in the population of treated patients would be 27.3% (95% confidence interval (CI) 21.9-33.0), 7.8% higher than if all were treated with primary surgery, and 5.6% higher if all were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.INTERPRETATION: Although survival was comparable after primary surgery and neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the overall group of patients with ovarian cancer in the EORTC 55971 trial, we found in this exploratory analysis that patients with stage IIIC and less extensive metastatic tumours had higher survival with primary surgery, while patients with stage IV disease and large metastatic tumours had higher survival with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.For patients who did not meet these criteria, both treatment options led to comparable survival rates.",1,1,1,1
22257825,"Whole-brain irradiation with concomitant daily fixed-dose temozolomide for brain metastases treatment: a randomised phase II trial.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This randomised phase II study evaluated the use of Temozolomide (TMZ) concomitant with 30 Gray (Gy) of Whole-brain irradiation (WBI) for 2 weeks without adjuvant TMZ vs. WBI alone in patients with Brain metastases (BM) from solid tumours.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-five patients were randomised into the following groups: 28 patients received WBI (30 Gy in 10 fractions over 2 weeks) concomitant with once-daily 200 mg TMZ on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and 300 mg TMZ on Tuesdays and Thursdays (TMZ plus WBI arm).Twenty-seven patients received the same schedule of WBI alone (control arm).RESULTS: The objective response (OR) was 78.6% for the TMZ plus WBI arm, (95% confidence interval [CI], 63.4-93.8%) and 48.1% (29.3-66.9%) for the control arm (p=0.019).Median Progression-free survival (PFS) of BM was 11.8 months (CI, 4.7-8.9 months) and 5.6 months (4.9-6.2 months) for the TMZ plus WBI and control arms, respectively, (Hazard ratio [HR], 0.24; CI, 0.09-0.65; p=0.005).Overall survival (OS) of 8.0 Months for the TMZ plus WBI arm and 8.1 months for the control arm, were not significantly different.CONCLUSION: A daily fixed dose of TMZ during WBI without adjuvant TMZ was well tolerated and significantly improved local control of BM compared with WBI alone.These findings require confirmation in a phase III trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01015534).",1,1,1,0
26878247,"Dual-focus versus conventional magnification endoscopy for the diagnosis of superficial squamous neoplasms in the pharynx and esophagus: a randomized trial.BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Conventional magnification narrow-band imaging (CM-NBI) endoscopy has demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy for superficial squamous neoplasms in the pharynx and esophagus.This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic utility of the newly developed dual-focus NBI (DF-NBI) compared with that of CM-NBI.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We recruited patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in the head and neck, or esophagus, or with a history of SCC.The primary endpoint of this prospective controlled non-inferiority trial was the sensitivity of DF-NBI and CM-NBI for detecting superficial carcinoma in the pharynx and esophagus.Secondary endpoints included other diagnostic values and the resolving power of each endoscope.Superficial carcinoma was defined as high grade dysplasia and SCC invading up to the submucosal layer.RESULTS: The study included 93 patients.A total of 28 superficial carcinomas were detected in the pharynx and esophagus.The sensitivities of DF-NBI and CM-NBI for superficial carcinoma were 82 % and 71 %, respectively.The lower limit of the 90 % confidence interval for the difference between the sensitivities exceeded the non-inferiority threshold.The specificity and overall accuracy of DF-NBI vs. CM-NBI were 93 % vs. 90 % and 91 % vs. 86 %, respectively (both non-significant differences).The maximum resolving power of a conventional magnification endoscope was significantly higher than a dual-focus endoscope (7.2 microm vs. 11.6 microm: P < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate the non-inferiority of DF-NBI versus CM-NBI in detecting superficial carcinoma in the pharynx and esophagus.DF-NBI appears to have a resolving power that, although significantly lower, is sufficient to achieve high diagnostic accuracy, comparable to that of CM-NBI.University Hospital Medical Information Network (UMIN, No. 000007585).",0,0,0,0
28678383,"The role of early magnetic resonance imaging in predicting survival on bevacizumab for recurrent glioblastoma: Results from a prospective clinical trial (CABARET).BACKGROUND: Bevacizumab has been associated with prolonged progression-free survival for patients with recurrent glioblastoma; however, not all derive a benefit.An early indicator of efficacy or futility may allow early discontinuation for nonresponders.This study prospectively assessed the role of early magnetic resonance imaging (eMRI) and its correlation with subsequent routine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results and survival.METHODS: Patients were part of a randomized phase 2 clinical trial (CABARET) comparing bevacizumab with bevacizumab plus carboplatin for recurrent glioblastoma.eMRI was conducted after 4 weeks in the trial (after 2 treatments with bevacizumab [10 mg/kg every 2 weeks]).The results were compared with the results of the subsequent 8-week MRI standard.RESULTS: For 119 of 122 patients, eMRI was available, and 111 had subsequent MRI for comparison.Thirty-six (30%) had an early radiological response, and 17 (14%) had progressive disease.The concordance between eMRI and 8-week MRI was moderate (kappa = 0.56), with most providing the same result (n = 79 [71%]).There was strong evidence that progression-free survival and overall survival were predicted by the eMRI response (both P values < .001).The median survival was 8.6 months for an eMRI response, 6.6 months for stable disease, and 3.7 months for progressive disease; the hazard ratio (progressive disease vs stable disease) was 3.4 (95% confidence interval, 1.9-6.0).Landmark analyses showed that eMRI progression was a strong predictor of mortality independent of other potential baseline predictors.CONCLUSIONS: In this study, early progression on MRI appears to be a robust marker of a poor prognosis for patients on bevacizumab.Cancer 2017;123:3576-82.

28701030,"Crizotinib versus Chemotherapy in Asian Patients with ALK-Positive Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.PURPOSE: Crizotinib has demonstrated superior progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rates (ORRs) versus chemotherapy in previously treated and untreated patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).We report the safety and efficacy of crizotinib in Asian subpopulations of two global phase III trials.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This analysis evaluated previously treated and untreated patients in two randomized, openlabel phase III trials of crizotinib versus chemotherapy in ALK-positive advanced NSCLC in second-line (PROFILE 1007) and first-line settings (PROFILE 1014).Efficacy and safety were analyzed by race in the intention-to-treat and ""as-treated"" populations for efficacy and safety endpoints, respectively.RESULTS: In previously treated (n=157) and untreated (n=157) Asian patients, PFS was statistically significantly longer with crizotinib versus chemotherapy (hazard ratio for PFS, 0.526; 95% confidence interval, 0.363 to 0.762; p &lt; 0.001 and hazard ratio, 0.442; 95% confidence interval, 0.302 to 0.648; p &lt; 0.001, respectively).Similar antitumor activity was seen in the non-Asian and overall populations.ORRs were statistically significantly higher with crizotinib versus chemotherapy in both Asian and non-Asian previously treated and untreated patients (p &lt; 0.05).The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (any grade)with crizotinib were vision disorder, diarrhea, and nausea, which were observed at a comparable incidence across Asian and non-Asian populations, irrespective of previous treatment status.Most adverse events were mild to moderate in severity.CONCLUSION: These data, currently the only analysis showing Asian and non-Asian populations in the same study, support the efficacy and safety of crizotinib in Asian patients with previously treated or untreated ALK-positive advanced NSCLC.",1,1,1,1
25057173,"EGFR biomarkers predict benefit from vandetanib in combination with docetaxel in a randomized phase III study of second-line treatment of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.BACKGROUND: ZODIAC was a randomized phase III study of second-line treatment in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that evaluated the addition of vandetanib to docetaxel.The study showed a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival and objective response rate, but not in overall survival for unselected patients.This study evaluated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutation, copy number gain, and protein expression, and KRAS gene mutation, in pretreatment tumor samples as potential biomarkers predicting benefit from vandetanib as second-line treatment of NSCLC.PATIENTS AND METHODS: After progression following first-line chemotherapy, 1391 patients with locally advanced or metastatic (stage IIIB/IV) NSCLC were randomized 1 : 1 to receive vandetanib (100 mg/day) plus docetaxel (75 mg/m(2) every 21 days) or placebo plus docetaxel in the ZODIAC study.Archival tumor samples (n = 570) were collected from consenting patients (n = 958) for predefined, prospective biomarker analyses.RESULTS: Of evaluable samples, 14% were EGFR mutation positive, 35% were EGFR FISH positive, 88% were EGFR protein expression positive, and 13% were KRAS mutation positive.Compared with the overall study population, in which progression-free survival (PFS) [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.79] but not OS (HR = 0.91) were significantly improved with vandetanib, there was greater relative clinical benefit for patients with EGFR mutation-positive tumors [PFS HR 0.51, confidence interval (CI) 0.25-1.06 and OS HR 0.46, CI 0.14-1.57] and EGFR FISH-positive tumors (PFS HR 0.61, CI 0.39-0.94 and OS HR 0.48, CI 0.28-0.84).Similarly, patients with EGFR mutation or FISH-positive tumor samples who received vandetanib had an increased chance of objective tumor response (odds ratios 3.34, CI 0.8-13.89, and 3.90, CI 1.02-14.82, respectively).There did not appear to be benefit for vandetanib in patients with KRAS mutation-positive tumors.CONCLUSIONS: High EGFR gene copy number or activating EGFR mutations may identify patient subgroups who receive increased clinical benefit from vandetanib in combination with docetaxel in second-line NSCLC.CLINICALTRIALSGOV: NCT00312377.",1,1,1,1
24827123,"ABVD (8 cycles) versus BEACOPP (4 escalated cycles >/= 4 baseline): final results in stage III-IV low-risk Hodgkin lymphoma (IPS 0-2) of the LYSA H34 randomized trial.BACKGROUND: Treatment with escalated BEACOPP achieved a superior time to treatment failure over ABVD in patients with disseminated Hodgkin lymphoma.However, recent clinical trials have failed to confirm BEACOPP overall survival (OS) superiority over ABVD.In addition, the gain in low-risk patients is still a matter of debate.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We randomly compared ABVD (8 cycles) with BEACOPP (escalated 4 cycles >/= baseline 4 cycles) in low-risk patients with an International Prognostic Score (IPS) of 0-2.The primary end point was event-free survival (EFS).This parallel group, open-label phase 3 trial was registered under #RECF0219 at French National Cancer Institute.RESULTS: One hundred and fifty patients were randomized in this trial (ABVD 80, BEACOPP 70): 28 years was the median age, 50% were male and IPS was 0-1 for 64%.Complete remission rate was 85% for ABVD and 90% for BEACOPP.Progression or relapses were more frequent in the ABVD patients than in the BEACOPP patients (17 versus 5 patients).With a median follow-up period of 5.5 years, seven patients died: six in the ABVD arm and one in the BEACOPP arm (HL 3 and 0, 2nd cancer 2 and 1, accident 1 and 0).The EFS at 5 years was estimated at 62% for ABVD versus 77%, for BEACOPP [hazards ratio (HR) = 0.6, P = 0.07].The progression-free survival (PFS) at 5 years was 75% versus 93% (HR = 0.3, P = 0.007).The OS at 5 years was 92% versus 99% (HR = 0.18, P = 0.06).CONCLUSION: Fewer progressions/relapses were observed with BEACOPP, demonstrating the high efficacy of the more intensive regimen, even in low-risk patients.However, additional considerations, balancing treatment-related toxicity and late morbidity due to salvage may help with decision-making with regard to treatment with ABVD or BEACOPP.",0,0,0,0
28188670,"A randomized phase II trial of personalized peptide vaccine with low dose cyclophosphamide in biliary tract cancer.Since the prognosis of advanced biliary tract cancer (aBTC) still remains very poor, new therapeutic approaches, including immunotherapies, need to be developed.In the current study, we conducted an open-label randomized phase II study to test whether low dose cyclophosphamide (CPA) could improve antigen-specific immune responses and clinical efficacy of personalized peptide vaccination (PPV) in 49 previously treated aBTC patients.Patients with aBTC refractory to at least one regimen of chemotherapies were randomly assigned to receive PPV with low dose CPA (100 mg/day for 7 days before vaccination) (PPV/CPA, n = 24) or PPV alone (n = 25).A maximum of four HLA-matched peptides were selected based on the pre-existing peptide-specific IgG responses, followed by subcutaneous administration.T cell responses to the vaccinated peptides in the PPV/CPA arm tended to be greater than those in the PPV alone arm.The PPV/CPA arm showed significantly better progression-free survival (median time: 6.1 vs 2.9 months; hazard ratio (HR): 0.427; P = 0.008) and overall survival (median time: 12.1 vs 5.9 months; HR: 0.376; P = 0.004), compared to the PPV alone arm.The PPV alone arm, but not the PPV/CPA arm, showed significant increase in plasma IL-6 after vaccinations, which might be associated with inhibition of antigen-specific T cell responses.These results suggested that combined treatment with low dose CPA could provide clinical benefits in aBTC patients under PPV, possibly through prevention of IL-6-mediated immune suppression.Further clinical studies would be recommended to clarify the clinical efficacy of PPV/CPA in aBTC patients.",1,1,1,1

24503408,"In vivo intraocular distribution and safety of periocular nanoparticle carboplatin for treatment of advanced retinoblastoma in humans.PURPOSE: To study the intraocular distribution and safety of polymethylmethacrylate nanoparticles loaded with carboplatin after posterior subtenon injection in humans.DESIGN: Prospective, interventional, comparative case series.METHODS: Six patients (mean age: 26.83 +/- 7.5 years), scheduled to undergo planned uniocular enucleation in an institutional setting, were randomly divided into 3 groups.Each group received a 10 mg/mL posterior subtenon injection of nanoparticle carboplatin in the eye to be enucleated.Two eyes were enucleated 6, 24 and 72 hours post injection.Intravenous blood was collected during enucleation.The concentration of carboplatin reaching various intraocular tissues was determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy.The drug toxicity in the ocular tissues was assessed by histopathology and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy.RESULTS: The highest level of carboplatin was detected in retinas (8.33 +/- 1.69 mg/g), up to 24 hours post treatment.The intravitreal concentration continued to increase gradually until 72 hours (3.46 +/- 0.26 mg/g).The choroids and lenses showed very low levels of carboplatin after 6 hours, with negligible amounts at 72 hours.No signs of tissue damage were observed on histopathology or electron microscopy.Intravenous concentration of carboplatin was undetectable in all patients.CONCLUSION: Results may indicate an increased facilitated trans-scleral transport of nanoparticle carboplatin, with a sustained-release behavior but without any associated short-term ocular or systemic side effects in humans.The very high concentrations achieved in vitreous and retina after a single posterior subtenon injection may be clinically useful for adjunctive treatment of advanced intraocular retinoblastoma with vitreous seeds.However, further studies are needed to assess long-term toxicity and clinical efficacy.",0,0,0,0
24953333,"First-line pemetrexed plus cisplatin followed by gefitinib maintenance therapy versus gefitinib monotherapy in East Asian patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer: a randomised, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: In the Iressa Pan-ASia Study (IPASS), gefitinib claimed improved progression-free survival (PFS) versus carboplatin-paclitaxel in clinically selected lung cancer patients.The primary objective of this study was to assess the PFS of pemetrexed-cisplatin (PC) followed by gefitinib maintenance versus gefitinib monotherapy in an IPASS-like population.METHODS: In this open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial, eligible patients were 18 years, chemonaive, East Asian, light ex-smokers/never-smokers with advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1 and unknown epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation status who enrolled at 12 sites in Asia.Patients randomly received (1:1) pemetrexed (500 mg/m(2)) plus cisplatin (75mg/m(2)) for six 21-day cycles, followed by gefitinib maintenance or gefitinib monotherapy (250 mg/day).Patient tissue was retrospectively analysed for EGFR mutations.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01017874.FINDINGS: Between 23rd November 2009 and 27th April 2012, 253 patients entered, and 236 patients were randomly assigned to and treated with PC therapy (N=114) and gefitinib monotherapy (N=118).Between-arm baseline characteristics were balanced.PFS was not significantly different between treatment arms (p=0.217).The unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) was 0.85 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63-1.13).The HR should be cautiously interpreted as it was not constant.EGFR mutation status was determined for 74 tissue samples; 50 (67.6%) had mutations.In a pre-specified subgroup analysis, only the treatment-by-EGFR mutation interaction was significant (p=0.008) for PFS.For the entire treatment period, a higher proportion of patients in the PC/gefitinib arm versus gefitinib experienced possibly drug-related grade 3-4 treatment-emergent adverse events (39 of 114 [34%] versus 19 of 118 [16%]; p=0.002).INTERPRETATION: In the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, PFS was not significantly different.In the biomarker-assessable population, front-line EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor monotherapy was not efficacious in patients with wild-type EGFR.Identification of EGFR mutation status is key in the management of advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer.FUNDING: Eli Lilly and Company.",1,1,1,1
28692586,"Bioactivity and prostate tissue distribution of metformin in a preprostatectomy prostate cancer cohort.Metformin has recently been shown to have potential to reduce prostate cancer risk.We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine the modulating effects of metformin on tissue and systemic biomarkers of drug activity and its distribution into the prostate tissue.Twenty patients with prostate cancer scheduled to undergo prostatectomy were randomly assigned to receive either extended-release metformin or placebo for a median of 34 days before surgery.Prostatectomy and serum samples were analyzed for metformin concentrations, serum biomarkers of drug activity (prostate-specific antigen, insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3, sex hormone-binding globulin, and testosterone) and tissue biomarkers of proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, and mTOR inhibition.For participants in the metformin arm, the prostate tissue and serum metformin concentrations ranged from 0.88 to 51.2 mug/g tissue and from not detectable to 3.6 mug/ml, respectively.There were no differences between the two groups in either the postintervention tissue biomarker expression in the prostatectomy tissue or pre to postintervention changes in serum biomarkers.We conclude that metformin distributes to human prostate tissue, suggesting that metformin could exert its effects directly on tissue targets.However, there was no difference in tissue and systemic drug effect biomarkers between the two treatment arms.Future studies with longer intervention duration and larger sample size should be considered in order to evaluate the potential of metformin for prostate cancer prevention.",1,1,1,1

31573911,"Tailored Web-Based Information for Younger and Older Patients with Cancer: Randomized Controlled Trial of a Preparatory Educational Intervention on Patient Outcomes.BACKGROUND: Many patients with cancer, including older patients (aged >/=65 years), consult the Web to prepare for their doctor's visit.In particular, older patients have varying needs regarding the mode in which information is presented (eg, via textual, visual, or audiovisual modes) owing to age-related sensory (eg, impaired vision and hearing) and cognitive decline (eg, reduced processing speed).Therefore, Web-based information targeted at older patient populations is likely to be used and processed more effectively, and evaluated more positively, when tailored to age-related capabilities and preferences.This, in turn, may benefit patient outcomes.OBJECTIVE: This randomized controlled trial tested the effects of a Web-based tailored educational intervention among newly diagnosed younger (<65 years) and older (>/=65 years) patients with cancer.We compared the intervention group who viewed a mode-tailored website (ie, enabling patients to tailor information using textual, visual, and audiovisual modes) with 3 control groups view a nontailored website (ie, text only, text with images, and text with videos).We examined website experience outcomes (ie, website satisfaction, website involvement, knowledge, anxiety, and communication self-efficacy) and consultation experience outcomes (ie, question asking during consultation, anxiety, and information recall).METHODS: Patients from a multidisciplinary outpatient clinic (N=232) viewed a mode-tailored or nontailored website as preparation before their hospital consultations to discuss diagnosis and treatment.Data were collected before (T1), during (T2), and after (T3) visitation.Website experience outcomes were assessed with questionnaires (T1).Patients' question asking was coded from videotaped consultations, and anxiety was assessed through a questionnaire (T2).Telephone interviews were conducted to assess knowledge acquired from the website before (T1) and after consultation (T3), and information recall from the consultation (T3).RESULTS: The preparatory website was well used across all conditions (mean 34 min).Younger patients viewing the mode-tailored website were more satisfied before consultation (P=.02) and reported lower anxiety after consultation (P=.046; vs text only).This pattern was not found in older patients.Mode tailoring yielded no other significant differences in patient outcomes.Regression analyses showed that website involvement (beta=.15; P=.03) and, to a lesser extent, website satisfaction (beta=.15; P=.05) positively associated with knowledge before consultation (T1).In turn, higher knowledge before consultation (beta=.39; P<.001), together with time on the website (beta=.21; P=.002; T1), predicted information recall from consultations (T3).Patients with higher knowledge before consultation (T1) also reported higher knowledge from the website afterward (T3; beta=.22; P=.003).CONCLUSIONS: Offering preparatory online information before consultations benefits information processing and patient outcomes of both younger and older newly diagnosed patients with cancer.Younger patients benefit even more when information is offered in a mode-tailored manner.We discuss the theoretical, methodological, and practical implications for patient-provider communication research in an electronic health era.CLINICAL TRIAL: Netherlands Trial Register NTR5904; https://www.trialregister.nl/trial/5750.",1,1,0,0
31513453,"The NEOLETEXE trial: a neoadjuvant cross-over study exploring the lack of cross resistance between aromatase inhibitors.The aromatase inhibitor letrozole (Femar((R))/Femara((R))) and the aromatase inactivator exemestane (Aromasin((R))) differ in their biochemical effect on the aromatase enzyme.Letrozole is a competitive aromatase inhibitor while exemestane binds irreversibly to the aromatase enzyme.This pharmacological difference is of clinical interest since a lack of cross-resistance has been documented.It has been demonstrated in several clinical trials that exemestane may cause a disease regression following resistance to nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors.The exact mechanism(s) behind this phenomenon is yet unknown.Here, we present the NEOLETEXE trial with the aim of exploring the individual mechanisms involved behind the observed lack of cross resistance.Clinical trial registration: The trial has been approved by the Regional Ethics Committee of South-East Norway (project number 2015/84).",0,0,0,0
24852569,"In Barrett's esophagus patients and Barrett's cell lines, ursodeoxycholic acid increases antioxidant expression and prevents DNA damage by bile acids.Hydrophobic bile acids like deoxycholic acid (DCA), which cause oxidative DNA damage and activate NF-kappaB in Barrett's metaplasia, might contribute to carcinogenesis in Barrett's esophagus.We have explored mechanisms whereby ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA, a hydrophilic bile acid) protects against DCA-induced injury in vivo in patients and in vitro using nonneoplastic, telomerase-immortalized Barrett's cell lines.We took biopsies of Barrett's esophagus from 21 patients before and after esophageal perfusion with DCA (250 muM) at baseline and after 8 wk of oral UDCA treatment.DNA damage was assessed by phospho-H2AX expression, neutral CometAssay, and phospho-H2AX nuclear foci formation.Quantitative PCR was performed for antioxidants including catalase and GPX1.Nrf2, catalase, and GPX1 were knocked down with siRNAs.Reporter assays were performed using a plasmid construct containing antioxidant responsive element.In patients, baseline esophageal perfusion with DCA significantly increased phospho-H2AX and phospho-p65 in Barrett's metaplasia.Oral UDCA increased GPX1 and catalase levels in Barrett's metaplasia and prevented DCA perfusion from inducing DNA damage and NF-kappaB activation.In cells, DCA-induced DNA damage and NF-kappaB activation was prevented by 24-h pretreatment with UDCA, but not by mixing UDCA with DCA.UDCA activated Nrf2 signaling to increase GPX1 and catalase expression, and protective effects of UDCA pretreatment were blocked by siRNA knockdown of these antioxidants.UDCA increases expression of antioxidants that prevent toxic bile acids from causing DNA damage and NF-kappaB activation in Barrett's metaplasia.Elucidation of this molecular pathway for UDCA protection provides rationale for clinical trials on UDCA for chemoprevention in Barrett's esophagus.",0,0,0,0

31808921,"Effect of True and Sham Acupuncture on Radiation-Induced Xerostomia Among Patients With Head and Neck Cancer: A Randomized Clinical Trial.Importance: Radiation-induced xerostomia (RIX) is a common, often debilitating, adverse effect of radiation therapy among patients with head and neck cancer.Quality of life can be severely affected, and current treatments have limited benefit.Objective: To determine if acupuncture can prevent RIX in patients with head and neck cancer undergoing radiation therapy.Design, Setting, and Participants: This 2-center, phase 3, randomized clinical trial compared a standard care control (SCC) with true acupuncture (TA) and sham acupuncture (SA) among patients with oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal carcinoma who were undergoing radiation therapy in comprehensive cancer centers in the United States and China.Patients were enrolled between December 16, 2011, and July 7, 2015.Final follow-up was August 15, 2016.Analyses were conducted February 1 through 28, 2019.Intervention: Either TA or SA using a validated acupuncture placebo device was performed 3 times per week during a 6- to 7-week course of radiation therapy.Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was RIX, as determined by the Xerostomia Questionnaire in which a higher score indicates worse RIX, for combined institutions 1 year after radiation therapy ended.Secondary outcomes included incidence of clinically significant xerostomia (score >30), salivary flow, quality of life, salivary constituents, and role of baseline expectancy related to acupuncture on outcomes.Results: Of 399 patients randomized, 339 were included in the final analysis (mean [SD] age, 51.3 [11.7] years; age range, 21-79 years; 258 [77.6%] men), including 112 patients in the TA group, 115 patients in the SA group, and 112 patients in the SCC group.For the primary aim, the adjusted least square mean (SD) xerostomia score in the TA group (26.6 [17.7]) was significantly lower than in the SCC group (34.8 [18.7]) (P = .001; effect size = -0.44) and marginally lower but not statistically significant different from the SA group (31.3 [18.6]) (P = .06; effect size = -0.26).Incidence of clinically significant xerostomia 1 year after radiation therapy ended followed a similar pattern, with 38 patients in the TA group (34.6%), 54 patients in the SA group (47.8%), and 60 patients in the SCC group (55.1%) experiencing clinically significant xerostomia (P = .009).Post hoc comparisons revealed a significant difference between the TA and SCC groups at both institutions, but TA was significantly different from SA only at Fudan University Cancer Center, Shanghai, China (estimated difference [SE]: TA vs SCC, -9.9 [2.5]; P < .001; SA vs SCC, -1.7 [2.5]; P = .50; TA vs SA, -8.2 [2.5]; P = .001), and SA was significantly different from SCC only at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas (estimated difference [SE]: TA vs SCC, -8.1 [3.4]; P = .016; SA vs SCC, -10.5 [3.3]; P = .002; TA vs SA, 2.4 [3.2]; P = .45).Conclusions and Relevance: This randomized clinical trial found that TA resulted in significantly fewer and less severe RIX symptoms 1 year after treatment vs SCC.However, further studies are needed to confirm clinical relevance and generalizability of this finding and to evaluate inconsistencies in response to sham acupuncture between patients in the United States and China.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01266044.",0,0,0,0
29439668,"HIPECT4: multicentre, randomized clinical trial to evaluate safety and efficacy of Hyperthermic intra-peritoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) with Mitomycin C used during surgery for treatment of locally advanced colorectal carcinoma.BACKGROUND: Local relapse and peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) for pT4 colon cancer is estimated in 15,6% and 36,7% for 12 months and 36 months from surgical resection respectively, achieving a 5 years overall survival of 6%.There are promising results using prophylactic HIPEC in this group of patients, and it is estimated that up to 26% of all T4 colon cancer could benefit from this treatment with a minimal morbidity.Adjuvant HIPEC is effective to avoid the possibility of peritoneal seeding after surgical resection.Taking into account these results and the cumulative experience in HIPEC use, we will lead a randomized controlled trial to determine the effectiveness and safety of adjuvant treatment with HIPEC vs. standard treatment in patients with colon cancer at high risk of peritoneal recurrence (pT4).METHODS/DESIGN: The aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness and safety of adjuvant HIPEC in preventing the development of PC in patients with colon cancer with a high risk of peritoneal recurrence (cT4).This study will be carried out in 15 Spanish HIPEC centres.Eligible for inclusion are patients who underwent curative resection for cT4NxM0 stage colon cancer.After resection of the primary tumour, 200 patients will be randomized to adjuvant HIPEC followed by routine adjuvant systemic chemotherapy in the experimental arm, or to systemic chemotherapy only in the control arm.Adjuvant HIPEC will be performed simultaneously after the primary resection.Mitomycin C will be used as chemotherapeutic agent, for 60 min at 42-43 degrees C. Primary endpoint is loco-regional control (LC) in months and the rate of loco-regional control (%LC) at 12 months and 36 months after resection.DISCUSSION: We assumed that adjuvant HIPEC will reduce the expected absolute risk of peritoneal recurrence from 36% to 18% at 36 months for T4 colon-rectal carcinoma.TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT02614534 ( clinicaltrial.gov ) Nov-2015.",1,1,1,1
28579538,"Late Recurrence of Barrett's Esophagus After Complete Eradication of Intestinal Metaplasia is Rare: Final Report From Ablation in Intestinal Metaplasia Containing Dysplasia Trial.BACKGROUND & AIMS: The goal of treatment for Barrett's esophagus (BE) with dysplasia is complete eradication of intestinal metaplasia (CEIM).The long-term durability of CEIM has not been well characterized, so the frequency and duration of surveillance are unclear.We report results from a 5-year follow-up analysis of patients with BE and dysplasia treated by radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in the randomized controlled Ablation of Intestinal Metaplasia Containing Dysplasia (AIM) trial.METHODS: Participants for the AIM Dysplasia trial (18-80 years old) were recruited from 19 sites in the United States and had endoscopic evidence of non-nodular dysplastic BE </=8 cm in length.Subjects (n = 127) were randomly assigned (2:1 ratio) to receive either RFA (entire BE segment ablated circumferentially) or a sham endoscopic procedure; patients in the sham group were offered RFA treatment 1 year later, and all patients were followed for 5 years.We collected data on BE recurrence (defined as intestinal metaplasia in the tubular esophagus) and dysplastic BE recurrence among patients who achieved CEIM.We constructed Kaplan-Meier estimates and applied parametric survival analysis to examine proportions of patients without any recurrence and without dysplastic recurrence.RESULTS: Of 127 patients in the AIM Dysplasia trial, 119 received RFA and met inclusion criteria.Of those 119, 110 (92%) achieved CEIM.Over 401 person-years of follow-up (mean, 3.6 years per patient; range, 0.2-5.8 years), 35 of 110 (32%) patients had recurrence of BE or dysplasia, and 19 (17%) had dysplasia recurrence.The incidence rate of BE recurrence was 10.8 per 100 person-years overall (95% CI, 7.8-15.0); 8.3 per 100 person-years among patients with baseline low-grade dysplasia (95% CI, 4.9-14.0), and 13.5 per 100 person-years among patients with baseline high-grade dysplasia (95% CI 8.8-20.7).The incidence rate of dysplasia recurrence was 5.2 per 100 person-years overall (95% CI 3.3-8.2); 3.3 per 100 person-years among patients with baseline low-grade dysplasia (95% CI 1.5-7.2), and 7.3 per 100 person-years among patients with baseline high-grade dysplasia (95% CI 4.2-12.5).Neither BE nor dysplasia recurred at a constant rate.There was a greater probability of recurrence in the first year following CEIM than in the following 4 years combined.CONCLUSIONS: In this analysis of prospective cohort data from the AIM Dysplasia trial, we found BE to recur after CEIM by RFA in almost one third of patients with baseline dysplastic disease; most recurrences occurred during the first year after CEIM.However, patients who achieved CEIM and remained BE free at 1 year after RFA had a low risk of BE recurrence.Studies are needed to determine when surveillance can be decreased or discontinued; our study did not identify any BE or dysplasia recurrence after 4 years of surveillance.",0,0,0,0

An exploratory analysis of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer 55971 randomised trial.BACKGROUND: To investigate whether biomarkers consisting of baseline characteristics of advanced stage ovarian cancer patients can help in identifying subgroups of patients who would benefit more from primary surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy.METHODS: We used data of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 55971 trial in which 670 patients were randomly assigned to primary surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy.The primary outcome was overall survival.Ten baseline clinical and pathological characteristics were selected as potential biomarkers.Using Subpopulation Treatment Effect Pattern Plots (STEPP), biomarkers with a statistically significant qualitative additive interaction with treatment were considered as potentially informative for treatment selection.We also combined selected biomarkers to form a multimarker treatment selection rule.FINDINGS: The size of the largest metastatic tumour and clinical stage were significantly associated with the magnitude of the benefit from treatment, in terms of five-year survival (p for interaction: 0.008 and 0.016, respectively).Stage IIIC patients with metastatic tumours 45 mm benefited more from primary surgery while stage IV patients with metastatic tumours >45 mm benefited more from neoadjuvant chemotherapy.In stage IIIC patients with larger metastatic tumours and in stage IV patients with less extensive metastatic tumours both treatments were equally effective.We estimated that by selecting treatments for patients based on largest metastatic tumour and clinical stage, the potential five-year survival rate in the population of treated patients would be 27.3% (95% confidence interval (CI) 21.9-33.0), 7.8% higher than if all were treated with primary surgery, and 5.6% higher if all were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.INTERPRETATION: Although survival was comparable after primary surgery and neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the overall group of patients with ovarian cancer in the EORTC 55971 trial, we found in this exploratory analysis that patients with stage IIIC and less extensive metastatic tumours had higher survival with primary surgery, while patients with stage IV disease and large metastatic tumours had higher survival with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.For patients who did not meet these criteria, both treatment options led to comparable survival rates.",1,1,1,1

28692586,"Bioactivity and prostate tissue distribution of metformin in a preprostatectomy prostate cancer cohort.Metformin has recently been shown to have potential to reduce prostate cancer risk.We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine the modulating effects of metformin on tissue and systemic biomarkers of drug activity and its distribution into the prostate tissue.Twenty patients with prostate cancer scheduled to undergo prostatectomy were randomly assigned to receive either extended-release metformin or placebo for a median of 34 days before surgery.Prostatectomy and serum samples were analyzed for metformin concentrations, serum biomarkers of drug activity (prostate-specific antigen, insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3, sex hormone-binding globulin, and testosterone) and tissue biomarkers of proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, and mTOR inhibition.For participants in the metformin arm, the prostate tissue and serum metformin concentrations ranged from 0.88 to 51.2 mug/g tissue and from not detectable to 3.6 mug/ml, respectively.There were no differences between the two groups in either the postintervention tissue biomarker expression in the prostatectomy tissue or pre to postintervention changes in serum biomarkers.We conclude that metformin distributes to human prostate tissue, suggesting that metformin could exert its effects directly on tissue targets.However, there was no difference in tissue and systemic drug effect biomarkers between the two treatment arms.Future studies with longer intervention duration and larger sample size should be considered in order to evaluate the potential of metformin for prostate cancer prevention.",1,1,1,1
31813636,"Long-term primary results of accelerated partial breast irradiation after breast-conserving surgery for early-stage breast cancer: a randomised, phase 3, equivalence trial.BACKGROUND: Whole-breast irradiation after breast-conserving surgery for patients with early-stage breast cancer decreases ipsilateral breast-tumour recurrence (IBTR), yielding comparable results to mastectomy.It is unknown whether accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) to only the tumour-bearing quadrant, which shortens treatment duration, is equally effective.In our trial, we investigated whether APBI provides equivalent local tumour control after lumpectomy compared with whole-breast irradiation.METHODS: We did this randomised, phase 3, equivalence trial (NSABP B-39/RTOG 0413) in 154 clinical centres in the USA, Canada, Ireland, and Israel.Adult women (>18 years) with early-stage (0, I, or II; no evidence of distant metastases, but up to three axillary nodes could be positive) breast cancer (tumour size </=3 cm; including all histologies and multifocal breast cancers), who had had lumpectomy with negative (ie, no detectable cancer cells) surgical margins, were randomly assigned (1:1) using a biased-coin-based minimisation algorithm to receive either whole-breast irradiation (whole-breast irradiation group) or APBI (APBI group).Whole-breast irradiation was delivered in 25 daily fractions of 50 Gy over 5 weeks, with or without a supplemental boost to the tumour bed, and APBI was delivered as 34 Gy of brachytherapy or 38.5 Gy of external bream radiation therapy in 10 fractions, over 5 treatment days within an 8-day period.Randomisation was stratified by disease stage, menopausal status, hormone-receptor status, and intention to receive chemotherapy.Patients, investigators, and statisticians could not be masked to treatment allocation.The primary outcome of invasive and non-invasive IBTR as a first recurrence was analysed in the intention-to-treat population, excluding those patients who were lost to follow-up, with an equivalency test on the basis of a 50% margin increase in the hazard ratio (90% CI for the observed HR between 0.667 and 1.5 for equivalence) and a Cox proportional hazard model.Survival was assessed by intention to treat, and sensitivity analyses were done in the per-protocol population.This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00103181.FINDINGS: Between March 21, 2005, and April 16, 2013, 4216 women were enrolled.2109 were assigned to the whole-breast irradiation group and 2107 were assigned to the APBI group.70 patients from the whole-breast irradiation group and 14 from the APBI group withdrew consent or were lost to follow-up at this stage, so 2039 and 2093 patients respectively were available for survival analysis.Further, three and four patients respectively were lost to clinical follow-up (ie, survival status was assessed by phone but no physical examination was done), leaving 2036 patients in the whole-breast irradiation group and 2089 in the APBI group evaluable for the primary outcome.At a median follow-up of 10.2 years (IQR 7.5-11.5), 90 (4%) of 2089 women eligible for the primary outcome in the APBI group and 71 (3%) of 2036 women in the whole-breast irradiation group had an IBTR (HR 1.22, 90% CI 0.94-1.58).The 10-year cumulative incidence of IBTR was 4.6% (95% CI 3.7-5.7) in the APBI group versus 3.9% (3.1-5.0) in the whole-breast irradiation group.44 (2%) of 2039 patients in the whole-breast irradiation group and 49 (2%) of 2093 patients in the APBI group died from recurring breast cancer.There were no treatment-related deaths.Second cancers and treatment-related toxicities were similar between the two groups.2020 patients in the whole-breast irradiation group and 2089 in APBI group had available data on adverse events.The highest toxicity grade reported was: grade 1 in 845 (40%), grade 2 in 921 (44%), and grade 3 in 201 (10%) patients in the APBI group, compared with grade 1 in 626 (31%), grade 2 in 1193 (59%), and grade 3 in 143 (7%) in the whole-breast irradiation group.INTERPRETATION: APBI did not meet the criteria for equivalence to whole-breast irradiation in controlling IBTR for breast-conserving therapy.Our trial had broad eligibility criteria, leading to a large, heterogeneous pool of patients and sufficient power to detect treatment equivalence, but was not designed to test equivalence in patient subgroups or outcomes from different APBI techniques.For patients with early-stage breast cancer, our findings support whole-breast irradiation following lumpectomy; however, with an absolute difference of less than 1% in the 10-year cumulative incidence of IBTR, APBI might be an acceptable alternative for some women.FUNDING: National Cancer Institute, US Department of Health and Human Services.",0,0,0,0

24775812,"Efficacy and safety of fosfomycin-trometamol in the prophylaxis for transrectal prostate biopsy. Prospective randomized comparison with ciprofloxacin.OBJECTIVE: Prostate biopsy is the standardized diagnostic method for prostate cancer.However, although there is not a standardized protocol, there are recommendations in order to reduce the incidence of complications.The objective of the present work is to assess the efficacy and safety of antibiotic prophylaxis in the prostate biopsy by comparing two antibiotic regimes: two doses of fosfomycin-trometamol 3g (FMT) every 48 hours with 10 doses of oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg every 12 hours during 5 days.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Randomized prospective study was performed with 671 patients who had undergone to walking transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy.Patients of group A (n=312) were treated with ciprofloxacin, and patients of group B (n=359) with FMT.Efficacy and tolerability of two prophylactic regimes were compared.Urine culture was carried out at 2 weeks after biopsy.Initially, patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria were not treated with antibiotics; urine culture was repeated after 1 month, persistent bacteriuria was treated according to antibiogram.RESULTS: No differences between groups were found in age (P=.78), cancer presence (P=.9) or number of biopsy cylinders (P=.93).The mean number of cores obtained was 11.3 +/- 3.25 (range 6-20).Digestive intolerance was observed for 9 patients (2.9%) of group A and 10 patients (2.8%) in group B. One patient (.3%) of group A showed severe allergic reaction.In total, 167 patients (24.6%) had complications: 16 (2.4%) fever, 47 (6.9%) hemospermia, 81 (11.9%) hematuria, 7 (1%) rectal bleeding and 16 (2.4%) urinary retention.No statistically differences between groups were observed (27.6% vs. 22.6%; P=.17).However, hemospermia was more frequent in group A (9.9% vs. 4.5%; P=.006).Bacteriuria after biopsy was detected in 44 patients (6.6%), being more frequent in group B patients (4.2% vs. 8.6%; P=.02) although a higher number of second treatment cycles were not needed (53.9% vs. 29%; P=.17).The likelihood of resistance to ciprofloxacin in patients with bacteriuria in A was greater than that of FMT in B (69.2% vs. 41.9%; P=.0004).CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic prophylaxis with FMT (2 doses of 3g) in prostate biopsy is an alternative as effective and safe as ciprofloxacin (10 doses of 500 mg), which carries lower rate of resistance.According to our experience, this drug is a safe, well-tolerated, and easily manageable prophylactic option, facilitating patient compliance.More prospective multicenter studies are necessary to confirm these findings.",0,0,0,0
28109543,"The risk of cancer in kidney transplant recipients may be reduced in those maintained on everolimus and reduced cyclosporine.Kidney transplant recipients are at a high risk of developing cancers after transplantation.Switching from calcineurin inhibitors to sirolimus has been shown to prevent secondary nonmelanoma skin cancer but whether everolimus with reduced exposure to calcineurin inhibitors has similar anti-cancer effects remains unknown.Therefore, we compared the risk of incident cancer over seven years of follow-up among kidney transplant recipients randomized to everolimus plus reduced exposure cyclosporine versus mycophenolate sodium and standard exposure cyclosporine.Using the Australian and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry (ANZDATA), we assessed the seven-year risk of incident cancer and other graft outcomes among a subgroup of recipients who had participated in the A2309 study using adjusted Cox proportional hazard models.Of 95 recipients, 66 were randomized to everolimus (1.5 mg or 3 mg) with reduced cyclosporine and 29 received mycophenolate sodium and standard exposure cyclosporine.Compared to mycophenolate sodium and standard exposure cyclosporine, everolimus treatment was associated with unadjusted hazard ratios of 0.28 (95% confidence interval 0.11-0.74), 0.39 (0.16-0.98) and 0.41 (0.23-0.71), respectively for nonmelanoma skin cancer, non-skin cancers and any cancers.Interestingly, the adjusted hazard ratios were 0.34 (0.13-0.91), 0.35 (0.09-1.25) and 0.32 (0.15-0.71), respectively.There was no association between treatment groups and rejection, graft loss or death.Compared to standard-exposure cyclosporine, everolimus with reduced exposure to cyclosporine may be associated with a reduced risk of cancer, particularly for non-melanoma skin cancer.Thus, if confirmed in larger patient cohorts, de novo use of everolimus with reduced exposure to calcineurin inhibitors may enable a reduction in cancer burden after transplantation.",0,0,0,0
22390720,"Value of immediate second resection of the tumor bed to improve the effectiveness of transurethral resection of bladder tumor.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Current guidelines recommend routine second transurethral resection (TUR) for accurate diagnosis and to prevent understaging of muscle-invasive bladder cancer.We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of immediate second resection of the tumor bed during initial TUR and its prognostic significance.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients (n=126) undergoing TUR were prospectively randomized to undergo (n=63) or not undergo (n=63) immediate second resection of the tumor bed after complete TUR.Second resection was repeated until muscularis propria (MP) was identified in the specimen and the depth of tumor invasion was inspected.The results of second resection were compared with final pathology results for diagnostic accuracy.Recurrence and progression rates were compared in the two groups, and factors affecting recurrence were evaluated.RESULTS: Patient age, sex distribution, number of tumors, pathologic T stage and grade were similar in the groups.MP was included in all TUR specimens in the immediate second resection group, compared with 41 of 63 (65.1%) in the nonsecond resection group.The concordance rate of second resection with final pathology was r=0.810 (P<0.01).The sensitivity and specificity of second resection for T(2) disease were 90.9% and 98.0%, respectively, and the positive and negative predictive values of second resection for T(2) disease were 90.0% and 96.2%, respectively.Among the 94 patients followed up, those in the second resection group had significantly higher 2-year recurrence-free survival rate (77.0% vs 45.8%, P=0.025), but there was no difference in progression-free survival rate.CONCLUSIONS: Immediate second resection of the tumor bed after complete TUR improves the effectiveness of resection by immediately confirming the presence of MP in the specimen and accurately differentiating muscle-invasive disease.The advantages of immediate second resection were precise prediction of final pathology results and reduced early recurrence.",0,0,0,0

The IOP at T13 in group S was approximately 5.7 mm Hg higher than in group E. The IOP at T13 was approximately 10.6 mm Hg higher than in T1 in group S, but only approximately 4.4 mm Hg higher than in group E.

29589991,"Comparison of patient flow and provider efficiency of two delivery strategies for HPV-based cervical cancer screening in Western Kenya: a time and motion study.BACKGROUND: Improving patient flow and reducing over-crowding can improve quality, promptness of care, and patient satisfaction.Given low utilization of preventive care in low-resource countries, improved patient flows are especially important in these settings.OBJECTIVE: Compare patient flow and provider efficiency between two cervical cancer screening strategies via self-collected human papillomavirus (HPV).METHODS: We collected time and motion data for patients screened for cervical cancer in 12 communities in rural Migori County, Kenya as part of a larger cluster randomized trial.Six communities were randomized to screening in community health campaigns (CHCs) and six to screening at government clinics.We quantified patient flow: duration spent on each active stage of screening and wait times, and the number of patients arriving at CHCs and clinics each hour of the day.In addition, for four CHCs, we collected time and motion data for providers, and measured provider efficiency as a ratio of active (service delivery) time to total time spent at the clinic.RESULTS: Total duration of screening visits, at CHCs and clinics was 42 and 87 minutes, respectively (p < 0.001 for difference).Total active time lasted longer at CHCs, with a mean of 28 minutes per patient versus 15 minutes at clinics, largely due to differences in duration for group education (p < 0.001).Wait time for registration at clinics was 36 minutes, explaining most of the difference between settings, but sometimes incorporated other health services.CONCLUSIONS: There is a substantial difference in patient flow at clinics compared to CHCs.Shorter duration at CHCs suggests that the model is favorable for patients in limiting time spent on screening.Future cervical cancer screening programs designed for scale-up should consider how this advantage may enhance satisfaction and uptake.For clinic-based screening programs, efforts could be made towards reducing registration wait times.",0,0,0,0

29908775,"Insulin resistance is associated with depression risk in polycystic ovary syndrome.OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that insulin resistance is associated with depression risk in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).DESIGN: Secondary analysis of data from a multicenter randomized trial.SETTING: Multicenter university-based clinical practices.PATIENT(S): Seven hundred thirty-eight women with PCOS by modified Rotterdam criteria seeking pregnancy enrolled in a randomized clinical trial comparing clomiphene citrate versus letrozole.INTERVENTION(S): The Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders Patient Health Questionnaire was self-administered to identify depression using a validated algorithm at enrollment.Demographic and anthropometric data were collected, and serum assays were performed.Insulin resistance was estimated using the homeostatic model of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), with a cutoff of >2.2 considered abnormal.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Demographic, endocrine, and metabolic parameters associated with depression.RESULT(S): In a univariate logistic regression analysis, elevated HOMA-IR was associated with 2.3-fold increased odds of depression (odds ratio [OR] = 2.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.28-4.21).This association remained significant after controlling for age and body mass index (adjusted OR [aOR] = 2.23; 95% CI, 1.11-4.46) and in a model including additional potential confounders (aOR = 2.03; 95% CI, 1.00-4.16).CONCLUSION(S): Insulin resistance has a strong and independent association with depression in PCOS and may serve as a physiologic mediator.Our findings corroborate a growing body of evidence linking insulin resistance to depressed mood.The association between insulin resistance and depressed mood warrants further investigation to elucidate mechanisms and identify potential therapeutic targets.",0,0,0,0
24162448,"A randomized controlled trial of diet and physical activity in BRCA mutation carriers.High serum levels of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) are associated with an increased risk of sporadic breast cancer (BC).Furthermore, insulin and markers of insulin resistance, such as abdominal obesity, high blood glucose, high serum testosterone and metabolic syndrome, may affect both BC incidence and prognosis.We hypothesized that all these factors might be relevant also for hereditary BC, due to a deleterious mutation of BRCA genes.Epidemiological observation suggested that weight, energy intake (usually associated with higher bio-availability of growth factors) and physical activity may be relevant in BRCA mutation carriers.Mechanistic studies hypothesized a functional interaction between BRCA genes and the IGF-I system.We have provided some evidence that high serum levels of IGF-I are associated with a significantly increased penetrance.We are recruiting a larger cohort of BRCA mutation carriers in order to test potential modulators of penetrance and prognosis.Within this cohort, we have planned a randomized controlled trial to test whether moderate calorie and protein restriction, together with physical activity, decrease IGF-I. Eligible study subjects are women with or without BC, aged 18-70, with a proven deleterious BRCA mutation, and without metastases.All the women will receive recommendations for the dietary prevention of cancer.The women will be then randomized into an active life-style intervention group and into a control group that will receive only the baseline recommendations.We expect to significantly reduce IGF-I in the intervention group.This trial and the subsequent cohort follow-up might open up primary prevention options for genetic BC.",0,0,0,0

29773717,"STK11/LKB1 Mutations and PD-1 Inhibitor Resistance in KRAS-Mutant Lung Adenocarcinoma.KRAS is the most common oncogenic driver in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAC).We previously reported that STK11/LKB1 (KL) or TP53 (KP) comutations define distinct subgroups of KRAS-mutant LUAC.Here, we examine the efficacy of PD-1 inhibitors in these subgroups.Objective response rates to PD-1 blockade differed significantly among KL (7.4%), KP (35.7%), and K-only (28.6%) subgroups (P < 0.001) in the Stand Up To Cancer (SU2C) cohort (174 patients) with KRAS-mutant LUAC and in patients treated with nivolumab in the CheckMate-057 phase III trial (0% vs. 57.1% vs. 18.2%; P = 0.047).In the SU2C cohort, KL LUAC exhibited shorter progression-free (P < 0.001) and overall (P = 0.0015) survival compared with KRAS(MUT);STK11/LKB1(WT) LUAC.Among 924 LUACs, STK11/LKB1 alterations were the only marker significantly associated with PD-L1 negativity in TMB(Intermediate/High)LUAC.The impact of STK11/LKB1 alterations on clinical outcomes with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors extended to PD-L1-positive non-small cell lung cancer.In Kras-mutant murine LUAC models, Stk11/Lkb1 loss promoted PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor resistance, suggesting a causal role.Our results identify STK11/LKB1 alterations as a major driver of primary resistance to PD-1 blockade in KRAS-mutant LUAC.Significance: This work identifies STK11/LKB1 alterations as the most prevalent genomic driver of primary resistance to PD-1 axis inhibitors in KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinoma.Genomic profiling may enhance the predictive utility of PD-L1 expression and tumor mutation burden and facilitate establishment of personalized combination immunotherapy approaches for genomically defined LUAC subsets.Cancer Discov; 8(7); 822-35.(c)2018 AACR.See related commentary by Etxeberria et al., p. 794This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 781.",0,0,0,0
29070044,"Neoadjuvant everolimus plus letrozole versus fluorouracil, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide for ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer: study protocol for a randomized pilot trial.BACKGROUND: The response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) varies by estrogen receptor (ER) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) statuses, with responses being lower in ER-positive, HER2-negative tumors as compared with ER-negative, HER2-positive or triple-negative tumors.Neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (NET) is an attractive alternative to NAC for ER-positive, HER2-negative cancer.However, a prior trial comparing NET with standard NAC in ER-positive tumor showed that the difference of response was not significant.Studies demonstrated that the mTOR inhibitor everolimus could sensitize breast tumors to endocrine therapy.A pilot open-label, randomized trial has been designed to evaluate the feasibility, efficacy and tolerability of neoadjuvant everolimus plus letrozole versus NAC in treating postmenopausal women with ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer.METHODS: Forty postmenopausal women with non-metastatic ER-positive, HER2-negative invasive breast cancer with a primary tumor > 2 cm or positive axillary lymph node(s) proved by biopsy will be randomly (1:1) enrolled from Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital to receive neoadjuvant everolimus plus letrozole for 18 weeks or fluorouracil, epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide (FEC) for six cycles before surgery.Primary outcome is the feasibility of the trial.Secondary outcome measures include ultrasound response rate, pathological complete response rate, breast-conserving surgery rate, toxicities, and changes in the percentages of peripheral blood CD4(+) T cells, CD8(+) T cells, T helper cells, regulatory T cells, and NK cells.DISCUSSION: This is the first study to determine the feasibility, efficacy and tolerability of head-to-head neoadjuvant everolimus plus letrozole versus neoadjuvant FEC in treating postmenopausal women with ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer.The trial will provide evidence to assess the feasibility of a future multicenter, randomized controlled trial, and will provide valuable clinical data of the immunoregulatory effect of everolimus in breast cancer.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov registry, ID: NCT02742051 .Registered on 7 April 2016.",1,1,1,1
31591063,"Ramucirumab plus erlotinib in patients with untreated, EGFR-mutated, advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (RELAY): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Dual blockade of the EGFR and VEGF pathways in EGFR-mutated metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is supported by preclinical and clinical data, yet the approach is not widely implemented.RELAY assessed erlotinib, an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) standard of care, plus ramucirumab, a human IgG1 VEGFR2 antagonist, or placebo in patients with untreated EGFR-mutated metastatic NSCLC.METHODS: This is a worldwide, double-blind, phase 3 trial done in 100 hospitals, clinics, and medical centres in 13 countries.Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older (20 years or older in Japan and Taiwan) at the time of study entry, had stage IV NSCLC, with an EGFR exon 19 deletion (ex19del) or exon 21 substitution (Leu858Arg) mutation, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, and no CNS metastases.We randomly assigned eligible patients in a 1:1 ratio to receive oral erlotinib (150 mg/day) plus either intravenous ramucirumab (10 mg/kg) or matching placebo once every 2 weeks.Randomisation was done by an interactive web response system with a computer-generated sequence and stratified by sex, geographical region, EGFR mutation type, and EGFR testing method.The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population.Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment.This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02411448, and is ongoing for long-term survival follow-up.FINDINGS: Between Jan 28, 2016, and Feb 1, 2018, 449 eligible patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to treatment with ramucirumab plus erlotinib (n=224) or placebo plus erlotinib (n=225).Median duration of follow-up was 20.7 months (IQR 15.8-27.2).At the time of primary analysis, progression-free survival was significantly longer in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib group (19.4 months [95% CI 15.4-21.6]) than in the placebo plus erlotinib group (12.4 months [11.0-13.5]), with a stratified hazard ratio of 0.59 (95% CI 0.46-0.76; p<0.0001).Grade 3-4 treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 159 (72%) of 221 patients in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib group versus 121 (54%) of 225 in the placebo plus erlotinib group.The most common grade 3-4 treatment-emergent adverse events in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib group were hypertension (52 [24%]; grade 3 only) and dermatitis acneiform (33 [15%]), and in the placebo plus erlotinib group were dermatitis acneiform (20 [9%]) and increased alanine aminotransferase (17 [8%]).Treatment-emergent serious adverse events were reported in 65 (29%) of 221 patients in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib group and 47 (21%) of 225 in the placebo plus erlotinib group.The most common serious adverse events of any grade in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib group were pneumonia (seven [3%]) and cellulitis and pneumothorax (four [2%], each); the most common in the placebo plus erlotinib group were pyrexia (four [2%]) and pneumothorax (three [1%]).One on-study treatment-related death due to an adverse event occurred (haemothorax after a thoracic drainage procedure for a pleural empyema) in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib group.INTERPRETATION: Ramucirumab plus erlotinib demonstrated superior progression-free survival compared with placebo plus erlotinib in patients with untreated EGFR-mutated metastatic NSCLC.Safety was consistent with the safety profiles of the individual compounds in advanced lung cancer.The RELAY regimen is a viable new treatment option for the initial treatment of EGFR-mutated metastatic NSCLC.FUNDING: Eli Lilly.",1,1,1,1
28209746,"A Phase II Randomized Trial (GO27827) of First-Line FOLFOX Plus Bevacizumab with or Without the MET Inhibitor Onartuzumab in Patients with Metastatic Colorectal Cancer.BACKGROUND: Dysregulated hepatocyte growth factor/mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) signaling is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to vascular endothelial growth factor inhibition in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).We report outcomes from a double-blind, multicenter phase II trial of the MET inhibitor onartuzumab in combination with mFOLFOX-6 and bevacizumab for mCRC (GO27827; NCT01418222).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive onartuzumab (10 mg/kg intravenously [IV]) or placebo plus mFOLFOX-6 and bevacizumab (5 mg/kg IV).Oxaliplatin was given for 8-12 cycles; other agents were continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or death.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) in the intent-to-treat (ITT) and MET immunohistochemistry (IHC) expression-positive populations.RESULTS: Between September 2011 and November 2012, 194 patients were enrolled.In September 2013, an interim analysis recommended stopping onartuzumab treatment due to lack of efficacy.At the time of the final analysis in February 2014, no significant improvement in PFS was seen with onartuzumab versus placebo in either the ITT or MET IHC-positive populations.An improvement in PFS was noted in the MET IHC-negative population.Neither overall survival nor response rate was improved with onartuzumab.The incidence of fatigue, peripheral edema, and deep vein thrombosis was increased with onartuzumab relative to placebo.CONCLUSION: Onartuzumab combined with mFOLFOX-6 and bevacizumab did not significantly improve efficacy outcomes in either the ITT or MET IHC-positive populations.MET expression by IHC was not a predictive biomarker in this setting.The Oncologist 2017;22:264-271 IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The addition of onartuzumab to mFOLFOX-6 plus bevacizumab did not improve outcomes in patients with previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer in this randomized, phase II study.Although initial results with onartuzumab were promising, a number of phase II/III clinical trials have reported a lack of improvement in efficacy with onartuzumab combined with standard-of-care therapies in several tumor types.Furthermore, negative study data have been published for rilotumumab and ficlatuzumab, both of which block hepatocyte growth factor binding to the mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) receptor.MET immunohistochemistry was not a predictive biomarker.It remains to be seen if other biomarkers or small molecule inhibitors may be more appropriate for inhibiting this oncogenic pathway.",1,1,1,1

31512101,"A Prospective Randomized Trial Comparing Jejunostomy and Nasogastric Feeding in Minimally Invasive McKeown Esophagectomy.BACKGROUND: Early postoperative enteral nutrition is recommended for patients undergoing esophagectomy; however, the optimum method of tube feeding remains controversial.Thus, the aim of this study is to assess two common enteral nutrition methods after minimally invasive McKeown esophagectomy.METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was performed with 120 patients who underwent minimally invasive McKeown esophagectomy from January 2017 to December 2018.The patients were randomly divided so that 58 patients were in the jejunostomy feeding (JF) group and 62 patients were in the nasogastric feeding (NF) group.The postoperative outcomes, including complications, nutritional status, quality of life, and survival rate, were studied and used as the main parameters to compare the abovementioned tube feeding methods.RESULTS: The incidence of overall complications was equivalent between the two groups (P = 0.625), except for bowel obstruction (which occurred 4 times in the JF group but did not occur in the NF group).In the first month after surgery (postoperative month 1, POM1), a significantly higher body mass index (BMI) was observed in the JF group (23.6 +/- 3.2) than in the NF group (20.9 +/- 3.5, P = 0.032).The global quality-of-life scores were better in the JF group than in the NF group (P < 0.001).In addition, there were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of disease-free survival (DFS) (P = 0.816) and overall survival (OS) (P = 0.564).CONCLUSIONS: Compared with NF, JF provides more safety, efficacy, and utility as nutritional support for minimally invasive McKeown esophagectomy patients who have a high incidence of anastomotic leakage.However, the higher risk of intestinal obstruction after JF requires attention.",0,0,0,0
24246414,"Long-term results of the Dutch randomized prostate cancer trial: impact of dose-escalation on local, biochemical, clinical failure, and survival.PURPOSE: Nowadays, advanced irradiation techniques make it possible to escalate safely the dose in prostate cancer.We studied the effect of a higher dose on tumor control in a randomized trial with a median follow-up of 110 months.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with T1b-T4N0 prostate cancer (n=664) were randomized between 78 Gy and 68 Gy.Primary endpoint was biochemical and/or clinical failure (BCF) according to the American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology (ASTRO) guidelines (3 consecutive rises), and to Phoenix (nadir plus 2 mug/L).Secondary endpoints were clinical failure (CF), local failure (LF), prostate cancer death (PCD), and overall survival (OS).Explorative subgroup analyses were performed.RESULTS: BCF rate (HR=0.8; 20% less events) and LF rate (HR=0.5; 50% less events) were significantly lower in the 78 Gy arm (p<0.05).CF, PCD and OS were similar in both arms.A significant heterogeneity of treatment effect was found for PSA cutoffs between 7 and 10 mug/L. CONCLUSION: We observed significantly less BCF and LF in the high-dose arm.This suggests improvement of the therapeutic ratio.However, we observed similar rates of CF and PCD at the current update.More follow-up is needed to investigate which patients benefit in terms of prolonged OS.",0,0,0,0
30581161,"Prophylactic Use of Entecavir for Lymphoma Patients With Past Hepatitis B Virus Infection: A Randomized Controlled Trial.BACKGROUND: The value of prophylactic antiviral therapy in patients with past hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (HBV surface antigen-negative/anti-HBV core antibody-positive/HBV DNA negative) is still controversial.PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study compared the safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of prophylactic entecavir (ETV) with regular monitoring alone in lymphoma patients with past HBV infection.Patients were randomly assigned to chemotherapy alone (control) or prophylactic ETV before chemotherapy and at least 6 months after completion of chemotherapy.All patients underwent close virologic and biochemical surveillance.The primary end points were the incidence rates of HBV reactivation (appearance of HBV DNA) and HBV reactivation-related hepatitis (defined as a greater than 3-fold increase in serum alanine aminotransferase levels exceeding 100 IU/L).RESULTS: A total of 190 patients were included, 141 (74.2%) of whom were positive for anti-HBV surface antibody (HBs).The incidence rates of HBV reactivation and HBV reactivation-related hepatitis were 0 (0/95) and 0 (0/95) in the prophylactic ETV group, respectively, and 3.2% (3/95) and 1.1% (1/95) in the control group, respectively (P = .246 and 1.000, respectively).One patient experienced HBV reactivation-related hepatitis, resulting in premature termination of chemotherapy.All 3 patients with HBV reactivation recovered after therapeutic ETV treatment.No HBV-related deaths were observed during the follow-up period.The cost in the prophylactic ETV group was higher than that in the control group ($125 per month).CONCLUSION: Prophylactic antiviral therapy is not a cost-effective strategy for the management of lymphoma patients with past HBV infection, especially those positive for anti-HBs.",1,1,0,0
22149921,"ABVD alone versus radiation-based therapy in limited-stage Hodgkin's lymphoma.BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy plus radiation treatment is effective in controlling stage IA or IIA nonbulky Hodgkin's lymphoma in 90% of patients but is associated with late treatment-related deaths.Chemotherapy alone may improve survival because it is associated with fewer late deaths.METHODS: We randomly assigned 405 patients with previously untreated stage IA or IIA nonbulky Hodgkin's lymphoma to treatment with doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD) alone or to treatment with subtotal nodal radiation therapy, with or without ABVD therapy.Patients in the ABVD-only group, both those with a favorable risk profile and those with an unfavorable risk profile, received four to six cycles of ABVD.Among those assigned to subtotal nodal radiation therapy, patients who had a favorable risk profile received subtotal nodal radiation therapy alone and patients with an unfavorable risk profile received two cycles of ABVD plus subtotal nodal radiation therapy.The primary end point was 12-year overall survival.RESULTS: The median length of follow-up was 11.3 years.At 12 years, the rate of overall survival was 94% among those receiving ABVD alone, as compared with 87% among those receiving subtotal nodal radiation therapy (hazard ratio for death with ABVD alone, 0.50; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.25 to 0.99; P=0.04); the rates of freedom from disease progression were 87% and 92% in the two groups, respectively (hazard ratio for disease progression, 1.91; 95% CI, 0.99 to 3.69; P=0.05); and the rates of event-free survival were 85% and 80%, respectively (hazard ratio for event, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.54 to 1.43; P=0.60).Among the patients randomly assigned to ABVD alone, 6 patients died from Hodgkin's lymphoma or an early treatment complication and 6 died from another cause; among those receiving radiation therapy, 4 deaths were related to Hodgkin's lymphoma or early toxic effects from the treatment and 20 were related to another cause.CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma, ABVD therapy alone, as compared with treatment that included subtotal nodal radiation therapy, was associated with a higher rate of overall survival owing to a lower rate of death from other causes.(Funded by the Canadian Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute; HD.6 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00002561.).",1,1,1,1

24129868,"Effect of a web-based curriculum on primary care practice: basic skin cancer triage trial.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Primary care physicians (PCPs) are uniquely positioned to detect melanoma.Effective educational interventions targeted at PCPs may improve early melanoma detection.A previous in-person Basic Skin Cancer Triage (BSCT) 2-hour course demonstrated significant short-term improvement in provider practices, attitudes, ability, confidence, and knowledge.We conducted a randomized trial to test the efficacy of the BSCT course implemented as a web-based learning program, compared to a similar (control) web-based course on weight assessment.METHODS: We recruited a sample of 57 PCPs and 3,341 of their patients from four geographically diverse centers.Skin cancer control activities by PCPs were assessed by physician survey and by chart review and patient telephone interview about their recent visit to their PCP at baseline and at 1--2 months and 12 months after course completion.RESULTS: Some effect of intervention on skin cancer parameters was self-reported by physicians; this was not confirmed by patient survey or chart-extracted data.Rates of skin cancer control practices by PCPs were low across both groups before and after intervention.The positive changes in physician-reported behaviors (total body skin examination [TBSE]), intentions (discuss skin cancer detection), confidence (performing TBSE), office practices, and knowledge (58% skin versus 49% control) were neither matched by differences in practice reported by their patients, nor persisted in a longer term follow-up, hence may be attributable to physician recall bias due to the experience of the course or desire to please study investigators and were less dramatic as compared to our previously reported in-person BSCT intervention.Thus this approach by itself appears unlikely to result in improved PCP handling of skin cancer issues.CONCLUSIONS: Given previous success with our in-person course, the features required to make WBL a more effective tool for medical education must be further explored.",0,0,0,0

27751846,"Safety and efficacy of regorafenib in patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma (REGOSARC): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial.BACKGROUND: Regorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor with proven activity in refractory gastrointestinal stromal tumours and chemotherapy-refractory advanced colorectal cancers.We assessed this agent's efficacy and safety in patients with metastatic soft tissue sarcomas previously treated with anthracycline.METHODS: In this randomised, double-blind, phase 2 trial undertaken in France and Austria, we enrolled patients aged 18 years and older with advanced soft tissue sarcomas who had received previous doxorubicin or other anthracycline treatment.These patients were randomly assigned (1:1) into one of the following four cohorts: liposarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, and other sarcomas.Participants were treated with oral regorafenib (160 mg per day 3 weeks on and 1 week off) or matched placebo.Patients receiving placebo were offered optional crossover in case of centrally confirmed disease progression.The random allocation schedule was computer-generated with permuted blocks of four patients, with two stratification factors: country (France or Austria) and previous exposure to pazopanib (yes or no).Eligibility criteria included patients with histologically proven advanced and inoperable soft tissue sarcomas with intolerance or failure to doxorubicin or other anthracycline-based chemotherapy and at least one unidimensionally or bidimensionally measurable lesion according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST; version 1.1).The primary endpoint was RECIST-based progression-free survival after central radiological review in the intention-to-treat population.Patients, physicians, and radiologists of the panel were masked to treatment allocation.This study is still open for recruitment for an additional stratum (patients previously treated with pazopanib) and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01900743.FINDINGS: From Aug 5, 2013, to Nov 26, 2014, 182 patients were randomly assigned to one of four cohorts and included in the final analysis.At the cutoff date (Jan 7, 2016), the number of required events was reached for the four cohorts.In the liposarcoma cohort, progression-free survival was 1.1 months (95% CI 0.9-2.3) with regorafenib versus 1.7 months (0.9-1.8) with placebo (HR 0.89 [95% CI 0.48-1.64] p=0.70).In the leiomyosarcoma cohort, progression-free survival was 3.7 months (95% CI 2.5-5.0) with regorafenib versus 1.8 (1.0-2.8) months with placebo (HR 0.46 [95% CI 0.46-0.80] p=0.0045).In the synovial sarcoma cohort, progression-free survival was 5.6 months (95% CI 1.4-11.6) with regorafenib versus 1.0 (0.8-1.4) with placebo (HR 0.10 [95% CI 0.03-0.35] p<0.0001).In the other sarcoma cohort, progression-free survival was 2.9 months (95% CI 1.0-7.8) with regorafenib versus 1.0 (0.9-1.9) with placebo (HR 0.46 [95% CI 0.25-0.81] p=0.0061).Before crossover, the most common clinically significant grade 3 or higher adverse events were arterial hypertension (17 [19%] events in the 89 patients in the regorafenib group vs two [2%] events in the 92 patients in the placebo group), hand and foot skin reaction (14 [15%] vs no events) and asthenia (12 [13%] vs six [6%]).One treatment-related death occurred in the regorafenib group due to liver failure.INTERPRETATION: Regorafenib has an important clinical antitumour effect in non-adipocytic soft tissue sarcomas, improving progression-free survival.Regorafenib should be further evaluated in this setting, and its therapeutic role has to be defined in the context of the growing therapeutic armamentarium, already including one approved multikinase inhibitor, pazopanib.FUNDING: Bayer HealthCare.",1,1,1,0
29413685,"PICCA study: panitumumab in combination with cisplatin/gemcitabine chemotherapy in KRAS wild-type patients with biliary cancer-a randomised biomarker-driven clinical phase II AIO study.BACKGROUND: Combination chemotherapy has shown benefit in the treatment of biliary cancer and further improvements might be achieved by the addition of a biological agent.We report here the effect of chemotherapy with the monoclonal EGFR antibody panitumumab as therapy for KRAS wild-type biliary cancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with advanced biliary tract cancer were randomised (2:1) to receive cisplatin 25 mg/m(2) and gemcitabine 1000 mg/m(2) on day 1 and day 8/q3w with (arm A) or without panitumumab (arm B; 9 mg/kg BW, i.v q3w).The primary end-point was the evaluation of progression-free survival (PFS) at 6 months.Secondary end-points included objective response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), and toxicity.In addition, a post hoc assessment of genetic alterations was performed.Finally, we performed a meta-analysis of trials with chemotherapy with and without EGFR antibodies.RESULTS: Sixty-two patients were randomised in arm A and 28 patients in arm B. Patients received 7 treatment cycles in median (1-35) with a median treatment duration of 4.7 months (141 days, 8-765).PFS rate at 6 months was 54% in patients treated with cisplatin/gemcitabine and panitumumab but was 73% in patients treated with cisplatin/gemcitabine without antibody, respectively.Secondary end-points were an ORR of 45% in treatment arm A compared with 39% receiving treatment B and a median OS of 12.8 months (arm A) and of 20.1 months (arm B), respectively.In contrast to the p53-status, genetic alterations in IDH1/2 were linked to a high response after chemotherapy and prolonged survival.In accordance with our results, the meta-analysis of 12 trials did not reveal a survival advantage for patients treated with EGFR antibodies compared with chemotherapy alone.CONCLUSIONS: Panitumumab in combination with chemotherapy does not improve ORR, PFS and OS in patients with KRAS wild-type, advanced biliary cancer.Genetic profiling should be included in CCA trials to identify and validate predictive and prognostic biomarkers.CLINICAL TRIALS NUMBER: The trial was registered with NCT01320254.",1,1,1,1

Canadian Cancer Trials Group (CCTG) IND.219.INTRODUCTION: Activation of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway may confer resistance to chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Selumetinib (AZD6244, ARRY142886), a MEK1/2 inhibitor combined with chemotherapy in patients with NSCLC was evaluated in two schedules to evaluate efficacy and toxicity.METHODS: IND.219 was a three-arm study of first line pemetrexed/platinum chemotherapy with two schedules of selumetinib (Arm A: intermittent given on days 2-19; Arm B: continuous given on days 1-21) versus chemotherapy alone (Arm C).The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR); secondary objectives were tolerability, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS).The trial was stopped at the planned interim analysis.RESULTS: Arms A/B/C enrolled 20/21/21 patients, ORR was 35% (95% CI 15-59% median duration 3.8 months), 62% (95% CI 38-82%; median duration 6.3 months), 24% (95% CI 8-47%; median duration 11.6 months) respectively.The PFS (months Arm A, B, C) was 7.5, 6.7, 4.0 respectively (hazard ratio (HR) PFS Arm A over Arm C: 0.76 [95% CI, 0.38-1.51, 2-sided p = 0.42]; Arm B over Arm C 0.75 [95% CI 0.37-1.54, p = 0.43].Skin and gastrointestinal adverse events were more common with the addition of selumetinib.A high incidence of venous thromboembolism was seen in all arms.CONCLUSIONS: Selumetinib combined with chemotherapy was associated with a higher response rate.Continuous selumetinib appeared to be superior to an intermittent schedule.PFS was prolonged with the addition of selumetinib, however this was not statistically significant.",1,1,1,1
31591063,"Ramucirumab plus erlotinib in patients with untreated, EGFR-mutated, advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (RELAY): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Dual blockade of the EGFR and VEGF pathways in EGFR-mutated metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is supported by preclinical and clinical data, yet the approach is not widely implemented.RELAY assessed erlotinib, an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) standard of care, plus ramucirumab, a human IgG1 VEGFR2 antagonist, or placebo in patients with untreated EGFR-mutated metastatic NSCLC.METHODS: This is a worldwide, double-blind, phase 3 trial done in 100 hospitals, clinics, and medical centres in 13 countries.Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older (20 years or older in Japan and Taiwan) at the time of study entry, had stage IV NSCLC, with an EGFR exon 19 deletion (ex19del) or exon 21 substitution (Leu858Arg) mutation, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, and no CNS metastases.We randomly assigned eligible patients in a 1:1 ratio to receive oral erlotinib (150 mg/day) plus either intravenous ramucirumab (10 mg/kg) or matching placebo once every 2 weeks.Randomisation was done by an interactive web response system with a computer-generated sequence and stratified by sex, geographical region, EGFR mutation type, and EGFR testing method.The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population.Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment.This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02411448, and is ongoing for long-term survival follow-up.FINDINGS: Between Jan 28, 2016, and Feb 1, 2018, 449 eligible patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to treatment with ramucirumab plus erlotinib (n=224) or placebo plus erlotinib (n=225).Median duration of follow-up was 20.7 months (IQR 15.8-27.2).At the time of primary analysis, progression-free survival was significantly longer in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib group (19.4 months [95% CI 15.4-21.6]) than in the placebo plus erlotinib group (12.4 months [11.0-13.5]), with a stratified hazard ratio of 0.59 (95% CI 0.46-0.76; p<0.0001).Grade 3-4 treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 159 (72%) of 221 patients in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib group versus 121 (54%) of 225 in the placebo plus erlotinib group.The most common grade 3-4 treatment-emergent adverse events in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib group were hypertension (52 [24%]; grade 3 only) and dermatitis acneiform (33 [15%]), and in the placebo plus erlotinib group were dermatitis acneiform (20 [9%]) and increased alanine aminotransferase (17 [8%]).Treatment-emergent serious adverse events were reported in 65 (29%) of 221 patients in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib group and 47 (21%) of 225 in the placebo plus erlotinib group.The most common serious adverse events of any grade in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib group were pneumonia (seven [3%]) and cellulitis and pneumothorax (four [2%], each); the most common in the placebo plus erlotinib group were pyrexia (four [2%]) and pneumothorax (three [1%]).One on-study treatment-related death due to an adverse event occurred (haemothorax after a thoracic drainage procedure for a pleural empyema) in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib group.INTERPRETATION: Ramucirumab plus erlotinib demonstrated superior progression-free survival compared with placebo plus erlotinib in patients with untreated EGFR-mutated metastatic NSCLC.Safety was consistent with the safety profiles of the individual compounds in advanced lung cancer.The RELAY regimen is a viable new treatment option for the initial treatment of EGFR-mutated metastatic NSCLC.FUNDING: Eli Lilly.",1,1,1,1
27498129,"Toxicity of dual HER2-blockade with pertuzumab added to anthracycline versus non-anthracycline containing chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment in HER2-positive breast cancer: The TRAIN-2 study.BACKGROUND: The addition of pertuzumab to neoadjuvant trastuzumab-based chemotherapy improves pathologic complete response rates in HER2-positive breast cancer.However, increased toxicity has been reported with the addition of pertuzumab, and this may differ between various chemotherapy backbone regimens.We evaluated toxicities of pertuzumab when added to either FEC-T (5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide, trastuzumab) or weekly paclitaxel, trastuzumab, carboplatin (PTC).METHODS: The TRAIN-2 study is a neoadjuvant randomized controlled trial in stage II and III HER2-positive breast cancer (NCT01996267).Patients are randomly assigned to receive either three cycles of FEC-T plus pertuzumab or three cycles of PTC plus pertuzumab, followed by six cycles of PTC plus pertuzumab in both arms.Toxicities are described per treatment arm according to the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03.RESULTS: This analysis includes 110 patients balanced over both treatment arms.Neutropenia was the most common hematologic toxicity, with grade 3-4 occurring in 53% in the FEC-T-arm and in 51% in the PTC-arm.Febrile neutropenia occurred in 9% in the FEC-T arm and did not occur in the PTC-arm.Secondary G-CSF prophylaxis was used in 35-40% of patients.Asymptomatic ejection fraction decrease grade 2 was observed in 24% in the FEC-T-arm and 11% in the PTC-arm.The most common grade 3-4 non-hematologic toxicity was diarrhea (5% in the FEC-T-arm and 18% in the PTC-arm).CONCLUSIONS: Pertuzumab in combination with FEC-T mostly causes neutropenia, and when added to PTC mostly causes diarrhea.Significant cardiac toxicity is rare with both regimens, and toxicity is overall well manageable.",1,1,1,1

30523381,"Randomized phase II trial of the prophylactic use of celecoxib for the prevention of oxaliplatin-related peripheral vascular pain in Capeox (YCOG1205).PURPOSE: Capeox is widely used as an adjuvant chemotherapy regimen of colorectal cancer that does not require central vein catheter insertion.However, oxaliplatin-related vascular pain with peripheral administration is a major adverse event.We assessed the preventive effect of Celecoxib on oxaliplatin-related vascular pain.METHODS: A multicenter study of the Yokohama Clinical Oncology Group (YCOG) in Japan.This study was an open label, randomized non-comparative phase II study between Capeox without Celecoxib (C+ Group) and with it (C- group).The primary endpoint was the appearance frequency of grade >/= 2 vascular pain according to the Verbal Rating Scale (VRS).RESULTS: Between October 2012 and February 2014, 81 patients were recruited to this study and randomly divided into 2 groups: 38 patients in the C- group and 39 patients in the C+ group.Four cases were excluded at the analysis stage because they had not received the allocated intervention.The rate of grade >/= 2 vascular pain was 55.3% in the C- group and 53.8% in the C+ group (p = 1.000).CONCLUSIONS: Celecoxib was unable to prevent oxaliplatin-related vascular pain in this study.However, it may be able to decrease the vascular pain that patients already have.",0,0,0,0
30094545,"Randomized phase III trial to evaluate radiopharmaceuticals and zoledronic acid in the palliation of osteoblastic metastases from lung, breast, and prostate cancer: report of the NRG Oncology RTOG 0517 trial.BACKGROUND: Skeletal-related events (SREs), common sequelae of metastatic cancer, are reduced by bisphosphonates.In this study, it was postulated that radiopharmaceuticals, added to bisphosphonates, could further decrease the incidence of SREs.METHODS: NRG Oncology RTOG 0517 randomized patients with breast, lung, and prostate cancer and blastic bone metastases to either zoledronic acid (ZA) alone or ZA plus radiopharmaceuticals (Sr-89 or Sm-153).The primary endpoint was time to development of SREs.Secondary objectives included quality of life (QOL), pain control, overall survival (OS), and toxicity.RESULTS: 261 patients (median age 68; 62% male; 55% prostate, 35% breast, 10% lung) were accrued between July 2006 and February 2011.The study closed early due to a lower than expected rate of SREs.52 (42%) patients in the ZA arm and 49 (40%) in the radiopharmaceutical arm experienced an SRE.Median time free of SREs was 29.9 and 27.4 months, respectively (p = 0.84).Median OS in the ZA arm and radiopharmaceutical arms was 32.1 and 26.9 months, respectively (p = 0.37).Cox proportional hazards regression model showed that primary disease site (lung) and number of bone metastases (> 2) had a negative impact on OS (p < 0.0001, p = 0.01, respectively).The addition of radiopharmaceuticals to ZA led to a significant reduction in pain at 1 month based on BPI worst score (p = 0.02).No other group differences were noted for QOL or toxicity.CONCLUSION: The addition of radiopharmaceuticals to bisphosphonates did not alter time to SREs or OS for patients with breast, lung, prostate cancers and blastic bone metastases, although it was associated with significant pain reduction at 1 month.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRY: This protocol (RTOG 0517) is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00365105), and may be viewed online at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00365105?term=RTOG+0517&rank=1 .",1,1,1,0

31209667,"Influence of Molecular Status on Recurrence Site in Patients Treated for a Stage III Colon Cancer: a Post Hoc Analysis of the PETACC-8 Trial.BACKGROUND: Recurrence patterns in stage III colon cancer (CC) patients according to molecular markers remain unclear.The objective of the study was to assess recurrence patterns according to microsatellite instability (MSI), RAS and BRAF(V600E) status in stage III CC patients.METHODS: All stage III CC patients from the PETACC-8 randomized trial tested for MSI, RAS and BRAF(V600E) status were included.The site and characteristics of recurrence were analyzed according to molecular status.Survival after recurrence (SAR) was analyzed.RESULTS: A total of 1650 patients were included.Recurrence occurred in 434 patients (26.3%).Microsatellite stable (MSS) patients had a significantly higher recurrence rate (27.2% vs. 18.7%, P = 0.02) with a trend to more pulmonary recurrence (28.8% vs. 12.9%, P = 0.06) when compared to MSI patients.MSI patients experienced more regional lymph nodes compared to MSS (12.9% vs. 4%, P = 0.046).In the MSS population, the recurrence rate was significantly higher in RAS (32.2%) or BRAF (32.3%) patients when compared to double wild-type patients (19.9%) (p < 0.001); no preferential site of recurrence was observed according to RAS and BRAF(V600E) mutations.Finally, decreased SAR was observed in the case of peritoneal recurrence or more than two recurrence sites.CONCLUSIONS: Microsatellite, RAS and BRAF(V600E) status influences recurrence rates in stage III CC patients.However, only microsatellite status seems to be associated with specific recurrence patterns.More than two recurrence sites and recurrence in the peritoneum were associated with poorer SAR.",0,0,0,0
28352657,"Randomized, placebo-controlled window trial of EGFR, Src, or combined blockade in head and neck cancer.BACKGROUND.EGFR and Src family kinases are upregulated in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).EGFR interacts with Src to activate STAT3 signaling, and dual EGFR-Src targeting is synergistic in HNSCC preclinical models.pSrc overexpression predicted resistance to the EGFR inhibitor, erlotinib, in a prior window trial.We conducted a 4-arm window trial to identify biomarkers associated with response to EGFR and/or Src inhibition.METHODS.Patients with operable stage II-IVa HNSCC were randomized to 7-21 days of neoadjuvant erlotinib, the Src inhibitor dasatinib, the combination of both, or placebo.Paired tumor specimens were collected before and after treatment.Pharmacodynamic expression of EGFR and Src pathway components was evaluated by IHC of tissue microarrays and reverse-phase protein array of tissue lysates.Candidate biomarkers were assessed for correlation with change in tumor size.RESULTS.From April 2009 to December 2012, 58 patients were randomized and 55 were treated.There was a significant decrease in tumor size in both erlotinib arms (P = 0.0014); however, no effect was seen with dasatinib alone (P = 0.24).High baseline pMAPK expression was associated with response to erlotinib (P = 0.03).High baseline pSTAT3 was associated with resistance to dasatinib (P = 0.099).CONCLUSIONS.Brief exposure to erlotinib significantly decreased tumor size in operable HNSCC, with no additive effect from dasatinib.Baseline pMAPK expression warrants further study as a response biomarker for anti-EGFR therapy.Basal expression of pSTAT3 may be independent of Src, explain therapeutic resistance, and preclude development of dasatinib in biomarker-unselected cohorts.TRIAL REGISTRATION.NCT00779389.FUNDING.National Cancer Institute, American Cancer Society, Pennsylvania Department of Health, V Foundation for Cancer Research, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Astellas Pharma.",1,1,1,1
24338990,"Risk factors for clinician-reported symptom clusters in patients with advanced head and neck cancer in a phase 3 randomized clinical trial: RTOG 0129.BACKGROUND: Chemoradiotherapy has become the standard of care for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma; however, those patients often experience multiple treatment-related symptoms or symptom clusters.Two symptom clusters have been identified for this population.Little is known about the risk factors of these symptom clusters.METHODS: Subjects comprised 684 patients who were treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy in a phase 3 randomized clinical trial.This trial compared standard fractionation radiotherapy to accelerated fractionation radiotherapy.Symptom clusters were evaluated at the end of the first and the second cycle of chemotherapy, and 3 months after the start of radiotherapy.Mixed-effect modeling was used to observe risk factors for symptom clusters.RESULTS: Race and education were independent predictors for the head and neck cluster, whereas sex and history of tobacco use were independent predictors for the gastrointestinal cluster.Primary cancer site was only significant for the head and neck cluster when other factors were not controlled: patients with oropharyngeal cancer had more severe symptoms in the head and neck clusters than did patients with laryngeal cancer.In addition, patients receiving accelerated fractionation radiotherapy experienced more symptoms of radiomucositis, pain, and nausea at 3 months after the start of radiotherapy than those receiving standard fractionation radiotherapy.CONCLUSIONS: Demographic characteristics were more predictive to symptom clusters, whereas clinical characteristics, such as cancer site and treatment arms, were more significant for individual symptoms.Knowing the risk factors will enhance the capability of clinicians to evaluate patients' risk of severe symptom clusters and to personalize management strategies.",0,0,0,0

25712685,"Rilotumumab exposure-response relationship in patients with advanced or metastatic gastric cancer.PURPOSE: Rilotumumab is an investigational, fully human monoclonal antibody to hepatocyte growth factor.In a randomized phase II study, trends toward improved survival were observed with rilotumumab (7.5 or 15 mg/kg) plus epirubicin, cisplatin, and capecitabine (ECX) versus placebo plus ECX in gastric/gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer patients, especially in MET-positive patients.Here, we quantitatively characterized the longitudinal exposure-response [tumor growth (TG) and overall survival (OS)] relationship for rilotumumab.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Rilotumumab concentrations, tumor sizes, and survival time from the phase II study were pooled to develop a longitudinal exposure versus TG model and parametric OS model that explored predictive/prognostic/treatment effects (MET expression, rilotumumab exposure, relative tumor size).Model evaluation included visual predictive checks, nonparametric bootstrap, and normalized prediction distribution errors.Simulations were undertaken to predict the relationship between rilotumumab dose and OS.RESULTS: Rilotumumab exhibited linear time-independent pharmacokinetics not affected by MET expression.The TG model adequately described tumor size across arms.A Weibull distribution best described OS.Rilotumumab exposure and change in tumor size from baseline at week 24 were predictive of OS.MET-positive patients showed shorter survival and responded better to rilotumumab than MET-negative patients.Simulations predicted a median (95% confidence interval) HR of 0.38 (0.18-0.60) in MET-positive patients treated with 15 mg/kg rilotumumab Q3W.CONCLUSIONS: Rilotumumab plus ECX demonstrated concentration-dependent effects on OS, influenced by MET expression, and tumor size in gastric/GEJ cancer patients.These findings support the phase II testing of rilotumumab 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks in MET-positive gastric/GEJ cancer (RILOMET-1; NCT01697072).",0,0,0,0
26724840,"Role of Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Prostate Cancer Screening: A Pilot Study Within the Goteborg Randomised Screening Trial.BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and targeted biopsies (TB) have shown potential to more accurately detect significant prostate cancer compared with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and systematic biopsies (SB).OBJECTIVE: To compare sequential screening (PSA+MRI) with conventional PSA screening.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Of 384 attendees in the 10th screening round of the Goteborg randomised screening trial, 124 men, median age 69.5 yr, had a PSA of >/= 1.8 ng/ml and underwent a prebiopsy MRI.Men with suspicious lesions on MRI and/or PSA >/= 3.0ng/ml were referred for biopsy.SB was performed blinded to MRI results and TB was performed in men with tumour-suspicious findings on MRI.Three screening strategies were compared (PSA >/= 3.0+SB; PSA >/= 3.0+MRI+TB and PSA >/= 1.8+MRI+TB).OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Cancer detection rates, sensitivity, and specificity were calculated per screening strategy and compared using McNemar's test.RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: In total, 28 cases of prostate cancer were detected, of which 20 were diagnosed in biopsy-naive men.Both PSA >/= 3.0+MRI and PSA >/= 1.8+MRI significantly increased specificity compared with PSA >/= 3.0+SB (0.92 and 0.79 vs 0.52; p<0.002 for both), while sensitivity was significantly higher for PSA >/= 1.8+MRI compared with PSA >/= 3.0+MRI (0.73 vs 0.46, p=0.008).The detection rate of significant cancer was higher with PSA >/= 1.8+MRI compared with PSA >/= 3.0+SB (5.9% vs 4.0%), while the detection rate of insignificant cancer was lowered by PSA >/= 3.0+MRI (0.3% vs 1.2%).The primary limitation of this study is the small sample of men.CONCLUSION: A screening strategy with a lowered PSA cut-off followed by TB in MRI-positive men seems to increase the detection of significant cancers while improving specificity.If replicated, these results may contribute to a paradigm shift in future screening.PATIENT SUMMARY: Major concerns in prostate-specific antigen screening are overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis.We evaluated whether prostate magnetic resonance imaging could improve the balance of benefits to harm in prostate cancer screening screening, and we found a promising potential of using magnetic resonance imaging in addition to prostate-specific antigen.",0,0,0,0

31400480,"Effect of a high-intensity interval training on serum microRNA levels in women with breast cancer undergoing hormone therapy. A single-blind randomized trial.BACKGROUND: The role of microRNAs (miRs) in hormone therapy (HT) is of keen interest in developing biomarkers and treatments for individuals with breast cancer.Although miRs are often moderate regulators under homeostatic conditions, their function is changed more in response to physical activity.OBJECTIVE: This single-blind randomized trial aimed to explore the effect of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on serum levels of miRs in individuals with early-stage breast cancer undergoing HT.METHODS: Hormone receptor-positive women with breast cancer and healthy women were randomly assigned to a healthy control group (n=15), healthy group with HIIT (n=15), breast cancer group with HT (HT, n=26), and breast cancer group with HT and HIIT (HT+HIIT, n=26).The exercise groups underwent interval uphill walking training on a treadmill 3 times a week for 12weeks.At the end of the study, we analyzed changes in levels of cancer-related miRs (oncomiRs) and tumour suppressor miRs (TSmiRs) in response to the HT and HIIT.RESULTS: In women with breast cancer versus healthy controls, the expression of some oncomiRs was significantly increased - miR-21 (P<0.001), miR-155 (P=0.001), miR-221 (P=0.008), miR-27a (P<0.001), and miR-10b (P=0.007) - and that of some TSmiRs was significantly decreased - miR-206 (P=0.048), miR-145 (P=0.011), miR-143 (P=0.008), miR-9 (P=0.020), and let-7a (P=0.005).Moreover, HT considerably downregulated oncomiRs and upregulated TSmiRs.HIIT for 12weeks with HT significantly decreased the expression of the oncomiRs and significantly increased that of the TSmiRs as compared with HT alone.CONCLUSIONS: HITT could amplify the decrease and/or increase in expression of miRs associated with HT in women with breast cancer.A prospective trial could determine whether the use of circulating miRs for monitoring treatment can be useful in therapy decisions.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (No.: IRCT201202289171N1).",1,1,0,0
24323034,"Targeted androgen pathway suppression in localized prostate cancer: a pilot study.PURPOSE: Ligand-mediated activation of the androgen receptor (AR) is critical for prostate cancer (PCa) survival and proliferation.The failure to completely ablate tissue androgens may limit suppression of PCa growth.We evaluated combinations of CYP17A and 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors for reducing prostate androgen levels, AR signaling, and PCa volumes.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-five men with intermediate/high-risk clinically localized PCa were randomly assigned to goserelin combined with dutasteride (ZD), bicalutamide and dutasteride (ZBD), or bicalutamide, dutasteride, and ketoconazole (ZBDK) for 3 months before prostatectomy.Controls included patients receiving combined androgen blockade with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist and bicalutamide.The primary outcome measure was tissue dihydrotestosterone (DHT) concentration.RESULTS: Prostate DHT levels were substantially lower in all experimental arms (0.02 to 0.04 ng/g v 0.92 ng/g in controls; P < .001).The ZBDK group demonstrated the greatest percentage decline in serum testosterone, androsterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (P < .05 for all).Staining for AR and the androgen-regulated genes prostate-specific antigen and TMPRSS2 was strongly suppressed in benign glands and moderately in malignant glands (P < .05 for all).Two patients had pathologic complete response, and nine had </= 0.2 cm(3) of residual tumor (defined as a near-complete response), with the largest numbers of complete and near-complete responses in the ZBDK group.CONCLUSION: Addition of androgen synthesis inhibitors lowers prostate androgens below that achieved with standard therapy, but significant AR signaling remains.Tissue-based analysis of steroids and AR signaling is critical to informing the search for optimal local and systemic control of high-risk prostate cancer.",1,1,1,1
23053638,"A randomized phase II trial of platinum salts in basal-like breast cancer patients in the neoadjuvant setting. Results from the GEICAM/2006-03, multicenter study.Chemotherapy remains as the only systemic treatment option available for basal-like breast cancer (BC) patients.Preclinical models and several phase II studies suggested that platinum salts are active drugs in this BC subtype though there is no randomized study supporting this hypothesis.This study investigates if the addition of carboplatin to a combination of an alkylating agent together with anthracyclines and taxanes is able to increase the efficacy in the neoadjuvant treatment context.Patients with operable breast cancer and immunophenotypically defined basal-like disease (ER-/PR-/HER2- and cytokeratin 5/6+ or EGFR+) were recruited.Patients were randomized to receive EC (epirubicin 90 mg/m(2) plus cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2) for 4 cycles) followed either by D (docetaxel 100 mg/m(2) x 4 cycles; EC-D) or DCb (docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) plus carboplatin AUC 6 x 4 cycles; EC-DCb).The primary end point was pathological complete response (pCR) in the breast following the Miller and Payne criteria.Ninety-four patients were randomized (46 EC-D, 48 EC-DCb).pCR rate in the breast was seen in 16 patients (35 %) with EC-D and 14 patients (30 %) with EC-DCb (P value = 0.61).pCR in the breast and axilla was seen in 30 % of patients in both arms.The overall clinical response rate was 70 % (95 % CI 56-83) in the EC-D arm and 77 % (95 % CI 65-87) in the EC-DCb arm.Grade 3/4 toxicity was similar in both arms.The addition of carboplatin to conventional chemotherapy with EC-D in basal-like breast cancer patients did not improve the efficacy probably because they had already received an alkylating agent.These findings should be taken into consideration when developing new agents for this disease.",1,1,1,1
26364885,"The influence of gastric filling instructions on dose delivery in patients with oesophageal cancer: A prospective study.PURPOSE: To evaluate whether adaptive radiotherapy for unaccounted stomach changes in patients with adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) is necessary and whether dose differences could be prevented by giving patients food and fluid instructions before treatment simulation and radiotherapy.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty patients were randomly assigned into two groups: patients with and without instructions about restricting food and fluid intake prior to radiotherapy simulation and treatment.Redelineation and offline recalculation of dose distributions based on cone-beam computed tomography (n=100) were performed.Dose-volume parameters were analysed for the clinical target volume extending into the stomach.RESULTS: Four patients who did not receive instructions had a geometric miss (0.7-12 cm(3)) in only one fraction.With instructions, 3 out of 10 patients had a geometric miss (0.1-1.9 cm(3)) in one (n=2) or two (n=1) fractions.The V95% was reduced by more than 5% for one patient, but this underdosage was in an in-air region without further clinical importance.CONCLUSIONS: Giving patients food and fluid instructions for the treatment of GEJ cancer offers no clinical benefit.Using a planning target volume margin of 1cm implies that there is no need for adaptive radiotherapy for GEJ tumours.",0,0,0,0
28209746,"A Phase II Randomized Trial (GO27827) of First-Line FOLFOX Plus Bevacizumab with or Without the MET Inhibitor Onartuzumab in Patients with Metastatic Colorectal Cancer.BACKGROUND: Dysregulated hepatocyte growth factor/mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) signaling is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to vascular endothelial growth factor inhibition in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).We report outcomes from a double-blind, multicenter phase II trial of the MET inhibitor onartuzumab in combination with mFOLFOX-6 and bevacizumab for mCRC (GO27827; NCT01418222).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive onartuzumab (10 mg/kg intravenously [IV]) or placebo plus mFOLFOX-6 and bevacizumab (5 mg/kg IV).Oxaliplatin was given for 8-12 cycles; other agents were continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or death.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) in the intent-to-treat (ITT) and MET immunohistochemistry (IHC) expression-positive populations.RESULTS: Between September 2011 and November 2012, 194 patients were enrolled.In September 2013, an interim analysis recommended stopping onartuzumab treatment due to lack of efficacy.At the time of the final analysis in February 2014, no significant improvement in PFS was seen with onartuzumab versus placebo in either the ITT or MET IHC-positive populations.An improvement in PFS was noted in the MET IHC-negative population.Neither overall survival nor response rate was improved with onartuzumab.The incidence of fatigue, peripheral edema, and deep vein thrombosis was increased with onartuzumab relative to placebo.CONCLUSION: Onartuzumab combined with mFOLFOX-6 and bevacizumab did not significantly improve efficacy outcomes in either the ITT or MET IHC-positive populations.MET expression by IHC was not a predictive biomarker in this setting.The Oncologist 2017;22:264-271 IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The addition of onartuzumab to mFOLFOX-6 plus bevacizumab did not improve outcomes in patients with previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer in this randomized, phase II study.Although initial results with onartuzumab were promising, a number of phase II/III clinical trials have reported a lack of improvement in efficacy with onartuzumab combined with standard-of-care therapies in several tumor types.Furthermore, negative study data have been published for rilotumumab and ficlatuzumab, both of which block hepatocyte growth factor binding to the mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) receptor.MET immunohistochemistry was not a predictive biomarker.It remains to be seen if other biomarkers or small molecule inhibitors may be more appropriate for inhibiting this oncogenic pathway.",1,1,1,1
30860948,"Effect of Chemotherapy With Docetaxel With Androgen Suppression and Radiotherapy for Localized High-Risk Prostate Cancer: The Randomized Phase III NRG Oncology RTOG 0521 Trial.PURPOSE: Radiotherapy (RT) plus long-term androgen suppression (AS) are a standard treatment option for patients with high-risk localized prostate cancer.We hypothesized that docetaxel chemotherapy (CT) could improve overall survival (OS) and clinical outcomes among patients with high-risk prostate cancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The multicenter randomized NRG Oncology RTOG 0521 study enrolled patients with high-risk nonmetastatic disease between 2005 and 2009.Patients were randomly assigned to receive standard long-term AS plus RT with or without adjuvant CT.RESULTS: A total of 612 patients were enrolled; 563 were evaluable.Median prostate-specific antigen was 15.1 ng/mL; 53% had a Gleason score 9 to 10 cancer; 27% had cT3 to cT4 disease.Median follow-up was 5.7 years.Treatment was well tolerated in both arms.Four-year OS rate was 89% (95% CI, 84% to 92%) for AS + RT and 93% (95% CI, 90% to 96%) for AS + RT + CT (hazard ratio [HR], 0.69; 90% CI, 0.49 to 0.97; one-sided P = .034).There were 59 deaths in the AS + RT arm and 43 in the AS + RT + CT arm, with fewer deaths resulting from prostate cancer in the AS + RT + CT arm versus AS + RT (23 v 16 deaths, respectively).Six-year rate of distant metastasis was 14% for AS + RT and 9.1% for AS + RT + CT, (HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.99; two-sided P = .044).Six-year disease-free survival rate was 55% for AS + RT and 65% for AS + RT + CT (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.99; two-sided P = .043).CONCLUSION: For patients with high-risk nonmetastatic prostate cancer, CT with docetaxel improved OS from 89% to 93% at 4 years, with improved disease-free survival and reduction in the rate of distant metastasis.The trial suggests that docetaxel CT may be an option to be discussed with selected men with high-risk prostate cancer.",1,1,1,1
25207898,"Treatment of mid-late stage NSCLC using sodium cantharidinate/vitamin B6/GP regimen in clinic.OBJECTIVE: The present study observed the clinical outcomes of the sodium cantharidinate/vitamin B6/GP regimen in the treatment of middle-late stage Non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-six cases of NSCLC were selected and randomized into two groups.Forty-five cases in the treatment group were subject to 30 ml cantharidinate/vitamin B6+ GP regimen, for four 21-day cycles.Forty-one cases in the control group were subject to regular GP regimen, for four 21-day cycles.RESULTS: The effectiveness rate was 57.8% in the treatment group and 36.6% in the control group, suggesting statistical difference (P < 0.05); life quality in the treatment group was significantly better than that in the control group (P < 0.05); the occurrence rate of the toxic/adverse effects were significantly lower in the treatment group compared with that in the control group (P < 0.05).CONCLUSION: Sodium cantharidinate/vitamin B6/GP regimen had fair effectiveness and synergistically improved the clinical outcomes.It lowered the toxic/adverse effects and its application is worth further investigation and promotion.",0,0,0,0
29648580,"Bevacizumab plus hypofractionated radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone in elderly patients with glioblastoma: the randomized, open-label, phase II ARTE trial.Background: The addition of bevacizumab to temozolomide-based chemoradiotherapy (TMZ/RT --> TMZ) did not prolong overall survival (OS) in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma in phase III trials.Elderly and frail patients are underrepresented in clinical trials, but early reports suggested preferential benefit in this population.Patients and methods: ARTE was a 2 : 1 randomized, multi-center, open-label, non-comparative phase II trial of hypofractionated RT (40 Gy in 15 fractions) with bevacizumab (10 mg/kgx14 days) (arm A, N = 50) or without bevacizumab (arm B, N = 25) in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma aged >/=65 years.The primary objective was to obtain evidence for prolongation of median OS by the addition of bevacizumab to RT.Response was assessed by RANO criteria.Quality of life (QoL) was monitored by the EORTC QLQ-C30/BN20 modules.Exploratory studies included molecular subtyping by 450k whole methylome and gene expression analyses.Results: Median PFS was longer in arm A than in arm B (7.6 and 4.8 months, P = 0.003), but OS was similar (12.1 and 12.2 months, P = 0.77).Clinical deterioration was delayed and more patients came off steroids in arm A. Prolonged PFS in arm A was confined to tumors with the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) I methylation subtype (HR 0.25, P = 0.014) and proneural gene expression (HR 0.29, P = 0.025).In a Cox model of OS controlling for established prognostic factors, associations with more favorable outcome were identified for age <70 years (HR 0.52, P = 0.018) and Karnofsky performance score 90%-100% (HR 0.51, P = 0.026).Including molecular subtypes into that model identified an association of the RTK II gene methylation subtype with inferior OS (HR 1.73, P = 0.076).Conclusion: Efficacy outcomes and exploratory analyses of ARTE do not support the hypothesis that the addition of bevacizumab to RT generally prolongs survival in elderly glioblastoma patients.Molecular biomarkers may identify patients with preferential benefit from bevacizumab.Clinical trial registration number: NCT01443676.",1,1,1,1
31389383,"A prospective, randomized study to compare the combination of imatinib and cytarabine versus imatinib alone in newly diagnosed patients with chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia.INTRODUCTION: To compare the efficacy and safety of imatinib and cytarabine (ara-c) combination versus imatinib monotherapy in newly diagnosed patients with chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML-CP).MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective, randomized study included adult patients (age >18 years) with newly diagnosed CML-CP.Patients received either a single oral dose of imatinib 400 mg/day in combination with a subcutaneous injection of ara-c 20 mg/m(2)/day (imatinib + ara-c) or a single oral dose of imatinib 400 mg/day.Primary endpoints were hematological and molecular responses at 3 months and cytogenetic responses at 6 and 12 months.Secondary endpoints included grade 3/4 hematological and nonhematological adverse events (AEs).RESULTS: Of 30 patients included, 14 were randomized to imatinib + ara-c and 16 to imatinib alone.Complete hematologic response (CHR) at 3 months was higher with imatinib + ara-c vs. imatinib alone (100% vs. 87.5%, P = 0.48).The median time to achieve CHR was significantly (P < 0.001) lower with imatinib + ara-c (32.07 vs. 23.43 days).Molecular response at 3 months was significantly higher (P = 0.04) with imatinib + ara-c vs.imatinib alone (100% vs. 68.75%).Complete cytogenetic response was also higher with imatinib + ara-c vs. imatinib alone (42.85% vs. 25% at 6 months and 71.4% vs. 62.5% at 12 months).Neutropenia followed by thrombocytopenia and anemia were the most common AEs.Grade 3/4 hematological and nausea events were significantly (P < 0.05) higher with imatinib + ara-c.Other nonhematological events were not significantly different between the treatments.The median follow-up duration was 20 months (range: 15-23 months).CONCLUSION: Imatinib with low-dose ara-c can be considered as a potential first-line treatment option for CML-CP.",1,1,1,0
28188670,"A randomized phase II trial of personalized peptide vaccine with low dose cyclophosphamide in biliary tract cancer.Since the prognosis of advanced biliary tract cancer (aBTC) still remains very poor, new therapeutic approaches, including immunotherapies, need to be developed.In the current study, we conducted an open-label randomized phase II study to test whether low dose cyclophosphamide (CPA) could improve antigen-specific immune responses and clinical efficacy of personalized peptide vaccination (PPV) in 49 previously treated aBTC patients.Patients with aBTC refractory to at least one regimen of chemotherapies were randomly assigned to receive PPV with low dose CPA (100 mg/day for 7 days before vaccination) (PPV/CPA, n = 24) or PPV alone (n = 25).A maximum of four HLA-matched peptides were selected based on the pre-existing peptide-specific IgG responses, followed by subcutaneous administration.T cell responses to the vaccinated peptides in the PPV/CPA arm tended to be greater than those in the PPV alone arm.The PPV/CPA arm showed significantly better progression-free survival (median time: 6.1 vs 2.9 months; hazard ratio (HR): 0.427; P = 0.008) and overall survival (median time: 12.1 vs 5.9 months; HR: 0.376; P = 0.004), compared to the PPV alone arm.The PPV alone arm, but not the PPV/CPA arm, showed significant increase in plasma IL-6 after vaccinations, which might be associated with inhibition of antigen-specific T cell responses.These results suggested that combined treatment with low dose CPA could provide clinical benefits in aBTC patients under PPV, possibly through prevention of IL-6-mediated immune suppression.Further clinical studies would be recommended to clarify the clinical efficacy of PPV/CPA in aBTC patients.",1,1,1,1
29891726,"The Efficacy of Direct Mail, Patient Navigation, and Incentives for Increasing Mammography and Colonoscopy in the Medicaid Population: A Randomized Controlled Trial.Background: Despite lower cancer screening rates and survival rates in the Medicaid population compared with those with private insurance, there is a dearth of population-based, evidence-based interventions targeting Medicaid clients to address this problem.Methods: This study reports results of a population-based randomized controlled trial (RCT) among all individuals enrolled in Minnesota's Medicaid program who were overdue for breast cancer (n = 22,113) and/or colorectal cancer (n = 94,294) screening.Individuals were randomized to intervention or control groups.The intervention group received persuasive and innovative direct mail materials coupled with a $20 incentive for using their Medicaid benefit to get screened.Direct mail materials provided a phone number to a call center staffed by patient navigators who addressed barriers and scheduled appointments via three-way calls.The control group received the intervention 15 months later.Primary outcomes were completion of mammography or colonoscopy within 12 weeks of the intervention.Billing claims served as evidence of screening.Results: Multivariate logistic regression showed significant differences for both breast cancer (P < 0.001) and colorectal cancer (P < 0.01).The odds of receiving a mammogram for the treatment group were significantly higher than the control group [OR = 1.30; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 1.16-1.46], and the treatment group was more likely to receive a colonoscopy than the control group (OR = 1.12; 95% CI = 1.04-1.21).Conclusions: This population-based intervention increased breast cancer and colorectal cancer screening in a Medicaid population overdue for screening.Impact: These findings may have broad application for reaching individuals who generally remain outside the health care system despite having public health insurance.Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 27(9); 1047-56.(c)2018 AACR.",0,0,0,0
25808375,"Immunoprofiling for prognostic assessment of colon cancer: a novel complement to ultrastaging.BACKGROUND: Although AJCC/TNM staging remains the gold standard for prognostic assessment of colon cancer, stage-specific outcomes vary.We therefore prospectively evaluated the prognostic role of immunoprofiling.METHODS: Our cohort included 35 patients from an ongoing prospective trial of ultrastaging for colon cancer.Specimens were analyzed for T cell markers (CD3, CD4, CD8, and FoxP3).The number of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes was analyzed at the tumor's margin and center and correlated with AJCC/TNM stage, clinicopathologic variables, and disease-free survival.RESULTS: There was a significant inverse association between number of CD3(+) cells in the tumor center and tumor stage (P = 0.05).The tumor center/margin ratio of CD3(+) cells also showed an inverse but non-significant relationship with nodal involvement (P = 0.07).Body mass index was inversely associated with numbers of CD3(+)(P = 0.04) and CD8(+)(P = 0.02) cells.Longer disease-free survival was correlated with higher CD8+ counts (P = 0.07), lower CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratios (P = 0.008), and higher CD8(+)/FoxP3(+) ratios (P = 0.02).CONCLUSIONS: This is the first prospective validation of immunoprofiling in patients whose colon cancer is staged with strict surgical and pathology quality measures.The apparent correlation between immunophenotypic response and clinical outcome warrants evaluation in a larger prospective trial.",0,0,0,0
23494582,"Transient swelling versus lymphoedema in the first year following surgery for breast cancer.PURPOSE: The aim was to better understand the incidence, time course and risk factors for swelling in the arm on the side of surgery over the first year following surgery for breast cancer.METHOD: Women (n = 160) were assessed 1 month following surgery and then randomised to the exercise or control group.Reassessment occurred 3, 9 and 15 months following surgery.Potential risk factors for swelling included age, body mass index, side of surgery and surgical and medical treatments for their breast cancer, physical measures of shoulder range of motion and strength, inter-limb arm circumference difference and the group to which they were randomised.Swelling was determined using bioimpedance spectroscopy with reference to previously established cut-offs for lymphoedema.RESULTS: The number of women with swelling at 3, 9 and 15 months was 15, 15 and 13, respectively; however, at 15 months only 5/13 presented with swelling in either of the preceding assessments.The risk of swelling increased at 3, 9 and 15 months for each centimetre increase in the baseline inter-limb difference in sum of arm circumferences by 1.30, 1.17 and 1.14.In addition, risk of swelling at 3 months was 2.6 times greater for women in the control group; at 9 months, 7 times greater for women who had taxane-based chemotherapy; and at 15 months, the risk increased 1.16 times for each day the drain was in situ.CONCLUSION: Swelling in the first year is likely to be transient, and factors including exercise and taxane chemotherapy affect the risk of developing swelling.",0,0,0,0
23234763,"Adjuvant lapatinib for women with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer: a randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Worldwide, many patients with HER2-positive early stage breast cancer do not receive trastuzumab-the standard adjuvant treatment.We investigated the efficacy and safety of adjuvant lapatinib for patients with trastuzumab-naive HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer, started at any time after diagnosis.METHODS: This study was a placebo-controlled, multicentre, randomised phase 3 trial.Women outpatients from 405 [corrected] centres in 33 countries [corrected] with HER2-positive early-breast cancer who had previously received adjuvant chemotherapy but not trastuzumab were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive daily lapatinib (1500 mg) or daily placebo for 12 months.Randomisation was done with a computer-generated sequence, stratified by time since diagnosis, lymph node involvement at diagnosis, and tumour hormone-receptor status.Investigators, site staff, and patients were masked to treatment assignment.The primary endpoint was disease-free survival in the intention-to-treat population.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00374322.FINDINGS: Between August, 2006, and May, 2008, 3161 women were enrolled and 3147 were assigned to lapatinib (n=1571) or placebo (n=1576).After a median follow-up of 47.4 months (range 0.4-60.0) in the lapatinib group and 48.3 (0.7-61.3) in the placebo group, 210 (13%) disease-free survival events had occurred in the lapatinib group versus 264 (17%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.83, 95% CI 0.70-1.00; p=0.053).Central review of HER2 status showed that only 2490 (79%) of the randomised women were HER2-positive.157 (13%) of 1230 confirmed HER2-positive patients in the lapatinib group and in 208 (17%) of 1260 in the placebo group had a disease-free survival event (HR 0.82, 95% 0.67-1.00; p=0.04).Serious adverse events occurred in 99 (6%) of 1573 patients taking lapatinib and 77 (5%) of 1574 patients taking placebo, with higher incidences of grade 3-4 diarrhoea (97 [6%] vs nine [<1%]), rash (72 [5%] vs three [<1%]), and hepatobiliary disorders (36 [2%] vs one [<1%]).INTERPRETATION: Our data show that there was no significant difference in disease-free survival between groups when analysed in the intention-to-treat population.However, exploratory analyses restricted to patients who had HER2-positive disease confirmed by central fluorescence in-situ hybridisation review suggested marginal benefit with lapatinib in terms of disease-free survival.Thus lapatinib might be an option for women with HER2-positive breast cancer who do not or cannot receive adjuvant trastuzumab.FUNDING: GlaxoSmithKline.",1,1,1,1
28128748,"Comparison of fine needle aspiration and non-aspiration cytology for diagnosis of thyroid nodules: A prospective, randomized, and controlled trial.OBJECTIVES: To compare the sampling efficiency and diagnostic performance of ultrasound (US)-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) and fine-needle non-aspiration cytology (FNNAC) for thyroid nodules.MATERIALS AND METHODS: 629 thyroid nodules in 629 cases (477 females, 152 males) were randomly subjected to FNAC or FNNAC from Jun 2014 to Feb 2015.Diagnostic performance was calculated in reference to the histological findings or follow-up results.RESULTS: 629 patients (152 men, 477 women) with 629 thyroid nodules were enrolled in the study.Pathological results were obtained in 173 nodules and benign nodules at FNA with more than six months' follow-up were found in 65 nodules.Tumor size for FNAC ranges from 3.0 to 51.0 mm (mean+/-SD; 10.2+/-6.9 mm); whereas FNNAC (2.0-43.0 mm; 11.9+/-7.7 mm).Non-diagnostic results were found in 7.59% (24/316) of FNNAC procedures and 7.59% (25/313) of FNAC (P > 0.05).Determinate and indeterminate results were found in 50.63% (160/316) and 41.77% (132/316) of FNNAC procedures, whereas 58.15% (182/313) and 33.87% (106/313) of FNAC (P < 0.05).In order to obtain determinate cytological results, FNAC might be more suitable than FNNAC for diagnosis of nodules with hypovascularity (51.38% vs. 41.78%, P < 0.05) and macrocalcifications (9.72% vs. 6.50%, P < 0.05).No US and Color-Doppler US characteristics, such as the presence of hypervascularity (P > 0.05), microcalcifications (P > 0.05), internal component (P > 0.05), or size(P > 0.05), were significantly different to obtain determinate cytological results between the FNAC and FNNAC groups.The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, accuracy of FNAC and FNNAC were as follows: 96.67% vs. 100%, 89.74% vs. 96.5%, 87.88% vs. 96.97%, 97.22% vs. 100%, 92.75% vs.98.36%, respectively (all P > 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Both FNAC and FNNAC are effective for diagnosis of thyroid nodules.However, FNAC is more effective than FNNAC to acquire determinate cytological results for nodules which US present hypovascularity and macrocalcifications.",0,0,0,0

25018037,"Impact of baseline corticosteroids on survival and steroid androgens in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: exploratory analysis from COU-AA-301.BACKGROUND: Corticosteroids have been used to mitigate mineralocorticoid-related effects and restore sensitivity to abiraterone acetate.Corticosteroids may also mediate glucocorticoid receptor or mutated androgen receptor activation and adversely influence outcome.OBJECTIVE: This post hoc exploratory analysis investigated whether baseline corticosteroids were an independent prognostic factor and its level of contribution in the presence of other prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) in study COU-AA-301.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: COU-AA-301 was a randomised study of abiraterone plus prednisone versus prednisone in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients after docetaxel.INTERVENTION: Patients were randomised 2:1 to abiraterone 1000 mg plus prednisone 5mg by mouth twice daily versus prednisone.OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Association of OS with baseline corticosteroids was determined by univariate and multivariate Cox models.RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: At study entry, 33% of patients received corticosteroids, had worse disease characteristics (p<0.05 except liver metastases), and were more likely to have testosterone levels below the median (odds ratio:2.92; chi-square p<0.0001).Associations between prostate-specific antigen response as well as circulating tumour cell decline and higher baseline androgen levels were demonstrated.Patients taking baseline corticosteroids had inferior OS in univariate analysis (hazard ratio: 1.48; p<0.0001); however, in multivariate stepwise selection modelling, baseline corticosteroids did not add substantially to the model.This analysis is limited as a retrospective analysis and restricted to patients after docetaxel.CONCLUSIONS: In the COU-AA-301 study, baseline corticosteroids were associated with adverse prognostic features, inferior OS, and lower baseline androgen levels but did not add substantial information to the final prognostic model.Thus in these data from study COU-AA-301, concurrent baseline corticosteroids did not have an independent impact on OS.PATIENT SUMMARY: Baseline corticosteroids did not adversely affect abiraterone clinical benefit in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.Their use was associated with patients having worse disease characteristics.",1,1,1,1
26822398,"Afatinib plus vinorelbine versus trastuzumab plus vinorelbine in patients with HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer who had progressed on one previous trastuzumab treatment (LUX-Breast 1): an open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Trastuzumab resistance is a key therapeutic challenge in metastatic breast cancer.We postulated that broader inhibition of ErbB receptors with afatinib would improve clinical outcomes compared with HER2 inhibition alone in patients who had progressed on previous trastuzumab treatment.LUX-Breast 1 compared afatinib plus vinorelbine with trastuzumab plus vinorelbine for such patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.METHODS: We did this open-label trial at 350 hospitals in 41 countries worldwide.We enrolled female patients with HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer who had progressed on or following adjuvant trastuzumab or first-line treatment of metastatic disease with trastuzumab.Participants were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive oral afatinib (40 mg/day) plus intravenous vinorelbine (25 mg/m(2) per week) or intravenous trastuzumab (2 mg/kg per week after 4 mg/kg loading dose) plus vinorelbine.Randomisation was done centrally and stratified by previous trastuzumab treatment (adjuvant vs first-line treatment), hormone receptor status (oestrogen receptor and progesterone receptor positive vs others), and region.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, assessed in the intention-to-treat population.This trial is closed to enrolment and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01125566.FINDINGS: Between Aug 26, 2010, and April 26, 2013, we enrolled 508 patients: 339 assigned to the afatinib group and 169 assigned to the trastuzumab group.Recruitment was stopped on April 26, 2013, after a benefit-risk assessment by the independent data monitoring committee was unfavourable for the afatinib group.Patients on afatinib plus vinorelbine had to switch to trastuzumab plus vinorelbine, afatinib monotherapy, vinorelbine monotherapy, or receive treatment outside of the trial.Median follow-up was 9.3 months (IQR 3.7-16.0).Median progression-free survival was 5.5 months (95% CI 5.4-5.6) in the afatinib group and 5.6 months (5.3-7.3) in the trastuzumab group (hazard ratio 1.10 95% CI 0.86-1.41; p=0.43).The most common drug-related adverse events of grade 3 or higher were neutropenia (190 [56%] of 337 patients in the afatinib group vs 102 [60%] of 169 patients in the trastuzumab group), leucopenia (64 [19%] vs 34 [20%]), and diarrhoea (60 [18%] vs none).INTERPRETATION: Trastuzumab-based therapy remains the treatment of choice for patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who had progressed on trastuzumab.FUNDING: Boehringer Ingelheim.",1,1,1,1
22610153,"Extended benefit from sequential administration of docetaxel after standard fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide regimen for node-positive breast cancer: the 8-year follow-up results of the UNICANCER-PACS01 trial.PURPOSE: The initial report from the Programme Action Concertee Sein (PACS) PACS01 trial demonstrated a benefit at 5 years for disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) rates with the sequential administration of docetaxel after FEC100 (fluorouracil 500 mg/m(2), epirubicin 100 mg/m(2), and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m(2)) for patients with node-positive, operable breast cancer.We evaluate here the impact of this regimen at 8 years.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between June 1997 and March 2000, a total of 1,999 patients (age <65) with localized, resectable, non-pretreated, unilateral breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive either standard FEC100 for 6 cycles or 3 cycles of FEC100 followed by 3 cycles of 100 mg/m(2) docetaxel (FEC-D), both given every 21 days.Radiotherapy was mandatory after conservative surgery and tamoxifen was given for 5 years to hormone receptor (HR)-positive patients.Five-year DFS was the trial's main endpoint.Updated 8-year survival data are presented.RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 92.8 months, 639 patients experienced at least one event.A total number of 383 deaths were registered.Eight-year DFS rates were 65.8% with FEC alone and 70.2% with FEC-D. OS rates at 8 years were 78% with FEC alone and 83.2% with FEC-D. Cox regression analysis adjusted for age and number of positive nodes showed a 15% reduction in the relative risk of relapse and a 25% reduction in the relative risk of death in favor of FEC-D. Significant relative risk reductions were observed in the HR-positive, HER2-positive, and Ki67 >/=20% subpopulations.CONCLUSION: Benefits for DFS and OS rates with the sequential FEC-D regimen are fully confirmed at 8 years.",1,1,1,1

30902613,"Updated Efficacy and Safety Data and Impact of the EML4-ALK Fusion Variant on the Efficacy of Alectinib in Untreated ALK-Positive Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer in the Global Phase III ALEX Study.INTRODUCTION: At the prior data cutoff (February 9, 2017) the ALEX trial showed superior investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) for alectinib versus crizotinib in untreated, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive, advanced NSCLC (hazard ratio = 0.47, 95% confidence interval: 0.34-0.65, p < 0.001).The median PFS in the alectinib arm was not reached versus 11.1 months with crizotinib.Retrospective analyses suggest that the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 gene-ALK variant (EML4-ALK) may influence ALK-inhibitor treatment benefit.We present updated analyses, including exploratory subgroup analysis by EML4-ALK variant, after an additional 10 months' follow-up (cutoff December 1, 2017).METHODS: Patients were randomized to receive twice-daily alectinib, 600 mg, or crizotinib, 250 mg, until disease progression, toxicity, death, or withdrawal.PFS was determined by the investigators.Baseline plasma and tissue biomarker samples were analyzed by using hybrid-capture, next-generation sequencing to determine EML4-ALK variant.RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were balanced.Investigator-assessed PFS was prolonged with alectinib (stratified hazard ratio = 0.43, 95% confidence interval: 0.32-0.58).The median PFS times were 34.8 months with alectinib and 10.9 months with crizotinib.EML4-ALK fusions were detectable in 129 patient plasma samples and 124 tissue samples; variants 1, 2, and 3/ab did not affect PFS, objective response rate, or duration of response.Investigator-assessed PFS was longer for alectinib than for crizotinib across EML4-ALK variants 1, 2, and 3a/b in plasma and tissue.Despite longer treatment duration (27.0 months in the case of alectinib versus 10.8 months in the case of crizotinib), the safety of alectinib compared favorably with that of crizotinib.CONCLUSION: Alectinib continues to demonstrate superior investigator-assessed PFS versus crizotinib in untreated ALK-positive NSCLC, irrespective of EML4-ALK variant.",1,1,1,1
22715124,"Effects of self-directed stress management training and home-based exercise on quality of life in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy: a randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Research has shown that self-directed stress management training improves mental well-being in patients undergoing chemotherapy.The present study extends this work by evaluating separate and combined effects of stress management training and home-based exercise.METHOD: Following assessment of mental and physical well-being, depression, anxiety, exercise, and stress reduction activity before chemotherapy started, patients were randomized to stress management training (SM), exercise (EX), combined stress management and exercise (SMEX), or usual care only (UCO).Outcomes were reassessed 6 and 12 weeks after chemotherapy started.Significance testing of group-by-time interactions in 286 patients who completed all assessments was used to evaluate intervention efficacy.RESULTS: Interaction effects for mental and physical well-being scores were not significant.Depression scores yielded a linear interaction comparing UCO and SMEX (p = 0.019), with decreases in SMEX but not UCO.Anxiety scores yielded a quadratic interaction comparing UCO and SMEX (p = 0.049), with trends for changes in SMEX but not UCO.Additional analyses yielded quadratic interactions for exercise activity comparing UCO and SMEX (p = 0.022), with positive changes in SMEX but not UCO, and for stress management activity comparing UCO and SM (p < 0.001) and UCO and SMEX (p = 0.013), with positive changes in SM and SMEX but not UCO.CONCLUSION: Only the combined intervention yielded effects on quality of life outcomes, and these were limited to anxiety and depression.These findings are consistent with evidence that only the combined intervention yielded increases in both exercise and stress management activity.Future research should investigate ways to augment this intervention to enhance its benefits.",0,0,0,0
27098346,"Fitness outcomes from a randomised controlled trial of exercise training for men with prostate cancer: the ENGAGE study.PURPOSE: The main purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a 12-week, clinician-referred, community-based exercise training program with supervised and unsupervised sessions for men with prostate cancer.The secondary purpose was to determine whether androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) modified responses to exercise training.METHODS: Secondary analysis was undertaken on data from a multicentre cluster randomised controlled trial in which 15 clinicians were randomly assigned to refer eligible patients to an exercise training intervention (n = 8) or to provide usual care (n = 7).Data from 119 patients (intervention n = 53, control n = 66) were available for this analysis.Outcome measures included fitness and physical function, anthropometrics, resting heart rate, and blood pressure.RESULTS: Compared to the control condition, men in the intervention significantly improved their 6-min walk distance (M diff = 49.98 m, p adj = 0.001), leg strength (M diff = 21.82 kg, p adj = 0.001), chest strength (M diff = 6.91 kg, p adj = 0.001), 30-s sit-to-stand result (M diff = 3.38 reps, p adj = 0.001), and reach distance (M diff = 4.8 cm, p adj = 0.024).A significant difference (unadjusted for multiplicity) in favour of men in the intervention was also found for resting heart rate (M diff = -3.76 beats/min, p = 0.034).ADT did not modify responses to exercise training.CONCLUSIONS: Men with prostate cancer who act upon clinician referrals to community-based exercise training programs can improve their strength, physical functioning, and, potentially, cardiovascular health, irrespective of whether or not they are treated with ADT.IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Clinicians should inform men with prostate cancer about the benefits of exercise and refer them to appropriately qualified exercise practitioners and suitable community-based programs.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australia and New Zealand Clinical Trials Register (ANZCTR): ACTRN12610000609055.",0,0,0,0
22552048,"Efficacy of docetaxel-based chemotherapy following ketoconazole in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: implications for prior therapy in clinical trials.OBJECTIVES: Abiraterone acetate (AA) is a CYP17 inhibitor of androgen synthesis approved for use following docetaxel for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC); evaluation in the pre-docetaxel setting is ongoing.Given that the reported efficacy of AA is lower following docetaxel vs. pre-docetaxel, the potential exists for cross resistance given docetaxel's partly androgen receptor targeting activity.The efficacy of docetaxel following ketoconazole (KC), a weaker and nonspecific inhibitor of CYP17, may provide some insights into this potential interaction.We retrospectively evaluated the efficacy of every 3-week docetaxel with prednisone (DP) in mCRPC previously exposed to KC compared to KC-naive patients.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A randomized phase II trial of men with mCRPC treated with DP + AT-101 (bcl-2 inhibitor) vs. DP plus placebo was analyzed.Both arms were combined for analysis as no significant differences were seen.Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective response (ORR), pain, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rates were estimated with and without prior KC.Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate the effect of covariates on OS.RESULTS: Of 220 evaluable men, 40 (18.2%) received prior KC.The median OS with DP-based therapy of KC-naive patients (18.3 months, 95% CI: 15.0, 24.5) and post-KC patients (17.0 months, 95% CI: 9.9, 20.4) was not statistically different (P = 0.20).After controlling for prognostic classifications, analyses demonstrated consistent trends for worsening of OS after KC, with (hazard ratios (HRs) 1.33-1.46.Similar unfavorable trends were observed for ORR, PSA declines, and PFS.CONCLUSIONS: In this hypothesis-generating analysis, patients treated with docetaxel-based chemotherapy following prior KC had numerically and consistently worse outcomes than patients not exposed to prior KC.Although the estimated differences did not attain statistical significance, evaluation of outcomes with docetaxel in particular, and all classes of novel and emerging agents following AA, is of clinical importance, given its more potent androgen synthesis inhibition compared with KC.Drug development should take into account the potential impact of previous therapy.",0,0,0,0
29730633,"Use of a GP-endorsed 12 months' reminder letter to promote uptake of bowel scope screening: protocol for a randomised controlled trial in a hard-to-reach population.INTRODUCTION: Flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS) screening is associated with reduced colorectal cancer incidence and mortality when offered as a one-off test to men and women aged 55-64.The test, also referred to as the 'bowel scope screening' (BSS) test, was added to England's national Bowel Cancer Screening Programme in March 2013, where it is offered to men and women aged 55.Since its implementation, uptake of the BSS test has been low, with only 43% of the eligible population attending an appointment.Sending non-participants a reminder at age 56 has been shown to improve uptake by up to nine percentage points at a single centre in London; we hypothesise that adding a general practitioners (GPs) endorsement to the reminder could improve uptake even further.METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This paper describes the protocol for a randomised controlled trial which will examine the effectiveness of adding a GPs endorsement to a reminder for BSS non-participants aged 56.All screening-eligible adults who have not responded to a BSS appointment at London North West Healthcare NHS Trust within 12 months of their initial invitation will be randomised to receive either a GP-endorsed reminder letter or reminder letter without GP endorsement.The primary outcome will be the proportion of individuals screened within each group 8 weeks after the reminder.Statistical comparisons will be made using univariate and multivariate logistic regression, with 'uptake' as the outcome variable, GP reminder group as the exposure and sociodemographic variables as covariates.ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study was approved by the Yorkshire & Humber-Bradford Leeds Research Ethics Committee (16/YH/0298) and the Confidentiality Advisory Group (17/CAG/0162).The results will be disseminated in a peer-reviewed journal in accordance with the Consort statement and will be made available to the public.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN82867861.",0,0,0,0

25688512,"Rationale and protocol of the MetNET-1 trial, a prospective, single center, phase II study to evaluate the activity and safety of everolimus in combination with octreotide LAR and metformin in patients with advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.Abnormal PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway signalling and autocrine activation of the mTOR pathway, mediated through insulin-like growth factor-1, have been implicated in the proliferation of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (pNET) cells.Everolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, has shown antitumor benefit in pNETs alone and in combination with octreotide LAR in RADIANT-1 and RADIANT-3 studies.Although everolimus-based phase II/III trials have improved progression-free survival for pNET, its use has not impacted on prolonging overall survival.Metformin has recently shown some anti-cancer activity in both in vitro and in vivo studies by its indirect properties to decrease insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels and by its antitumour effect to promote AMPK activation and consequently inhibition to TSC1-2/mTOR complex.In light of even more retrospective evidence of metformin's anticancer activity, a prospective evaluation is required to either confirm or discard these preliminary findings.With the aim to evaluate the antiproliferative effect of metformin in combination with everolimus and octreotide LAR in pancreatic well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor patients, a single arm, prospective, single center phase II study was designed (MetNET-1 trial, NCT 02294006).Forty-three patients are expected to be evaluated.The study is ongoing, and recruitment is estimated to be completed in August 2016.The results will be anticipated in 2017.",0,0,0,0
22633817,"Effects of a dietary intervention on acute gastrointestinal side effects and other aspects of health-related quality of life: a randomized controlled trial in prostate cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy.PURPOSE: To study the effect of a dietary intervention on acute gastrointestinal side effects and other aspects of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in prostate cancer patients referred to radiotherapy.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 130 patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups: an intervention group (IG, n=64), instructed to reduce their intake of insoluble dietary fibres and lactose, a standard care group (SC, n=66), instructed to continue their normal diet.Gastrointestinal side effects and other aspects of HRQOL were evaluated from baseline up to 2 months after completed radiotherapy, using the EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-PR25 and the study-specific Gastrointestinal Side Effects Questionnaire (GISEQ).A scale indicating adherence to dietary instructions was developed from a Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ), with lower scores representing better compliance.Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were conducted.RESULTS: There was an interaction effect between randomization and time in the FFQ Scores (p<0.001), indicating that both groups followed their assigned dietary instructions.The dietary intervention had no effect on gastrointestinal side effects or other aspects of HRQOL.During radiotherapy, the percentage of patients with bowel symptoms and bloated abdomen was lower in IG compared to SC, but the between-group differences were not statistically significant.During radiotherapy, the percentage of patients with bowel symptoms, urinary symptoms, pain, fatigue and diminished physical and role functioning increased in both groups.CONCLUSIONS: The dietary intervention had no effect on gastrointestinal side effects or other aspects of HRQOL.The tendency towards lower prevalence of bowel symptoms in IG may indicate some positive effect of the dietary intervention, but methodological refinements, clearer results and longer follow-up are needed before the value of diet change can be established with certainty.",0,0,0,0
26740194,"Effect of intranasal steroids on rhinosinusitis after radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma: clinical study.OBJECTIVE: Post-irradiation rhinosinusitis is one of the most common untoward side effects in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma.This study aimed to evaluate the effect of fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray on post-irradiation rhinosinusitis.METHODS: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients who had undergone radiotherapy and subsequently developed chronic rhinosinusitis were randomised to receive either fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray 200 microg plus nasal irrigation or a single nasal irrigation, for six months.A questionnaire, nasal endoscopy and computed tomography were used to evaluate rhinosinusitis severity, at the beginning of treatment, and at three and six months after treatment.RESULTS: The group who received fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray combined with irrigation had fewer nasal complaints (overall symptoms, blocked nose and headache were reduced), a better quality of life and less severe endoscopic findings than those who only received nasal irrigation at three and six months after treatment.CONCLUSION: Nasal steroids are a safe and effective therapy for patients with post-irradiation rhinosinusitis.",0,0,0,0
30596812,"Weekly paclitaxel, carboplatin, cetuximab, and cetuximab, docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil, followed by local therapy in previously untreated, locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.BACKGROUND: The survival advantage of induction chemotherapy (IC) followed by locoregional treatment is controversial in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (LAHNSCC).We previously showed feasibility and safety of cetuximab-based IC (paclitaxel/carboplatin/cetuximab-PCC, and docetaxel/cisplatin/5-fluorouracil/cetuximab-C-TPF) followed by local therapy in LAHNSCC.The primary end point of this phase II clinical trial with randomization to PCC and C-TPF followed by combined local therapy in patients with LAHNSCC stratified by human papillomavirus (HPV) status and T-stage was 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) compared with historical control.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients were >/=18 years with squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx, oral cavity, nasopharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx with measurable stage IV (T0-4N2b-2c/3M0) and known HPV by p16 status.Stratification was by HPV and T-stage into one of the two risk groups: (i) low-risk: HPV-positive and T0-3 or HPV-negative and T0-2; (ii) intermediate/high-risk: HPV-positive and T4 or HPV-negative and T3-4.Patient reported outcomes were carried out.RESULTS: A total of 136 patients were randomized in the study, 68 to each arm.With a median follow up of 3.2 years, the 2-year PFS in the PCC arm was 89% in the overall, 96% in the low-risk and 67% in the intermediate/high-risk groups; in the C-TPF arm 2-year PFS was 88% in the overall, 88% in the low-risk and 89% in the intermediate/high-risk groups.CONCLUSION: The observed 2-year PFS of PCC in the low-risk group and of C-TPF in the intermediate/high-risk group showed a 20% improvement compared with the historical control derived from RTOG-0129, therefore reaching the primary end point of the trial.",1,1,1,1
27573561,"Subgroup analysis in RAISE: a randomized, double-blind phase III study of irinotecan, folinic acid, and 5-fluorouracil (FOLFIRI) plus ramucirumab or placebo in patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma progression.BACKGROUND: The RAISE phase III clinical trial demonstrated that ramucirumab + FOLFIRI improved overall survival (OS) [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.844, P = 0.0219] and progression-free survival (PFS) (HR = 0.793, P < 0.0005) compared with placebo + FOLFIRI for second-line metastatic colorectal carcinoma (mCRC) patients previously treated with first-line bevacizumab, oxaliplatin, and a fluoropyrimidine.Since some patient or disease characteristics could be associated with differential efficacy or safety, prespecified subgroup analyses were undertaken.This report focuses on three of the most relevant ones: KRAS status (wild-type versus mutant), age (<65 versus >/=65 years), and time to progression (TTP) on first-line therapy (<6 versus >/=6 months).PATIENTS AND METHODS: OS and PFS were evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier analysis, with HR determined by the Cox proportional hazards model.Treatment-by-subgroup interaction was tested to determine whether treatment effect was consistent between subgroup pairs.RESULTS: Patients with both wild-type and mutant KRAS benefited from ramucirumab + FOLFIRI treatment over placebo + FOLFIRI (interaction P = 0.526); although numerically, wild-type KRAS patients benefited more (wild-type KRAS: median OS = 14.4 versus 11.9 months, HR = 0.82, P = 0.049; mutant KRAS: median OS = 12.7 versus 11.3 months, HR = 0.89, P = 0.263).Patients with both longer and shorter first-line TTP benefited from ramucirumab (interaction P = 0.9434), although TTP <6 months was associated with poorer OS (TTP >/=6 months: median OS = 14.3 versus 12.5 months, HR = 0.86, P = 0.061; TTP <6 months: median OS = 10.4 versus 8.0 months, HR = 0.86, P = 0.276).The subgroups of patients >/=65 versus <65 years also derived a similar ramucirumab survival benefit (interaction P = 0.9521) (>/=65 years: median OS = 13.8 versus 11.7 months, HR = 0.85, P = 0.156; <65 years: median OS = 13.1 versus 11.9 months, HR = 0.86, P = 0.098).The safety profile of ramucirumab + FOLFIRI was similar across subgroups.CONCLUSIONS: These analyses revealed similar efficacy and safety among patient subgroups with differing KRAS mutation status, longer or shorter first-line TTP, and age.Ramucirumab is a beneficial addition to second-line FOLFIRI treatment for a wide range of patients with mCRC.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01183780.",1,1,1,1
26951379,"AVAREG: a phase II, randomized, noncomparative study of fotemustine or bevacizumab for patients with recurrent glioblastoma.BACKGROUND: Few prospective studies have assessed the role of bevacizumab and included a control arm with standard treatments for recurrent glioblastoma.We conducted a noncomparative phase II trial (AVAREG) to examine the efficacy of bevacizumab or fotemustine in this setting.METHODS: Eligible patients were randomized 2:1 to receive bevacizumab (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks) or fotemustine (75 mg/m(2) on days 1, 8, and 15, then 100 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks after a 35-day interval).The primary endpoint was 6-month overall survival (OS) rate (OS-6).No formal efficacy comparison was made between the treatment arms.RESULTS: Ninety-one patients were enrolled (bevacizumab n = 59; fotemustine n = 32).Median age was 57 years (range, 28-78 y), and patients had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 (n = 42), 1 (n = 35), or 2 (n = 14).OS-6 rate was 62.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 48.4-74.5) with bevacizumab and 73.3% (95% CI, 54.1-87.7) with fotemustine.OS-6 rates were lower in bevacizumab-treated patients with MGMT promoter methylated tumors than in those with unmethylated tumors (50% and 85%, respectively), but higher in fotemustine-treated patients (87.5% and 50%, respectively).OS rates at 9 months were 37.9% (95% CI, 25.5-51.6) and 46.7% (95% CI, 28.3-65.7) with bevacizumab and fotemustine, respectively, and median OS was 7.3 months (95% CI, 5.8-9.2) and 8.7 months (95% CI, 6.3-15.4), respectively.Toxicity was as expected with the 2 agents.CONCLUSION: Single-agent bevacizumab may have a role in patients with recurrent glioblastoma.",1,1,1,1
21660669,"Light treatment prevents fatigue in women undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer.PURPOSE: Fatigue is one of the most disturbing complaints of cancer patients and is often the reason for discontinuing treatment.This randomized controlled study tested the hypothesis that increased morning bright light, compared to dim light, would result in less fatigue in women with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy.METHODS: Thirty-nine women newly diagnosed with stage I-III breast cancer were randomized to either bright white light (BWL) or dim red light (DRL) treatment and were instructed to use the light box for 30 min every morning throughout the first four cycles of chemotherapy.The Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory was administered prior to the start of chemotherapy (baseline), during the chemotherapy treatment week of cycle 1 (C1TW), the last week (recovery week) of cycle 1 (C1RW), the chemotherapy treatment week of cycle 4 (C4TW), and the last week (recovery week) of cycle 4 (C4RW).RESULTS: The DRL group reported increased fatigue at C1TW (p = 0.003) and C4TW (p < 0.001) compared to baseline, while there was no significant change from baseline in the BWL group.A secondary analysis showed that the increases in fatigue levels in the DRL group were not mediated through nor associated with changes in sleep or in circadian rhythms as measured with wrist actigraphy.CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that morning bright light treatment may prevent overall fatigue from worsening during chemotherapy.Although our hypothesis that overall fatigue would improve with bright light treatment was not supported, the lack of deterioration in total fatigue scores suggests that bright morning light may be a useful intervention during chemotherapy for breast cancer.",0,0,0,0

30303516,"NCI 8628: A randomized phase 2 study of ziv-aflibercept and high-dose interleukin 2 or high-dose interleukin 2 alone for inoperable stage III or IV melanoma.BACKGROUND: Interleukin 2 (IL-2) is a growth factor for T and natural killer cells, promotes proinflammatory cytokines, and can lead to durable responses in patients with melanoma.Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) promotes angiogenesis and modulates host innate and adaptive immunity.High VEGF levels were found to be associated with nonresponse to IL-2.Ziv-aflibercept may deplete VEGF and thereby enhance antitumor T-cell responses, thus supporting a combination immunotherapeutic strategy with IL-2.METHODS: NCI 8628 was a phase 2 trial of ziv-aflibercept and IL-2 (arm A) versus IL-2 alone (arm B) randomized at 2:1, respectively.Eligible patients had inoperable American Joint Committee on Cancer stage III or stage IV melanoma.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS).RESULTS: A total of 89 patients were enrolled and 84 patients were treated.The median follow-up was 41.4 months.Among treated patients (55 patients in arm A and 29 patients in arm B), PFS was significantly improved in favor of arm A, with a median of 6.9 months (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 4.1-8.7 months) versus 2.3 months (95% CI, 1.6-3.5 months) (P<.001).No significant difference was noted with regard to overall survival, with a median of 26.9 months (95% CI, 14.4-63.6 months) for arm A and 24.2 months (95% CI, 11.3-36.4 months) for arm B. The response rate (according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors [RECIST]) was 22% in arm A (4 complete responses [CRs] and 8 partial responses [PRs]) and 17% in arm B (1 CR and 4 PRs).Stable disease or PR or CR was noted in 65% of patients in arm A and 48% of patients in arm B. The combination was found to be superior to monotherapy in patients with high and low levels of serum VEGF and VEGF receptor 2.Adverse events were consistent with the expected profiles of monotherapy with IL-2 and ziv-aflibercept.CONCLUSIONS: Ziv-aflibercept and IL-2 were found to significantly improve PFS compared with IL-2 alone, thereby meeting the primary endpoint of the current study.These findings support further study of immunotherapeutic combination strategies involving VEGF inhibitors.",1,1,1,1
22371400,"Dietary patterns as risk factors of differentiated thyroid carcinoma.UNLABELLED: Nutritional factors are known to be important in the development of different metabolic diseases.The history of nodular or diffuse goiter is closely related to risk of thyroid carcinoma.On account of the function of the thyroid gland, many studies focus on iodine intake.The aim of the study was to assess whether dietary patterns could be risk factors of differentiated thyroid carcinoma.MATERIAL/METHODS: The case-control study was based on a questionnaire, which included information about dietary patterns and was carried out on 284 patients comprising 30 males (mean age 58.4+/-13.7 years), and 254 females (mean age 52.1+/-13.8 years), as well as 345 randomly selected controls: 58 males (mean age 60.2+/-12 years) and 287 females (mean age 53.4+/-14.3 years) randomly selected from the Population Register and adjusted by age and gender to the group of TC.The main groups of nutritional products, i.e. starchy foods, meat, dairy products, vegetables, fruits, and beverages, were analyzed.RESULTS: Consumption of vegetables, fruits, saltwater fish and cottage cheese was significantly lower in patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma than in controls, quite the contrary to starchy foods, especially white bread.CONCLUSIONS: Dietary patterns appear to modify the risk of thyroid carcinoma.A diet rich in vegetables and fruit, as well as saltwater fish (a source of iodine) and low-fat meat, could be an important protective factor.",0,0,0,0
30160789,"Multicenter randomized trial of arsenic trioxide and Realgar-Indigo naturalis formula in pediatric patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia: Interim results of the SCCLG-APL clinical study.Intravenous arsenic trioxide (ATO) has been adopted as the first-line treatment for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL).Another arsenic compound named the Realgar-Indigo naturalis formula (RIF), an oral traditional Chinese medicine containing As4 S4 , has been shown to be highly effective in treating adult APL.In the treatment of pediatric APL, the safety and efficacy of RIF remains to be confirmed.This randomized, multicenter, and noninferiority trial was conducted to determine whether intravenous ATO can be substituted by oral RIF in the treatment of pediatric APL.From September 2011 to January 2017, among 92 patients who were 16 years old or younger with newly diagnosed PML-RARa positive APL, 82 met eligible criteria and were randomly assigned to ATO (n = 42) or RIF (n = 40) group.The remaining 10 patients did not fulfilled eligible criteria because five did not accept randomization, four died and one had hemiplegia prior to arsenic randomization due to intracranial hemorrhage or cerebral thrombosis.Induction and consolidation treatment contained ATO or RIF, all-trans-retinoic acid and low intensity chemotherapy.End points included event-free survival (EFS), adverse events and hospital days.After a median 3-year follow-up, the estimated 5-year EFS was 100% in both groups, and adverse events were mild.However, patients in the RIF group had significantly less hospital stay than those in the ATO group.This interim analysis shows that oral RIF is as effective and safe as intravenous ATO for the treatment of pediatric APL, with the advantage of reducing hospital stay.Final trial analysis will reveal mature outcome data.",1,1,1,1
28463827,"Taurolidine/Citrate Lock Therapy for Primary Prevention of Catheter-Related Infections in Cancer Patients: Results of a Prospective, Randomized, Phase IV Trial (ATAPAC).BACKGROUND: Totally implantable venous access port (TIVAP)-related infections (RIs) remain a serious health problem in cancer patients receiving an intravenous (i.v.) therapy.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The ATAPAC study was a prospective, randomized, monocentric, phase IV trial evaluating the efficacy of taurolidine lock solution versus standard saline solution for primary TIVAP-RI prevention in nonhematological cancer patients receiving i.v.chemotherapy.The primary endpoint was the TIVAP-RI incidence rate.From December 2014 to September 2015, 163 patients were enrolled in the study (taurolidine: n = 86 vs. CONTROL: n = 77).Four patients in the control group (5%) had a Staphylococcus epidermidis TIVAP-RI, and 1 patient (1%) in the taurolidine group had a Staphylococcus aureus infection.The TIVAP-RI incidence rate was 0.4 and 0.1 per thousand catheter-days, respectively (p = 0.21).The infection-free TIVAP survival was not statistically significant (p = 0.09).TIVAP-RI required a total of 22 hospitalization days in the taurolidine group versus 106 days in the control arm with associated costs of EUR 4,849 and EUR 36,020, respectively.Taurolidine-related toxicity was transitory and classified as grade I.

25795410,"Nivolumab versus chemotherapy in patients with advanced melanoma who progressed after anti-CTLA-4 treatment (CheckMate 037): a randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Nivolumab, a fully human IgG4 PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor antibody, can result in durable responses in patients with melanoma who have progressed after ipilimumab and BRAF inhibitors.We assessed the efficacy and safety of nivolumab compared with investigator's choice of chemotherapy (ICC) as a second-line or later-line treatment in patients with advanced melanoma.METHODS: In this randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 3 trial, we recruited patients at 90 sites in 14 countries.Eligible patients were 18 years or older, had unresectable or metastatic melanoma, and progressed after ipilimumab, or ipilimumab and a BRAF inhibitor if they were BRAF(V 600) mutation-positive.Participating investigators randomly assigned (with an interactive voice response system) patients 2:1 to receive an intravenous infusion of nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks or ICC (dacarbazine 1000 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks or paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2) combined with carboplatin area under the curve 6 every 3 weeks) until progression or unacceptable toxic effects.We stratified randomisation by BRAF mutation status, tumour expression of PD-L1, and previous best overall response to ipilimumab.We used permuted blocks (block size of six) within each stratum.Primary endpoints were the proportion of patients who had an objective response and overall survival.Treatment was given open-label, but those doing tumour assessments were masked to treatment assignment.We assessed objective responses per-protocol after 120 patients had been treated with nivolumab and had a minimum follow-up of 24 weeks, and safety in all patients who had had at least one dose of treatment.The trial is closed and this is the first interim analysis, reporting the objective response primary endpoint.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01721746.FINDINGS: Between Dec 21, 2012, and Jan 10, 2014, we screened 631 patients, randomly allocating 272 patients to nivolumab and 133 to ICC.Confirmed objective responses were reported in 38 (31.7%, 95% CI 23.5-40.8) of the first 120 patients in the nivolumab group versus five (10.6%, 3.5-23.1) of 47 patients in the ICC group.Grade 3-4 adverse events related to nivolumab included increased lipase (three [1%] of 268 patients), increased alanine aminotransferase, anaemia, and fatigue (two [1%] each); for ICC, these included neutropenia (14 [14%] of 102), thrombocytopenia (six [6%]), and anaemia (five [5%]).We noted grade 3-4 drug-related serious adverse events in 12 (5%) nivolumab-treated patients and nine (9%) patients in the ICC group.No treatment-related deaths occurred.INTERPRETATION: Nivolumab led to a greater proportion of patients achieving an objective response and fewer toxic effects than with alternative available chemotherapy regimens for patients with advanced melanoma that has progressed after ipilimumab or ipilimumab and a BRAF inhibitor.Nivolumab represents a new treatment option with clinically meaningful durable objective responses in a population of high unmet need.FUNDING: Bristol-Myers Squibb.",1,1,1,1
25015740,"A cohort analysis to identify eligible patients for intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) of early breast cancer.BACKGROUND: Since the results from the randomized TARGIT A trial were published, intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) is used more often.IORT can be provided as accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) or as a boost.The definition of suitable patients for IORT as APBI differs between different national societies (e.g. ESTRO and ASTRO) and different inclusion criteria of trials and so does the eligibility of patients.This analysis identifies eligible patients for IORT according to available consensus statements and inclusion criteria of the ongoing TARGIT trials.METHODS: Between 01/03 - 12/09, 1505 breast cancer cases were treated at the breast cancer center at the University Medical Center Mannheim.Complete data sets for age, stage (T, N, and M), histology and hormone receptor status were available in 1108 cases.Parameters to identify eligible patients are as follows: ESTRO: >50 years, invasive ductal carcinoma/other favorable histology (IDC), T1-2 (</=3 cm), N0, any hormone receptor status, M0; ASTRO: >/=60 years, IDC, T1, N0, positive estrogen hormone receptor status, M0; TARGIT E ""elderly"", risk adapted radiotherapy with IORT followed by external beam radiotherapy in case of risk factors in final histopathology, phase II: >/=70 years, IDC, T1, N0, any hormone receptor status, M0; TARGIT C ""consolidation"", risk adapted radiotherapy, phase IV: >/=50 years, IDC, T1, N0, positive hormone receptor status, M0; TARGIT BQR ""boost quality registry"": every age, every histology, T1-2 (max.3.5 cm), any hormone receptor status, N0/+, M0/+.RESULTS: Out of the 1108 cases, 379 cases (34.2%) were suitable for IORT as APBI regarding the ESTRO and 175 (15.8%) regarding the ASTRO consensus statements.82 (7.4%) patients were eligible for the TARGIT E trial, 258 (23.3%) for the TARGIT C trial and 671 (60.6%) for the TARGIT BQR registry.According to the consensus statements of ASTRO (45.1%) and ESTRO (41.4%) about half of the eligible patients were treated with IORT as APBI.From the eligible patients fulfilling the criteria for IORT boost (35%) about one third was eventually treated.CONCLUSIONS: Patient selection for IORT should be restrictive.For IORT as APBI the TARGIT trials are even more restrictive including patients than the ESTRO and ASTRO consensus statements.",0,0,0,0

23146280,"The prognostic and predictive value of mRNA expression of vascular endothelial growth factor family members in breast cancer: a study in primary tumors of high-risk early breast cancer patients participating in a randomized Hellenic Cooperative Oncology Group trial.INTRODUCTION: The main prognostic variables in early breast cancer are tumor size, histological grade, estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor (ER/PgR) status, number of positive nodes and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status.The present study evaluated the prognostic and/or predictive value of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family members in high-risk early breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant chemo-hormonotherapy.METHODS: RNA was isolated from 308 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded primary tumor samples from breast cancer patients enrolled in the HE10/97 trial, evaluating adjuvant dose-dense sequential chemotherapy with epirubicin followed by cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil (CMF) with or without paclitaxel (E-T-CMF versus E-CMF).A fully automated method based on magnetic beads was applied for RNA extraction, followed by one-step quantitative RT-PCR for mRNA analysis of VEGF-A, -B, -C and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) 1, 2, 3.RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 8 years, 109 patients (35%) developed a relapse and 80 patients (26%) died.In high VEGF-C and VEGFR1 mRNA expressing tumors, ER/PgR-negative tumors (Fisher's exact test, P = 0.001 and P = 0.021, respectively) and HER2-positive tumors (P <0.001 and P = 0.028, respectively) were more frequent than in low VEGF-C and VEGFR1 expressing tumors, respectively.From the VEGF family members evaluated, high VEGFR1 mRNA expression (above the 75th percentile) emerged as a significant negative prognostic factor for overall survival (OS; hazard ratio (HR) = 1.60, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01 to 2.55, Wald's P = 0.047) and disease-free survival (DFS; HR = 1.67, 95% CI: 1.13 to 2.48, P = 0.010), when adjusting for treatment group.High VEGF-C mRNA expression was predictive for benefit from adjuvant treatment with paclitaxel (E-T-CMF arm) for OS (test for interaction, Wald's P = 0.038), while in multivariate analysis the interaction of VEGF-C with taxane treatment was significant for both OS (Wald's P = 0.019) and DFS (P = 0.041) and continuous VEGF-B mRNA expression values for OS (P = 0.019).CONCLUSIONS: The present study reports, for the first time, that VEGF-C mRNA overexpression, as assessed by qRT-PCR, has a strong predictive value in high-risk early breast cancer patients undergoing adjuvant paclitaxel-containing treatment.Further studies are warranted to validate the prognostic and/or predictive value of VEGF-B, VEGF-C and VEGFR1 in patients treated with adjuvant therapies and to reveal which members of the VEGF family could possibly be useful markers in identifying patients who will benefit most from anti-VEGF strategies.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR) ACTRN12611000506998.",0,0,0,0
30138612,"Improving the quality and acceptance of colonoscopy preparation by reinforced patient education with short message service: results from a randomized, multicenter study (PERICLES-II).BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Sufficient bowel preparation is crucial for successful screening and surveillance colonoscopy.However, the rates of inadequate preparation are still high.We investigated the effects of reinforcing patient education and guidance by using the short message service (SMS).METHODS: In this prospective, endoscopist-blinded, multicenter study, standard instructions pertaining to split-dose preparation were provided in a verbal and written format to all patients during the initial appointment.Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to a group that received reinforced education starting 4 days before the colonoscopy (SMS group) or to the control group which did not receive further education.The primary outcome was the percentage of insufficient preparation results (Boston Bowel Preparation Scale [BBPS] score <6).The secondary outcomes included quality of bowel preparation according to the BBPS, polyp and adenoma detection rates, and patients' perceived discomfort in the preparation procedure.RESULTS: The percentage of patients with insufficient bowel preparation was significantly lower in the SMS group (9%) than in the control group (19%) (P = .0013).The mean BBPS score was significantly higher in the SMS group (7.4 +/- 0.1) than in the control group (6.5 +/- 0.1) (P < .0001).Each colon segment had significantly higher BBPS scores in the SMS group.The adenoma detection rate and number of detected adenomas in the right segment of the colon were higher in the SMS group.SMS messages were accompanied by a lower level of discomfort during preparation (numeric rating scale) (5.2 SMS vs 5.8 controls) (P = .0042).CONCLUSIONS: Reinforced patient education by using SMS messages during the 4 days before colonoscopy increased bowel cleanliness, adenoma detection in the right segment of the colon, and reduced discomfort.(Clinical trial registration number: NCT02272036.).",1,1,0,0
31560068,"Addition of docetaxel to hormonal therapy in low- and high-burden metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer: long-term survival results from the STAMPEDE trial.BACKGROUND: STAMPEDE has previously reported that the use of upfront docetaxel improved overall survival (OS) for metastatic hormone naive prostate cancer patients starting long-term androgen deprivation therapy.We report on long-term outcomes stratified by metastatic burden for M1 patients.METHODS: We randomly allocated patients in 2 : 1 ratio to standard-of-care (SOC; control group) or SOC + docetaxel.Metastatic disease burden was categorised using retrospectively-collected baseline staging scans where available.Analysis used Cox regression models, adjusted for stratification factors, with emphasis on restricted mean survival time where hazards were non-proportional.RESULTS: Between 05 October 2005 and 31 March 2013, 1086 M1 patients were randomised to receive SOC (n = 724) or SOC + docetaxel (n = 362).Metastatic burden was assessable for 830/1086 (76%) patients; 362 (44%) had low and 468 (56%) high metastatic burden.Median follow-up was 78.2 months.There were 494 deaths on SOC (41% more than the previous report).There was good evidence of benefit of docetaxel over SOC on OS (HR = 0.81, 95% CI 0.69-0.95, P = 0.009) with no evidence of heterogeneity of docetaxel effect between metastatic burden sub-groups (interaction P = 0.827).Analysis of other outcomes found evidence of benefit for docetaxel over SOC in failure-free survival (HR = 0.66, 95% CI 0.57-0.76, P < 0.001) and progression-free survival (HR = 0.69, 95% CI 0.59-0.81, P < 0.001) with no evidence of heterogeneity of docetaxel effect between metastatic burden sub-groups (interaction P > 0.5 in each case).There was no evidence that docetaxel resulted in late toxicity compared with SOC: after 1 year, G3-5 toxicity was reported for 28% SOC and 27% docetaxel (in patients still on follow-up at 1 year without prior progression).CONCLUSIONS: The clinically significant benefit in survival for upfront docetaxel persists at longer follow-up, with no evidence that benefit differed by metastatic burden.We advocate that upfront docetaxel is considered for metastatic hormone naive prostate cancer patients regardless of metastatic burden.",1,1,1,1
29244528,"Phase III, Randomized Study of Dual Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) Blockade With Lapatinib Plus Trastuzumab in Combination With an Aromatase Inhibitor in Postmenopausal Women With HER2-Positive, Hormone Receptor-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer: ALTERNATIVE.Purpose Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) targeting plus endocrine therapy (ET) improved clinical benefit in HER2-positive, hormone receptor (HR)-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) versus ET alone.Dual HER2 blockade enhances clinical benefit versus single HER2 blockade.The ALTERNATIVE study evaluated the efficacy and safety of dual HER2 blockade plus aromatase inhibitor (AI) in postmenopausal women with HER2-positive/HR-positive MBC who received prior ET and prior neo(adjuvant)/first-line trastuzumab (TRAS) plus chemotherapy.Methods Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive lapatinib (LAP) + TRAS + AI, TRAS + AI, or LAP + AI.Patients for whom chemotherapy was intended were excluded.The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS; investigator assessed) with LAP + TRAS + AI versus TRAS + AI.Secondary end points were PFS (comparison of other arms), overall survival, overall response rate, clinical benefit rate, and safety.Results Three hundred fifty-five patients were included in this analysis: LAP + TRAS + AI (n = 120), TRAS + AI (n = 117), and LAP + AI (n = 118).Baseline characteristics were balanced.The study met its primary end point; superior PFS was observed with LAP + TRAS + AI versus TRAS + AI (median PFS, 11 v 5.7 months; hazard ratio, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.88; P = .0064).Consistent PFS benefit was observed in predefined subgroups.Overall response rate, clinical benefit rate, and overall survival also favored LAP + TRAS + AI.The median PFS with LAP + AI versus TRAS + AI was 8.3 versus 5.7 months (hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.98; P = .0361).Common adverse events (AEs; >/= 15%) with LAP + TRAS + AI, TRAS + AI, and LAP + AI were diarrhea (69%, 9%, and 51%, respectively), rash (36%, 2%, and 28%, respectively), nausea (22%, 9%, and 22%, respectively), and paronychia (30%, 0%, and 15%, respectively), mostly grade 1 or 2.Serious AEs were reported similarly across the three groups, and AEs leading to discontinuation were lower with LAP + TRAS + AI.Conclusion Dual HER2 blockade with LAP + TRAS + AI showed superior PFS benefit versus TRAS + AI in patients with HER2-positive/HR-positive MBC.This combination offers an effective and safe chemotherapy-sparing alternative treatment regimen for this patient population.",1,1,1,1

28812132,"Bowel preparation in CT colonography: Is diet restriction necessary? A randomised trial (DIETSAN).OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether diet restriction affects quality of colon cleansing and patient tolerance during reduced bowel preparation for CT colonography (CTC).METHODS: Asymptomatic and symptomatic patients were enrolled in this pragmatic, single-centre, randomised trial.All patients were randomly assigned (1:1 ratio, blocks of ten) to receive a reduced bowel preparation and faecal tagging with (Diet-Restriction-Group [DR]) or without (No-Diet-Restriction-Group [NDR]) dietary restriction.Five readers performed a blinded subjective image analysis, by means of 4-point Likert-scales from 0 (highest score) to 3 (worst score).Endpoints were the quality of large bowel cleansing and tolerance to the assigned bowel preparation regimen.The trial is registered at ClinicalTrial.gov (URomLSDBAL1).RESULTS: Ninety-five patients were randomly allocated to treatments (48 in NDR-group, 47 in DR-group).Both groups resulted in optimal colon cleansing.The mean residual stool (0.22, 95%CI 0.00-0.44) and fluid burden (0.39, 95%CI 0.25-0.53) scores for patients in DR-group were similar to those in patients in NDR-group (0.25, 95%CI 0.03-0.47 [p = 0.82] and 0.49, 95%CI 0.30-0.67 [p = 0.38], respectively).Tolerance was significantly better in NDR-group.CONCLUSION: A reduced bowel preparation in association with faecal tagging and without any dietary restriction demonstrated optimal colon cleansing effectiveness for CTC, providing better patient compliance compared with dietary restriction.KEY POINTS: * Dietary restriction in reduced bowel preparation regimen can be avoided. *The quality of colon cleansing is not affected by dietary restriction.* The quality of faecal tagging is not affected by dietary restriction.* Avoidance of dietary restriction improves patients' tolerance for CTC.",0,0,0,0

27390378,"Communicating Findings of Delayed Diagnostic Evaluation to Primary Care Providers.BACKGROUND: We previously found that an intervention involving electronic algorithms to detect delays in follow-up of cancer-related abnormal or ""red-flag"" findings and communicating this information to primary care providers (PCPs) led to more timely diagnostic evaluation.In this study, we examined the effectiveness of various communication strategies to inform PCPs about the delayed follow-up.METHODS: After identifying follow-up delays through electronic health record-based algorithms and record reviews, we communicated this information to PCPs using 3 escalating steps.First, we sent secure E-mails.If no evidence of follow-up was found in a medical record review after 1 week, we made up to 3 attempts to reach the PCPs or their nurses via telephone.If they could not be reached, we informed clinic directors as the third and final step.In this analysis, we evaluate PCPs' follow-up in response to these methods of communication.RESULTS: A total of 733 patients with follow-up delays were identified (369 patients in the intervention group and 364 patients in the control group).Communicating information to PCPs about possible follow-up delays led to decreased times to diagnostic evaluation, but communication related to delays did not always lead to follow-up for the patients in the intervention group.Specifically, secure E-mails led to follow-up in 11.1% of cases (41 of 369), telephone calls led to follow-up in 68.6% of cases (225 of 328), and contacting clinic directors led to follow-up in 5 of 11 cases in which communication escalated to this level.CONCLUSION: Strategies to communicate to PCPs information on delayed follow-up of findings suspicious for cancer were useful, but not fail-safe.Additional back-up strategies, such as using case coordinators, might be needed.",0,0,0,0

24158787,"Everolimus plus exemestane in postmenopausal patients with HR(+) breast cancer: BOLERO-2 final progression-free survival analysis.INTRODUCTION: Effective treatments for hormone-receptor-positive (HR(+)) breast cancer (BC) following relapse/progression on nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI) therapy are needed.Initial Breast Cancer Trials of OraL EveROlimus-2 (BOLERO-2) trial data demonstrated that everolimus and exemestane significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) versus placebo plus exemestane alone in this patient population.METHODS: BOLERO-2 is a phase 3, double-blind, randomized, international trial comparing everolimus (10 mg/day) plus exemestane (25 mg/day) versus placebo plus exemestane in postmenopausal women with HR(+) advanced BC with recurrence/progression during or after NSAIs.The primary endpoint was PFS by local investigator review, and was confirmed by independent central radiology review.Overall survival, response rate, and clinical benefit rate were secondary endpoints.RESULTS: Final study results with median 18-month follow-up show that median PFS remained significantly longer with everolimus plus exemestane versus placebo plus exemestane [investigator review: 7.8 versus 3.2 months, respectively; hazard ratio = 0.45 (95% confidence interval 0.38-0.54); log-rank P < 0.0001; central review: 11.0 versus 4.1 months, respectively; hazard ratio = 0.38 (95% confidence interval 0.31-0.48); log-rank P < 0.0001] in the overall population and in all prospectively defined subgroups, including patients with visceral metastases, [corrected] and irrespective of age.The incidence and severity of adverse events were consistent with those reported at the interim analysis and in other everolimus trials.CONCLUSION: The addition of everolimus to exemestane markedly prolonged PFS in patients with HR(+) advanced BC with disease recurrence/progression following prior NSAIs.These results further support the use of everolimus plus exemestane in this patient population.ClinicalTrials.gov #NCT00863655.",1,1,1,1
22086774,"[Stem cell-induced liver regeneration].BACKGROUND: The liver has an excellent regenerative capacity after resection.However, below a critical level of future liver remnant volume (FLRV), partial hepatectomy is accompanied by a significant increase of postoperative liver failure.There is accumulating evidence for the contribution of bone marrow stem cells (BMSC) to participate in liver regeneration.Here we report our experience with portal vein embolisation (PVE) and CD133+ BMSC administration to the liver, compared with PVE alone, to augment hepatic regeneration in patients with critically low FLRV or impaired liver function.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eleven patients underwent PVE of liver segments I and IV-VIII to stimulate hepatic regeneration prior to extended right hepatectomy.In these 11 patients with a FLRV below 25% and/or limited quality of hepatic parenchyma, PVE alone did not promise adequate proliferation.These patients underwent additional BMSC administration to segments II and III.Two radiologists blinded to patients' identity and each other's results measured liver and tumour volumes with helical computed tomography.Absolute, relative and daily FLRV gains were compared with a group of patients that underwent PVE alone.RESULTS: The increase of the mean absolute FLRV after PVE with BMSC application from 239.3 mL+/-103.5 (standard deviation) to 417.1 mL+/-150.4 was significantly higher than that from 286.3 mL+/-77.1 to 395.9 mL+/-94.1 after PVE alone (p<0.05).Also the relative gain of FLRV in this group (77.3%+/-38.2%) was significantly higher than that after PVE alone (39.1%+/-20.4%) (P=0.039).In addition, the daily hepatic growth rate after PVE and BMSC application (9.5+/-4.3 mL/d) was significantly superior to that after PVE alone (4.1+/-1.9 mL/d) (p=0.03).Time to surgery was 27 days+/-11 in this group and 45 days+/-21 after PVE alone (p=0.02).Short- and long-term survival were not negatively influenced by the shorter waiting period.CONCLUSION: In patients with malignant liver lesions, the combination of PVE with CD133+ BMSC administration substantially increased hepatic regeneration compared with PVE alone.This procedure bears the potential to allow the safe resection of patients with a curative intention that would otherwise carry the risk post-operative liver failure.",0,0,0,0
29445928,"Efficacy and safety of trastuzumab, lapatinib, and paclitaxel neoadjuvant treatment with or without prolonged exposure to anti-HER2 therapy, and with or without hormone therapy for HER2-positive primary breast cancer: a randomised, five-arm, multicentre, open-label phase II trial.BACKGROUND: Dual blockade of HER2 promises increased pathological complete response (pCR) rate compared with single blockade in the presence of chemotherapy for HER2-positive (+) primary breast cancer.Many questions remain regarding optimal duration of treatment and combination impact of endocrine therapy for luminal HER2 disease.METHODS: We designed a randomised phase II, five-arm study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lapatinib and trastuzumab (6 weeks) followed by lapatinib and trastuzumab plus weekly paclitaxel (12 weeks) with/without prolongation of anti-HER2 therapy prior to chemotherapy (18 vs. 6 weeks), and with/without endocrine therapy in patients with HER2+ and/or oestrogen receptor (ER)+ disease.The primary endpoint was comprehensive pCR (CpCR) rate.Among the secondary endpoints, pCR (yT0-isyN0) rate, safety, and clinical response were evaluated.RESULTS: In total, 215 patients were enrolled; 212 were included in the full analysis set (median age 53.0 years; tumour size = T2, 65%; and tumour spread = N0, 55%).CpCR was achieved in 101 (47.9%) patients and was significantly higher in ER- patients than in ER+ patients (ER- 63.0%, ER+ 36.1%; P = 0.0034).pCR with pN0 was achieved in 42.2% of patients (ER- 57.6%, ER+ 30.3%).No significant difference was observed in pCR rate between prolonged exposure groups and standard groups.Better clinical response outcomes were obtained in the prolongation phase of the anti-HER2 therapy.No surplus was detected in pCR rate by adding endocrine treatment.No major safety concern was recognised by prolonging the anti-HER2 treatment or adding endocrine therapy.CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed the therapeutic impact of lapatinib, trastuzumab, and paclitaxel therapy for each ER- and ER+ subgroup of HER2+ patients.Development of further strategies and tools is required, particularly for luminal HER2 disease.",1,1,1,1

Prolonged PFS in arm A was confined to tumors with the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) I methylation subtype (HR 0.25, P = 0.014) and proneural gene expression (HR 0.29, P = 0.025).In a Cox model of OS controlling for established prognostic factors, associations with more favorable outcome were identified for age <70 years (HR 0.52, P = 0.018) and Karnofsky performance score 90%-100% (HR 0.51, P = 0.026).Including molecular subtypes into that model identified an association of the RTK II gene methylation subtype with inferior OS (HR 1.73, P = 0.076).Conclusion: Efficacy outcomes and exploratory analyses of ARTE do not support the hypothesis that the addition of bevacizumab to RT generally prolongs survival in elderly glioblastoma patients.Molecular biomarkers may identify patients with preferential benefit from bevacizumab.Clinical trial registration number: NCT01443676.",1,1,1,1

24627237,"Quality of life in patients with advanced gastric cancer sequentially treated with docetaxel and irinotecan with 5-fluorouracil and folinic acid (leucovin).With a median overall survival of only 9-13 months in patients with advanced gastric cancer (GC), the quality of life (QoL) during the palliative treatment remains a key issue.Furthermore, when combinations of two or three drugs are used, the impact on QoL should be carefully evaluated.This was studied within the GATAC trial in patients sequentially treated with docetaxel and irinotecan with 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin (5-Fu/Lv).Patients with previously untreated advanced GC were randomly assigned to start with docetaxel 45 mg/m(2) (arm T) or irinotecan 180 mg/m(2) (arm C) with bolus and 44 h infusion of 5-Fu/Lv (D1, q2 weeks).After four courses, there was a prescheduled crossover to the alternative regimen for four additional courses.QoL was measured with the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire at the start of the treatment, at crossover and after completing treatment with both regimens.Eighty-one patients were randomized, and 78 patients started treatment.A total of 191 completed QoL questionnaires were collected.There were no statistically significant differences in QoL scores between the two treatment groups and no changes in mean scores during the 16 weeks of treatment.During the last 8 weeks of treatment, a significantly larger portion of patients with radiological response reported sustained or better QoL scores than those with no radiological response (82 vs. 50%, p = 0.007).Chemotherapy in advanced GC did not affect QoL average scores.Patients with non-responding tumours reported more often a decline in the global QoL score.The concept of the pre-scheduled switch of chemotherapy regimens prior to progression should be further studied in this disease, as it appears effective, tolerable and not to negatively affect QoL.",0,0,0,0
30303516,"NCI 8628: A randomized phase 2 study of ziv-aflibercept and high-dose interleukin 2 or high-dose interleukin 2 alone for inoperable stage III or IV melanoma.BACKGROUND: Interleukin 2 (IL-2) is a growth factor for T and natural killer cells, promotes proinflammatory cytokines, and can lead to durable responses in patients with melanoma.Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) promotes angiogenesis and modulates host innate and adaptive immunity.High VEGF levels were found to be associated with nonresponse to IL-2.Ziv-aflibercept may deplete VEGF and thereby enhance antitumor T-cell responses, thus supporting a combination immunotherapeutic strategy with IL-2.METHODS: NCI 8628 was a phase 2 trial of ziv-aflibercept and IL-2 (arm A) versus IL-2 alone (arm B) randomized at 2:1, respectively.Eligible patients had inoperable American Joint Committee on Cancer stage III or stage IV melanoma.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS).RESULTS: A total of 89 patients were enrolled and 84 patients were treated.The median follow-up was 41.4 months.Among treated patients (55 patients in arm A and 29 patients in arm B), PFS was significantly improved in favor of arm A, with a median of 6.9 months (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 4.1-8.7 months) versus 2.3 months (95% CI, 1.6-3.5 months) (P<.001).No significant difference was noted with regard to overall survival, with a median of 26.9 months (95% CI, 14.4-63.6 months) for arm A and 24.2 months (95% CI, 11.3-36.4 months) for arm B. The response rate (according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors [RECIST]) was 22% in arm A (4 complete responses [CRs] and 8 partial responses [PRs]) and 17% in arm B (1 CR and 4 PRs).Stable disease or PR or CR was noted in 65% of patients in arm A and 48% of patients in arm B. The combination was found to be superior to monotherapy in patients with high and low levels of serum VEGF and VEGF receptor 2.Adverse events were consistent with the expected profiles of monotherapy with IL-2 and ziv-aflibercept.CONCLUSIONS: Ziv-aflibercept and IL-2 were found to significantly improve PFS compared with IL-2 alone, thereby meeting the primary endpoint of the current study.These findings support further study of immunotherapeutic combination strategies involving VEGF inhibitors.",1,1,1,1
27589688,"Primary analysis of a prospective, randomized, single-blinded phase II trial evaluating the HER2 peptide GP2 vaccine in breast cancer patients to prevent recurrence.GP2 is a HER2-derived, HLA-A2+ restricted peptide.Phase I studies showed GP2 administered with GM-CSF to be safe and immunogenic.Here we report the primary analysis of a prospective, randomized, multicenter phase II adjuvant trial conducted to determine the vaccine's efficacy.The trial enrolled HLA-A2+, clinically disease-free, node-positive and high-risk node-negative breast cancer patients with tumors expressing HER2 (immunohistochemistry[IHC] 1+-3+).Patients were randomized to GP2+GM-CSF versus GM-CSF alone.Disease-free survival (DFS) was analyzed in intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-treatment cohorts; pre-specified subgroup analyses were performed for patients with IHC 3+ or FISH+ disease.The trial enrolled 180 patients; 89 received GP2+GM-CSF and 91 received GM-CSF alone.The groups were well-matched for clinicopathologic characteristics.Toxicities have been minimal.The Kaplan-Meier estimated 5-year DFS rate in the ITT analyses was 88% (95% CI:78-94%) in vaccinated vs. 81% (95% CI:69-89%) (P = 0.43) in control patients after a 34 month median follow-up.In the per-treatment analysis, the estimated 5-year DFS rates were 94% (95% CI:83-98%) and 85% (73-92%) (P = 0.17).In IHC 3+/FISH+ patients, the estimated 5-year DFS rate was 94% (82-98%) in vaccinated patients (n = 51) vs. 89% (71-96%) in control patients (n = 50), (P = 0.86) in the ITT analyses and 100% vs. 89% (71-96%) in vaccinated vs. control patients in the per-treatment analyses (P = 0.08).While the overall ITT analysis did not demonstrate benefit to vaccination, this trial confirmed that the GP2 vaccine is safe and suggests that vaccination may have clinical activity, particularly in patients with HER2 overexpression who received the full vaccine series (ie per-treatment group).",1,1,1,1
31654838,"Patient-reported outcomes from the randomized phase III ALEX study of alectinib versus crizotinib in patients with ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer.OBJECTIVES: Alectinib demonstrated superior efficacy and a safety profile that compared favorably with crizotinib in treatment-naive ALK+ non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the phase III ALEX study.We present patient-reported outcomes (PROs) from ALEX to assess disease burden, treatment-related symptom tolerability, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) with alectinib versus crizotinib.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were randomized to receive alectinib 600 mg or crizotinib 250 mg twice daily until disease progression, death, or withdrawal.Pre-specified PRO endpoints were: mean change from baseline in symptoms, HRQoL, and functioning; and time to deterioration (TTD) in cough, dyspnea, chest pain, arm/shoulder pain, fatigue, and a composite of three symptoms (cough, dyspnea, chest pain).PRO data were collected using EORTC QLQ-C30 and LC13 questionnaires.Raw scores were standardized to a 0-100-point range, with a >/=10-point score change defined as clinically meaningful.TTD was defined as the time from randomization until confirmed clinically meaningful deterioration (i.e., a >/=10-point score change from baseline).RESULTS: Baseline completion rates and characteristics were balanced in the PRO-evaluable population (alectinib n = 100, 66%; crizotinib n = 97, 64%).On average, alectinib-treated patients reported clinically meaningful improvements in lung cancer symptoms for longer than crizotinib-treated patients.Between-treatment differences in lung cancer symptoms tended to favor alectinib from 11.1 months (45 weeks) onwards, around the time of median PFS with crizotinib (11.1 months).TTD in lung cancer symptoms was similar between treatment arms, despite longer duration of symptom improvement with alectinib; composite symptom endpoint (hazard ratio 1.10 [95% confidence interval: 0.72-1.68]).Duration of clinically meaningful improvement in HRQoL was longer with alectinib versus crizotinib (Week 88 vs. Week 68, respectively).Better patient-reported tolerability was observed with alectinib versus crizotinib on common treatment-related symptoms.CONCLUSION: PRO data support the superior efficacy and tolerability of alectinib relative to crizotinib demonstrated in the ALEX study.",1,1,1,1
27342301,"Long-Term Efficacy of Computerized Cognitive Training Among Survivors of Childhood Cancer: A Single-Blind Randomized Controlled Trial.Objective: To investigate the long-term efficacy of computerized cognitive training in improving cognitive outcomes among childhood cancer survivors.Methods: Sixty-eight survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or brain tumor (BT) were randomly assigned to computerized cognitive intervention (23 ALL/11 BT, age = 12.21 +/- 2.47) or a waitlist control group (24 ALL/10 BT, age = 11.82 +/- 2.42).Cognitive assessments were completed pre-, immediately post-, and 6 months postintervention.Results: A prior report showed training led to immediate improvement in working memory, attention and processing speed.In the current study, piecewise linear mixed effects modeling revealed that working memory and processing speed were unchanged from immediate to 6 months postintervention (intervention beta = -.04 to .01, p = .26 to .95; control beta = -.06 to .01, p = .23-.97), but group differences on an attention measure did not persist.Conclusion: Cognitive benefits are maintained 6 months following computerized cognitive training, adding to potential clinical utility of this intervention approach.",0,0,0,0

25018037,"Impact of baseline corticosteroids on survival and steroid androgens in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: exploratory analysis from COU-AA-301.BACKGROUND: Corticosteroids have been used to mitigate mineralocorticoid-related effects and restore sensitivity to abiraterone acetate.Corticosteroids may also mediate glucocorticoid receptor or mutated androgen receptor activation and adversely influence outcome.OBJECTIVE: This post hoc exploratory analysis investigated whether baseline corticosteroids were an independent prognostic factor and its level of contribution in the presence of other prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) in study COU-AA-301.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: COU-AA-301 was a randomised study of abiraterone plus prednisone versus prednisone in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients after docetaxel.INTERVENTION: Patients were randomised 2:1 to abiraterone 1000 mg plus prednisone 5mg by mouth twice daily versus prednisone.OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Association of OS with baseline corticosteroids was determined by univariate and multivariate Cox models.RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: At study entry, 33% of patients received corticosteroids, had worse disease characteristics (p<0.05 except liver metastases), and were more likely to have testosterone levels below the median (odds ratio:2.92; chi-square p<0.0001).Associations between prostate-specific antigen response as well as circulating tumour cell decline and higher baseline androgen levels were demonstrated.Patients taking baseline corticosteroids had inferior OS in univariate analysis (hazard ratio: 1.48; p<0.0001); however, in multivariate stepwise selection modelling, baseline corticosteroids did not add substantially to the model.This analysis is limited as a retrospective analysis and restricted to patients after docetaxel.CONCLUSIONS: In the COU-AA-301 study, baseline corticosteroids were associated with adverse prognostic features, inferior OS, and lower baseline androgen levels but did not add substantial information to the final prognostic model.Thus in these data from study COU-AA-301, concurrent baseline corticosteroids did not have an independent impact on OS.PATIENT SUMMARY: Baseline corticosteroids did not adversely affect abiraterone clinical benefit in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.Their use was associated with patients having worse disease characteristics.",1,1,1,1
30216191,"Randomised trial of HPV self-sampling among non-attenders in the Slovenian cervical screening programme ZORA: comparing three different screening approaches.Background To overcome obstacles within the Slovenian organised cervical cancer screening programme, a randomised pilot study of human papillomavirus (HPV) self-sampling among non-attenders was performed, aiming to assess three different screening approaches.Participants and methods Non-attenders aged 30-64 years from two Slovenian regions were randomised to two HPV self-sampling groups-the opt-in (I1, n = 14.400) and the opt-out (I2, n = 9.556), with a control group (P, n = 2.600).Self-collected samples were analysed using the Hybrid Capture 2 assay.HPV-positive women were invited to a colposcopy.The overall and type-specific intention-to-screen response rates and histological outcomes with a positive predictive value (PPV) according to the women's age, the screening approach, the level of protection resulting from previous screening history, and the region of residence were assessed.Results Of the 26.556 women enrolled, 8.972 (33.8%) responded with self-sample for HPV testing and/or traditional cytology within one year of enrolment.Response rates were 37.7%, 34.0% and 18.4% (p < 0.050) for opt-out, opt-in and control groups.Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)2+ was diagnosed in 3.9/1.000, 3.4/1.000, and 3.1/1.000 women (p > 0.050), respectively.PPV of the HPV self-sampling was 12.0% and 9.6% for CIN2+ and CIN3+.The highest PPV was obtained in non-attenders in screening programme for more than 10-years and concordant results of HPV testing with 40.8% for CIN2+ and 38.8% for CIN3+.Conclusions The results of our study show that a high response to HPV self-sampling can be achieved also in an opt-in approach, if women are encouraged to choose between self-sampling at home and screening with gynaecologist.In addition, clinically important risk difference for a high-grade cervical lesion exists in the case of a positive result of HPV testing on self-collected samples, depending on the length of the interval since last screening.Stratified management of these women should be strongly considered.Women who were not screened with cytology for at least 10 years should be referred to immediate colposcopy for histology verification instead to delayed re-testing.",0,0,0,0
24793078,"A randomized trial of the effectiveness of topical ""ABH Gel"" (Ativan((R)), Benadryl((R)), Haldol((R))) vs. placebo in cancer patients with nausea.CONTEXT: The topical gel known as ""ABH gel,"" comprising lorazepam (Ativan((R))), diphenhydramine (Benadryl((R))), and haloperidol (Haldol((R))), is frequently used to treat nausea because of its perceived efficacy, relatively low cost, and ease of use in the home setting.There are limited scientific data on this medication, however.Recent pilot studies showed no absorption of the active ingredients of the gel, prompting further prospective studies into the cause of the perceived efficacy in the clinical setting.OBJECTIVES: To determine any difference in the effectiveness of ABH gel compared with placebo in cancer patients with nausea.METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, noninferiority clinical trial was developed to test the hypothesis that there is no difference in the effectiveness of ABH gel compared with placebo in cancer patients with nausea.The primary outcome was the difference in nausea score (on a 0-10 scale) at baseline and at 60 minutes in each treatment group.The difference in the ABH gel-treated group compared with placebo was evaluated for noninferiority.Secondary outcomes included the number of vomiting episodes and side effects over time.RESULTS: The mean change in nausea score from baseline to 60 minutes after treatment in the ABH gel group was 1.7 +/- 2.05 and 0.9 +/- 2.45 for the placebo group (P = 0.42).The placebo group was found to be noninferior to the ABH gel group in reducing the nausea score.ABH gel also did not decrease vomiting events better than placebo (P = 0.34).Only one patient reported any side effects from the treatments in either arm of the study.CONCLUSION: ABH gel in its current formulation should not be used in cancer patients experiencing nausea.",0,0,0,0
22559906,"A nurse practitioner directed intervention improves the quality of life of patients with metastatic cancer: results of a randomized pilot study.BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of randomized studies evaluating the value of palliative interventions on a prospective basis in newly diagnosed oncology patients.We sought to prospectively evaluate quality of life (QoL) outcomes in advanced cancer patients who received discussion-based palliative care interventions from an advanced registered nurse practitioner (ARNP) integrated into the oncology team, and compare these outcomes with a control population.METHODS: Patients with metastatic cancer were randomized to standard care or an ARNP-directed intervention that included discussions of the benefits of hospice, discussions on living wills and advanced directives (Five Wishes document) along with an assessment of QoL. Relevant endpoints included change from baseline QoL and improvement in hospice knowledge.RESULTS: From November 13, 2008, through July 28, 2009, 26 patients were accrued at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida.The study closed early due to published data demonstrating the benefits of early palliative care interventions in the management of metastatic cancer patients.Statistically significant improvements from baseline were noted in emotional and mental QoL assessments in the intervention group that were not seen in the control group.Patients found it useful to have the living will and Five Wishes documents offered as part of the ARNP intervention.CONCLUSIONS: An ARNP-directed intervention that explains the benefits of hospice and addresses advanced directives early in the course of metastatic cancer patients' treatment, is well received by the patients and their relatives and leads to measurable improvement in the patient's emotional and mental QoL.",1,1,0,0
30386984,"Short-term surgical outcomes of laparoscopy-assisted versus open D2 distal gastrectomy for locally advanced gastric cancer in North China: a multicenter randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Although laparoscopic surgery has been recommended as an optional therapy for patients with early gastric cancer, whether patients with locally advanced gastric cancer (AGC) could benefit from laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy (LADG) with D2 lymphadenectomy remains elusive due to a lack of comprehensive clinical data.To evaluate the efficacy of LADG, we conducted a multi-institutional randomized controlled trial to compare laparoscopy-assisted versus open distal gastrectomy (ODG) for AGC in North China.METHODS: In this RCT, after patients were enrolled according to the eligibility criteria, they were preoperatively assigned to LADG or ODG arm randomly with a 1:1 allocation ratio.The primary endpoint was the morbidity and mortality within 30 postoperative days to evaluate the surgical safety of LADG.The secondary endpoint was 3-year disease-free survival.This trial was registered at ClinicalTrial.gov as NCT02464215.RESULTS: Between March 2014 and August 2017, a total of 446 patients with cT2-4aN0-3M0 (AJCC 7th staging system) were enrolled.Of these, 222 patients underwent LADG and 220 patients underwent ODG were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis.The compliance rate of D2 lymph node dissection was identical between the LADG and ODG arms (99.5%, P = 1.000).No significant difference was observed regarding the overall postoperative complication rate in two groups (LADG 13.1%, ODG 17.7%, P = 0.174).No operation-related death occurred in both arms.CONCLUSIONS: This trial confirmed that LADG performed by credentialed surgeons was safe and feasible for patients with AGC compared with conventional ODG.",1,1,1,1
24076063,"Neoadjuvant treatment of endometrial cancer using anastrozole: a randomised pilot study.OBJECTIVE: Excessive oestrogenic stimulation is a well-known risk factor for the development and progression of endometrial cancer.Aromatase is the key enzyme which catalyses the conversion of androgens to oestrogens in postmenopausal women.Inhibition of aromatase may therefore be a useful strategy in the management of endometrial cancer.A pilot study was designed to assess the feasibility of a neoadjuvant model and understand the biological effects of anastrozole, an aromatase inhibitor, in the treatment of endometrial cancer.METHODS: Patients with endometrial cancer who consented to participate in the study were randomised to receive anastrozole or placebo for a minimum of 14 days prior to definitive surgery.Endometrial samples were obtained before and after treatment.Immunohistochemistry was performed to ascertain the expression of oestrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha), progesterone receptor (PR), androgen receptor (AR), ki-67 and Bcl2 before and after treatment in glands and stroma of the endometrium.RESULTS: A total of 16 patients were randomised to the anastrozole arm and 8 to the placebo arm (2:1 randomisation).A significant decrease in the glandular expression of ERalpha and AR was observed in the anastrozole arm.There was no significant change in the expression of PR or Bcl2.Expression of ki-67, a proliferation marker, also decreased significantly following treatment with anastrozole.CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with anastrozole caused a significant decrease in proliferation as demonstrated by decreased ki-67 expression.A large randomised controlled trial is warranted to fully assess the role of anastrozole in the neoadjuvant treatment of endometrial cancer.",1,1,1,1

26714164,"Influence of tumour burden on trastuzumab pharmacokinetics in HER2 positive non-metastatic breast cancer.AIMS: Trastuzumab, an antibody binding to epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), has been approved to treat HER2-positive breast cancer in different settings.This study aimed at evaluating the influence of tumour size on trastuzumab pharmacokinetics (PK) in non-metastatic breast cancer patients treated with short term pre-operative trastuzumab.METHODS: Trastuzumab PK data were obtained from a multicentre, randomized and comparative study.This antibody was administered pre-operatively to patients with localized HER2-positive breast cancer as a single 4 mg kg(-1) loading dose followed by 5 weekly 2 mg kg(-1) doses.Trastuzumab concentrations were measured repeatedly using an ELISA technique.Tumour size was evaluated at baseline using breast echography.Trastuzumab pharmacokinetics were studied using a population approach and a two compartment model.The influence of tumour burden on trastuzumab pharmacokinetics was quantified as a covariate.RESULTS: A total of 784 trastuzumab concentrations were available from the 79 eligible patients.Estimated parameters (interindiviual standard deviation) were central volume of distribution =2.1 l (23%), peripheral volume of distribution =1.3 l (38%), intercompartment clearance =0.36 l day(-1) , with an elimination half-life of 11.8 days.Typical clearance was 0.22 l day(-1) (19%) and its value was increased with tumour size.In patients with the highest tumour size, trastuzumab clearance was 50% [18%-92%] higher than in patients with the lowest tumour size.CONCLUSIONS: In non-metastatic breast cancer patients, trastuzumab clearance increases with tumour size.The elimination half-life of trastuzumab was shorter in the present population of patients than in metastatic breast cancer patients previously studied.",0,0,0,0
26438237,"The effects of short-term fasting on tolerance to (neo) adjuvant chemotherapy in HER2-negative breast cancer patients: a randomized pilot study.BACKGROUND: Preclinical evidence shows that short-term fasting (STF) protects healthy cells against side effects of chemotherapy and makes cancer cells more vulnerable to it.This pilot study examines the feasibility of STF and its effects on tolerance of chemotherapy in a homogeneous patient group with early breast cancer (BC).METHODS: Eligible patients had HER2-negative, stage II/III BC.Women receiving (neo)-adjuvant TAC (docetaxel/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide) were randomized to fast 24 h before and after commencing chemotherapy, or to eat according to the guidelines for healthy nutrition.Toxicity in the two groups was compared.Chemotherapy-induced DNA damage in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was quantified by the level of gamma-H2AX analyzed by flow cytometry.RESULTS: Thirteen patients were included of whom seven were randomized to the STF arm.STF was well tolerated.Mean erythrocyte- and thrombocyte counts 7 days post-chemotherapy were significantly higher (P = 0.007, 95 % CI 0.106-0.638 and P = 0.00007, 95 % CI 38.7-104, respectively) in the STF group compared to the non-STF group.Non-hematological toxicity did not differ between the groups.Levels of gamma-H2AX were significantly increased 30 min post-chemotherapy in CD45 + CD3- cells in non-STF, but not in STF patients.CONCLUSIONS: STF during chemotherapy was well tolerated and reduced hematological toxicity of TAC in HER2-negative BC patients.Moreover, STF may reduce a transient increase in, and/or induce a faster recovery of DNA damage in PBMCs after chemotherapy.Larger studies, investigating a longer fasting period, are required to generate more insight into the possible benefits of STF during chemotherapy.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01304251 , March 2011.",1,1,1,1

29648580,"Bevacizumab plus hypofractionated radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone in elderly patients with glioblastoma: the randomized, open-label, phase II ARTE trial.Background: The addition of bevacizumab to temozolomide-based chemoradiotherapy (TMZ/RT --> TMZ) did not prolong overall survival (OS) in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma in phase III trials.Elderly and frail patients are underrepresented in clinical trials, but early reports suggested preferential benefit in this population.Patients and methods: ARTE was a 2 : 1 randomized, multi-center, open-label, non-comparative phase II trial of hypofractionated RT (40 Gy in 15 fractions) with bevacizumab (10 mg/kgx14 days) (arm A, N = 50) or without bevacizumab (arm B, N = 25) in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma aged >/=65 years.The primary objective was to obtain evidence for prolongation of median OS by the addition of bevacizumab to RT.Response was assessed by RANO criteria.Quality of life (QoL) was monitored by the EORTC QLQ-C30/BN20 modules.Exploratory studies included molecular subtyping by 450k whole methylome and gene expression analyses.Results: Median PFS was longer in arm A than in arm B (7.6 and 4.8 months, P = 0.003), but OS was similar (12.1 and 12.2 months, P = 0.77).Clinical deterioration was delayed and more patients came off steroids in arm A. Prolonged PFS in arm A was confined to tumors with the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) I methylation subtype (HR 0.25, P = 0.014) and proneural gene expression (HR 0.29, P = 0.025).In a Cox model of OS controlling for established prognostic factors, associations with more favorable outcome were identified for age <70 years (HR 0.52, P = 0.018) and Karnofsky performance score 90%-100% (HR 0.51, P = 0.026).Including molecular subtypes into that model identified an association of the RTK II gene methylation subtype with inferior OS (HR 1.73, P = 0.076).Conclusion: Efficacy outcomes and exploratory analyses of ARTE do not support the hypothesis that the addition of bevacizumab to RT generally prolongs survival in elderly glioblastoma patients.Molecular biomarkers may identify patients with preferential benefit from bevacizumab.Clinical trial registration number: NCT01443676.",1,1,1,1

29445928,"Efficacy and safety of trastuzumab, lapatinib, and paclitaxel neoadjuvant treatment with or without prolonged exposure to anti-HER2 therapy, and with or without hormone therapy for HER2-positive primary breast cancer: a randomised, five-arm, multicentre, open-label phase II trial.BACKGROUND: Dual blockade of HER2 promises increased pathological complete response (pCR) rate compared with single blockade in the presence of chemotherapy for HER2-positive (+) primary breast cancer.Many questions remain regarding optimal duration of treatment and combination impact of endocrine therapy for luminal HER2 disease.METHODS: We designed a randomised phase II, five-arm study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lapatinib and trastuzumab (6 weeks) followed by lapatinib and trastuzumab plus weekly paclitaxel (12 weeks) with/without prolongation of anti-HER2 therapy prior to chemotherapy (18 vs. 6 weeks), and with/without endocrine therapy in patients with HER2+ and/or oestrogen receptor (ER)+ disease.The primary endpoint was comprehensive pCR (CpCR) rate.Among the secondary endpoints, pCR (yT0-isyN0) rate, safety, and clinical response were evaluated.RESULTS: In total, 215 patients were enrolled; 212 were included in the full analysis set (median age 53.0 years; tumour size = T2, 65%; and tumour spread = N0, 55%).CpCR was achieved in 101 (47.9%) patients and was significantly higher in ER- patients than in ER+ patients (ER- 63.0%, ER+ 36.1%; P = 0.0034).pCR with pN0 was achieved in 42.2% of patients (ER- 57.6%, ER+ 30.3%).No significant difference was observed in pCR rate between prolonged exposure groups and standard groups.Better clinical response outcomes were obtained in the prolongation phase of the anti-HER2 therapy.No surplus was detected in pCR rate by adding endocrine treatment.No major safety concern was recognised by prolonging the anti-HER2 treatment or adding endocrine therapy.CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed the therapeutic impact of lapatinib, trastuzumab, and paclitaxel therapy for each ER- and ER+ subgroup of HER2+ patients.Development of further strategies and tools is required, particularly for luminal HER2 disease.",1,1,1,1
28209746,"A Phase II Randomized Trial (GO27827) of First-Line FOLFOX Plus Bevacizumab with or Without the MET Inhibitor Onartuzumab in Patients with Metastatic Colorectal Cancer.BACKGROUND: Dysregulated hepatocyte growth factor/mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) signaling is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to vascular endothelial growth factor inhibition in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).We report outcomes from a double-blind, multicenter phase II trial of the MET inhibitor onartuzumab in combination with mFOLFOX-6 and bevacizumab for mCRC (GO27827; NCT01418222).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive onartuzumab (10 mg/kg intravenously [IV]) or placebo plus mFOLFOX-6 and bevacizumab (5 mg/kg IV).Oxaliplatin was given for 8-12 cycles; other agents were continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or death.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) in the intent-to-treat (ITT) and MET immunohistochemistry (IHC) expression-positive populations.RESULTS: Between September 2011 and November 2012, 194 patients were enrolled.In September 2013, an interim analysis recommended stopping onartuzumab treatment due to lack of efficacy.At the time of the final analysis in February 2014, no significant improvement in PFS was seen with onartuzumab versus placebo in either the ITT or MET IHC-positive populations.An improvement in PFS was noted in the MET IHC-negative population.Neither overall survival nor response rate was improved with onartuzumab.The incidence of fatigue, peripheral edema, and deep vein thrombosis was increased with onartuzumab relative to placebo.CONCLUSION: Onartuzumab combined with mFOLFOX-6 and bevacizumab did not significantly improve efficacy outcomes in either the ITT or MET IHC-positive populations.MET expression by IHC was not a predictive biomarker in this setting.The Oncologist 2017;22:264-271 IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The addition of onartuzumab to mFOLFOX-6 plus bevacizumab did not improve outcomes in patients with previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer in this randomized, phase II study.Although initial results with onartuzumab were promising, a number of phase II/III clinical trials have reported a lack of improvement in efficacy with onartuzumab combined with standard-of-care therapies in several tumor types.Furthermore, negative study data have been published for rilotumumab and ficlatuzumab, both of which block hepatocyte growth factor binding to the mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) receptor.MET immunohistochemistry was not a predictive biomarker.It remains to be seen if other biomarkers or small molecule inhibitors may be more appropriate for inhibiting this oncogenic pathway.",1,1,1,1
28111430,"Incorporating Erlotinib or Irinotecan Plus Cisplatin into Chemoradiotherapy for Stage III Non-small Cell Lung Cancer According to EGFR Mutation Status.PURPOSE: Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) is the standard care for stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients; however, a more effective regimen is needed to improve the outcome by better controlling occult metastases.We conducted two parallel randomized phase II studies to incorporate erlotinib or irinotecan-cisplatin (IP) into CCRT for stage III NSCLC depending on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation status.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with EGFR-mutant tumors were randomized to receive three cycles of erlotinib first and then either CCRT with erlotinib followed by erlotinib (arm A) or CCRT with IP only (arm B).Patients with EGFR unknown or wild-type tumors were randomized to receive either three cycles of IP before (arm C) or after CCRT with IP (arm D).RESULTS: Seventy-three patients were screened and the study was closed early because of slow accrual after 59 patients were randomized.Overall, there were seven patients in arm A, five in arm B, 22 in arm C, and 25 in arm D. The response rate was 71.4% and 80.0% for arm A and B, and 70.0% and 73.9% for arm C and D. The median overall survival (OS) was 39.3 months versus 31.2 months for arm A and B (p=0.442), and 16.3 months versus 25.3 months for arm C and D (p=0.050).Patients with sensitive EGFR mutations had significantly longer OS than EGFR-wild patients (74.8 months vs. 25.3 months, p=0.034).There were no unexpected toxicities.CONCLUSION: Combined-modality treatment by molecular diagnostics is feasible in stage III NSCLC.EGFR-mutant patients appear to be a distinct subset with longer survival.",1,1,1,1
27020655,"Alterations of Cyclooxygenase-2 Methylation Levels Before and After Intervention Trial to Prevent Gastric Cancer in a Chinese Population.To explore the epigenetic mechanisms underlying the effects of anti-Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) alone and combined with COX-2 inhibitor (celecoxib), we dynamically evaluated the associations between COX-2 methylation alterations and gastric lesion evolution during the process of interventions.In a total of 809 trial participants COX-2 methylation levels were quantitatively detected before and after treatment.The self-comparison at the same stomach site for each subject showed significant methylation alteration differences among intervention groups (P < 0.001).With placebo group as reference, COX-2 methylation levels were decreased in anti-H. pylori [OR, 3.30; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.16-5.02], celecoxib (OR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.36-3.07), and anti-H. pylori followed by celecoxib (OR, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.38-3.17) groups.When stratified by baseline histology, the three active arms significantly decreased COX-2 methylation levels in indefinite dysplasia/dysplasia subjects, and ORs were 3.65 (95% CI, 1.96-6.80) for anti-H. pylori, 2.43 (95% CI 1.34-4.39) for celecoxib, and 2.80 (95% CI, 1.52-5.15) for anti-H. pylori followed by celecoxib, respectively.No additive effect on COX-2 methylation was found for anti-H. pylori followed by celecoxib than two treatments alone.Compared with subjects without methylation reduction, higher opportunity for gastric lesion regression was found in subjects with decreased COX-2 methylation levels, especially for indefinite dysplasia/dysplasia subjects (OR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.03-3.60).These findings suggest that anti-H. pylori or celecoxib treatment alone could decrease COX-2 methylation levels in gastric mucosa.COX-2 methylation alteration was associated with the regression of indefinite dysplasia/dysplasia, which might serve as a potential biomarker for chemoprevention efficacy.Cancer Prev Res; 9(6); 484-90.(c)2016 AACR.",0,0,0,0
25722381,"A randomized phase II study of the MEK1/MEK2 inhibitor trametinib (GSK1120212) compared with docetaxel in KRAS-mutant advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)dagger.BACKGROUND: KRAS mutations are detected in 25% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and no targeted therapies are approved for this subset population.Trametinib, a selective allosteric inhibitor of MEK1/MEK2, demonstrated preclinical and clinical activity in KRAS-mutant NSCLC.We report a phase II trial comparing trametinib with docetaxel in patients with advanced KRAS-mutant NSCLC.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients with histologically confirmed KRAS-mutant NSCLC previously treated with one prior platinum-based chemotherapy were randomly assigned in a ratio of 2 : 1 to trametinib (2 mg orally once daily) or docetaxel (75 mg/m(2) i.v.every 3 weeks).Crossover to the other arm after disease progression was allowed.Primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS).The study was prematurely terminated after the interim analysis of 92 PFS events, which showed the comparison of trametinib versus docetaxel for PFS crossed the futility boundary.RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-nine patients with KRAS-mutant NSCLC were randomized; of which, 86 patients received trametinib and 43 received docetaxel.Median PFS was 12 weeks in the trametinib arm and 11 weeks in the docetaxel arm (hazard ratio [HR] 1.14; 95% CI 0.75-1.75; P = 0.5197).Median overall survival, while the data are immature, was 8 months in the trametinib arm and was not reached in the docetaxel arm (HR 0.97; 95% CI 0.52-1.83; P = 0.934).There were 10 (12%) partial responses (PRs) in the trametinib arm and 5 (12%) PRs in the docetaxel arm (P = 1.0000).The most frequent adverse events (AEs) in >/=20% of trametinib patients were rash, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue.The most frequent grade 3 treatment-related AEs in the trametinib arm were hypertension, rash, diarrhea, and asthenia.CONCLUSION: Trametinib showed similar PFS and a response rate as docetaxel in patients with previously treated KRAS-mutant-positive NSCLC.CLINICALTRIALSGOV REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT01362296.",1,1,1,1
24206578,"Expression of CD56 is an unfavorable prognostic factor for acute promyelocytic leukemia with higher initial white blood cell counts.Expression of CD56 has recently been introduced as one of the adverse prognostic factors in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL).However, the clinical significance of CD56 antigen in APL has not been well elucidated.We assessed the clinical significance of CD56 antigen in 239 APL patients prospectively treated with all-trans retinoic acid and chemotherapy according to the Japan Adult Leukemia Study Group APL97 protocol.All patients were prospectively treated by the Japan Adult Leukemia Study Group APL97 protocol.The median follow-up period was 8.5 years.Positive CD56 expression was found in 23 APL patients (9.6%).Expression of CD56 was significantly associated with lower platelet count (P = 0.04), severe disseminated intravascular coagulation (P = 0.04), and coexpression of CD2 (P = 0.03), CD7 (P = 0.04), CD34 (P < 0.01) and/or human leukocyte antigen-DR (P < 0.01).Complete remission rate and overall survival were not different between the two groups.However, cumulative incidence of relapse and event-free survival (EFS) showed an inferior trend in CD56(+) APL (P = 0.08 and P = 0.08, respectively).Among patients with initial white blood cell counts of 3.0 x 10(9)/L or more, EFS and cumulative incidence of relapse in CD56(+) APL were significantly worse (30.8% vs 63.6%, P = 0.008, and 53.8% vs 28.9%, P = 0.03, respectively), and in multivariate analysis, CD56 expression was an unfavorable prognostic factor for EFS (P = 0.04).In conclusion, for APL with higher initial white blood cell counts, CD56 expression should be regarded as an unfavorable prognostic factor.",0,0,0,0
23657629,"Activation, dysfunction and retention of T cells in vaccine sites after injection of incomplete Freund's adjuvant, with or without peptide.We conducted a randomized clinical trial in 45 patients with resected AJCC stage IIB-IV melanoma to characterize cellular and molecular events at sites of immunization with incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) alone, or a melanoma vaccine in IFA.At a primary vaccine site, all patients received a multi-peptide melanoma vaccine in IFA.At a replicate vaccine site, which was biopsied, group 1 received IFA only; group 2 received vaccine in IFA.Lymphocytes isolated from replicate vaccine site microenvironments (VSME) were compared to time-matched peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in ELISpot and flow cytometry assays.Compared to PBMC, the VSME had fewer naive and greater proportions of effector memory CD8(+) T cells (TCD8).The vast majority of TCD8 within the VSME were activated (CD69(+)), with a concentration of antigen-specific (tetramer(pos)) cells in the VSME, particularly in vaccine sites with peptide (group 2).CXCR3(+) lymphocytes were concentrated in the VSME of all patients, suggesting IFA-induced chemokine recruitment.TCD8 expression of retention integrins alphaEbeta7 and alpha1beta1 was elevated in VSME, with the highest levels observed in antigen-specific cells in VSME containing peptide (group 2).TCD8 retained in the VSME of both groups were strikingly dysfunctional, with minimal IFN-gamma production in response to peptide stimulation and few tetramer(pos) cells producing IFN-gamma.These data suggest that vaccine-induced selective retention and dysfunction of antigen-specific TCD8 within VSME may represent a significant mechanism underlying transient immune responses and low clinical response rates to peptide vaccines administered in IFA.",0,0,0,0

31080129,"Diagnostic accuracy of whole-body MRI versus standard imaging pathways for metastatic disease in newly diagnosed non-small-cell lung cancer: the prospective Streamline L trial.BACKGROUND: Whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (WB-MRI) could be an alternative to multi-modality staging of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but its diagnostic accuracy, effect on staging times, number of tests needed, cost, and effect on treatment decisions are unknown.We aimed to prospectively compare the diagnostic accuracy and efficiency of WB-MRI-based staging pathways with standard pathways in NSCLC.METHODS: The Streamline L trial was a prospective, multicentre trial done in 16 hospitals in England.Eligible patients were 18 years or older, with newly diagnosed NSCLC that was potentially radically treatable on diagnostic chest CT (defined as stage IIIb or less).Exclusion criteria were severe systemic disease, pregnancy, contraindications to MRI, or histologies other than NSCLC.Patients underwent WB-MRI, the result of which was withheld until standard staging investigations were complete and the first treatment decision made.The multidisciplinary team recorded its treatment decision based on standard investigations, then on the WB-MRI staging pathway (WB-MRI plus additional tests generated), and finally on all tests.The primary outcome was difference in per-patient sensitivity for metastases between standard and WB-MRI staging pathways against a consensus reference standard at 12 months, in the per-protocol population.Secondary outcomes were difference in per-patient specificity for metastatic disease detection between standard and WB-MRI staging pathways, differences in treatment decisions, staging efficiency (time taken, test number, and costs) and per-organ sensitivity and specificity for metastases and per-patient agreement for local T and N stage.This trial is registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial registry, number ISRCTN50436483, and is complete.FINDINGS: Between Feb 26, 2013, and Sept 5, 2016, 976 patients were screened for eligibility.353 patients were recruited, 187 of whom completed the trial; 52 (28%) had metastasis at baseline.Pathway sensitivity was 50% (95% CI 37-63) for WB-MRI and 54% (41-67) for standard pathways, a difference of 4% (-7 to 15, p=0.73).No adverse events related to imaging were reported.Specificity did not differ between WB-MRI (93% [88-96]) and standard pathways (95% [91-98], p=0.45).Agreement with the multidisciplinary team's final treatment decision was 98% for WB-MRI and 99% for the standard pathway.Time to complete staging was shorter for WB-MRI (13 days [12-14]) than for the standard pathway (19 days [17-21]); a 6-day (4-8) difference.The number of tests required was similar WB-MRI (one [1-1]) and standard pathways (one [1-2]).Mean per-patient costs were pound317 (273-361) for WBI-MRI and pound620 (574-666) for standard pathways.INTERPRETATION: WB-MRI staging pathways have similar accuracy to standard pathways, and reduce the staging time and costs.FUNDING: UK National Institute for Health Research.",0,0,0,0
31338575,"Effects of an antiadhesive agent on functional recovery of the greater auricular nerve after parotidectomy: a double-blind randomized controlled trial.PURPOSE: Periauricular sensory deficit occurs frequently after parotidectomy even in cases with preservation of the greater auricular nerve (GAN).This study was performed to evaluate the effects of antiadhesive agent in functional recovery of the GAN after parotidectomy.METHODS: Ninety-eight patients undergoing partial parotidectomy for benign parotid tumors were prospectively enrolled in this multicenter, double-blind randomized controlled study and randomly assigned to either the study or control group.Antiadhesive agent was applied in the study group.The results of sensory tests (tactile, heat, and cold sensitivity) and a questionnaire on quality of life (QoL) were acquired at postoperative 1, 8, and 24 weeks after surgery.Clinical parameters, and the results of the sensory tests and the questionnaire, were compared between the two groups.RESULTS: A total of 80 patients were finally enrolled.On sensory evaluation, tactile sensation and warm sensation in the ear lobule, and warm sensation in the mastoid area, showed significant improvement at 24 weeks postoperatively in the study group.There were no significant differences between the two groups on any questions in the QoL questionnaire, at any follow-up time point.CONCLUSIONS: Antiadhesive agents have some positive effects on functional recovery of the GAN after parotidectomy.Therefore, applying antiadhesive agents after parotidectomy can reduce discomfort in patients.",0,0,0,0
28412590,"Baseline carcinoembryonic antigen as a predictive factor of ramucirumab efficacy in RAISE, a second-line metastatic colorectal carcinoma phase III trial.BACKGROUND: The RAISE phase III clinical trial demonstrated that ramucirumab + (folinic acid plus 5-fluorouracil plus irinotecan) FOLFIRI significantly improved overall survival (OS) versus placebo + FOLFIRI for second-line metastatic colorectal carcinoma (mCRC) patients failing bevacizumab- and oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.73-0.98, P = 0.022).Post hoc analyses of RAISE patient data examined the association of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) subgroups with efficacy parameters.METHODS: CEA subgroups (</=10 versus >10 ng/ml) were based on 2X upper limit of normal (ULN) (5 ng/ml).The Kaplan-Meier method estimated the median OS and the progression-free survival (PFS).Log-rank test compared the survival distributions within the subgroups.Hazard ratio (HR) (95% confidence interval [CI]) and treatment-by-subgroup interaction p-values were calculated by Cox proportional hazards model.RESULTS: Ramucirumab treatment prolonged survival for the CEA </=10 subgroup (HR = 0.68; 95% CI = 0.50-0.92; P = 0.013) and CEA >10 subgroup (HR = 0.90; 95% CI = 0.76-1.07; P = 0.233).However, the ramucirumab OS benefit over placebo was greater for the CEA </=10 subgroup than for the CEA >10 subgroup (median OS: 3.6 versus 0.8 months greater, respectively).The interaction P-value between CEA level and treatment effect on OS was 0.088.This trend was observed across randomisation strata and to a lesser extent for PFS (P = 0.594).CONCLUSIONS: Although patients in both high- and low-CEA subgroups derive OS and PFS benefits from ramucirumab treatment, the low baseline CEA level may identify a subgroup of patients with mCRC who obtain greater benefit from ramucirumab.",1,1,1,1
22795435,"American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z4099/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 1021: a randomized study of sublobar resection compared with stereotactic body radiotherapy for high-risk stage I non-small cell lung cancer.During the past decade, tremendous interest has arisen in the use of nonoperative therapies for patients with non-small cell lung cancer.Of these therapies, stereotactic body radiotherapy has become established as an effective modality for treating peripheral cancer in medically inoperable patients.Toxicity is low, and the treatment is effective, with excellent local control rates.Several investigators have suggested that stereotactic body radiotherapy could be effective for high-risk operable patients (usually treated with sublobar resection) and even perhaps for standard-risk operable patients (usually treated with lobectomy); however, this is less accepted.A direct comparison of stereotactic body radiotherapy and sublobar resection is difficult for a number of reasons.These include different definitions of recurrence, different populations of patients in these studies (with those undergoing stereotactic body radiotherapy tending to be the medically inoperable group), and different methods of classifying morbidity in the surgical and radiation oncology studies.Imaging follow-up has also not been standardized among the studies.Thus, a randomized study is necessary and timely.Investigators from the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group and the Radiation Therapy and Oncology Group have collaborated to develop a phase III randomized study comparing stereotactic body radiotherapy and sublobar resection (with or without brachytherapy) for high-risk operable patients with non-small cell lung cancer.This study (American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z4099/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 1021) has recently opened for accrual.It is hoped that this will help to better define the role of these therapies for patients with non-small cell lung cancer.",0,0,0,0
25982801,"Prostate genetic score (PGS-33) is independently associated with risk of prostate cancer in the PLCO trial.BACKGROUND: To investigate the ability of the prostate genetic score (PGS-33), a germ-line biomarker of prostate cancer (PCa) risk, to categorize men participating in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial.METHODS: We obtained the genetic data from the Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility (CGEMS), a nested case control study examining germ-line DNA in the screened arm of the PLCO trial.A PGS-33 was calculated based on their genotype at 33 PCa associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).The primary outcome was the diagnosis of PCa and primary predictor was PGS-33.RESULTS: We identified 2,244 subjects (no cancer, N = 1017) and cases (N = 1227).The PGS-33 (P<0.001), prostate specific antigen (PSA; P < 0.001), family history of PCa (< 0.001), abnormal digital rectal exam (DRE, P < 0.001), and history of ever smoking (P = 0.037) were associated with a PCa diagnosis.In multivariable analysis, the log (PGS-33) was associated with PCa diagnosis with an odds ratio of 1.68 (95% CI 1.36-2.08, P < 0.001), log (PSA) (OR 8.2; 95% CI 6.75-10.04, P < 0.001), and family history of PCa (OR 2.01; 95% CI 1.26-3.20, P = 0.003).PGS-33 quartiles noted an increasing rate of PCa detection in addition to PSA: 43.2% (Q1), 47.8% (Q2), 58.8% (Q3), and 69.4 (Q4) (P < 0.001) and improvement in PSA performance (P < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Germ-line DNA in the form of the PGS-33 is able to risk stratify men regarding their risk of PCa.The PGS-33 may have implications regarding who may benefit most from PCa screening and possibly add to PSA performance.",0,0,0,0
30150014,"Erlotinib versus vinorelbine plus cisplatin as adjuvant therapy in Chinese patients with stage IIIA EGFR mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (EVAN): a randomised, open-label, phase 2 trial.BACKGROUND: Adjuvant chemotherapy after radical resection of stage IIIA non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has quite poor outcomes.We aimed to investigate whether adjuvant erlotinib therapy improves 2-year disease-free survival compared with chemotherapy in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation-positive stage IIIA NSCLC.METHODS: In this randomised, open-label, phase 2 trial, eligible patients aged 18-75 years who had undergone complete (R0) resection of histologically or pathologically confirmed stage IIIA EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC and had not received any previous anticancer therapies were enrolled.Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either adjuvant erlotinib (150 mg once daily administered orally) or vinorelbine and cisplatin chemotherapy (four cycles of vinorelbine [25 mg/m(2) intravenously on days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle] plus cisplatin [75 mg/m(2) intravenously on day 1 of each 21-day cycle]).Randomisation was done by Simon's minimisation with a random element and was stratified by EGFR activating mutation type (exon 19 vs 21), histology (adenocarcinoma vs non-adenocarcinoma), and smoking status (smoker vs non-smoker).The primary endpoint in the unblinded intention-to-treat analysis was 2-year disease-free survival.This ongoing study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01683175.FINDINGS: Between Sept 8, 2012, and May 21, 2015, 102 patients from 16 centres across China were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive erlotinib (n=51) or chemotherapy (n=51).Median follow-up was 33.0 months (IQR 17.8-43.1).2-year disease-free survival was 81.4% (95% CI 69.6-93.1) in the erlotinib group and 44.6% (26.9-62.4) in the chemotherapy group (relative risk 1.823 [95% CI 1.194-2.784; p=0.0054).The difference in 2-year disease-free survival between the groups was 36.7% (95% CI 15.5-58.0; p=0.0007).Adverse events of any grade occurred in 29 (58%) of 50 patients in the erlotinib group and 28 (65%) of 43 patients in the chemotherapy group.Grade 3 or worse adverse events occurred in six (12%) of 50 patients in the erlotinib group versus 11 (26%) of 43 in the chemotherapy group; the most common of these in the erlotinib group was rash (in two [4%] of 50 patients) and in the chemotherapy group were decreased neutrophil count (in seven [16%] of 43 patients) and myelosuppression (in four [9%]).No treatment-related deaths were reported.INTERPRETATION: Adjuvant erlotinib improved 2-year disease-free survival in patients with EGFR mutation-positive stage IIIA NSCLC compared with chemotherapy, with a better tolerability profile.This study suggests that tyrosine kinase inhibitors could have a potentially important role as adjuvant therapy in EGFR mutation-positive stage IIIA NSCLC.However, this trial was a phase 2 study.Mature overall survival data are also needed.Ongoing studies will hopefully confirm the role of adjuvant EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy in patients with NSCLC.FUNDING: National Key Research and Development Program of China and Shanghai Roche Pharmaceuticals Ltd.",1,1,1,1

22146893,"An immune-active tumor microenvironment favors clinical response to ipilimumab.PURPOSE: Ipilimumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody specific to CTLA-4, has been shown to improve overall survival in metastatic melanoma patients.As a consequence of CTLA-4 blockade, ipilimumab treatment is associated with proliferation and activation of peripheral T cells.To better understand various tumor-associated components that may influence the clinical outcome of ipilimumab treatment, gene expression profiles of tumors from patients treated with ipilimumab were characterized.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Gene expression profiling was performed on tumor biopsies collected from 45 melanoma patients before and 3 weeks after the start of treatment in a phase II clinical trial.RESULTS: Analysis of pre-treatment tumors indicated that patients with high baseline expression levels of immune-related genes were more likely to respond favorably to ipilimumab.Furthermore, ipilimumab appeared to induce two major changes in tumors from patients who exhibited clinical activity: genes involved in immune response showed increased expression, whereas expression of genes for melanoma-specific antigens and genes involved in cell proliferation decreased.These changes were associated with the total lymphocyte infiltrate in tumors, and there was a suggestion of association with prolonged overall survival in these patients.Many IFN-gamma-inducible genes and Th1-associated markers showed increased expression after ipilimumab treatment, suggesting an accumulation of this particular type of T cell at the tumor sites, which might play an important role in mediating the antitumor activity of ipilimumab.CONCLUSIONS: These results support the proposed mechanism of action of ipilimumab, suggesting that cell-mediated immune responses play an important role in the antitumor activity of ipilimumab.",0,0,0,0
24573743,"A phase II open-label randomized multicenter trial of TSU-68 in combination with S-1 and oxaliplatin versus S-1 in combination with oxaliplatin in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide.The combination of oxaliplatin-based treatments (oxaliplatin plus infusional 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin [FOLFOX] or oxaliplatin plus capecitabine [CapeOX]) and bevacizumab is a standard chemotherapy regimen for metastatic CRC (mCRC).However, several clinical studies that tested S-1 plus oxaliplatin (SOX) indicate that SOX is also a treatment option for mCRC.TSU-68 is an oral compound that inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptor and platelet-derived growth factor receptor.The recommended dose of TSU-68 + SOX was previously determined in a phase I study of mCRC patients.The goal of this trial was to evaluate the efficacy of TSU-68 in combination with SOX.METHODS: This open-label multicenter randomized phase II trial was performed in Korea.Treatment-naive mCRC patients with a performance status of 0 or 1 were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either TSU-68 + SOX or SOX alone.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS).RESULTS: A total of 105 patients (TSU-68 + SOX, 52 patients; SOX alone, 53 patients) were randomized.The median PFS was 7.0 months in the TSU-68 + SOX group (hazard ratio [HR], 1.057) and 7.2 months in the SOX group (p = 0.8401).The most frequent grade 3 and 4 adverse events were thrombocytopenia (9.6 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 26.4 % [SOX]), neutropenia (13.5 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 15.1 % [SOX]), and anemia (3.8 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 13.2 % [SOX]).We observed a difference between the 2 groups for all grades of anemia (15.4 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 32.1 % [SOX]), diarrhea (30.8 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 47.2 % [SOX]), vomiting (50.0 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 26.4 % [SOX]), and chromaturia (23.1 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 0.0 % [SOX]).Analysis using a Cox proportional hazard model showed that baseline interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels were associated with a survival benefit of TSU-68 (p = 0.012).CONCLUSION: TSU-68 + SOX had a favorable safety profile.However, TSU-68 did not have a synergistic effect on the efficacy of SOX.The baseline serum IL-6 level could be a prognostic factor for TSU-68 efficacy.",1,1,1,1

CONCLUSIONS: In this group of patients with spinal bone metastases we were able to show that guided resistance training of the paravertebral muscles had no essential impact on survival concomitant to RT.Importantly, no local bone progression in group A was detected, nevertheless no prognostic factor for combined treatment could be evaluated.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical trial identifier NCT 01409720 .Registered 8 February 2011.",0,0,0,0
25604851,"Randomized multicenter phase III study of a modified docetaxel and cisplatin plus fluorouracil regimen compared with cisplatin and fluorouracil as first-line therapy for advanced or locally recurrent gastric cancer.BACKGROUND: The V325 study showed that docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil (DCF) prolonged overall survival (OS) of patients with advanced gastric cancer, but with a high incidence of dose-limiting toxicities.We investigated the efficacy and safety of a modified DCF (mDCF) regimen for Chinese patients with advanced gastric cancer.METHODS: Untreated advanced gastric cancer patients randomly received docetaxel and cisplatin at 60 mg/m(2) (day 1) followed by fluorouracil at 600 mg/m(2)/day (days 1-5; mDCF regimen) or cisplatin at 75 mg/m(2) (day 1) followed by fluorouracil at 600 mg/m(2)/day (days 1-5; CF) every 3 weeks.The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS).The secondary end points were OS, overall response rate (ORR), time-to-treatment failure (TTF), and safety.RESULTS: In total, 243 patients were randomized to treatment (mDCF regimen 121; CF 122).Compared with CF, the mDCF regimen significantly improved PFS and OS: the median PFS was 7.2 and 4.9 months, respectively [hazard ratio (HR) 0.58, log-rank P = 0.0008], and the median OS was 10.2 and 8.5 months, respectively (HR = 0.71, P = 0.0319).Additionally, the mDCF regimen improved the parameters used as secondary objectives: the ORR was 48.7% with the mDCF regimen versus 33.9% with CF (P = 0.0244); the median TTF was 3.4 months with the mDCF regimen and 2.4 months with CF (HR = 0.67, P = 0.0027).Grade 3 and grade 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 77.3 % of patients who received the mDCF regimen versus 46.1% of patients who received CF (P < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: The mDCF regimen, compared with CF, significantly prolonged PFS and OS and enhanced ORR of Chinese patients with advanced gastric cancer.The mDCF regimen achieved efficacy comparable to that of DCF but with fewer toxicities, which is appropriate for the Chinese population.",1,1,1,1
24629419,"A randomized controlled trial assessing the effect of prescribed patient position changes during colonoscope withdrawal on adenoma detection.BACKGROUND: High-quality colonoscope withdrawal technique is associated with a higher adenoma detection rate.Position change is routinely used in barium enema and CT colonography to facilitate adequate distension of the colon and promote movement of fluid from the segment of the colon being assessed.OBJECTIVE: To determine whether prescribed position changes during colonoscope withdrawal affect the adenoma detection rate compared with the usual care per endoscopist.DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, controlled trial.SETTING: Tertiary-care, university-affiliated hospital.PATIENTS: Patients referred for outpatient colonoscopy between July 2011 and July 2012 were evaluated for eligibility.Inclusion criteria were outpatient status and age >/=40 years.Exclusion criteria were (1) complete colonoscopy within 1 year before the procedure, (2) inability to provide informed consent, (3) incomplete colonoscopy to the cecum, (4) previous bowel resection, (5) inflammatory bowel disease, (6) colonic polyposis syndrome, (7) inadequate bowel preparation, and (8) musculoskeletal disorder or other mobility issues limiting effective patient position changes during colonoscopy.INTERVENTIONS: Prescribed position changes during colonoscope withdrawal.MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Polyp detection rate (PDR) and adenoma detection rate (ADR).RESULTS: A total of 776 patients were enrolled, with 388 in the dynamic group.There was no difference in PDR (odds ratio [OR] 0.99; P = .93) or ADR (OR 1.17; P = .28).Colonoscope withdrawal time was longer in the dynamic group (median time 466.5 vs 422.5 seconds; P < .0001).LIMITATIONS: Single-center study.Indication for procedure not controlled.Lack of standardized bowel preparation and blinding.CONCLUSION: Prescribed position changes during colonoscope withdrawal do not affect polyp/adenoma detection compared with the usual practice when the baseline ADR is above the recommended standard.( CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT01395173.).",0,0,0,0
30902613,"Updated Efficacy and Safety Data and Impact of the EML4-ALK Fusion Variant on the Efficacy of Alectinib in Untreated ALK-Positive Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer in the Global Phase III ALEX Study.INTRODUCTION: At the prior data cutoff (February 9, 2017) the ALEX trial showed superior investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) for alectinib versus crizotinib in untreated, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive, advanced NSCLC (hazard ratio = 0.47, 95% confidence interval: 0.34-0.65, p < 0.001).The median PFS in the alectinib arm was not reached versus 11.1 months with crizotinib.Retrospective analyses suggest that the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 gene-ALK variant (EML4-ALK) may influence ALK-inhibitor treatment benefit.We present updated analyses, including exploratory subgroup analysis by EML4-ALK variant, after an additional 10 months' follow-up (cutoff December 1, 2017).METHODS: Patients were randomized to receive twice-daily alectinib, 600 mg, or crizotinib, 250 mg, until disease progression, toxicity, death, or withdrawal.PFS was determined by the investigators.Baseline plasma and tissue biomarker samples were analyzed by using hybrid-capture, next-generation sequencing to determine EML4-ALK variant.RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were balanced.Investigator-assessed PFS was prolonged with alectinib (stratified hazard ratio = 0.43, 95% confidence interval: 0.32-0.58).The median PFS times were 34.8 months with alectinib and 10.9 months with crizotinib.EML4-ALK fusions were detectable in 129 patient plasma samples and 124 tissue samples; variants 1, 2, and 3/ab did not affect PFS, objective response rate, or duration of response.Investigator-assessed PFS was longer for alectinib than for crizotinib across EML4-ALK variants 1, 2, and 3a/b in plasma and tissue.Despite longer treatment duration (27.0 months in the case of alectinib versus 10.8 months in the case of crizotinib), the safety of alectinib compared favorably with that of crizotinib.CONCLUSION: Alectinib continues to demonstrate superior investigator-assessed PFS versus crizotinib in untreated ALK-positive NSCLC, irrespective of EML4-ALK variant.",1,1,1,1
26908330,"Circulating biomarkers and outcome from a randomised phase II trial of sunitinib vs everolimus for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.BACKGROUND: RECORD-3 assessed non-inferiority of progression-free survival (PFS) with everolimus vs sunitinib in previously untreated patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.Baseline plasma sample collection and randomised design enabled correlation of circulating biomarkers with efficacy.METHODS: Samples were analysed for 121 cancer-related biomarkers.Analyses of biomarkers categorised patients as high or low (vs median) to assess association with first-line PFS (PFS1L) for each treatment arm.A composite biomarker score (CBS) incorporated biomarkers potentially predictive of PFS1L with everolimus.RESULTS: Plasma samples from 442 of the 471 randomised patients were analysed.Biomarkers were associated with PFS1L for everolimus alone (29), sunitinib alone (9) or both (12).Everolimus-specific biomarkers (CSF1, ICAM1, IL-18BP, KIM1, TNFRII) with hazard ratio 1.8 were integrated into a CBS (range 0-5).For CBS low (0-3, n = 291) vs high (4-5, n = 151), PFS1L differed significantly for everolimus but not for sunitinib.There was no significant difference in PFS1L between everolimus and sunitinib in the high CBS patient cohort.CONCLUSIONS: Baseline levels of multiple soluble biomarkers correlated with benefit from everolimus and/or sunitinib, independent of clinical risk factors.A similar PFS1L was observed for both treatments among patients with high CBS score.",1,1,1,1
26714372,"EFFECTS OF COMPRESSION ON LYMPHEDEMA DURING RESISTANCE EXERCISE IN WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER-RELATED LYMPHEDEMA: A RANDOMIZED, CROSS-OVER TRIAL.The use of compression garments during exercise is recommended for women with breast cancer-related lymphedema, but the evidence behind this clinical recommendation is unclear.The aim of this randomized, cross-over trial was to compare the acute effects of wearing versus not wearing compression during a single bout of moderate-load resistance exercise on lymphedema status and its associated symptoms in women with breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL).Twenty-five women with clinically diagnosed, stable unilateral breast cancer-related lymphedema completed two resistance exercise sessions, one with compression and one without, in a randomized order separated by a minimum 6 day wash-out period.The resistance exercise session consisted of six upper-body exercises, with each exercise performed for three sets at a moderate-load (10-12 repetition maximum).Primary outcome was lymphedema, assessed using bioimpedance spectroscopy (L-Dex score).Secondary outcomes were lymphedema as assessed by arm circumferences (percent inter-limb difference and sum-of-circumferences), and symptom severity for pain, heaviness and tightness, measured using visual analogue scales.Measurements were taken pre-, immediately post- and 24 hours post-exercise.There was no difference in lymphedema status (i.e., L-Dex scores) pre- and post-exercise sessions or between the compression and non-compression condition [Mean (SD) for compression pre-, immediately post- and 24 hours post-exercise: 17.7 (21.5), 12.7 (16.2) and 14.1 (16.7), respectively; no compression: 15.3 (18.3), 15.3 (17.8), and 13.4 (16.1), respectively].Circumference values and symptom severity were stable across time and treatment condition.An acute bout of moderate-load, upper-body resistance exercise performed in the absence of compression does not exacerbate lymphedema in women with BCRL.",0,0,0,0
27498129,"Toxicity of dual HER2-blockade with pertuzumab added to anthracycline versus non-anthracycline containing chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment in HER2-positive breast cancer: The TRAIN-2 study.BACKGROUND: The addition of pertuzumab to neoadjuvant trastuzumab-based chemotherapy improves pathologic complete response rates in HER2-positive breast cancer.However, increased toxicity has been reported with the addition of pertuzumab, and this may differ between various chemotherapy backbone regimens.We evaluated toxicities of pertuzumab when added to either FEC-T (5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide, trastuzumab) or weekly paclitaxel, trastuzumab, carboplatin (PTC).METHODS: The TRAIN-2 study is a neoadjuvant randomized controlled trial in stage II and III HER2-positive breast cancer (NCT01996267).Patients are randomly assigned to receive either three cycles of FEC-T plus pertuzumab or three cycles of PTC plus pertuzumab, followed by six cycles of PTC plus pertuzumab in both arms.Toxicities are described per treatment arm according to the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03.RESULTS: This analysis includes 110 patients balanced over both treatment arms.Neutropenia was the most common hematologic toxicity, with grade 3-4 occurring in 53% in the FEC-T-arm and in 51% in the PTC-arm.Febrile neutropenia occurred in 9% in the FEC-T arm and did not occur in the PTC-arm.Secondary G-CSF prophylaxis was used in 35-40% of patients.Asymptomatic ejection fraction decrease grade 2 was observed in 24% in the FEC-T-arm and 11% in the PTC-arm.The most common grade 3-4 non-hematologic toxicity was diarrhea (5% in the FEC-T-arm and 18% in the PTC-arm).CONCLUSIONS: Pertuzumab in combination with FEC-T mostly causes neutropenia, and when added to PTC mostly causes diarrhea.Significant cardiac toxicity is rare with both regimens, and toxicity is overall well manageable.",1,1,1,1

27914822,"Effects of sodium thiosulfate versus observation on development of cisplatin-induced hearing loss in children with cancer (ACCL0431): a multicentre, randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Sodium thiosulfate is an antioxidant shown in preclinical studies in animals to prevent cisplatin-induced hearing loss with timed administration after cisplatin without compromising the antitumour efficacy of cisplatin.The primary aim of this study was to assess sodium thiosulfate for prevention of cisplatin-induced hearing loss in children and adolescents.METHODS: ACCL0431 was a multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial that enrolled participants at 38 participating Children's Oncology Group hospitals in the USA and Canada.Eligible participants aged 1-18 years with newly diagnosed cancer and normal audiometry were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive sodium thiosulfate or observation (control group) in addition to their planned cisplatin-containing chemotherapy regimen, using permuted blocks of four.Randomisation was initially stratified by age and duration of cisplatin infusion.Stratification by previous cranial irradiation was added later as a protocol amendment.The allocation sequence was computer-generated centrally and concealed to all personnel.Participants received sodium thiosulfate 16 g/m(2) intravenously 6 h after each cisplatin dose or observation.The primary endpoint was incidence of hearing loss 4 weeks after final cisplatin dose.Hearing was measured using standard audiometry and reviewed centrally by audiologists masked to allocation using American Speech-Language-Hearing Association criteria but treatment was not masked for participants or clinicians.Analysis of the primary endpoint was by modified intention to treat, which included all randomly assigned patients irrespective of treatment received but restricted to those assessable for hearing loss.Enrolment is complete and this report represents the final analysis.This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00716976.FINDINGS: Between June 23, 2008, and Sept 28, 2012, 125 eligible participants were randomly assigned to either sodium thiosulfate (n=61) or observation (n=64).Of these, 104 participants were assessable for the primary endpoint (sodium thiosulfate, n=49; control, n=55).Hearing loss was identified in 14 (28.6%; 95% CI 16.6-43.3) participants in the sodium thiosulfate group compared with 31 (56.4%; 42.3-69.7) in the control group (p=0.00022).Adjusted for stratification variables, the likelihood of hearing loss was significantly lower in the sodium thiosulfate group compared with the control group (odds ratio 0.31, 95% CI 0.13-0.73; p=0.0036).The most common grade 3-4 haematological adverse events reported, irrespective of attribution, were neutropenia (117 [66%] of 177 participant cycles in the sodium thiosulfate group vs 145 [65%] of 223 in the control group), whereas the most common non-haematological adverse event was hypokalaemia (25 [17%] of 147 vs 22 [12%] of 187).Of 194 serious adverse events reported in 26 participants who had received sodium thiosulfate, none were deemed probably or definitely related to sodium thiosulfate; the most common serious adverse event was decreased neutrophil count: 26 episodes in 14 participants.INTERPRETATION: Sodium thiosulfate protects against cisplatin-induced hearing loss in children and is not associated with serious adverse events attributed to its use.Further research is needed to define the appropriate role for sodium thiosulfate among emerging otoprotection strategies.FUNDING: US National Cancer Institute.",0,0,0,0
25975527,"Clip closure of defect after endoscopic resection in patients with larger colorectal tumors decreased the adverse events.BACKGROUND: Clip closure of large colorectal mucosal defects may reduce the rate of adverse events in a cost-effective manner.OBJECTIVE: To assess the adverse events and outcomes of clip closure of defects after endoscopic resection in patients with large colorectal tumors.DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, controlled study.SETTING: Single tertiary referral center.PATIENTS AND INTERVENTIONS: Patients with lesions measuring 1 to 4 cm who were scheduled for endoscopic resection between March 2012 and December 2014 were randomly assigned to a clip-closure group and a no-closure group.In the clip-closure group, the defect of the resection site was completely closed with an endoclip.In the no-closure group, the defect was left open.The following primary outcome measures were assessed: delayed postoperative bleeding, postpolypectomy coagulation syndrome, perforation, and abdominal pain.Secondary outcome measures of length of hospital stay, time required for procedure, and patient's satisfaction were also assessed.RESULTS: Patients and lesions had similar characteristics across both groups.For patients who underwent clip closure (n = 174), the rates of delayed postoperative bleeding (1.1% [2/174]) and postpolypectomy coagulation syndrome (0.6% [1/174]) were lower than those in the no-closure group (6.9% [12/174], P = .01 and 4.6% [8/174], P = .03).Two patients experienced perforation, 1 in each group.In the clip-closure group, 4 patients reported abdominal pain as opposed to 26 in the no-closure group (2.8% vs 16.7%, P < .01).The procedure took longer in the closure group (38.1 minutes vs 30.9 minutes, P = .04).The length of hospitalization was shorter in the closure group (3.1 days vs 4.7 days, P = .03).Total medical expense was similar between the 2 groups.Patients who underwent closure reported greater satisfaction.LIMITATION: This was a single-center analysis.CONCLUSIONS: Clip closure of endoscopic resection defects in patients with large colorectal tumors decreased the rate of procedure-related adverse events and did not increase the cost of hospitalization.",1,1,1,0
29033099,"Custirsen (OGX-011) combined with cabazitaxel and prednisone versus cabazitaxel and prednisone alone in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer previously treated with docetaxel (AFFINITY): a randomised, open-label, international, phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Docetaxel and cabazitaxel improve overall survival compared with mitoxantrone in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.Custirsen (OGX011) is a second generation highly specific antisense oligonucleotide that inhibits the production of clusterin, an antiapoptotic protein that is upregulated in response to chemotherapy and that confers treatment resistance.We aimed to assess whether custirsen in combination with cabazitaxel and prednisone increases overall survival in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer previously treated with docetaxel.METHODS: In this randomised, open-label, international, phase 3 trial, men with radiographically documented metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer that had progressed after docetaxel treatment with a Karnofsky performance status of more than 70% and who were fit for chemotherapy, were recruited from 95 cancer treatment centres in eight countries.Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) centrally using permuted blocks (block size 8) to receive cabazitaxel plus prednisone (cabazitaxel 25 mg/m(2) intravenously every 21 days plus oral prednisone 10 mg daily) with or without custirsen (640 mg intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15, plus three previous loading doses) until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or the completion of ten treatment cycles.Randomisation was stratified by use of opioids for prostate cancer-related pain at screening, disease progression following first-line docetaxel treatment established by radiographic evidence, and previous treatment with abiraterone or enzalutamide.The co-primary endpoints were overall survival in all randomly assigned patients and in a poor-prognosis subgroup.All analyses were intention to treat with the exception of safety, which was reported for patients who received any assigned treatment.The trial has been completed and the results presented here are the final analysis.This trial is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov, number NCT01578655.FINDINGS: Between Sept 9, 2012, and Sept 29, 2014, 795 patients were screened for enrolment.635 men were eligible for inclusion and were randomly assigned (n=317 in the cabazitaxel and prednisone plus custirsen group and n=318 in the cabazitaxel and prednisone group).Median follow up was 28.3 months (IQR 24.4-34.5) for the custirsen group and 29.8 months (IQR 25.3-35.2) for the control group.Median overall survival in all randomly assigned patients did not differ between the two groups (14.1 months [95% CI 12.7-15.9] in the curtisen group vs 13.4 months [12.1-14.9] in the control group; hazard ratio [HR] 0.95 [95% CI 0.80-1.12]; log-rank p=0.53).In the poor prognosis subgroup, median overall survival also did not differ between the two treatment groups (11.0 months [95% CI 9.3-13.3] in the custursin group vs 10.9 months [8.2-12.4] in the control group; HR 0.97 [95% CI 0.80-1.21]; two-sided p=0.80).The most frequently reported grade 3 or worse adverse events in the custirsen versus control groups were neutropenia (70 [22%] of 315 vs 61 [20%] of 312), anaemia (68 [22%] vs 49 [16%]), fatigue (23 [7%] vs 18 [6%]), asthenia (16 [5%] vs 8 [3%]), bone pain (16 [5%] vs 5 [2%]), and febrile neutropenia (16 [5%] vs 9 [3%]).Serious adverse events were reported in 155 (49%) versus 132 (42%).27 patients died within 30 days of treatment in the cabazitaxel and prednisone plus custirsen group, seven of which were deemed to be treatment related, versus 17 in the cabazitaxel and prednisone group, eight of which were deemed to be treatment related.Of the 21 deaths reported, 15 were reported as complications related to study treatment, either chemotherapy (eight and three, respectively) or study drug (none and four, respectively).INTERPRETATION: We noted no survival benefit in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer with the addition of custirsen to cabazitaxel and prednisone treatment.Cabazitaxel and prednisone remains the standard of care for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer progressing after docetaxel chemotherapy.FUNDING: OncoGenex Pharmaceuticals.",1,1,1,1

Common treatment-emergent adverse events were nausea (arm A/B, 33%/40%), diarrhea (arm A/B, 19%/38%), headache (arm A/B, 28%/27%), and cough (arm A/B, 18%/34%), and were mainly grades 1 to 2.A subset of pulmonary adverse events with early onset (median onset: day 2) occurred in 14 of 219 treated patients (all grades, 6%; grade >/= 3, 3%); none occurred after escalation to 180 mg in arm B. Seven of 14 patients were successfully retreated with brigatinib.Conclusion Brigatinib yielded substantial whole-body and intracranial responses as well as robust progression-free survival; 180 mg (with lead-in) showed consistently better efficacy than 90 mg, with acceptable safety.",1,1,1,1
25791173,"A Pilot Study to Investigate the Efficacy of Fibrin Sealant (Tisseel(R)) in the Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedure.AIMS: The objective of the current study was to evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of fibrin sealant (Tisseel(R)) in the loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 2 or 3).METHODS: We designed a single-blind, prospective, randomized study in 40 consecutive women undergoing LEEP for CIN 2 or 3 at our institute.Two milliliters of fibrin sealant (Tisseel) was applied to the uterine cervix of 20 women immediately after LEEP surgery (treatment group).We evaluated abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, vaginal discharge and impairment in daily living after 1 week using visual analogue scale questionnaires and compared the results with those of 20 women who did not receive fibrin sealant (control group).RESULTS: Among 40 women who returned for a follow-up 1 week after LEEP, 25 women (62.5%) reported at least one moderate to severe postprocedural symptom.The mean duration of moderate to severe vaginal bleeding and impairment in daily living during postoperative week 1 for the treatment group and the control group was 0.3 +/- 0.80 versus 1.7 +/- 2.36 days (p = 0.015) and 0.9 +/- 1.37 versus 3.00 +/- 2.62 days (p = 0.060), respectively.CONCLUSION: Intraoperative application of fibrin sealant (Tisseel) in LEEP can decrease postoperative vaginal bleeding and impairment in daily living.",0,0,0,0
23281805,"Randomized Phase II trial of paclitaxel and carboplatin followed by gemcitabine switch-maintenance therapy versus gemcitabine and carboplatin followed by gemcitabine continuation-maintenance therapy in previously untreated advanced non-small cell lung cancer.BACKGROUND: In recent years, maintenance chemotherapy is increasingly being recognized as a new treatment strategy to improve the outcome of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).However, the optimal maintenance strategy is still controversial.Gemcitabine is a promising candidate for single-agent maintenance therapy because of little toxicity and good tolerability.We have conducted a randomized phase II study to evaluate the validity of single-agent maintenance chemotherapy of gemcitabine and to compare continuation- and switch-maintenance.METHODS: Chemonaive patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC were randomly assigned 1:1 to either arm A or B. Patients received paclitaxel (200 mg/m2, day 1) plus carboplatin (AUC 6 mg/mL/min, day 1) every 3 weeks in arm A, or gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2, days 1 and 8) plus carboplatin (AUC 5 mg/mL/min, day1) every 3 weeks in arm B. Non-progressive patients following 3 cycles of induction chemotherapy received maintenance gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2, days 1 and 8) every 3 weeks.( TRIAL REGISTRATION: UMIN000008252)RESULTS: The study was stopped because of delayed accrual at interim analysis.Of the randomly assigned 50 patients, 49 except for one in arm B were evaluable.Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 4.6 months for arm A vs. 3.5 months for arm B (HR = 1.03; 95% CI, 0.45-2.27; p = 0.95) and median overall survival (OS) was 15.0 months for arm A vs. 14.8 months for arm B (HR = 0.79; 95% CI, 0.40-1.51; p = 0.60), showing no difference between the two arms.The response rate, disease control rate, and the transit rate to maintenance phase were 36.0% (9/25), 64.0% (16/25), and 48% (12/25) for arm A vs. 16.7% (4/24), 50.0% (12/24), and 33% (8/24) for arm B, which were also statistically similar between the two arms (p = 0.13, p = 0.32, and p = 0.30, respectively).Both induction regimens were tolerable, except that more patients experienced peripheral neuropathy in arm A. Toxicities during the maintenance phase were also minimal.CONCLUSION: Survival and overall response were not significantly different between the two arms.Gemcitabine may be well-tolerable and feasible for maintenance therapy.",1,1,1,1
26502987,"School-based brief psycho-educational intervention to raise adolescent cancer awareness and address barriers to medical help-seeking about cancer: a cluster randomised controlled trial.OBJECTIVES: Raising cancer awareness and addressing barriers to help-seeking may improve early diagnosis.The aim was to assess whether a psycho-educational intervention increased adolescents' cancer awareness and addressed help-seeking barriers.METHODS: This was a cluster randomised controlled trial involving 2173 adolescents in 20 schools.The intervention was a 50-min presentation delivered by a member of Teenage Cancer Trust's (UK charity) education team.Schools were stratified by deprivation and roll size and randomly allocated to intervention/control conditions within these strata.Outcome measures were the number of cancer warning signs and cancer risk factors recognised, help-seeking barriers endorsed and cancer communication.Communication self-efficacy and intervention fidelity were also assessed.RESULTS: Regression models showed significant differences in the number of cancer warning signs and risk factors recognised between intervention and control groups.In intervention schools, the greatest increases in recognition of cancer warning signs at 6-month follow-up were for unexplained weight loss (from 44.2% to 62.0%) and change in the appearance of a mole (from 46.3% to 70.7%), up by 17.8% and 24.4%, respectively.Greatest increases in recognition of cancer risk factors were for getting sunburnt more than once as a child (from 41.0% to 57.6%) and being overweight (from 42.7% to 55.5%), up by 16.6% and 12.8%, respectively.Regression models showed that adolescents in intervention schools were 2.7 times more likely to discuss cancer at 2-week follow-up compared with the control group.No differences in endorsement of barriers to help-seeking were observed.CONCLUSIONS: School-based brief psycho-educational interventions are easy to deliver, require little resource and improve cancer awareness.(c) 2015 The Authors.Psycho-Oncology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",0,0,0,0
29864379,"Improvement in Overall Survival in a Randomized Study That Compared Dacomitinib With Gefitinib in Patients With Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer and EGFR-Activating Mutations.Purpose ARCHER 1050, a randomized, open-label, phase III study of dacomitinib versus gefitinib in treatment-naive patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and activating mutations in EGFR, reported significant improvement in progression-free survival with dacomitinib.The mature overall survival (OS) analysis for the intention-to-treat population is presented here.Patients and Methods In this multinational, multicenter study, patients age 18 years or older (>/= 20 years in Japan and Korea) who had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 and newly diagnosed NSCLC with activating mutations in EGFR (exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R) were enrolled and randomly assigned in a 1:1 manner to dacomitinib (n = 227) or gefitinib (n = 225).Random assignment was stratified by race (Japanese, Chinese, other East Asian, or non-Asian) and EGFR mutation type.The final OS analysis was conducted with a data cutoff date of February 17, 2017; at that time 220 deaths (48.7%) were observed.Results During a median follow-up time of 31.3 months, 103 (45.4%) and 117 (52.0%) deaths occurred in the dacomitinib and gefitinib arms, respectively.The estimated hazard ratio for OS was 0.760 (95% CI, 0.582 to 0.993; two-sided P = .044).The median OS was 34.1 months with dacomitinib versus 26.8 months with gefitinib.The OS probabilities at 30 months were 56.2% and 46.3% with dacomitinib and gefitinib, respectively.Preliminary subgroup analyses for OS that are based on baseline characteristics were consistent with the primary OS analysis.Conclusion In patients with advanced NSCLC and EGFR activating mutations, dacomitinib is the first second-generation epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) to show significant improvement in OS in a phase III randomized study compared with a standard-of-care TKI.Dacomitinib should be considered one of the standard treatment options for these patients.",1,1,1,1
30860948,"Effect of Chemotherapy With Docetaxel With Androgen Suppression and Radiotherapy for Localized High-Risk Prostate Cancer: The Randomized Phase III NRG Oncology RTOG 0521 Trial.PURPOSE: Radiotherapy (RT) plus long-term androgen suppression (AS) are a standard treatment option for patients with high-risk localized prostate cancer.We hypothesized that docetaxel chemotherapy (CT) could improve overall survival (OS) and clinical outcomes among patients with high-risk prostate cancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The multicenter randomized NRG Oncology RTOG 0521 study enrolled patients with high-risk nonmetastatic disease between 2005 and 2009.Patients were randomly assigned to receive standard long-term AS plus RT with or without adjuvant CT.RESULTS: A total of 612 patients were enrolled; 563 were evaluable.Median prostate-specific antigen was 15.1 ng/mL; 53% had a Gleason score 9 to 10 cancer; 27% had cT3 to cT4 disease.Median follow-up was 5.7 years.Treatment was well tolerated in both arms.Four-year OS rate was 89% (95% CI, 84% to 92%) for AS + RT and 93% (95% CI, 90% to 96%) for AS + RT + CT (hazard ratio [HR], 0.69; 90% CI, 0.49 to 0.97; one-sided P = .034).There were 59 deaths in the AS + RT arm and 43 in the AS + RT + CT arm, with fewer deaths resulting from prostate cancer in the AS + RT + CT arm versus AS + RT (23 v 16 deaths, respectively).Six-year rate of distant metastasis was 14% for AS + RT and 9.1% for AS + RT + CT, (HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.99; two-sided P = .044).Six-year disease-free survival rate was 55% for AS + RT and 65% for AS + RT + CT (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.99; two-sided P = .043).CONCLUSION: For patients with high-risk nonmetastatic prostate cancer, CT with docetaxel improved OS from 89% to 93% at 4 years, with improved disease-free survival and reduction in the rate of distant metastasis.The trial suggests that docetaxel CT may be an option to be discussed with selected men with high-risk prostate cancer.",1,1,1,1
29330978,"Intramuscular Diclofenac Vs Periprostatic Lidocaine Injection For Controlling Pain Undergoing Transrectal Ultrasound Guided Prostatic Biopsy.BACKGROUND: Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) technique for getting prostatic tissue for histopathology is now the standard procedure for malignant lesions of the prostate and imperative diagnostic investigation of patients with clinical specks of prostatic neoplasia.During TRUS guided biopsy, pain control has been important issue therefore, highly potent analgesia before this procedure should be considered on high priority according to current census.Therefore, we compared intramuscular diclofenac injection with sensory blockade of injection lidocaine to abolish pain undergoing prostatic biopsy with TRUS technique.METHODS: Total 200 patients were selected for this study having raised PSA values and suspicious nodule on Digital Rectal Examination.These patients were segregated into two groups by randomization.Group ""A"" received intramuscular diclofenac and group ""B"" were infiltrated with lidocaine injection for sensory blockade.RESULTS: Patients in group A was having mean age of 64.5+/-5.8 years while for group B patients was 65.6+/-4.9 years (p=0.16).Both groups have statistically insignificant difference in their mean PSA values (p=0.24) and mean prostatic volume (p=0.22).The mean pain scores on visual analogue scale in groups A was 3.5+/-0.8 and in group B it was 2.4+/-0.8 (p<0.001).60% group A patients reported with mild or no pain compared to 90% in group B.

26953983,"Pathologic Complete Response in Rectal Cancer: Can We Detect It? Lessons Learned From a Proposed Randomized Trial of Watch-and-Wait Treatment of Rectal Cancer.BACKGROUND: Chemoradiotherapy has the potential to downsize and downstage tumors before surgery, decrease locoregional recurrence, and induce a complete sterilization of tumor cells for middle and low locally advanced rectal cancer.A watch-and-wait tactic has been proposed for patients with clinical complete response.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to verify our ability to identify complete clinical response in patients with rectal cancer based on clinical and radiologic criteria.DESIGN: This was a prospective study.SETTINGS: The study was conducted at a single institution, in the setting of a watch-and-wait randomized trial.PATIENTS: Consecutive patients with stage T3 to T4N0M0 or T(any)N+M0 cancer located within 10 cm from anal verge or T2N0 within 7 cm from anal verge were included in the study.Patients were staged and restaged 8 weeks after completion of chemoradiation (5-fluorouracil, 5040 cGy) by digital examination, colonoscopy, pelvic MRI, and thorax and abdominal CT scans.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical and radiologic judgments of tumor response were compared with pathologic response of patients treated by total mesorectal excision or clinical follow-up of patients selected for nonoperative treatment.RESULTS: A total of 118 patients were treated.Six patients were considered clinic complete responders (2 randomly assigned for surgery (1 ypT0N0 and 1 ypT2N0) and 4 patients randomly assigned for observation (3 sustained clinic complete response and 1 had tumor regrowth)).The 112 clinic incomplete responders underwent total mesorectal excision, and 18 revealed pathologic complete response.These 18 patients were not considered complete responders at restaging because they presented at least 1 of the following conditions: mucosal ulceration and/or deformity and/or substenosis of rectal lumen at digital rectal examination and colonoscopy (n = 16), ymrT1 to T4 (n = 16), ymrN+ (n = 2), involvement of circumferential resection margin on MRI (n = 3), extramural vascular invasion on MRI (n = 4), MRI tumor response grade 2 to 4 (n = 15), and pelvic side wall lymph node involvement on MRI (n = 1).Sensitivity for identification of ypT0N0 or sustained clinic complete response was 18.2%.LIMITATIONS: This study has a short follow-up and small sample size.Radiologists who reviewed the restaging examination were not blinded to the pretreatment stage.Only 1 radiologist read the images of each patient.CONCLUSIONS: Evaluation of clinic complete response according to current adopted criteria has low sensitivity because pathologic complete response more frequently presented as clinic incomplete response (see Video, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/DCR/A221).",0,0,0,0
22674191,"Goserelin and bicalutamide treatments alter the expression of microRNAs in the prostate.BACKGROUND: Although endocrine therapy has been used for decades, its influence on the expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) in clinical tissue specimens has not been analyzed.Moreover, the effects of the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion on the expression of miRNAs in hormone naive and endocrine-treated prostate cancers are poorly understood.METHODS: We used clinical material from a neoadjuvant trial consisting of 28 men treated with goserelin (n = 8), bicalutamide (n = 9), or no treatment (n = 11) for 3 months prior to radical prostatectomy.Freshly frozen specimens were used for microarray analysis of 723 human miRNAs.Specific miRNA expression in cancer, benign epithelium and stromal tissue compartments was predicted with an in silico Bayesian modeling tool.RESULTS: The expression of 52, 44, and 34 miRNAs was affected >1.4-fold by the endocrine treatment in the cancer, non-malignant epithelium, and stromal compartments, respectively.Of the 52 miRNAs, only 10 were equally affected by the two treatment modalities in the cancer compartment.Twenty-six of the 52 genes (50%) showed AR binding sites in their proximity in either VCaP or LNCaP cell lines.Forty-seven miRNAs were differentially expressed in TMPRSS2:ERG fusion positive compared with fusion negative cases.Endocrine treatment reduced the differences between fusion positive and negative cases.CONCLUSIONS: Goserelin treatment and bicalutamide treatment mostly affected the expression of different miRNAs.The effect clearly varied in different tissue compartments.TMPRSS2:ERG fusion positive and negative cases showed differential expression of miRNAs, and the difference was diminished by androgen ablation.",0,0,0,0
26198205,"Computed tomographic colonography compared with colonoscopy or barium enema for diagnosis of colorectal cancer in older symptomatic patients: two multicentre randomised trials with economic evaluation (the SIGGAR trials).BACKGROUND: Computed tomographic colonography (CTC) is a relatively new diagnostic test that may be superior to existing alternatives to investigate the large bowel.OBJECTIVES: To compare the diagnostic efficacy, acceptability, safety and cost-effectiveness of CTC with barium enema (BE) or colonoscopy.DESIGN: Parallel randomised trials: BE compared with CTC and colonoscopy compared with CTC (randomisation 2 : 1, respectively).SETTING: A total of 21 NHS hospitals.PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged >/= 55 years with symptoms suggestive of colorectal cancer (CRC).INTERVENTIONS: CTC, BE and colonoscopy.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: For the trial of CTC compared with BE, the primary outcome was the detection rate of CRC and large polyps (>/= 10 mm), with the proportion of patients referred for additional colonic investigation as a secondary outcome.For the trial of CTC compared with colonoscopy, the primary outcome was the proportion of patients referred for additional colonic investigation, with the detection rate of CRC and large polyps as a secondary outcome.Secondary outcomes for both trials were miss rates for cancer (via registry data), all-cause mortality, serious adverse events, patient acceptability, extracolonic pathology and cost-effectiveness.RESULTS: A total of 8484 patients were registered and 5384 were randomised and analysed (BE trial: 2527 BE, 1277 CTC; colonoscopy trial: 1047 colonoscopy, 533 CTC).Detection rates in the BE trial were 7.3% (93/1277) for CTC, compared with 5.6% (141/2527) for BE (p = 0.0390).The difference was due to better detection of large polyps by CTC (3.6% vs. 2.2%; p = 0.0098), with no significant difference for cancer (3.7% vs. 3.4%; p = 0.66).Significantly more patients having CTC underwent additional investigation (23.5% vs. 18.3%; p = 0.0003).At the 3-year follow-up, the miss rate for CRC was 6.7% for CTC (three missed cancers) and 14.1% for BE (12 missed cancers).Significantly more patients randomised to CTC than to colonoscopy underwent additional investigation (30% vs. 8.2%; p < 0.0001).There was no significant difference in detection rates for cancer or large polyps (10.7% for CTC vs. 11.4% for colonoscopy; p = 0.69), with no difference when cancers (p = 0.94) and large polyps (p = 0.53) were analysed separately.At the 3-year follow-up, the miss rate for cancer was nil for colonoscopy and 3.4% for CTC (one missed cancer).Adverse events were uncommon for all procedures.In 1042 of 1748 (59.6%) CTC examinations, at least one extracolonic finding was reported, and this proportion increased with age (p < 0.0001).A total of 149 patients (8.5%) were subsequently investigated, and extracolonic neoplasia was diagnosed in 79 patients (4.5%) and malignancy in 29 (1.7%).In the short term, CTC was significantly more acceptable to patients than BE or colonoscopy.Total costs for CTC and colonoscopy were finely balanced, but CTC was associated with higher health-care costs than BE.The cost per large polyp or cancer detected was pound4235 (95% confidence interval pound395 to pound9656).CONCLUSIONS: CTC is superior to BE for detection of cancers and large polyps in symptomatic patients.CTC and colonoscopy detect a similar proportion of large polyps and cancers and their costs are also similar.CTC precipitates significantly more additional investigations than either BE or colonoscopy, and evidence-based referral criteria are needed.Further work is recommended to clarify the extent to which patients initially referred for colonoscopy or BE undergo subsequent abdominopelvic imaging, for example by computed tomography, which will have a significant impact on health economic estimates.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN95152621.",0,0,0,0
23167843,"Let-7 miRNA-binding site polymorphism in the KRAS 3'UTR; colorectal cancer screening population prevalence and influence on clinical outcome in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin +/- cetuximab.BACKGROUND: Recent studies have reported associations between a variant allele in a let-7 microRNA complementary site (LCS6) within the 3'untranslated region (3'UTR) of KRAS (rs61764370) and clinical outcome in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients receiving cetuximab.The variant allele has also been associated with increased cancer risk.We aimed to reveal the incidence of the variant allele in a colorectal cancer screening population and to investigate the clinical relevance of the variant allele in mCRC patients treated with 1st line Nordic FLOX (bolus 5-fluorouracil/folinic acid and oxaliplatin) +/- cetuximab.METHODS: The feasibility of the variant allele as a risk factor for CRC was investigated by comparing the LCS6 gene frequencies in 197 CRC patients, 1060 individuals with colorectal polyps, and 358 healthy controls.The relationship between clinical outcome and LCS6 genotype was analyzed in 180 mCRC patients receiving Nordic FLOX and 355 patients receiving Nordic FLOX + cetuximab in the NORDIC-VII trial (NCT00145314).RESULTS: LCS6 frequencies did not vary between CRC patients (23%), individuals with polyps (20%), and healthy controls (20%) (P = 0.50).No statistically significant differences were demonstrated in the NORDIC-VII cohort even if numerically increased progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were found in patients with the LCS6 variant allele (8.5 (95% CI: 7.3-9.7 months) versus 7.8 months (95% CI: 7.4-8.3 months), P = 0.16 and 23.5 (95% CI: 21.6-25.4 months) versus 19.5 months (95% CI: 17.8-21.2 months), P = 0.31, respectively).Addition of cetuximab seemed to improve response rate more in variant carriers than in wild-type carriers (from 35% to 57% versus 44% to 47%), however the difference was not statistically significant (interaction P = 0.16).CONCLUSIONS: The LCS6 variant allele does not seem to be a risk factor for development of colorectal polyps or CRC.No statistically significant effect of the LCS6 variant allele on response rate, PFS or OS was found in mCRC patients treated with 1st line Nordic FLOX +/- cetuximab.",0,0,0,0
