25284802,"Multicenter randomized controlled trial of percutaneous cryoablation versus radiofrequency ablation in hepatocellular carcinoma.UNLABELLED: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is considered a curative treatment option for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Growing data have demonstrated that cryoablation represents a safe and effective alternative therapy for HCC, but no randomized controlled trial (RCT) has been reported to compare cryoablation with RFA in HCC treatment.The present study was a multicenter RCT aimed to compare the outcomes of percutaneous cryoablation with RFA for the treatment of HCC.In all, 360 patients with Child-Pugh class A or B cirrhosis and one or two HCC lesions </= 4 cm, treatment-naive, without metastasis were randomly assigned to cryoablation (n = 180) or RFA (n = 180).The primary endpoints were local tumor progression at 3 years after treatment and safety.Local tumor progression rates at 1, 2, and 3 years were 3%, 7%, and 7% for cryoablation and 9%, 11%, and 11% for RFA, respectively (P = 0.043).For lesions >3 cm in diameter, the local tumor progression rate was significantly lower in the cryoablation group versus the RFA group (7.7% versus 18.2%, P = 0.041).The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates were 97%, 67%, and 40% for cryoablation and 97%, 66%, and 38% for RFA, respectively (P = 0.747).The 1-, 3-, and 5-year tumor-free survival rates were 89%, 54%, and 35% in the cryoablation group and 84%, 50%, and 34% in the RFA group, respectively (P = 0.628).Multivariate analyses demonstrated that Child-Pugh class B and distant intrahepatic recurrence were significant negative predictors for overall survival.Major complications occurred in seven patients (3.9%) following cryoablation and in six patients (3.3%) following RFA (P = 0.776).CONCLUSION: Cryoablation resulted in a significantly lower local tumor progression than RFA, although both cryoablation and RFA were equally safe and effective, with similar 5-year survival rates.",1,1,1,1
23890768,"Three-arm randomised controlled phase 2 study comparing pemetrexed and erlotinib to either pemetrexed or erlotinib alone as second-line treatment for never-smokers with non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer.BACKGROUND: This randomised controlled phase 2 study compared pemetrexed and erlotinib in combination with either agent alone in terms of efficacy and safety as second-line treatment in a clinically selected population of never-smokers with non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).METHODS: Patients who had failed only one prior chemotherapy regimen and had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) </=2 were randomised to either: pemetrexed 500 mg/m(2) on day 1 plus erlotinib 150 mg daily on days 2-14; erlotinib 150 mg daily; or pemetrexed 500 mg/m(2) on day 1 of a 21-day cycle until discontinuation criteria were met.The primary endpoint, progression-free survival (PFS), was analysed using a multivariate Cox model.Firstly, a global comparison across the three arms was performed.If the global null hypothesis was rejected at a two-sided 0.2 significance level, pairwise comparisons of pemetrexed-erlotinib versus erlotinib or pemetrexed were then conducted using the same model.Statistical significance was claimed only if both global and pairwise null hypotheses were rejected at a two-sided 0.05 significance level.FINDINGS: A total of 240 patients (male, 35%; East Asian, 55%; ECOG PS 0-1, 93%) were included.A statistically significant difference in PFS was found across the three arms (global p=0.003), with pemetrexed-erlotinib significantly better than either single agent: HR=0.57, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.40-0.81, p=0.002 versus erlotinib; HR=0.58, 95% CI: 0.39-0.85, p=0.005 versus pemetrexed.Median PFS (95% CI) was 7.4 (4.4, 12.9) months in pemetrexed-erlotinib, 3.8 (2.7, 6.3) months in erlotinib and 4.4 (3.0, 6.0) months in pemetrexed.Safety analyses showed a higher incidence of drug-related grade 3/4 toxicity in pemetrexed-erlotinib (60.0%) than in pemetrexed (28.9%) or erlotinib (12.0%); the majority being neutropenia, anaemia, rash and diarrhoea.INTERPRETATION: Pemetrexed-erlotinib significantly improved PFS compared to either drug alone in this clinically selected population.The combination had more toxicity, but was clinically manageable.",1,1,1,1
23104720,"Benefit of adjuvant trastuzumab-based chemotherapy in T1ab node-negative HER2-overexpressing breast carcinomas: a multicenter retrospective series.BACKGROUND: Randomized clinical trials showed the benefit of adjuvant trastuzumab-based chemotherapy (ATBC) for node-positive and/or >1 cm HER2+ breast carcinomas.No efficacy data have been published on ATBC in large series of pT1abN0 HER2+ tumors.PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective study evaluated 276 cases of pT1abN0 HER2+ breast tumors in eight French cancer centers.Factors associated with prognosis and ATBC prescription were analyzed.RESULTS: A total of 129 cases (47%) were treated with ATBC (ATBC+), 19 with chemotherapy alone, 5 with trastuzumab alone, and 123 (45%) with neither trastuzumab nor chemotherapy (ATBC-).ATBC use was associated with the date of diagnosis (before or after June 2005) and with poor prognostic features.At a median follow-up of 44 months, there were 13 recurrences in the ATBC- group and 2 in the ATBC+ group.ATBC was associated with a significant survival benefit (99% 40-month disease-free survival for ATBC+ versus 93% for ATBC- cases; P = 0.018).Lack of hormone receptors (HRs) and the presence of lymphovascular invasion (LVI) were significantly associated with a poor prognosis and a greater benefit of ATBC.CONCLUSIONS: ATBC was associated with a significantly reduced risk of recurrence in pT1abN0 HER2+ tumors, and was more beneficial in HR- and/or LVI+ tumors.",0,0,0,0
24323034,"Targeted androgen pathway suppression in localized prostate cancer: a pilot study.PURPOSE: Ligand-mediated activation of the androgen receptor (AR) is critical for prostate cancer (PCa) survival and proliferation.The failure to completely ablate tissue androgens may limit suppression of PCa growth.We evaluated combinations of CYP17A and 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors for reducing prostate androgen levels, AR signaling, and PCa volumes.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-five men with intermediate/high-risk clinically localized PCa were randomly assigned to goserelin combined with dutasteride (ZD), bicalutamide and dutasteride (ZBD), or bicalutamide, dutasteride, and ketoconazole (ZBDK) for 3 months before prostatectomy.Controls included patients receiving combined androgen blockade with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist and bicalutamide.The primary outcome measure was tissue dihydrotestosterone (DHT) concentration.RESULTS: Prostate DHT levels were substantially lower in all experimental arms (0.02 to 0.04 ng/g v 0.92 ng/g in controls; P < .001).The ZBDK group demonstrated the greatest percentage decline in serum testosterone, androsterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (P < .05 for all).Staining for AR and the androgen-regulated genes prostate-specific antigen and TMPRSS2 was strongly suppressed in benign glands and moderately in malignant glands (P < .05 for all).Two patients had pathologic complete response, and nine had </= 0.2 cm(3) of residual tumor (defined as a near-complete response), with the largest numbers of complete and near-complete responses in the ZBDK group.CONCLUSION: Addition of androgen synthesis inhibitors lowers prostate androgens below that achieved with standard therapy, but significant AR signaling remains.Tissue-based analysis of steroids and AR signaling is critical to informing the search for optimal local and systemic control of high-risk prostate cancer.",1,1,1,1
23899063,"Pathologic response and long-term follow-up in breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy: a comparison between classifications and their practical application.CONTEXT: Breast cancer is increasingly treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy to improve surgical resectability and evaluate tumor response, which is assessed histopathologically.Several histopathologic classification systems have been previously described for assessment of treatment response.OBJECTIVES: To test performance in a side-by-side comparison of several histopathologic classification systems after neoadjuvant chemotherapy with clinical outcome.DESIGN: Sixty-two patients were enrolled in a randomized trial receiving sequential neoadjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin and paclitaxel.Histologic sections from the patients' tumors sampled before (core biopsy) and after treatment (excision or mastectomy) were reviewed.Histologic response was assessed following National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project protocol B18, Miller-Payne grading, Sataloff tumor and nodes, Residual Cancer Burden (RCB), and Residual Disease in Breast and Nodes (RDBN).Pathologic classification results were correlated with survival using Kaplan-Meier and Cox hazards regression with a median follow-up of 93 months.RESULTS: RDBN was associated with distant disease-free survival by univariate and multivariate analysis (P = .01 and .004, respectively), as were lymph node metastases (P = .02 and .01, respectively).Five patients (8%) had complete pathologic response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and none of them relapsed during the study period.Survival was shorter among patients with higher Residual Cancer Burden scores, but the associations were not significant.Miller-Payne grading and Sataloff tumor scores were not correlated with survival.CONCLUSIONS: Evaluation of breast specimens after neoadjuvant chemotherapy by the composite index RDBN correlates with long-term outcome.The residual disease in breast and nodes system is suitable for routinely processed pathology cases.This study confirms the importance of lymph node status after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and favorable outcome in patients with pathologic complete response.",0,0,0,0
25668505,"Effect of the treatment with beta-glucan in women with cervical cytologic report of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (L-SIL).AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of beta-glucan in women with ASCUS or L-SIL, as detected by cervical cytologic screening.METHODS: A total of 356 women with ASCUS or L-SIL were enrolled and divided into two groups: 1) 176 patients, treated with topical beta-glucan; and 2) 180 patients who were only followed-up.The treatment consisted of two cycles of topical beta-glucan applied once a day for 20 consecutive days and treatment separated by ten days.The effect of beta-glucan was evaluated comparing Pap cytology results and colposcopic findings between treated patients and controls after 6 and 12 months of follow-up.RESULTS: After 6 months from enrollment, 63.1% (111/176) of patients treated with beta-glucan had a negative Pap smear versus 45% (81/180) of controls (P<0.001), and 43.4% (36/83) of treated patients versus 18.2% (14/77) of controls experienced the disappearance of colposcopic lesions (P=0.001).At the end of the 12-month follow up, 83.5% (147/176) of treated patients versus 60% (108/180) of controls had a negative Pap smear (P<0.001), and 55.4% (46/83) of treated patients versus 24.7% (19/77) of controls experienced the disappearance of colposcopic lesions (P<0.001).No side effects were observed in treated patients.CONCLUSION: beta-glucan increases the spontaneous regression rate of low-grade cytologic abnormalities as well as cervical findings.",0,0,0,0
24383843,"Imatinib 800 mg daily induces deeper molecular responses than imatinib 400 mg daily: results of SWOG S0325, an intergroup randomized PHASE II trial in newly diagnosed chronic phase chronic myeloid leukaemia.The standard dose of imatinib for newly diagnosed patients with chronic phase chronic myeloid leukaemia (CP-CML) is 400 mg daily (IM400), but the optimal dose is unknown.This randomized phase II study compared the rates of molecular, haematological and cytogenetic response to IM400 vs. imatinib 400 mg twice daily (IM800) in 153 adult patients with CP-CML.Dose adjustments for toxicity were flexible to maximize retention on study.Molecular response (MR) at 12 months was deeper in the IM800 arm (4-log reduction of BCR-ABL1 mRNA: 25% vs. 10% of patients, P = 0.038; 3-log reduction: 53% vs. 35%, P = 0.049).During the first 12 months BCR-ABL1 levels in the IM800 arm were an average 2.9-fold lower than in the IM400 arm (P = 0.010).Complete haematological response was similar, but complete cytogenetic response was higher with IM800 (85% vs. 67%, P = 0.040).Grade 3-4 toxicities were more common for IM800 (58% vs. 31%, P = 0.0007), and were most commonly haematological.Few patients have relapsed, progressed or died, but both progression-free (P = 0.048) and relapse-free (P = 0.031) survival were superior for IM800.In newly diagnosed CP-CML patients, IM800 induced deeper MRs than IM400, with a trend for improved progression-free and overall survival, but was associated with more severe toxicity.",1,1,1,1
24504441,"Functional and symptom impact of trametinib versus chemotherapy in BRAF V600E advanced or metastatic melanoma: quality-of-life analyses of the METRIC study.BACKGROUND: In a randomized phase III study, trametinib prolonged progression-free survival and improved overall survival versus chemotherapy in patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients' quality of life (QOL) was assessed at baseline and follow-up visits using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core QOL questionnaire.RESULTS: In the primary efficacy population (BRAF V600E+, no brain metastases) from baseline to weeks 6 and 12, patients' global health status scores worsened by 4-5 points with chemotherapy but improved by 2-3 points with trametinib.Rapid and substantive reductions in QOL functionality (e.g. role functioning, 8-11 points at weeks 6 and 12) and symptom exacerbation (e.g. fatigue, 4-8 points; nausea and vomiting, 5 points, both at weeks 6 and 12) were observed in chemotherapy-treated patients.In contrast, trametinib-treated patients reported small improvements or slight worsening from baseline at week 12, depending on the functional dimension and symptom.The mean symptom-scale scores for chemotherapy-treated patients increased from baseline (symptoms worsened) for seven of eight symptoms at week 6 (except insomnia) and six of eight symptoms at week 12 (except dyspnea and insomnia).In contrast, at weeks 6 and 12, the mean symptom-scale scores for trametinib decreased from baseline (symptoms improved) for pain (11-12 points), insomnia (10-12 points), and appetite loss (1-5 points), whereas those for diarrhea worsened (15-16 points).Mixed-model repeated-measures analyses showed significant (P < 0.05) and/or clinically meaningful improvements (small to moderate) from baseline in favor of trametinib for global health; physical, role, and social functioning; fatigue; pain; insomnia; nausea and vomiting; constipation; dyspnea; and appetite at weeks 6 and/or 12.QOL results for the intent-to-treat population were consistent.CONCLUSIONS: This first QOL assessment for a MEK inhibitor in metastatic melanoma demonstrated that trametinib was associated with less functional impairment, smaller declines in health status, and less exacerbation of symptoms versus chemotherapy.",0,0,0,0

22614994,"Reach out to enhance wellness home-based diet-exercise intervention promotes reproducible and sustainable long-term improvements in health behaviors, body weight, and physical functioning in older, overweight/obese cancer survivors.PURPOSE: Diet and exercise interventions have been tested in cancer survivors as a means to reduce late effects and comorbidity, but few have assessed adherence and health outcomes long term.METHODS: Between July 2005 and May 2007, the Reach Out to Enhance Wellness (RENEW) trial accrued 641 locoregionally staged, long-term (>/= 5 years from diagnosis) colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer survivors in the United States (21 states), Canada, and the United Kingdom.All participants were sedentary (< 150 minutes of physical activity [PA] a week), overweight or obese (body mass index, 25 to 40 kg/m(2)), and over age 65 years.The trial tested a diet-exercise intervention delivered via mailed print materials and telephone counseling.RENEW used a wait-list control, cross-over design (ie, participants received the year-long intervention immediately or after a 1-year delay), which allowed the opportunity to assess program efficacy (previously reported primary outcome), durability, and reproducibility (reported herein).Measures included diet quality (DQ), PA, BMI, and physical function (PF).RESULTS: No significant relapse was observed in the immediate-intervention arm for DQ, PA, and BMI; however, rates of functional decline increased when the intervention ceased.From year 1 to year 2, significant improvements were observed in the delayed-intervention arm; mean change scores in behaviors and BMI and PF slopes were as follows: DQ score, 5.2 (95% CI, 3.4 to 7.0); PA, 45.8 min/wk (95% CI, 26.9 to 64.6 min/wk); BMI, -0.56 (95% CI, -0.75 to -0.36); and Short Form-36 PF, -1.02 versus -5.52 (P < .001 for all measures).Overall, both arms experienced significant improvements in DQ, PA, and BMI from baseline to 2-year follow-up (P < .001).CONCLUSION: Older cancer survivors respond favorably to lifestyle interventions and make durable changes in DQ and PA that contribute to sustained weight loss.These changes positively reorient functional decline trajectories during intervention delivery.",1,1,0,0
25582141,"Prognostic factors of survival in a randomized phase III trial (MPACT) of weekly nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine versus gemcitabine alone in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.BACKGROUND: nab-Paclitaxel in combination with gemcitabine has emerged as a new treatment option for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer (MPC), based on superiority over gemcitabine demonstrated in the phase III MPACT trial.Previously, Karnofsky performance status (KPS) score and the presence of liver metastases were shown to be predictive of survival with nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine treatment.This analysis sought to further explore the relationship between clinical characteristics and survival in the MPACT trial and to identify potential predictors of overall survival and progression-free survival in patients with MPC.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cox regression models adjusted for stratification factors and a stepwise multivariate analysis of prespecified baseline prognostic factors were performed.RESULTS: Treatment effect was significantly associated with survival, with a similar magnitude of reduction in risk of death compared with the previously reported primary analysis.Treatment effect consistently favored nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine across the majority of the prespecified factors.In addition to KPS score and presence of liver metastases, age and number of metastatic sites were independent prognostic factors of overall and progression-free survival.Baseline carbohydrate antigen 19-9 was not found to be an independent prognostic factor of survival in this analysis.CONCLUSION: The results of this analysis confirm broad utility of nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine for the treatment of MPC.In addition, these findings suggest that KPS score, presence of liver metastases, age, and number of metastatic sites are important predictors of survival that may be useful when making treatment decisions and designing future clinical trials.",0,0,0,0

23519566,"The role of physical activity and physical fitness in postcancer fatigue: a randomized controlled trial.PURPOSE: Patients suffering from postcancer fatigue have both an inferior physical activity and physical fitness compared to non-fatigued cancer survivors.The aims of this study were (1) to examine the effect of cognitive behavior therapy, an effective treatment for postcancer fatigue, on physical activity and physical fitness and (2) to examine whether the effect of cognitive behavior therapy on postcancer fatigue is mediated by physical activity and/or physical fitness.METHODS: Severely fatigued cancer survivors were randomly assigned to either the intervention (cognitive behavior therapy) or the waiting list condition.After assigning 23 patients in the intervention condition and 14 patients in the waiting list condition, they were assessed both at baseline and 6 months later.Physical activity was assessed via actigraphy and physical fitness was assessed by a maximal exercise test.A nonparametric bootstrap approach was used to test the statistical significance of the mediation effects.RESULTS: A significant increase in physical activity was observed in the intervention group from baseline to follow-up, whereas physical activity did not change from baseline to follow-up in the waiting list group.Physical fitness did not significantly change after cognitive behavior therapy or after 6 months of waiting for therapy.Fatigue decreased more significantly in the intervention group than in the waiting list group.The mediation hypotheses were rejected.CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive behavior therapy effectively reduced postcancer fatigue and increased physical activity but did not change physical fitness.The effect of cognitive behavior therapy on postcancer fatigue is not mediated by a change in physical activity or physical fitness.",0,0,0,0
23222500,"When does an episode of care for cancer begin?BACKGROUND: Little is known about the medical care resources devoted to diagnosing and treating cancer-related symptoms before a definitive cancer diagnosis.Previous research using SEER-Medicare data to measure incremental costs and utilization associated with cancer started with the date of diagnosis.We hypothesized that health care use increases before diagnosis of a new primary cancer.METHODS: We used a longitudinal case-control design to estimate incremental medical care utilization rates.Cases were 121,293 persons enrolled between January 2000 and December 2008 with >/=1 primary cancers.We selected 522,839 controls randomly from among all health plan members who had no tumor registry evidence of cancer before January 2009, and we frequency matched controls to cancer cases on a 5:1 ratio by age group, sex, and having health plan eligibility in the year of diagnosis of the index cancer case.Utilization data were extracted for all cases and controls for the period 2000 to 2008 from standardized distributed data warehouses.To determine when and the extent to which patterns of medical care use change preceding a cancer diagnosis, we compute hospitalization rates, hospital days, emergency department visits, same-day surgical procedures, ambulatory medical office visits, imaging procedures, laboratory tests, and ambulatory prescription dispensings per 1000 persons per month within integrated delivery systems.RESULTS: One- to 3-fold increases in monthly utilization rates were observed during the 3 to 5 months before a cancer diagnosis, compared with matched noncancer control groups.This pattern was consistent for both aged and nonaged cancer patients.Aged cancer patients had higher utilization rates than nonaged cancer patients throughout the year before a cancer diagnosis.CONCLUSIONS: The prediagnosis phase is a resource-intensive component of cancer care episodes and should be included in cost of cancer estimates.More research is needed to determine whether reliable prognostic markers can be identified as the start of a cancer episode before a pathology-based diagnosis.",0,0,0,0

Patients received paclitaxel (200 mg/m2, day 1) plus carboplatin (AUC 6 mg/mL/min, day 1) every 3 weeks in arm A, or gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2, days 1 and 8) plus carboplatin (AUC 5 mg/mL/min, day1) every 3 weeks in arm B. Non-progressive patients following 3 cycles of induction chemotherapy received maintenance gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2, days 1 and 8) every 3 weeks.( TRIAL REGISTRATION: UMIN000008252)RESULTS: The study was stopped because of delayed accrual at interim analysis.Of the randomly assigned 50 patients, 49 except for one in arm B were evaluable.Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 4.6 months for arm A vs. 3.5 months for arm B (HR = 1.03; 95% CI, 0.45-2.27; p = 0.95) and median overall survival (OS) was 15.0 months for arm A vs. 14.8 months for arm B (HR = 0.79; 95% CI, 0.40-1.51; p = 0.60), showing no difference between the two arms.The response rate, disease control rate, and the transit rate to maintenance phase were 36.0% (9/25), 64.0% (16/25), and 48% (12/25) for arm A vs. 16.7% (4/24), 50.0% (12/24), and 33% (8/24) for arm B, which were also statistically similar between the two arms (p = 0.13, p = 0.32, and p = 0.30, respectively).Both induction regimens were tolerable, except that more patients experienced peripheral neuropathy in arm A.

Continuous accelerated irradiation of 7-days per week is equal to accelerated fractionation with concomitant boost of 7 fractions in 5-days per week: report on phase 3 clinical trial in head-and-neck cancer patients.PURPOSE: To report long-term results of randomized trial comparing 2 accelerated fractionations of definitive radiation therapy assessing the need to irradiate during weekend in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 345 patients with SCC of the oral cavity, larynx, and oro- or hypo-pharynx, stage T2-4N0-1M0, were randomized to receive continuous accelerated irradiation (CAIR: once per day, 7 days per week) or concomitant accelerated boost (CB: once per day, 3 days per week, and twice per day, 2 days per week).Total dose ranged from 66.6-72 Gy, dose per fraction was 1.8 Gy, number of fractions ranged from 37-40 fractions, and overall treatment time ranged from 37-40 days.RESULTS: No differences for all trial end-points were noted.At 5 and 10 years, the actuarial rates of local-regional control were 63% and 60% for CAIR vs 65% and 60% for CB, and the corresponding overall survival were 40% and 25% vs 44% and 25%, respectively.Confluent mucositis was the main acute toxicity, with an incidence of 89% in CAIR and 86% in CB patients.The 5-year rate of grade 3-4 late radiation morbidity was 6% for both regimens.CONCLUSIONS: Results of this trial indicate that the effects of accelerated fractionation can be achieve by delivering twice-per-day irradiation on weekday(s).This trial has also confirmed that an accelerated, 6-weeks schedule is a reasonable option for patients with intermediate-stage head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma because of the associated high cure rate and minimal severe late toxicity.",0,0,0,0
24924798,"Patient-reported genitourinary dysfunction after laparoscopic and open rectal cancer surgery in a randomized trial (COLOR II).BACKGROUND: This article reports on patient-reported sexual dysfunction and micturition symptoms following a randomized trial of laparoscopic and open surgery for rectal cancer.METHODS: Patients in the COLOR II randomized trial, comparing laparoscopic and open surgery for rectal cancer, completed the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-CR38 questionnaire before surgery, and after 4 weeks, 6, 12 and 24 months.Adjusted mean differences on a 100-point scale were calculated using changes from baseline value at the various time points in the domains of sexual functioning, sexual enjoyment, male and female sexual problems, and micturition symptoms.RESULTS: Of 617 randomized patients, 385 completed this phase of the trial.Their mean age was 67.1 years.Surgery caused an anticipated reduction in genitourinary function after 4 weeks, with no significant differences between laparoscopic and open approaches.An improvement in sexual dysfunction was seen in the first year, but some male sexual problems persisted.Before operation 64.5 per cent of men in the laparoscopic group and 55.6 per cent in the open group reported some degree of erectile dysfunction.This increased to 81.1 and 80.5 per cent respectively 4 weeks after surgery, and 76.3 versus 75.5 per cent at 12 months, with no significant differences between groups.Micturition symptoms were less affected than sexual function and gradually improved to preoperative levels by 6 months.Adjusting for confounders, including radiotherapy, did not change these results.CONCLUSION: Sexual dysfunction is common in patients with rectal cancer, and treatment (including surgery) increases the proportion of patients affected.A laparoscopic approach does not change this.REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT00297791 (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov).",0,0,0,0
25194966,"Effects of DASH diet on lipid profiles and biomarkers of oxidative stress in overweight and obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome: a randomized clinical trial.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the effects of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet on lipid profiles and biomarkers of oxidative stress in overweight and obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).METHODS: This randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted with 48 women diagnosed with PCOS.The women were randomly assigned to consume either the control (n = 24) or DASH diet (n = 24) for 8 wk.Both diets were designed to be calorie-restricted.Both diets consisted of 52% carbohydrates, 18% proteins, and 30% total fats.The DASH diet was designed to be rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products and to be low in saturated fats, cholesterol, and refined grains.Fasting blood samples were taken at baseline and after 8-wk intervention to measure lipid profiles and biomarkers of oxidative stress including plasma total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and total glutathione (GSH).RESULTS: Adherence to the DASH diet, compared with the control diet, resulted in a significant decrease in weight (-4.4 versus -1.5 kg; P < 0.001) and body mass index (-1.7 versus -0.6 kg/m(2); P < 0.001), decreased serum triglycerides (-10.0 versus +19.2 mg/dL; P interaction = 0.005) and very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (-2.0 versus +3.9 mg/dL; P interaction = 0.005).Increased concentrations of TAC (+98.6 versus -174.8 mmol/L; P interaction <0.001) and GSH (+66.4 versus -155.6 mumol/L; P interaction = 0.005) also were found in the DASH group compared with the control group.CONCLUSION: Consumption of DASH diet for 8 wk led to a significant reduction in serum insulin, triglycerides and very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and a significant increase in TAC and GSH levels.",0,0,0,0
23335153,"Reducing the psychological distress of family caregivers of home-based palliative care patients: short-term effects from a randomised controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Palliative care is expected to incorporate comprehensive support for family caregivers given that many caregivers suffer psychological morbidity.However, systematically implemented evidence-based psychological support initiatives are lacking.AIM: The objective of this study was to prepare caregivers for the role of supporting a patient with advanced cancer receiving home-based palliative care by offering a one-to-one psycho-educational intervention.We hypothesised that primary family caregivers who participated in the intervention would report decreased psychological distress (primary outcome), fewer unmet needs and increased levels of perceived preparedness, competence and positive emotions.METHODS: A three-arm randomised controlled trial was conducted comparing two versions of the intervention (one face-to-face visit versus two visits) plus standard care to a control group (standard care) across four sites in Australia.RESULTS: A total of 298 participants were recruited; 148 were in the Control condition, 57 in Intervention 1 (one visit) and 93 in Intervention 2 (two visits).Relative to participants in the control group; the psychological well-being of participants in the intervention condition was improved by a small amount but non-significantly.No significant reduction in unmet needs or improvements in positive aspects of caregiving amongst the intervention group were identified.However, the intervention demonstrated significant improvements in participants' levels of preparedness and competence for Intervention 2.CONCLUSION/IMPLICATIONS: This research adds to accumulating body of evidence demonstrating that relatively short psycho-educational interventions can enable family caregivers to feel more prepared and competent in the role of supporting a dying relative.Further investigation is required to determine the longer term outcomes of such interventions.",0,0,0,0

22798186,"A dual-institution randomized controlled trial of remnant closure after distal pancreatectomy: does the addition of a falciform patch and fibrin glue improve outcomes?OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to assess the efficacy of two pancreatic remnant closure techniques following distal pancreatectomy: (1) stapled or sutured closure versus (2) stapled or sutured closure plus falciform patch and fibrin glue reinforcement in the setting of a prospective randomized trial, with the primary endpoint being pancreatic fistula.Pancreatic stump leak following left-sided pancreatic resection (distal pancreatectomy) remains common.Despite multiple and varied techniques for closure, the reported leak rate varies up to 30 %.A retrospective analysis by Iannitti et al. (J Am Coll Surg 203(6):857-864, 2006) detected a decreased leak rate in patients receiving a traditional closure buttressed with an autologous falciform ligament patch and fibrin glue.METHODS: Between April 2008 and October 2011, all willing patients scheduled to undergo distal pancreatectomy at the authors' institutions were consented and enrolled at the preoperative office visit.Patients were intraoperatively stratified as having hard or soft glands and randomized to one of two groups: (1) closure utilizing stapling or suturing (SS) versus (2) stapled or sutured plus falciform ligament patch and fibrin glue (FF).The trial design and power analysis (alpha = 0.05, beta = 0.2, power 80 %, chi-square test) hypothesized that the FF intervention would reduce the primary endpoint (pancreatic fistula) from 30 % to 15 % and targeted an accrual goal of 190 patients.Secondary endpoints included length of postoperative hospital stay, 30-day mortality, hospital readmission, and ISGPF fistula grade (A, B, and C).RESULTS: The trial accrued 109 patients, 55 in the SS group and 54 in the FF group.Enrollment was closed prior to the target accrual, following an interim analysis and futility calculation.Due to insufficient enrollment, patients stratified as having a hard gland were excluded (n = 8) from analysis, leaving 101 patients in the soft stratum.The overall pancreatic leak rate was 19.8 % (20 patients) for patients with soft glands.Patients randomized to the FF group had a leak rate of 20 %, as compared with 19.6 % in the SS group (p = 1.000).Fistula grades in both groups were identical: 1A, 8B, and 1C in the FF group as compared to 1A, 8B, and 1C in the SS group.Complication rates were comparable between the two groups.The median length of postoperative hospital stay was 5 days in both groups.There was a trend towards a higher 30-day readmission rate in the FF group (28 % vs. 17.6 %, p = 0.243).CONCLUSION: The addition of a falciform ligament patch and fibrin glue to standard stapled or sutured remnant closure did not reduce the rate or severity of pancreatic fistula in patients undergoing distal pancreatectomy (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00889213).",0,0,0,0
23412098,"Phase II randomised proof-of-concept study of the urokinase inhibitor upamostat (WX-671) in combination with gemcitabine compared with gemcitabine alone in patients with non-resectable, locally advanced pancreatic cancer.BACKGROUND: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of the urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) inhibitor upamostat in combination with gemcitabine in locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma (LAPC).METHODS: Within a prospective multicenter study, LAPC patients were randomly assigned to receive 1000 mg m(-2) of gemcitabine IV weekly either alone (arm A) or in combination with 200 mg (arm B) or 400 mg (arm C) oral upamostat daily.Efficacy endpoints of this proof-of-concept study included response rate, time to first metastasis, progression-free and overall survival (OS).RESULTS: Of the 95 enroled patients, 85 were evaluable for response and 93 for safety.Median OS was 12.5 months (95% CI 8.2-18.2) in arm C, 9.7 months (95% CI 8.4-17.1) in arm B and 9.9 months (95% CI 7.4-12.1) in arm A; corresponding 1-year survival rates were 50.6%, 40.7% and 33.9%, respectively.More patients achieved a partial remission (confirmed responses by RECIST) with upamostat combination therapy (arm C: 12.9%; arm B: 7.1%; arm A: 3.8%).Overall, only 12 patients progressed by developing detectable distant metastasis (arm A: 4, arm B: 6, arm C: 2).The most common adverse events considered to be related to upamostat were asthenia, fever and nausea.CONCLUSION: In this proof-of-concept study targeting the uPA system in LAPC, the addition of upamostat to gemcitabine was tolerated well; similar survival results were observed for the three treatment arms.",1,1,1,1

21699645,"Usefulness of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) rise as a marker of prostate cancer in men treated with dutasteride: lessons from the REDUCE study.OBJECTIVES: To determine if dutasteride-treated men can be monitored safely and adequately for prostate cancer based on data from the Reduction by Dutasteride in Prostate Cancer Events (REDUCE) study.To analyse whether the use of treatment-specific criteria for repeat biopsy maintains the usefulness of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level for detecting high grade cancers.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The REDUCE study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled investigation of whether dutasteride (0.5 mg/day) reduced the risk of biopsy-detectable prostate cancer in men with a previous negative biopsy.The usefulness of PSA was evaluated using biopsy thresholds defined by National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines in the placebo group and any rise in PSA from nadir (the lowest PSA level achieved while in the study) in the dutasteride group.The number of cancers detected on biopsy in the absence of increased/suspicious PSA level as well as sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for high grade prostate cancer detection were analysed by treatment group.Prostate cancer pathological characteristics were compared between men who did and did not meet biopsy thresholds.RESULTS: Of 8231 men randomized, 3305 (dutasteride) and 3424 (placebo) underwent at least one prostate biopsy during the study and were included in the analysis.If only men meeting biopsy thresholds underwent biopsy, 25% (47/191) of Gleason 7 and 24% (7/29) of Gleason 8-10 cancers would have been missed in the dutasteride group, and 37% (78/209) of Gleason 7 and 22% (4/18) Gleason 8-10 cancers would have been missed in the placebo group.In both groups, the incidence of Gleason 7 and Gleason 8-10 cancers generally increased with greater rises in PSA.Sensitivity of PSA kinetics was higher and specificity was lower for the detection of Gleason 7-10 cancers in men treated with dutasteride vs placebo.Men with Gleason 7 and Gleason 8-10 cancer meeting biopsy thresholds had greater numbers of positive cores, percent core involvement, and biopsy cancer volume vs men not meeting thresholds.CONCLUSION: Using treatment-specific biopsy thresholds, the present study shows that the ability of PSA kinetics to detect high grade prostate cancer is maintained with dutasteride compared with placebo in men with a previous negative biopsy.The sensitivity of PSA kinetics with dutasteride was similar to (Gleason 8-10) or higher than (Gleason 7-10) the placebo group; however, biopsy decisions based on a single increased PSA measurement from nadir in the dutasteride group resulted in a lower specificity compared with using a comparable biopsy threshold in the placebo group, indicating the importance of confirmation of PSA measurements.",0,0,0,0
23442174,"Monitoring laparoscopic radiofrequency renal lesions in real time using contrast-enhanced ultrasonography: an open-label, randomized, comparative pilot trial.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has been considered as an important therapy for small renal lesions.The main limitation of RFA, however, is the lack of pathologic confirmation of complete tumor eradication.A single center, open label, randomized pilot study was designed to evaluate whether contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) with Sonovue, performed in real time could allow us to determine the end point during laparoscopic radiofrequency ablation (LRFA) and the clinical outcome of this method.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ninety-six patients undergoing LRFA were randomly assigned to CEUS or a control group; finally, 38 and 40 patients with a pathologic diagnosis of renal-cell carcinoma completed a 3-month follow-up.CEUS was conducted in real time during the procedure to determine the end point in the CEUS group.The primary outcome was the incomplete ablation rate according to a radiographic image at 3 months after the procedure.The secondary outcome included the local tumor control rate and disease-free survival rate.RESULTS: There were no differences in the incomplete ablation rate and disease-free survival rate between the two groups.Within a median 16-month follow-up period, three incomplete ablations and two local recurrences according to a radiographic image were found in the control group.Meanwhile, there was no incomplete ablation or recurrence but one lung metastasis in the CEUS group.The local tumor control rate was 87.5% (35/40) in the control group vs 100% (38/38) (P=0.073) in the CEUS group.CONCLUSION: In patients undergoing LRFA, there were no differences in the incomplete ablation rate and local tumor control rate between the CEUS group and the control group in our study despite a nonsignificant trend in favor of CEUS.CEUS may have the potential to provide more effective renal tumor ablation.These novel data support the need for a larger study of CEUS during LRFA surgery.",0,0,0,0
24503408,"In vivo intraocular distribution and safety of periocular nanoparticle carboplatin for treatment of advanced retinoblastoma in humans.PURPOSE: To study the intraocular distribution and safety of polymethylmethacrylate nanoparticles loaded with carboplatin after posterior subtenon injection in humans.DESIGN: Prospective, interventional, comparative case series.METHODS: Six patients (mean age: 26.83 +/- 7.5 years), scheduled to undergo planned uniocular enucleation in an institutional setting, were randomly divided into 3 groups.Each group received a 10 mg/mL posterior subtenon injection of nanoparticle carboplatin in the eye to be enucleated.Two eyes were enucleated 6, 24 and 72 hours post injection.Intravenous blood was collected during enucleation.The concentration of carboplatin reaching various intraocular tissues was determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy.The drug toxicity in the ocular tissues was assessed by histopathology and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy.RESULTS: The highest level of carboplatin was detected in retinas (8.33 +/- 1.69 mg/g), up to 24 hours post treatment.The intravitreal concentration continued to increase gradually until 72 hours (3.46 +/- 0.26 mg/g).The choroids and lenses showed very low levels of carboplatin after 6 hours, with negligible amounts at 72 hours.No signs of tissue damage were observed on histopathology or electron microscopy.Intravenous concentration of carboplatin was undetectable in all patients.CONCLUSION: Results may indicate an increased facilitated trans-scleral transport of nanoparticle carboplatin, with a sustained-release behavior but without any associated short-term ocular or systemic side effects in humans.The very high concentrations achieved in vitreous and retina after a single posterior subtenon injection may be clinically useful for adjunctive treatment of advanced intraocular retinoblastoma with vitreous seeds.However, further studies are needed to assess long-term toxicity and clinical efficacy.",0,0,0,0

And the secondary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR) and overall survival (OS).RESULTS: They were randomized into gefitinib arm (n = 25) and paclitaxel/carboplatin arm (n = 26).The median PFS was 4.2 months in gefitinib arm and 8.3 months in paclitaxel/carboplatin arm (P = 0.422); ORR 36.0% in gefitinib arm and 42.3% in paclitaxel/carboplatin arm (P = 0.645); Median OS 14.4 months in gefitinib arm and 15.0 months in paclitaxel/carboplatin arm (P = 0.290).Multifactorial Cox regression analysis showed that age (P = 0.004), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutation status (P = 0.012) and subsequent treatments (platinum-based chemotherapy, P = 0.001; EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), P = 0.005) were the significant predictors of OS.CONCLUSIONS: No significant differences exist in terms of efficacy and survival between first-line gefitinib and paclitaxel/carboplatin for Chinese patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma who are non-smokers or former light smokers.And age, EGFR gene mutation status and subsequent treatments are significant predictor of OS.However, first-line gefitinib should not be recommended for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients only based on clinical factors, due to a very small sample-size in our study.",1,1,1,1
25361981,"Molecular subtype and tumor characteristics of breast cancer metastases as assessed by gene expression significantly influence patient post-relapse survival.BACKGROUND: We and others have recently shown that tumor characteristics are altered throughout tumor progression.These findings emphasize the need for re-examination of tumor characteristics at relapse and have led to recommendations from ESMO and the Swedish Breast Cancer group.Here, we aim to determine whether tumor characteristics and molecular subtypes in breast cancer metastases confer clinically relevant prognostic information for patients.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The translational aspect of the Swedish multicenter randomized trial called TEX included 111 patients with at least one biopsy from a morphologically confirmed locoregional or distant breast cancer metastasis diagnosed from December 2002 until June 2007.All patients had detailed clinical information, complete follow-up, and metastasis gene expression information (Affymetrix array GPL10379).We assessed the previously published gene expression modules describing biological processes [proliferation, apoptosis, human epidermal receptor 2 (HER2) and estrogen (ER) signaling, tumor invasion, immune response, and angiogenesis] and pathways (Ras, MAPK, PTEN, AKT-MTOR, PI3KCA, IGF1, Src, Myc, E2F3, and beta-catenin) and the intrinsic subtypes (PAM50).Furthermore, by contrasting genes expressed in the metastases in relation to survival, we derived a poor metastasis survival signature.RESULTS: A significant reduction in post-relapse breast cancer-specific survival was associated with low-ER receptor signaling and apoptosis gene module scores, and high AKT-MTOR, Ras, and beta-catenin module scores.Similarly, intrinsic subtyping of the metastases provided statistically significant post-relapse survival information with the worst survival outcome in the basal-like [hazard ratio (HR) 3.7; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3-10.9] and HER2-enriched (HR 4.4; 95% CI 1.5-12.8) subtypes compared with the luminal A subtype.Overall, 25% of the metastases were basal-like, 32% HER2-enriched, 10% luminal A, 28% luminal B, and 5% normal-like.CONCLUSIONS: We show that tumor characteristics and molecular subtypes of breast cancer metastases significantly influence post-relapse patient survival, emphasizing that molecular investigations at relapse provide prognostic and clinically relevant information.CLINICALTRIALS.GOV: This is the translational part of the Swedish multicenter and randomized trial TEX, clinicaltrials.gov identifier nct01433614 (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct01433614).",0,0,0,0

24447190,"Trait and state disgust: an experimental investigation of disgust and avoidance in colorectal cancer decision scenarios.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether trait and experimentally manipulated state disgust independently and/or interactively predict immediate and anticipated avoidance in decision scenarios related to colorectal cancer (CRC).METHOD: Eighty participants, aged 18 to 66 years, completed questionnaires assessing trait disgust prior to a laboratory session.Participants were gender block randomized to disgust or control conditions before completing tasks assessing immediate avoidance of a CRC disgust elicitor (stoma bag) and anticipated avoidance in hypothetical CRC scenarios.RESULTS: Manipulation checks confirmed the elicitation of disgust in the experimental condition.Persons in the experimental condition were more likely to exhibit immediate avoidance behaviors in response to a commonly used bowel disease device (stoma bag), and trait disgust predicted time to touch the device.Trait disgust also moderated the influence of state disgust on anticipated avoidance, namely delay in help seeking for bowel symptoms and predicted rating disgusting side effects as more deterring to adherence.CONCLUSIONS: The current report suggests the importance of examining disgust in CRC contexts and provides the first empirical demonstration that state and trait aspects of disgust may interactively operate to deter certain types of decisions.It thus furthers understanding of emotions and avoidance in a health context that has had surprisingly little focus to date.",0,0,0,0

22674529,"A phase 3 study of induction treatment with concurrent chemoradiotherapy versus chemotherapy before surgery in patients with pathologically confirmed N2 stage IIIA nonsmall cell lung cancer (WJTOG9903).BACKGROUND: This study sought to ascertain whether induction-concurrent radiotherapy added to chemotherapy could improve the survival of patients undergoing surgery for stage IIIA N2 nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC).METHODS: Patients with pathologically proven N2 disease were randomized to receive either induction chemotherapy (docetaxel 60 mg/m(2) and carboplatin AUC [area under the receiver operating characteristic curve] = 5 for 2 cycles) plus concurrent radiation therapy (40 Gy) followed by surgery (CRS arm) or induction chemotherapy followed by surgery (CS arm).They subsequently underwent pulmonary resection when possible.RESULTS: Sixty patients were randomly assigned between December 2000 and August 2005.The study was prematurely terminated in January 2006 because of slow accrual.The most common toxicity was grade 3 or 4 leukopenia in 92.9% of patients in the CRS arm and 46.4% in the CS arm.Induction therapy was generally well tolerated, and there were no treatment-related deaths in either arm.Downstaging in the CS arm and CRS arm was 21% and 40%, respectively.The progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in the CS arm were 9.7 months and 29.9 months (PFS, hazard ratio [HR] = 0.68, P = .187), and those in the CRS arm were 12.4 months and 39.6 months (OS, HR = 0.77, P = .397), respectively.The PFS with and without downstaging was 55.0 and 9.4 months, respectively (HR = 3.39, P = .001).The OS with and without downstaging was 63.3 and 29.5 months, respectively (HR = 2.62, P = .021).CONCLUSIONS: The addition of radiotherapy to induction chemotherapy conferred better local control without significant adverse events.Tumor downstaging is important for prolonging the OS in patients with stage IIIA (N2) NSCLC.",1,1,1,1
22383680,"Influence of zoledronic acid on disseminated tumor cells in primary breast cancer patients.BACKGROUND: The presence of disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) in bone marrow of patients with early breast cancer (EBC) has been correlated with increased risk of metastatic disease or locoregional relapse.Zoledronic acid (ZOL) treatment has reduced DTCs in the bone marrow of patients with EBC in several studies.This controlled study sought to confirm these observations.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with EBC and DTC-positive bone marrow were randomized (N = 96) to treatment with ZOL plus adjuvant systemic therapy or adjuvant systemic therapy alone.The change in DTC numbers at 12 months versus baseline was measured.RESULTS: DTC-positive patients treated with ZOL were more likely to become DTC-negative after 12 months of treatment compared with the controls (67% versus 35%; P = 0.009).At 12 months, DTC counts decreased to a mean of 0.5 +/- 0.8 DTCs in the ZOL group and to 0.9 +/- 0.8 DTCs in the control group.In addition, ZOL was generally well tolerated.CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with ZOL improves elimination of DTCs.Further studies are needed to determine whether the reduction in DTCs by ZOL provides clinical benefit.",1,1,1,1

23578722,"Dose-dense rituximab-CHOP compared with standard rituximab-CHOP in elderly patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (the LNH03-6B study): a randomised phase 3 trial.BACKGROUND: Immunochemotherapy with rituximab and cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) has become the standard of care for elderly patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.We aimed to ascertain if a dose-dense R-CHOP regimen administered every 2 weeks (R-CHOP14) was superior to the standard 3-week schedule (R-CHOP21).METHODS: We did a randomised phase 3 trial at 83 centres in four countries.602 patients aged 60-80 years with untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and at least one adverse prognostic factor (age-adjusted international prognostic index >/= 1) were eligible for the study.We randomly allocated individuals to R-CHOP-ie, rituximab (375 mg/m(2)), cyclophosphamide (750 mg/m(2)), doxorubicin (50 mg/m(2)), vincristine (1.4 mg/m(2), up to 2 mg) all on day 1, and prednisone 40 mg/m(2) daily for 5 days-administered every 14 days (n=304) or every 21 days (n=298) for eight cycles.We did permuted-block randomisation (block size four, allocation ratio 1:1) stratified by centre and number of adverse prognostic factors.The primary endpoint was event-free survival.Our analysis was of the intention-to-treat population, and we present the final analysis.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00144755.FINDINGS: Two patients allocated R-CHOP21 were ineligible for the study and were excluded from analyses.After median follow-up of 56 months (IQR 27-60), 3-year event-free survival was 56% (95% CI 50-62) in the R-CHOP14 group and 60% (55-66) in the R-CHOP21 group (hazard ratio 1.04, 95% CI 0.82-1.31; p=0.7614).Grade 3-4 neutropenia occurred in 224 (74%) of 304 patients allocated R-CHOP14 and 189 (64%) of 296 assigned R-CHOP21, despite increased use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor in the R-CHOP14 group compared with the R-CHOP21 group.143 (47%) patients in the R-CHOP14 group received at least one red-blood-cell transfusion versus 93 (31%) in the R-CHOP21 group (p=0.0001).35 (12%) patients allocated R-CHOP14 received at least one platelet transfusion versus 25 (8%) assigned R-CHOP21 (p=0.2156).155 (51%) patients who were assigned R-CHOP14 had at least one serious adverse event compared with 140 (47%) who were allocated R-CHOP21.INTERPRETATION: In elderly patients with untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and at least one adverse prognostic factor, a 2-week dose-dense R-CHOP regimen did not improve efficacy compared with the 3-week standard schedule.The frequency of toxic side-effects was similar between regimens, but R-CHOP14 was associated with increased need for red-blood-cell transfusion.FUNDING: Groupe d'Etude des Lymphomes de l'Adulte (GELA), Amgen.",1,1,1,0
23374147,"Immunomodulatory effects of total intravenous and balanced inhalation anesthesia in patients with bladder cancer undergoing elective radical cystectomy: preliminary results.BACKGROUND: Although surgery and anesthesia induce immunesuppression, remains largely unknown whether various anesthetic techniques have different immunosuppressive effects on cancer patients.Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the influence of total intravenous anesthesia with target-controlled infusion (TIVA-TCI) and balanced inhalation anesthesia (BAL) on the peri-operative levels of inflammatory cytokines and regulatory T cells (Tregs) in patients with bladder cancer undergoing surgery.METHODS: Twenty eight consecutive patients with bladder cancer who underwent radical cystectomy were prospectively randomized into two groups to receive TIVA-TCI (n = 14) or BAL (n = 14).Before the induction of anesthesia (T0), 6-8 hours (T1) post-surgery, and 5 days post-surgery (T2), Tregs and serum levels of interleukin -1beta (IL-1beta), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin -2 (IL-2), interleukin -6 (IL-6), and interleukin -10 (IL-10) were measured.RESULTS: In the peri-operative period all cancer patients showed a marked and significant increase in IL-6.Moreover, TIVA-TCI patients also showed a higher increase in IFN-gamma, whereas in BAL patients Tregs were reduced by approximately 30% during surgery.The incidence of infections, metastases, and death was similar in both groups.CONCLUSIONS: The increase in the Th1 response in the TIVA-TCI group and the reduction in Tregs in the BAL group seem to balance the immunosuppressive effect induced by IL-6.Therefore TIVA-TCI and BAL can be both used in major surgery in patients with bladder cancer without worsening the outcome.",0,0,0,0
22520631,"Ability of C-reactive protein to complement multiple prognostic classifiers in men with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer receiving docetaxel-based chemotherapy.UNLABELLED: What's known on the subject? and What does the study add?Serum C-reactive protein (C-reactive protein) is emerging as a potential novel prognostic factor in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).In the present study, a prospective trial was investigated retrospectively and a significant prognostic impact for C-reactive protein that was independent of multiple published prognostic models was identified in men receiving docetaxel-based chemotherapy for mCRPC.Prospective validation is warranted.OBJECTIVE: * Given the recent emergence of C-reactive protein levels as a novel prognostic factor in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), we sought to evaluate the independent prognostic ability of C-reactive protein in the context of published prognostic nomograms, risk grouping and disease state models in men receiving docetaxel-based chemotherapy for mCRPC.PATIENTS AND METHODS: * A large randomized phase II trial (CS-205) of mCRPC patients who received docetaxel-prednisone + AT-101 (Bcl-2 inhibitor) or docetaxel-prednisone + placebo was analyzed retrospectively (n= 220).* Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and measures of discriminatory ability were assessed in a hypothesis-generating analysis using Cox regression and concordance probabilities.* Patients from both treatment groups were combined for this analysis because no significant differences in outcomes were observed.* Because some factors used in nomograms were not collected or defined differently, risk was estimated based on slightly modified versions of nomograms.RESULTS: * C-reactive protein was independently prognostic for OS and PFS (P </= 0.002) after adjusting for all modeled risk estimates and classifiers.* C-reactive protein showed a concordance probability of 0.65 for both OS and PFS.* A 10-factor modified prognostic model based on the TAX327 trial had the greatest observed discrimination ability for OS and PFS (concordance probability = 0.623 and 0.603, respectively) among the modified nomograms or classifiers.* Adding the TAX327 model risk estimates to C-reactive protein did not substantially increase discrimination ability over C-reactive protein alone.CONCLUSIONS: * Current prognostic classifications provide modest discrimination of outcomes in mCRPC receiving docetaxel-based chemotherapy, highlighting the need for improved risk-based models.* Baseline C-reactive protein appears to be an useful, independent prognostic factor and prospective external validation is warranted.",0,0,0,0
24076063,"Neoadjuvant treatment of endometrial cancer using anastrozole: a randomised pilot study.OBJECTIVE: Excessive oestrogenic stimulation is a well-known risk factor for the development and progression of endometrial cancer.Aromatase is the key enzyme which catalyses the conversion of androgens to oestrogens in postmenopausal women.Inhibition of aromatase may therefore be a useful strategy in the management of endometrial cancer.A pilot study was designed to assess the feasibility of a neoadjuvant model and understand the biological effects of anastrozole, an aromatase inhibitor, in the treatment of endometrial cancer.METHODS: Patients with endometrial cancer who consented to participate in the study were randomised to receive anastrozole or placebo for a minimum of 14 days prior to definitive surgery.Endometrial samples were obtained before and after treatment.Immunohistochemistry was performed to ascertain the expression of oestrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha), progesterone receptor (PR), androgen receptor (AR), ki-67 and Bcl2 before and after treatment in glands and stroma of the endometrium.RESULTS: A total of 16 patients were randomised to the anastrozole arm and 8 to the placebo arm (2:1 randomisation).A significant decrease in the glandular expression of ERalpha and AR was observed in the anastrozole arm.There was no significant change in the expression of PR or Bcl2.Expression of ki-67, a proliferation marker, also decreased significantly following treatment with anastrozole.CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with anastrozole caused a significant decrease in proliferation as demonstrated by decreased ki-67 expression.A large randomised controlled trial is warranted to fully assess the role of anastrozole in the neoadjuvant treatment of endometrial cancer.",1,1,1,1

25014687,"Lanreotide in metastatic enteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.BACKGROUND: Somatostatin analogues are commonly used to treat symptoms associated with hormone hypersecretion in neuroendocrine tumors; however, data on their antitumor effects are limited.METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational study of the somatostatin analogue lanreotide in patients with advanced, well-differentiated or moderately differentiated, nonfunctioning, somatostatin receptor-positive neuroendocrine tumors of grade 1 or 2 (a tumor proliferation index [on staining for the Ki-67 antigen] of <10%) and documented disease-progression status.The tumors originated in the pancreas, midgut, or hindgut or were of unknown origin.Patients were randomly assigned to receive an extended-release aqueous-gel formulation of lanreotide (Autogel [known in the United States as Depot], Ipsen) at a dose of 120 mg (101 patients) or placebo (103 patients) once every 28 days for 96 weeks.The primary end point was progression-free survival, defined as the time to disease progression (according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.0) or death.Secondary end points included overall survival, quality of life (assessed with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer questionnaires QLQ-C30 and QLQ-GI.NET21), and safety.RESULTS: Most patients (96%) had no tumor progression in the 3 to 6 months before randomization, and 33% had hepatic tumor volumes greater than 25%.Lanreotide, as compared with placebo, was associated with significantly prolonged progression-free survival (median not reached vs. median of 18.0 months, P<0.001 by the stratified log-rank test; hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.47; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.30 to 0.73).The estimated rates of progression-free survival at 24 months were 65.1% (95% CI, 54.0 to 74.1) in the lanreotide group and 33.0% (95% CI, 23.0 to 43.3) in the placebo group.The therapeutic effect in predefined subgroups was generally consistent with that in the overall population, with the exception of small subgroups in which confidence intervals were wide.There were no significant between-group differences in quality of life or overall survival.The most common treatment-related adverse event was diarrhea (in 26% of the patients in the lanreotide group and 9% of those in the placebo group).CONCLUSIONS: Lanreotide was associated with significantly prolonged progression-free survival among patients with metastatic enteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors of grade 1 or 2 (Ki-67 <10%).(Funded by Ipsen; CLARINET ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00353496; EudraCT 2005-004904-35.).",0,0,0,0
22971492,"Clinical evaluation of extraperitoneal colostomy without damaging the muscle layer of the abdominal wall.OBJECTIVE: This study investigated whether extraperitoneal colostomy without damaging the muscle layer of the abdominal wall is an improved surgical procedure compared with conventional sigmoid colostomy in patients undergoing abdominoperineal resection.METHODS: Patients with rectal cancer undergoing abdominoperineal resection were selected and randomly divided into two groups: the study group received extraperitoneal colostomy without damaging the muscle layer of the abdominal wall and the control group received conventional colostomy.Clinical data from both groups were analysed.RESULTS: A total of 128 patients were included: 66 received extraperitoneal colostomy without damaging the muscle layer of the abdominal wall and 62 received conventional colostomy.Significant differences between the two groups were found in relation to colostomy operating time, defaecation sensation, bowel control and overall stoma-related complications.Duration of postoperative hospital stay was also significantly different between the study groups.CONCLUSIONS: Extraperitoneal colostomy without damaging the muscle layer of the abdominal wall was found to be an improved procedure compared with conventional sigmoid colostomy in abdominoperineal resection, and may reduce colostomy-related complications, shorten operating time and postoperative hospital stay, and potentially improve patients' quality of life.",0,0,0,0
24903230,"Effect of inspiration on airway dimensions measured in maximal inspiration CT images of subjects without airflow limitation.OBJECTIVES: To study the effect of inspiration on airway dimensions measured in voluntary inspiration breath-hold examinations.METHODS: 961 subjects with normal spirometry were selected from the Danish Lung Cancer Screening Trial.Subjects were examined annually for five years with low-dose CT.Automated software was utilized to segment lungs and airways, identify segmental bronchi, and match airway branches in all images of the same subject.Inspiration level was defined as segmented total lung volume (TLV) divided by predicted total lung capacity (pTLC).Mixed-effects models were used to predict relative change in lumen diameter (ALD) and wall thickness (AWT) in airways of generation 0 (trachea) to 7 and segmental bronchi (R1-R10 and L1-L10) from relative changes in inspiration level.RESULTS: Relative changes in ALD were related to relative changes in TLV/pTLC, and this distensibility increased with generation (p < 0.001).Relative changes in AWT were inversely related to relative changes in TLV/pTLC in generation 3--7 (p < 0.001).Segmental bronchi were widely dispersed in terms of ALD (5.7 +/- 0.7 mm), AWT (0.86 +/- 0.07 mm), and distensibility (23.5 +/- 7.7%).CONCLUSIONS: Subjects who inspire more deeply prior to imaging have larger ALD and smaller AWT.This effect is more pronounced in higher-generation airways.Therefore, adjustment of inspiration level is necessary to accurately assess airway dimensions.KEY POINTS: Airway lumen diameter increases and wall thickness decreases with inspiration.The effect of inspiration is greater in higher-generation (more peripheral) airways.Airways of generation 5 and beyond are as distensible as lung parenchyma.Airway dimensions measured from CT should be adjusted for inspiration level.",0,0,0,0

22453059,"Effects of vitamin D on cardiovascular disease risk factors in polycystic ovary syndrome women with vitamin D deficiency.BACKGROUND: Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent among women, including patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).Some studies have suggested that vitamin D may have a role in cardiovascular disease (CVD).There is very limited data on the vitamin D effect on CVD risk factors in women with PCOS and vitamin D deficiency.AIM: To investigate the effect of cholecalciferol on CVD risk factors in PCOS women with vitamin D deficiency.METHODS: The study was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double blinded trial.Fifty PCOS women with vitamin D deficiency (vitamin D, no. = 24; placebo, no. = 26) aged 20-40 yr, were randomly assigned to receive 3 oral capsules of 50,000 IU vitamin D3 or a placebo (one capsule every 20 days) for two months.Serum vitamin D, PTH, lipid profile, apolipoprotein AI (APO-AI), and high sensitive C- reactive protein (hs-CRP) were measured at baseline and after treatment.RESULTS: Vitamin D3 therapy in PCOS patients, increased serum vitamin D (7.00 +/- 2.80 to 22.9 +/- 6.14 ng/ml), decreased serum total cholesterol (196.6 +/- 32.8 to 179.1 +/- 34.1 mg/dl), triglyceride (156.8 +/- 73.0 to 130.5 +/- 56.5 mg/dl), and VLDL (31.4 +/- 14.6 to 26.1 +/- 11.3 mg/dl) levels significantly (p < 0.05), but it did not affect serum HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, APO-AI, and hs-CRP concentrations.There was no change in variables in the placebo group.CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that vitamin D3 therapy had beneficial effects on some CVD risk factors in PCOS patients with vitamin D deficiency.The trial was registered at IRCT.ir (IRCT138904113140N2).",1,0,0,0
24231627,"Docetaxel or pemetrexed with or without cetuximab in recurrent or progressive non-small-cell lung cancer after platinum-based therapy: a phase 3, open-label, randomised trial.BACKGROUND: Available preclinical and phase 2 clinical data suggest that the addition of cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody directed against the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), to chemotherapy might improve outcome in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).We aimed to assess whether the addition of cetuximab to chemotherapy improved progression-free survival in patients with recurrent or progressive NSCLC after platinum-based therapy.METHODS: In this unmasked, open-label randomised phase 3 trial we enrolled patients with metastatic, unresectable, or locally advanced NSCLC from 121 sites in Canada and the USA.Eligible patients were those aged 18 years or older who had experienced progressive disease during or after one previous platinum-based regimen.Initially, patients were randomly assigned to receive either pemetrexed (500 mg/m(2)) or docetaxel (75 mg/m(2)) and then randomly assigned within each group to receive their chemotherapy with or without cetuximab (400 mg/m(2) at first dose and 250 mg/m(2) weekly thereafter) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.However, after a change in the standard of care, investigators chose whether to treat with pemetrexed or docetaxel on a patient-by-patient basis.The primary analysis was changed to compare progression-free survival with cetuximab plus pemetrexed versus pemetrexed, on an intention-to-treat basis.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00095199.FINDINGS: Between Jan 10, 2005, and Feb 10, 2010, we enrolled 939 patients; data for one patient was accidentally discarded.Of the remaining 938 patients, 605 received pemetrexed (301 patients with cetuximab and 304 alone) and 333 received docetaxel (167 in combination with cetuximab and 166 alone).Median progression-free survival with cetuximab plus pemetrexed was 2.9 months (95% CI 2.7-3.2) versus 2.8 months (2.5-3.3) with pemetrexed (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.87-1.21; p=0.76).The most common grade 3-4 adverse events with cetuximab plus pemetrexed were fatigue (33 [11%] of 292 patients), acneiform rash (31 [11%]), dyspnoea (29 [10%]), and decreased neutrophil count (28 [10%]), and with pemetrexed alone were dyspnoea (35 [12%] of 289 patients), decreased neutrophil count (26 [9%]), and fatigue (23 [8%]).A significantly higher proportion of patients in the cetuximab plus pemetrexed group (119 [41%] of 292 patients) experienced at least one serious adverse event than those patients in the pemetrexed group (85 [29%] of 289 patients; p=0.0054).Nine (3%) of 292 treated patients in the cetuximab and pemetrexed group died of adverse events compared with five (2%) of 289 treated patients in the pemetrexed alone group.INTERPRETATION: The use of cetuximab is not recommended in combination with chemotherapy in patients previously treated with platinum-based therapy.FUNDING: Eli Lilly and Company and ImClone Systems LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Eli Lilly and Company.",0,0,0,0
25403578,"FOLFOX4 versus sequential dose-dense FOLFOX7 followed by FOLFIRI in patients with resectable metastatic colorectal cancer (MIROX): a pragmatic approach to chemotherapy timing with perioperative or postoperative chemotherapy from an open-label, randomized phase III trial.BACKGROUND: Perioperative FOLFOX4 (oxaliplatin plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin) chemotherapy is the current standard in patients with resectable metastases from colorectal cancer (CRC).We aimed to determine whether a sequential chemotherapy with dose-dense oxaliplatin (FOLFOX7) and irinotecan (FOLFIRI; irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin) is superior to FOLFOX4.The chemotherapy timing was not imposed, and was perioperative or postoperative.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this open-label, phase III trial, patients with resectable or resected metastases were randomly assigned either to 12 cycles of FOLFOX4 (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m(2)) or 6 cycles of FOLFOX7 (oxaliplatin 130 mg/m(2)) followed by 6 cycles of FOLFIRI (irinotecan 180 mg/m(2)).Randomization was done centrally, with stratification by chemotherapy timing, type of local treatment (surgery versus radiofrequency ablation with/without surgery), and Fong's prognostic score.The primary end point was 2-year disease-free survival (DFS).RESULTS: A total of 284 patients were randomized, 142 in each treatment group.Chemotherapy was perioperative in 168 (59.2%) patients and postoperative in 116 (40.8%) patients.Perioperative chemotherapy was preferentially proposed for synchronous metastases, whereas postoperative chemotherapy was more frequently used for metachronous metastases.Two-year DFS was 48.5% in the FOLFOX4 group and 50.0% in the FOLFOX7-FOLFIRI group.In the multivariable analysis, more than one metastasis [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.15] and synchronous metastases (HR = 1.63) were independent prognostic factors for shorter DFS.Five-year overall survival (OS) rate was 69.5% with FOLFOX4 versus 66.6% with FOLFOX7-FOLFIRI.CONCLUSIONS: FOLFOX7-FOLFIRI is not superior to FOLFOX4 in patients with resectable metastatic CRC.Five-year OS rates observed in both groups are the highest ever reported in this setting, possibly reflecting the pragmatic approach to chemotherapy timing.CLINICAL TRIALS NUMBER: NCT00268398.",1,1,1,1
22357257,"A randomised trial of primary tamoxifen versus mastectomy plus adjuvant tamoxifen in fit elderly women with invasive breast carcinoma of high oestrogen receptor content: long-term results at 20 years of follow-up.BACKGROUND: Long-term analysis of a randomised trial in Nottingham comparing tamoxifen versus surgery as initial treatment demonstrated that in oestrogen receptor (ER)-unselected cases, surgery achieved better local control, with no difference in overall survival.It was suggested that for patients with ER-rich tumours, local control and survival may be comparable.We now present long-term follow-up of a randomised trial designed to address this clinical scenario.PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and fifty three fit elderly (>/=70 years) women with clinically node-negative primary invasive breast carcinoma <5 cm of high ER content [histochemical (H) score >/=100] were randomised 2:1 to primary tamoxifen (Tam) (N = 100) or mastectomy with adjuvant tamoxifen (Mx + Tam) (N = 53).RESULTS: With median follow-up of 78 months, there was no statistically significant difference in 10-year rates of regional recurrence (9.0% versus 7.5%), metastasis (8.0% versus 13.2%), breast cancer-specific survival (89.0% versus 86.8%) or overall survival (64.0% versus 66.0%) between Tam and Mx + Tam; however, local control was inferior with Tam (local failure rates 43.0% versus 1.9%; P < 0.001).CONCLUSION: Irrespective of the degree of ER positivity, surgery achieved better local control.However, there was excellent and similar survival in both groups.Tam could be considered in those who are 'frail', refuse or prefer not to initially undergo surgery.",1,1,1,1

24996197,"Brivanib as adjuvant therapy to transarterial chemoembolization in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma: A randomized phase III trial.UNLABELLED: Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the current standard of treatment for unresectable intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Brivanib, a selective dual inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor and fibroblast growth factor signaling, may improve the effectiveness of TACE when given as an adjuvant to TACE.In this multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III study, 870 patients with TACE-eligible HCC were planned to be randomly assigned (1:1) after the first TACE to receive either brivanib 800 mg or placebo orally once-daily.The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS).Secondary endpoints included time to disease progression (TTDP; a composite endpoint based on development of extrahepatic spread or vascular invasion, deterioration of liver function or performance status, or death), time to extrahepatic spread or vascular invasion (TTES/VI), rate of TACE, and safety.Time to radiographic progression (TTP) and objective response rate were exploratory endpoints.The trial was terminated after randomization of 502 patients (brivanib, 249; placebo, 253) when two other phase III studies of brivanib in advanced HCC patients failed to meet OS objectives.At termination, median follow-up was approximately 16 months.Intention-to-treat analysis showed no improvement in OS with brivanib versus placebo (median, 26.4 [95% confidence interval {CI}: 19.1 to not reached] vs. 26.1 months [19.0-30.9]; hazard ratio [HR]: 0.90 [95% CI: 0.66-1.23]; log-rank P=0.5280).Brivanib improved TTES/VI (HR, 0.64 [95% CI: 0.45-0.90]), TTP (0.61 [0.48-0.77]), and rate of TACE (0.72 [0.61-0.86]), but not TTDP (0.94 [0.72-1.22]) versus placebo.Most frequent grade 3-4 adverse events included hyponatremia (brivanib, 18% vs. placebo, 5%) and hypertension (13% vs. 3%).CONCLUSIONS: In this study, brivanib as adjuvant therapy to TACE did not improve OS.",0,0,0,0
24475840,"Recurrent glioblastoma treated with bevacizumab: contrast-enhanced T1-weighted subtraction maps improve tumor delineation and aid prediction of survival in a multicenter clinical trial.PURPOSE: To compare the capability to aid prediction of clinical outcome measures, including progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), between volumetric estimates from contrast material-enhanced (CE) T1-weighted subtraction maps and traditional segmentation in a randomized multicenter clinical trial of recurrent glioblastoma (GBM) patients treated with bevacizumab.MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients participating in this study signed institutional review board-approved informed consent at their respective institutions prior to enrolling in the multicenter clinical trial.One-hundred sixty patients with recurrent GBM enrolled as part of a HIPAA-compliant, multicenter clinical trial (AVF3708 g, BRAIN trial).Contrast-enhancing tumor volumes and change in volumes as a response to therapy were quantified by using either conventional segmentation or CE T1-weighted subtraction maps created by voxel-by-voxel subtraction of intensity-normalized nonenhanced T1-weighted images from CE T1-weighted images.These volumes were then tested as predictors of PFS and OS by using log-rank univariate analysis, the multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model, and receiver operating characteristic analysis.RESULTS: Use of CE T1-weighted subtraction maps qualitatively improved visualization and improved quantification of tumor volume after bevacizumab treatment.Significant trends between the volume of tumor and change in tumor volume after therapy on CE T1-weighted subtraction maps were found for both PFS and OS (pretreatment volume < 15 cm(3), P < .003; posttreatment volume < 7.5 cm(3), P < .05; percentage change in volume > 25%, P = .004 for PFS and P = .053 for OS).CE T1-weighted subtraction maps were significantly better at aiding prediction of 6-month PFS and 12-month OS compared with conventional segmentation by using receiver operating characteristic analysis (P < .05).CONCLUSION: Use of CE T1-weighted subtraction maps improved visualization and aided better prediction of patient survival in recurrent GBM treated with bevacizumab compared with conventional segmentation of CE T1-weighted images.Clinical trial registration no.

25057173,"EGFR biomarkers predict benefit from vandetanib in combination with docetaxel in a randomized phase III study of second-line treatment of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.BACKGROUND: ZODIAC was a randomized phase III study of second-line treatment in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that evaluated the addition of vandetanib to docetaxel.The study showed a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival and objective response rate, but not in overall survival for unselected patients.This study evaluated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutation, copy number gain, and protein expression, and KRAS gene mutation, in pretreatment tumor samples as potential biomarkers predicting benefit from vandetanib as second-line treatment of NSCLC.PATIENTS AND METHODS: After progression following first-line chemotherapy, 1391 patients with locally advanced or metastatic (stage IIIB/IV) NSCLC were randomized 1 : 1 to receive vandetanib (100 mg/day) plus docetaxel (75 mg/m(2) every 21 days) or placebo plus docetaxel in the ZODIAC study.Archival tumor samples (n = 570) were collected from consenting patients (n = 958) for predefined, prospective biomarker analyses.RESULTS: Of evaluable samples, 14% were EGFR mutation positive, 35% were EGFR FISH positive, 88% were EGFR protein expression positive, and 13% were KRAS mutation positive.Compared with the overall study population, in which progression-free survival (PFS) [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.79] but not OS (HR = 0.91) were significantly improved with vandetanib, there was greater relative clinical benefit for patients with EGFR mutation-positive tumors [PFS HR 0.51, confidence interval (CI) 0.25-1.06 and OS HR 0.46, CI 0.14-1.57] and EGFR FISH-positive tumors (PFS HR 0.61, CI 0.39-0.94 and OS HR 0.48, CI 0.28-0.84).Similarly, patients with EGFR mutation or FISH-positive tumor samples who received vandetanib had an increased chance of objective tumor response (odds ratios 3.34, CI 0.8-13.89, and 3.90, CI 1.02-14.82, respectively).There did not appear to be benefit for vandetanib in patients with KRAS mutation-positive tumors.CONCLUSIONS: High EGFR gene copy number or activating EGFR mutations may identify patient subgroups who receive increased clinical benefit from vandetanib in combination with docetaxel in second-line NSCLC.CLINICALTRIALSGOV: NCT00312377.",1,1,1,1
24435414,"Long term duration of protective effect for HPV negative women: follow-up of primary HPV screening randomised controlled trial.OBJECTIVES: To assess whether the increased sensitivity of screening for human papillomavirus (HPV) may represent overdiagnosis and to compare the long term duration of protective effect against cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CIN2+) in HPV based and cytology based screening.DESIGN: 13 year follow-up of the Swedescreen randomised controlled trial of primary HPV screening.SETTING: Organised cervical screening programme in Sweden.PARTICIPANTS: 12,527 women aged 32-38 attending organised screening were enrolled and randomised to HPV and cytology double testing (intervention arm, n=6257) or to cytology only, with samples frozen for future HPV testing (control arm, n=6270).MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cumulative incidence of CIN2+ and CIN3+ (Kaplan Meier curves).Longitudinal test characteristics were calculated for cytology only, HPV testing only, and cytology and HPV testing combined, adjusting for censoring.RESULTS: The increased detection of CIN2+ in the intervention arm decreased over time.After six years, the cumulative incidence of CIN3+ was similar in both trial arms, and after 11 years the cumulative incidence of CIN2+ became similar in both arms.The longitudinal sensitivity of cytology for CIN2+ in the control arm at three years was similar to the sensitivity of HPV testing in the intervention arm at five years of follow-up: 85.94% (95% confidence interval 76.85% to 91.84%) v 86.40% (79.21% to 91.37%).The sensitivity of HPV screening for CIN3+after five years was 89.34% (80.10% to 94.58%) and for cytology after three years was 92.02% (80.59% to 96.97%).CONCLUSIONS: Over long term follow-up, the cumulative incidence of CIN2+ was the same for HPV screening and for cytology, implying that the increased sensitivity of HPV screening for CIN2+ reflects earlier detection rather than overdiagnosis.The low long term risks of CIN3+ among women who tested negative in HPV screening, support screening intervals of five years for such women.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00479375.",0,0,0,0
22146893,"An immune-active tumor microenvironment favors clinical response to ipilimumab.PURPOSE: Ipilimumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody specific to CTLA-4, has been shown to improve overall survival in metastatic melanoma patients.As a consequence of CTLA-4 blockade, ipilimumab treatment is associated with proliferation and activation of peripheral T cells.To better understand various tumor-associated components that may influence the clinical outcome of ipilimumab treatment, gene expression profiles of tumors from patients treated with ipilimumab were characterized.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Gene expression profiling was performed on tumor biopsies collected from 45 melanoma patients before and 3 weeks after the start of treatment in a phase II clinical trial.RESULTS: Analysis of pre-treatment tumors indicated that patients with high baseline expression levels of immune-related genes were more likely to respond favorably to ipilimumab.Furthermore, ipilimumab appeared to induce two major changes in tumors from patients who exhibited clinical activity: genes involved in immune response showed increased expression, whereas expression of genes for melanoma-specific antigens and genes involved in cell proliferation decreased.These changes were associated with the total lymphocyte infiltrate in tumors, and there was a suggestion of association with prolonged overall survival in these patients.Many IFN-gamma-inducible genes and Th1-associated markers showed increased expression after ipilimumab treatment, suggesting an accumulation of this particular type of T cell at the tumor sites, which might play an important role in mediating the antitumor activity of ipilimumab.CONCLUSIONS: These results support the proposed mechanism of action of ipilimumab, suggesting that cell-mediated immune responses play an important role in the antitumor activity of ipilimumab.",0,0,0,0

25525672,"Comparing effects in regular practice of e-communication and Web-based self-management support among breast cancer patients: preliminary results from a randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: While Web-based interventions have been shown to assist a wide range of patients successfully in managing their illness, few studies have examined the relative contribution of different Web-based components to improve outcomes.Further efficacy trials are needed to test the effects of Web support when offered as a part of routine care.OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to compare in regular care the effects of (1) an Internet-based patient provider communication service (IPPC), (2) WebChoice, a Web-based illness management system for breast cancer patients (IPPC included), and (3) usual care on symptom distress, anxiety, depression, (primary outcomes), and self-efficacy (secondary outcome).This study reports preliminary findings from 6 months' follow-up data in a 12-month trial.METHODS: We recruited 167 patients recently diagnosed with breast cancer and undergoing treatment from three Norwegian hospitals.The nurse-administered IPPC allowed patients to send secure e-messages to and receive e-messages from health care personnel at the hospital where they were treated.In addition to the IPPC, WebChoice contains components for symptom monitoring, tailored information and self-management support, a diary, and communication with other patients.A total of 20 care providers (11 nurses, 6 physicians, and 3 social workers) were trained to answer questions from patients.Outcomes were measured with questionnaires at study entry and at study months 2, 4, and 6.Linear mixed models for repeated measures were fitted to compare effects on outcomes over time.RESULTS: Patients were randomly assigned to the WebChoice group (n=64), the IPPC group (n=45), or the usual care group (n=58).Response rates to questionnaires were 73.7% (123/167) at 2 months, 65.9 (110/167) at 4 months, and 62.3% (104/167) at 6 months.Attrition was similar in all study groups.Among those with access to WebChoice, 64% (41/64) logged on more than once and 39% (25/64) sent e-messages to care providers.In the IPPC group, 40% (18/45) sent e-messages.Linear mixed models analyses revealed that the WebChoice group reported significantly lower symptom distress (mean difference 0.16, 95% CI 0.06-0.25, P=.001), anxiety (mean difference 0.79, 95% CI 0.09-1.49, P=.03), and depression (mean difference 0.79, 95% CI 0.09-1.49, P=.03) compared with the usual care group.The IPPC group reported significant lower depression scores compared with the usual care group (mean difference 0.69, 95% CI 0.05-1.32, P=.03), but no differences were observed for symptom distress or anxiety.No significant differences in self-efficacy were found among the study groups.CONCLUSIONS: In spite of practice variations and moderate use of the interventions, our results suggest that offering Web support as part of regular care can be a powerful tool to help patients manage their illness.Our finding that a nurse-administered IPPC alone can significantly reduce depression is particularly promising.However, the multicomponent intervention WebChoice had additional positive effects.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov:NCT00971009; http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00971009 (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/6USKezP0Y).",0,0,0,0

22715124,"Effects of self-directed stress management training and home-based exercise on quality of life in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy: a randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Research has shown that self-directed stress management training improves mental well-being in patients undergoing chemotherapy.The present study extends this work by evaluating separate and combined effects of stress management training and home-based exercise.METHOD: Following assessment of mental and physical well-being, depression, anxiety, exercise, and stress reduction activity before chemotherapy started, patients were randomized to stress management training (SM), exercise (EX), combined stress management and exercise (SMEX), or usual care only (UCO).Outcomes were reassessed 6 and 12 weeks after chemotherapy started.Significance testing of group-by-time interactions in 286 patients who completed all assessments was used to evaluate intervention efficacy.RESULTS: Interaction effects for mental and physical well-being scores were not significant.Depression scores yielded a linear interaction comparing UCO and SMEX (p = 0.019), with decreases in SMEX but not UCO.Anxiety scores yielded a quadratic interaction comparing UCO and SMEX (p = 0.049), with trends for changes in SMEX but not UCO.Additional analyses yielded quadratic interactions for exercise activity comparing UCO and SMEX (p = 0.022), with positive changes in SMEX but not UCO, and for stress management activity comparing UCO and SM (p < 0.001) and UCO and SMEX (p = 0.013), with positive changes in SM and SMEX but not UCO.CONCLUSION: Only the combined intervention yielded effects on quality of life outcomes, and these were limited to anxiety and depression.These findings are consistent with evidence that only the combined intervention yielded increases in both exercise and stress management activity.Future research should investigate ways to augment this intervention to enhance its benefits.",0,0,0,0

22840231,"Influence of perioperative oxygen fraction on pulmonary function after abdominal surgery: a randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: A high perioperative inspiratory oxygen fraction (FiO2) may reduce the frequency of surgical site infection.Perioperative atelectasis is caused by absorption, compression and reduced function of surfactant.It is well accepted, that ventilation with 100% oxygen for only a few minutes is associated with significant formation of atelectasis.However, it is still not clear if a longer period of 80% oxygen results in more atelectasis compared to a low FiO2.Our aim was to assess if a high FiO2 is associated with impaired oxygenation and decreased pulmonary functional residual capacity (FRC).METHODS: Thirty-five patients scheduled for laparotomy for ovarian cancer were randomized to receive either 30% oxygen (n = 15) or 80% oxygen (n = 20) during and for 2 h after surgery.The oxygenation index (PaO2/FiO2) was measured every 30 min during anesthesia and 90 min after extubation.FRC was measured the day before surgery and 2 h after extubation by a rebreathing method using the inert gas SF6.RESULTS: Five min after intubation, the median PaO2/FiO2 was 69 kPa [53-71] in the 30%-group vs. 60 kPa [47-69] in the 80%-group (P = 0.25).At the end of anesthesia, the PaO2/FiO2 was 58 kPa [40-70] vs. 57 kPa [46-67] in the 30%- and 80%-group, respectively (P = 0.10).The median FRC was 1993 mL [1610-2240] vs. 1875 mL [1545-2048] at baseline and 1615 mL [1375-2318] vs. 1633 mL [1343-1948] postoperatively in the 30%- and 80%-group, respectively (P = 0.70).CONCLUSION: We found no significant difference in oxygenation index or functional residual capacity between patients given 80% and 30% oxygen for a period of approximately 5 hours.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00637936.",0,0,0,0

24923533,"Impact of comprehensive geriatric assessment on survival, function, and nutritional status in elderly patients with head and neck cancer: protocol for a multicentre randomised controlled trial (EGeSOR).BACKGROUND: Survival is poorer in elderly patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinomas [HNSCCs] than in younger patients.Possible explanations include a contribution of co-morbidities to mortality, frequent refusal of standard therapy, and the use of suboptimal treatments due to concern about toxicities.The Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment [CGA] is a multidimensional assessment of general health that can help to customise treatment and follow-up plans.The CGA has been proven effective in several health settings but has not been evaluated in randomised studies of patients with cancer.Our aim here was to assess the impact of the CGA on overall survival, function, and nutritional status of elderly patients with HNSCC.METHODS/DESIGN: EGeSOR is an open-label, multicentre, randomised, controlled, parallel-group trial in patients aged 70 years or older and receiving standard care for HNSCC.The intervention includes four components: the CGA conducted by a geriatrician before cancer treatment, participation of the same geriatrician in cancer treatment selection, a standardised geriatric therapeutic intervention designed by the same geriatrician; and geriatric follow-up for 24 months.The primary endpoint, assessed after 6 months, is a composite criterion including death, functional impairment [Activities of Daily Living score decrease >/= 2], and weight loss >/= 10%.Secondary endpoints include progression-free survival, unscheduled admissions, quality of life, treatment toxicities, costs, and completion of the planned cancer treatment.A centralised online system is used to perform 1:1 randomisation with a minimisation algorithm for centre, age, T and N stages, and tumour site [oral, oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal, or laryngeal].The estimated sample size is 704 patients, who are being recruited by 14 centres in 9 French cities.DISCUSSION: EGeSOR is the first randomised trial of the CGA in elderly cancer patients.We expect the CGA to have direct clinical benefits on the management of elderly patients with HNSCC.If this expectation is fulfilled, the trial may lead to modifications of the management model for elderly patients with cancer.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Trial registration: NCT02025062.",0,0,0,0
23632052,"Guided paravertebral blocks with versus without clonidine for women undergoing breast surgery: a prospective double-blinded randomized study.BACKGROUND: Paravertebral blocks (PVBs) have been introduced as an alternative to general anesthesia for breast cancer surgeries.The addition of clonidine as an adjuvant in PVBs may enhance quality and duration of analgesia and significantly reduce the consumption of analgesics after breast surgery.In this prospective randomized double-blind study, we assessed the significance of adding clonidine to the anesthetic mixture for women undergoing mastectomy.METHODS: Sixty patients were randomized equally into 2 groups, both of which received PVB block, either with or without clonidine.Analgesic consumption was noted up to 2 weeks after the operation.A visual analog scale was used to assess pain postoperatively during the hospital stay, and a numeric rating scale was used when patients were discharged.RESULTS: Analgesic consumption was significantly lower in the clonidine group 48 hours postoperatively with 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference (-69.5% to -6.6%).Pain scores at rest showed significant reduction in the clonidine group during the period from 24 to 72 hours postoperatively with 95% CI for the ratios of 2 means (1.09-3.61), (2.04-9.04), and (2.54-16.55), respectively, with shoulder movement at 24, 48, and 72 hours postoperatively 95% CI for the ratio of 2 means (1.10-3.15), (1.32-6.38), and (1.33-8.42), respectively.The time needed to resume daily activity was shorter in the clonidine group compared with the control group with 95% CI for the ratio of 2 means (1.14-1.62).CONCLUSION: The addition of clonidine enhanced the analgesic efficacy of PVB up to 3 days postoperatively for patients undergoing breast surgery.",1,1,0,0

Patients received paclitaxel (200 mg/m2, day 1) plus carboplatin (AUC 6 mg/mL/min, day 1) every 3 weeks in arm A, or gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2, days 1 and 8) plus carboplatin (AUC 5 mg/mL/min, day1) every 3 weeks in arm B. Non-progressive patients following 3 cycles of induction chemotherapy received maintenance gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2, days 1 and 8) every 3 weeks.( TRIAL REGISTRATION: UMIN000008252)RESULTS: The study was stopped because of delayed accrual at interim analysis.Of the randomly assigned 50 patients, 49 except for one in arm B were evaluable.Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 4.6 months for arm A vs. 3.5 months for arm B (HR = 1.03; 95% CI, 0.45-2.27; p = 0.95) and median overall survival (OS) was 15.0 months for arm A vs. 14.8 months for arm B (HR = 0.79; 95% CI, 0.40-1.51; p = 0.60), showing no difference between the two arms.The response rate, disease control rate, and the transit rate to maintenance phase were 36.0% (9/25), 64.0% (16/25), and 48% (12/25) for arm A vs. 16.7% (4/24), 50.0% (12/24), and 33% (8/24) for arm B, which were also statistically similar between the two arms (p = 0.13, p = 0.32, and p = 0.30, respectively).Both induction regimens were tolerable, except that more patients experienced peripheral neuropathy in arm A.

22383680,"Influence of zoledronic acid on disseminated tumor cells in primary breast cancer patients.BACKGROUND: The presence of disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) in bone marrow of patients with early breast cancer (EBC) has been correlated with increased risk of metastatic disease or locoregional relapse.Zoledronic acid (ZOL) treatment has reduced DTCs in the bone marrow of patients with EBC in several studies.This controlled study sought to confirm these observations.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with EBC and DTC-positive bone marrow were randomized (N = 96) to treatment with ZOL plus adjuvant systemic therapy or adjuvant systemic therapy alone.The change in DTC numbers at 12 months versus baseline was measured.RESULTS: DTC-positive patients treated with ZOL were more likely to become DTC-negative after 12 months of treatment compared with the controls (67% versus 35%; P = 0.009).At 12 months, DTC counts decreased to a mean of 0.5 +/- 0.8 DTCs in the ZOL group and to 0.9 +/- 0.8 DTCs in the control group.In addition, ZOL was generally well tolerated.CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with ZOL improves elimination of DTCs.Further studies are needed to determine whether the reduction in DTCs by ZOL provides clinical benefit.",1,1,1,1
25403578,"FOLFOX4 versus sequential dose-dense FOLFOX7 followed by FOLFIRI in patients with resectable metastatic colorectal cancer (MIROX): a pragmatic approach to chemotherapy timing with perioperative or postoperative chemotherapy from an open-label, randomized phase III trial.BACKGROUND: Perioperative FOLFOX4 (oxaliplatin plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin) chemotherapy is the current standard in patients with resectable metastases from colorectal cancer (CRC).We aimed to determine whether a sequential chemotherapy with dose-dense oxaliplatin (FOLFOX7) and irinotecan (FOLFIRI; irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin) is superior to FOLFOX4.The chemotherapy timing was not imposed, and was perioperative or postoperative.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this open-label, phase III trial, patients with resectable or resected metastases were randomly assigned either to 12 cycles of FOLFOX4 (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m(2)) or 6 cycles of FOLFOX7 (oxaliplatin 130 mg/m(2)) followed by 6 cycles of FOLFIRI (irinotecan 180 mg/m(2)).Randomization was done centrally, with stratification by chemotherapy timing, type of local treatment (surgery versus radiofrequency ablation with/without surgery), and Fong's prognostic score.The primary end point was 2-year disease-free survival (DFS).RESULTS: A total of 284 patients were randomized, 142 in each treatment group.Chemotherapy was perioperative in 168 (59.2%) patients and postoperative in 116 (40.8%) patients.Perioperative chemotherapy was preferentially proposed for synchronous metastases, whereas postoperative chemotherapy was more frequently used for metachronous metastases.Two-year DFS was 48.5% in the FOLFOX4 group and 50.0% in the FOLFOX7-FOLFIRI group.In the multivariable analysis, more than one metastasis [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.15] and synchronous metastases (HR = 1.63) were independent prognostic factors for shorter DFS.Five-year overall survival (OS) rate was 69.5% with FOLFOX4 versus 66.6% with FOLFOX7-FOLFIRI.CONCLUSIONS: FOLFOX7-FOLFIRI is not superior to FOLFOX4 in patients with resectable metastatic CRC.Five-year OS rates observed in both groups are the highest ever reported in this setting, possibly reflecting the pragmatic approach to chemotherapy timing.CLINICAL TRIALS NUMBER: NCT00268398.",1,1,1,1
23957945,"Initial biopsy Gleason score as a predictive marker for survival benefit in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with docetaxel: data from the TAX327 study.BACKGROUND: Since 2004, docetaxel has been the standard first-line systemic therapy for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).With abiraterone recently becoming available in the predocetaxel setting, it is warranted to identify subgroups of patients who may obtain the greatest benefit from docetaxel and particularly qualify for receiving docetaxel as first-line treatment for mCRPC.OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify factors that could characterize subgroups of patients who obtain the greatest benefit from the use of docetaxel.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: TAX327 was multinational, randomized, phase 3 study that was conducted from 2000 to 2002 in 1006 men with mCRPC.INTERVENTION: Patients were randomized to receive docetaxel every 3 wk (D3), weekly docetaxel (D1), or mitoxantrone every 3 wk (M3), each with prednisone.OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: We investigated whether patients with poorly differentiated tumors (Gleason score >/=7) at diagnosis had greater benefit from D3 compared with M3 than patients with better differentiated tumors (Gleason score </=6).Using a Cox model, we compared overall survival (OS) between the treatment groups within each subgroup of Gleason score.RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: The TAX 327 data showed that the OS benefit of D3 versus M3 was greater in patients with high-grade tumors (median OS: 18.9 vs 14.5 mo; p=0.009) than in patients with low-grade tumors (median OS: 21.6 vs 20.7 mo; p=0.674).Limitations of a retrospective analysis apply.CONCLUSIONS: The survival benefit obtained with docetaxel is most pronounced in patients with high-Gleason-score tumors (Gleason >/=7).In a time of shifting paradigms in mCRPC, with abiraterone becoming available prior to docetaxel chemotherapy, Gleason score may help in selecting patients who obtain the greatest benefit from docetaxel as first-line treatment for mCRPC.Prospective validation of these findings is warranted.",1,1,1,1

23261355,"Risk of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia during follow-up in HPV-positive women according to baseline p16-INK4A results: a prospective analysis of a nested substudy of the NTCC randomised controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Immunostaining for p16-INK4A (henceforth p16) is a sensitive and specific method for detection of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) in women infected with human papillomavirus (HPV), but longitudinal data have not been obtained.We investigated the relation between p16 status and risk of CIN during 3 years of follow-up.METHODS: Women aged 25-60 years were enrolled between June 10, 2003, and Dec 31, 2004, in a multicentre randomised trial comparing HPV testing with cytology.HPV-positive women were referred for colposcopy and, in seven of nine centres, were tested for p16 overexpression by immunostaining.If no CIN was detected, these women were followed up at yearly intervals until clearance of HPV infection.The primary endpoint was histologically confirmed CIN of grade 2 or worse (CIN of grade 2 [CIN2], CIN of grade 3 [CIN3], or invasive cervical cancer) at recruitment or during follow-up.We calculated the absolute and relative risks by p16 status at recruitment.We also calculated the longitudinal sensitivity of p16 testing.Additionally, we assessed the relative sensitivity of an alternative strategy (referral to colposcopy and follow-up of only HPV-positive, p16-positive women) versus conventional cytology in two age groups.Percentages were weighted by the inverse of the tested fraction.The trial in which this study is nested is registered, number ISRCTN81678807.FINDINGS: Of 1042 HPV-positive women who were tested for p16 with no CIN detected during the first round of screening, 944 (91%) had further HPV tests.793 (84%) of these 944 were followed up until detection of CIN2 or worse, HPV infection clearance, or for at least 3 years.CIN2 or worse was detected during follow-up in more p16-positive women (31 of 365, 8.8% [95% CI 5.8-11.8]) than in p16-negative women (17 of 579, 3.7% [1.9-5.4]; relative risk [RR] 2.61 [95% CI 1.49-4.59]).RR was higher in women aged 35-60 years at recruitment (3.37 [1.39-8.15]) than in those aged 25-34 years (2.15 [1.00-4.61]), but age was not a significant modifier.CIN3 or worse was detected during follow-up in more p16-positive women (16 of 365, 4.4% [2.3-6.6]) than in p16-negative women (six of 579, 1.3% [0.2-2.3]; RR 3.90 [95% CI 1.57-9.68]).Longitudinal sensitivity of p16 testing for detection of CIN3 or worse during follow-up at all ages was 77.8% (95% CI 63.9-91.6).The relative sensitivity of the alternative strategy compared with conventional cytology was 2.08 (1.13-3.56) in women aged 35-60 years and 2.86 (1.28-5.36) in those aged 25-34 years.HPV-positive, p16-negative women aged 35-60 years had a higher cumulative risk of CIN3 or worse during recruitment or follow-up (2.0%, 95% CI 0.3-3.7) than did HPV-negative women (0.01%, 0-0.04) or those who were cytologically normal (0.04%, 0.02-0.09) at recruitment.INTERPRETATION: p16 overexpression is a marker for CIN2 or worse or for development of CIN2 or worse within 3 years in HPV-positive women, especially those aged 35-60 years.HPV-positive, p16-positive women need immediate colposcopy and, if the assessment is negative, annual follow-up.Immediate colposcopy can be avoided in HPV-positive, p16-negative women, who can be safely managed with repeat screening after 2-3 year intervals.FUNDING: European Union; Italian Ministry of Health; Regional Health Administrations of Piemonte, Tuscany, Veneto and Emilia Romagna; and Public Health Agency of Lazio Region.",0,0,0,0
24573743,"A phase II open-label randomized multicenter trial of TSU-68 in combination with S-1 and oxaliplatin versus S-1 in combination with oxaliplatin in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide.The combination of oxaliplatin-based treatments (oxaliplatin plus infusional 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin [FOLFOX] or oxaliplatin plus capecitabine [CapeOX]) and bevacizumab is a standard chemotherapy regimen for metastatic CRC (mCRC).However, several clinical studies that tested S-1 plus oxaliplatin (SOX) indicate that SOX is also a treatment option for mCRC.TSU-68 is an oral compound that inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptor and platelet-derived growth factor receptor.The recommended dose of TSU-68 + SOX was previously determined in a phase I study of mCRC patients.The goal of this trial was to evaluate the efficacy of TSU-68 in combination with SOX.METHODS: This open-label multicenter randomized phase II trial was performed in Korea.Treatment-naive mCRC patients with a performance status of 0 or 1 were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either TSU-68 + SOX or SOX alone.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS).RESULTS: A total of 105 patients (TSU-68 + SOX, 52 patients; SOX alone, 53 patients) were randomized.The median PFS was 7.0 months in the TSU-68 + SOX group (hazard ratio [HR], 1.057) and 7.2 months in the SOX group (p = 0.8401).The most frequent grade 3 and 4 adverse events were thrombocytopenia (9.6 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 26.4 % [SOX]), neutropenia (13.5 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 15.1 % [SOX]), and anemia (3.8 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 13.2 % [SOX]).We observed a difference between the 2 groups for all grades of anemia (15.4 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 32.1 % [SOX]), diarrhea (30.8 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 47.2 % [SOX]), vomiting (50.0 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 26.4 % [SOX]), and chromaturia (23.1 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 0.0 % [SOX]).Analysis using a Cox proportional hazard model showed that baseline interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels were associated with a survival benefit of TSU-68 (p = 0.012).CONCLUSION: TSU-68 + SOX had a favorable safety profile.However, TSU-68 did not have a synergistic effect on the efficacy of SOX.The baseline serum IL-6 level could be a prognostic factor for TSU-68 efficacy.",1,1,1,1

22674529,"A phase 3 study of induction treatment with concurrent chemoradiotherapy versus chemotherapy before surgery in patients with pathologically confirmed N2 stage IIIA nonsmall cell lung cancer (WJTOG9903).BACKGROUND: This study sought to ascertain whether induction-concurrent radiotherapy added to chemotherapy could improve the survival of patients undergoing surgery for stage IIIA N2 nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC).METHODS: Patients with pathologically proven N2 disease were randomized to receive either induction chemotherapy (docetaxel 60 mg/m(2) and carboplatin AUC [area under the receiver operating characteristic curve] = 5 for 2 cycles) plus concurrent radiation therapy (40 Gy) followed by surgery (CRS arm) or induction chemotherapy followed by surgery (CS arm).They subsequently underwent pulmonary resection when possible.RESULTS: Sixty patients were randomly assigned between December 2000 and August 2005.The study was prematurely terminated in January 2006 because of slow accrual.The most common toxicity was grade 3 or 4 leukopenia in 92.9% of patients in the CRS arm and 46.4% in the CS arm.Induction therapy was generally well tolerated, and there were no treatment-related deaths in either arm.Downstaging in the CS arm and CRS arm was 21% and 40%, respectively.The progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in the CS arm were 9.7 months and 29.9 months (PFS, hazard ratio [HR] = 0.68, P = .187), and those in the CRS arm were 12.4 months and 39.6 months (OS, HR = 0.77, P = .397), respectively.The PFS with and without downstaging was 55.0 and 9.4 months, respectively (HR = 3.39, P = .001).The OS with and without downstaging was 63.3 and 29.5 months, respectively (HR = 2.62, P = .021).CONCLUSIONS: The addition of radiotherapy to induction chemotherapy conferred better local control without significant adverse events.Tumor downstaging is important for prolonging the OS in patients with stage IIIA (N2) NSCLC.",1,1,1,1
22830463,"Sirolimus and secondary skin-cancer prevention in kidney transplantation.BACKGROUND: Transplant recipients in whom cutaneous squamous-cell carcinomas develop are at high risk for multiple subsequent skin cancers.Whether sirolimus is useful in the prevention of secondary skin cancer has not been assessed.METHODS: In this multicenter trial, we randomly assigned transplant recipients who were taking calcineurin inhibitors and had at least one cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma either to receive sirolimus as a substitute for calcineurin inhibitors (in 64 patients) or to maintain their initial treatment (in 56).The primary end point was survival free of squamous-cell carcinoma at 2 years.Secondary end points included the time until the onset of new squamous-cell carcinomas, occurrence of other skin tumors, graft function, and problems with sirolimus.RESULTS: Survival free of cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma was significantly longer in the sirolimus group than in the calcineurin-inhibitor group.Overall, new squamous-cell carcinomas developed in 14 patients (22%) in the sirolimus group (6 after withdrawal of sirolimus) and in 22 (39%) in the calcineurin-inhibitor group (median time until onset, 15 vs. 7 months; P=0.02), with a relative risk in the sirolimus group of 0.56 (95% confidence interval, 0.32 to 0.98).There were 60 serious adverse events in the sirolimus group, as compared with 14 such events in the calcineurin-inhibitor group (average, 0.938 vs. 0.250).There were twice as many serious adverse events in patients who had been converted to sirolimus with rapid protocols as in those with progressive protocols.In the sirolimus group, 23% of patients discontinued the drug because of adverse events.Graft function remained stable in the two study groups.CONCLUSIONS: Switching from calcineurin inhibitors to sirolimus had an antitumoral effect among kidney-transplant recipients with previous squamous-cell carcinoma.These observations may have implications concerning immunosuppressive treatment of patients with cutaneous squamous-cell carcinomas.(Funded by Hospices Civils de Lyon and others; TUMORAPA ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00133887.).",0,0,0,0
25287825,"Postinduction minimal residual disease monitoring by polymerase chain reaction in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.PURPOSE: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common pediatric cancer.Monitoring minimal residual disease (MRD) by using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) provides information for patient stratification and individual risk-directed treatment.Cooperative studies have documented that measurement of blast clearance from the bone marrow during and after induction therapy identifies patient populations with different risk of relapse.We explored the possible contribution of measurements of MRD during the course of treatment.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We used RQ-PCR to detect MRD in 110 unselected patients treated in Italy in the International Collaborative Treatment Protocol for Children and Adolescents With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (AIEOP-BFM ALL 2000).The trial took place in AIEOP centers during postinduction chemotherapy.Results were categorized as negative, low positive (below the quantitative range [< 5 x 10(-4)]), or high positive (>/= 5 x 10(-4)).Patients with at least one low-positive or high-positive result were assigned to the corresponding subgroup.RESULTS: Patients who tested high positive, low positive, or negative had significantly different cumulative incidences of leukemia relapse: 83.3%, 34.8%, and 8.6%, respectively (P < .001).Two thirds of positive cases were identified within 4 months after induction-consolidation therapy, suggesting that this time frame may be most suitable for cost-effective MRD monitoring, particularly in patients who did not clear their disease at the end of consolidation.CONCLUSION: These findings provide further insights into the dynamic of MRD and the ongoing effort to define molecular relapse in childhood ALL.",0,0,0,0
25678394,"Double-blinded, randomized phase II study using embolization with or without granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor in uveal melanoma with hepatic metastases.PURPOSE: To investigate the effects of immunoembolization with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in patients with uveal melanoma (UM) with liver-only metastasis.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this double-blind phase II clinical trial, patients were randomized to undergo immunoembolization or bland embolization (BE).Lobar treatment was performed with GM-CSF or normal saline solution mixed with ethiodized oil followed by embolization with gelatin sponge emulsified with iodinated contrast medium.Fifty-two patients (immunoembolization, n = 25; BE, n = 27) were enrolled.Response was assessed after every two treatments.The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR) of liver metastases.Progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and immunologic responses were secondary endpoints.RESULTS: There were five partial responses in the immunoembolization group (ORR, 21.2%; 90% confidence interval [CI], 10.3%-30.5%) and three in the BE group (ORR, 16.7%; 90% CI, 6.3%-26.9%).Stable disease was seen in 12 patients in the immunoembolization group and 19 in the BE group.OS times were 21.5 months (95% CI, 18.5-24.8 mo) with immunoembolization and 17.2 months (95% CI, 11.9-22.4 mo) with BE.The degree of proinflammatory cytokine production was more robust after immunoembolization and correlated with time to ""systemic"" extrahepatic progression.In the immunoembolization group, interleukin (IL)-6 levels at 1 hour (P = .001) and IL-8 levels at 18 hours after the procedure (P < .001) were significant predictors of longer systemic PFS.Moreover, a dose-response pattern was evident between posttreatment serum cytokine concentrations and systemic PFS.CONCLUSIONS: Immunoembolization induced more robust inflammatory responses, which correlated with the delayed progression of extrahepatic systemic metastases.",1,1,1,1
25057173,"EGFR biomarkers predict benefit from vandetanib in combination with docetaxel in a randomized phase III study of second-line treatment of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.BACKGROUND: ZODIAC was a randomized phase III study of second-line treatment in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that evaluated the addition of vandetanib to docetaxel.The study showed a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival and objective response rate, but not in overall survival for unselected patients.This study evaluated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutation, copy number gain, and protein expression, and KRAS gene mutation, in pretreatment tumor samples as potential biomarkers predicting benefit from vandetanib as second-line treatment of NSCLC.PATIENTS AND METHODS: After progression following first-line chemotherapy, 1391 patients with locally advanced or metastatic (stage IIIB/IV) NSCLC were randomized 1 : 1 to receive vandetanib (100 mg/day) plus docetaxel (75 mg/m(2) every 21 days) or placebo plus docetaxel in the ZODIAC study.Archival tumor samples (n = 570) were collected from consenting patients (n = 958) for predefined, prospective biomarker analyses.RESULTS: Of evaluable samples, 14% were EGFR mutation positive, 35% were EGFR FISH positive, 88% were EGFR protein expression positive, and 13% were KRAS mutation positive.Compared with the overall study population, in which progression-free survival (PFS) [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.79] but not OS (HR = 0.91) were significantly improved with vandetanib, there was greater relative clinical benefit for patients with EGFR mutation-positive tumors [PFS HR 0.51, confidence interval (CI) 0.25-1.06 and OS HR 0.46, CI 0.14-1.57] and EGFR FISH-positive tumors (PFS HR 0.61, CI 0.39-0.94 and OS HR 0.48, CI 0.28-0.84).Similarly, patients with EGFR mutation or FISH-positive tumor samples who received vandetanib had an increased chance of objective tumor response (odds ratios 3.34, CI 0.8-13.89, and 3.90, CI 1.02-14.82, respectively).There did not appear to be benefit for vandetanib in patients with KRAS mutation-positive tumors.CONCLUSIONS: High EGFR gene copy number or activating EGFR mutations may identify patient subgroups who receive increased clinical benefit from vandetanib in combination with docetaxel in second-line NSCLC.CLINICALTRIALSGOV: NCT00312377.",1,1,1,1

24573743,"A phase II open-label randomized multicenter trial of TSU-68 in combination with S-1 and oxaliplatin versus S-1 in combination with oxaliplatin in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide.The combination of oxaliplatin-based treatments (oxaliplatin plus infusional 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin [FOLFOX] or oxaliplatin plus capecitabine [CapeOX]) and bevacizumab is a standard chemotherapy regimen for metastatic CRC (mCRC).However, several clinical studies that tested S-1 plus oxaliplatin (SOX) indicate that SOX is also a treatment option for mCRC.TSU-68 is an oral compound that inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptor and platelet-derived growth factor receptor.The recommended dose of TSU-68 + SOX was previously determined in a phase I study of mCRC patients.The goal of this trial was to evaluate the efficacy of TSU-68 in combination with SOX.METHODS: This open-label multicenter randomized phase II trial was performed in Korea.Treatment-naive mCRC patients with a performance status of 0 or 1 were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either TSU-68 + SOX or SOX alone.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS).RESULTS: A total of 105 patients (TSU-68 + SOX, 52 patients; SOX alone, 53 patients) were randomized.The median PFS was 7.0 months in the TSU-68 + SOX group (hazard ratio [HR], 1.057) and 7.2 months in the SOX group (p = 0.8401).The most frequent grade 3 and 4 adverse events were thrombocytopenia (9.6 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 26.4 % [SOX]), neutropenia (13.5 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 15.1 % [SOX]), and anemia (3.8 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 13.2 % [SOX]).We observed a difference between the 2 groups for all grades of anemia (15.4 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 32.1 % [SOX]), diarrhea (30.8 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 47.2 % [SOX]), vomiting (50.0 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 26.4 % [SOX]), and chromaturia (23.1 % [TSU-68 + SOX] vs. 0.0 % [SOX]).Analysis using a Cox proportional hazard model showed that baseline interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels were associated with a survival benefit of TSU-68 (p = 0.012).CONCLUSION: TSU-68 + SOX had a favorable safety profile.However, TSU-68 did not have a synergistic effect on the efficacy of SOX.The baseline serum IL-6 level could be a prognostic factor for TSU-68 efficacy.",1,1,1,1
25403578,"FOLFOX4 versus sequential dose-dense FOLFOX7 followed by FOLFIRI in patients with resectable metastatic colorectal cancer (MIROX): a pragmatic approach to chemotherapy timing with perioperative or postoperative chemotherapy from an open-label, randomized phase III trial.BACKGROUND: Perioperative FOLFOX4 (oxaliplatin plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin) chemotherapy is the current standard in patients with resectable metastases from colorectal cancer (CRC).We aimed to determine whether a sequential chemotherapy with dose-dense oxaliplatin (FOLFOX7) and irinotecan (FOLFIRI; irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin) is superior to FOLFOX4.The chemotherapy timing was not imposed, and was perioperative or postoperative.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this open-label, phase III trial, patients with resectable or resected metastases were randomly assigned either to 12 cycles of FOLFOX4 (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m(2)) or 6 cycles of FOLFOX7 (oxaliplatin 130 mg/m(2)) followed by 6 cycles of FOLFIRI (irinotecan 180 mg/m(2)).Randomization was done centrally, with stratification by chemotherapy timing, type of local treatment (surgery versus radiofrequency ablation with/without surgery), and Fong's prognostic score.The primary end point was 2-year disease-free survival (DFS).RESULTS: A total of 284 patients were randomized, 142 in each treatment group.Chemotherapy was perioperative in 168 (59.2%) patients and postoperative in 116 (40.8%) patients.Perioperative chemotherapy was preferentially proposed for synchronous metastases, whereas postoperative chemotherapy was more frequently used for metachronous metastases.Two-year DFS was 48.5% in the FOLFOX4 group and 50.0% in the FOLFOX7-FOLFIRI group.In the multivariable analysis, more than one metastasis [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.15] and synchronous metastases (HR = 1.63) were independent prognostic factors for shorter DFS.Five-year overall survival (OS) rate was 69.5% with FOLFOX4 versus 66.6% with FOLFOX7-FOLFIRI.CONCLUSIONS: FOLFOX7-FOLFIRI is not superior to FOLFOX4 in patients with resectable metastatic CRC.Five-year OS rates observed in both groups are the highest ever reported in this setting, possibly reflecting the pragmatic approach to chemotherapy timing.CLINICAL TRIALS NUMBER: NCT00268398.",1,1,1,1

23532629,"Erythropoietin treatment in chemotherapy-induced anemia in previously untreated advanced esophagogastric cancer patients.BACKGROUND: The impact of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents in chemotherapy-induced anemia has been a constant topic of debate over recent years.We prospectively assessed the efficacy of epoetin beta (Epo-b) in improving hemoglobin (Hb) levels and outcome in patients within an open label, randomized clinical phase II trial with advanced or metastatic gastric/esophagogastric cancer.METHODS: Previously untreated patients were randomized to receive 3-weekly cycles of capecitabine (1000 mg/m(2) bid) for 14 days plus on day 1 either irinotecan 250 mg/m(2) or cisplatin 80 mg/m(2).Epo-b (30000 IU once weekly) was initiated in patients with Hb <11 g/dl and continued until Hb >/=12 g/dl was reached.If after 4 weeks the Hb increase was <0.5 g/dl, Epo-b was increased to 30000 IU, twice weekly.RESULTS: Of 118 patients enrolled, 32 received Epo-b treatment; of these, 65 % achieved an increase in Hb levels of at least 2 g/dl, with 74 % achieving the target Hb of >/=12 g/dl.Within the study population, patients receiving Epo-b showed better overall survival (median 14.5 vs. 8.0 months, P = 0.056) as well as a significantly improved disease control rate (78 vs. 55 %, P = 0.025).Patients in the irinotecan group profited significantly (P < 0.05) in terms of progression-free survival and overall survival under Epo-b treatment (median 6.5 vs 4.1 months and median 15.4 vs 8.4 months, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: Epo-b was effective in raising Hb levels in patients with advanced esophagogastric cancer.Patients receiving Epo-b had a significantly increased response to chemotherapy and a clear trend to improved survival.",1,1,1,1
22493375,"Intra-arterial infusion of irinotecan-loaded drug-eluting beads (DEBIRI) versus intravenous therapy (FOLFIRI) for hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer: final results of a phase III study.BACKGROUND: Metastases to the liver receive most of their blood supply from the arterial route, therefore for patients with hepatic metastases from large bowel cancer, hepatic arterial infusion adopting drug-eluting beads preloaded with irinotecan (DEBIRI) may offer a chance of cure.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a multi-institutional study, 74 patients were randomly assigned to receive DEBIRI (36) versus systemic irinotecan, fluorouracil and leucovorin (FOLFIRI, 38).The primary end-point was survival; secondary end points were response, recurrence, toxicity, quality of life, cost and influence of molecular markers.RESULTS: At 50 months, overall survival was significantly longer for patients treated with DEBIRI than for those treated with FOLFIRI (p=0.031, log-rank).Median survival was 22 (95% Confidence Interval CI=21-23) months, for DEBIRI and 15 (95% CI=12-18) months for FOLFIRI.Progression-free survival was 7 (95% CI=3-11) months in the DEBIRI group compared to 4 (95% CI=3-5) months in the FOLFIRI group and the difference between groups was statistically significant (p=0.006, log-rank).Extrahepatic progression had occurred in all patients by the end of the study, at a median time of 13 (95% CI=10-16) months in the DEBIRI group compared to 9 (95% CI 5-13) months in the FOLFIRI group.A statistically significant difference between groups was not observed (p=0.064, log-rank).The median time for duration of improvement to quality of life was 8 (95% CI=3-13) months in the DEBIRI group and 3 (95% CI=2-4) months in the FOLFIRI group.The difference in duration of improvement was statistically significant (p=0.00002, log-rank).CONCLUSION: This study showed a statistically significant difference between DEBIRI and FOLFIRI for overall survival (7 months), progression-free survival (3 months) and quality of life (5 months).In addition, a clinically significant improvement in time to extrahepatic progression (4 months) was observed for DEBIRI, a reversal of the expectation for a regional treatment.This suggests a benefit of DEBIRI treatment over standard chemotherapy and serves to establish the expected difference between these two treatment options for planning future large randomized studies.",1,1,1,1
24076063,"Neoadjuvant treatment of endometrial cancer using anastrozole: a randomised pilot study.OBJECTIVE: Excessive oestrogenic stimulation is a well-known risk factor for the development and progression of endometrial cancer.Aromatase is the key enzyme which catalyses the conversion of androgens to oestrogens in postmenopausal women.Inhibition of aromatase may therefore be a useful strategy in the management of endometrial cancer.A pilot study was designed to assess the feasibility of a neoadjuvant model and understand the biological effects of anastrozole, an aromatase inhibitor, in the treatment of endometrial cancer.METHODS: Patients with endometrial cancer who consented to participate in the study were randomised to receive anastrozole or placebo for a minimum of 14 days prior to definitive surgery.Endometrial samples were obtained before and after treatment.Immunohistochemistry was performed to ascertain the expression of oestrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha), progesterone receptor (PR), androgen receptor (AR), ki-67 and Bcl2 before and after treatment in glands and stroma of the endometrium.RESULTS: A total of 16 patients were randomised to the anastrozole arm and 8 to the placebo arm (2:1 randomisation).A significant decrease in the glandular expression of ERalpha and AR was observed in the anastrozole arm.There was no significant change in the expression of PR or Bcl2.Expression of ki-67, a proliferation marker, also decreased significantly following treatment with anastrozole.CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with anastrozole caused a significant decrease in proliferation as demonstrated by decreased ki-67 expression.A large randomised controlled trial is warranted to fully assess the role of anastrozole in the neoadjuvant treatment of endometrial cancer.",1,1,1,1
22892060,"Hormone replacement therapy after breast cancer: 10 year follow up of the Stockholm randomised trial.BACKGROUND: The management of hormonal deficiency symptoms in breast cancer survivors is an unsolved problem.While hormone replacement therapy (HRT) may increase the risk of breast cancer in healthy women, its effects on recurrence is unclear.Observational studies have suggested decreased recurrence rates from HRT.The few clinical trials in this field have all been closed preterm.METHODS: The Stockholm trial was started in 1997 and designed to minimise the dose of progestogen in the HRT arm.Disease-free women with a history of breast cancer were randomised to HRT (n=188) or no HRT (n=190).The trial was stopped in 2003 when another Swedish study (HABITS, the Hormonal Replacement After Breast Cancer - Is it Safe?) reported increased recurrence.However the Stockholm material showed no excess risk after 4 years of follow-up.A long term follow-up has now been performed.FINDINGS: After 10.8 years of follow-up, there was no difference in new breast cancer events: 60 in the HRT group versus 48 among controls (hazard ratio (HR)=1.3; 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.9-1.9).Among women on HRT, 11 had local recurrence and 12 distant metastases versus 15 and 12 for the controls.There were 14 contra-lateral breast cancers in the HRT group and four in the control group (HR=3.6; 95% CI=1.2-10.9; p=0.013).No differences in mortality or new primary malignancies were found.INTERPRETATION: The number of new events did not differ significantly between groups, in contrast to previous reports.The increased recurrence in HABITS has been attributed to higher progestogen exposure.As both trials were prematurely closed, data do not allow firm conclusions.Both studies found no increased mortality from breast cancer or other causes from HRT.Current guidelines typically consider HRT contraindicated in breast cancer survivors.Findings suggest that, in some women symptom relief may outweigh the potential risks of HRT.",0,0,0,0

24214315,"Similar relationship between the time course of bone mineral density improvement and vertebral fracture risk reduction with denosumab treatment in postmenopausal osteoporosis and prostate cancer patients on androgen deprivation therapy.Denosumab has received approval in many countries and indications include treating women with postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO) at increased or high risk for fracture and men at high risk for fracture receiving androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for non-metastatic prostate cancer.Increases in total hip bone mineral density (BMD) with denosumab explained a large percentage of new vertebral fracture risk reduction in women with PMO; however, this effect has not been studied in men with prostate cancer receiving ADT.We compared the relationship between the time course of BMD changes and new vertebral fracture risk reduction with denosumab in women with PMO and men with prostate cancer.After adjusting for different baseline hazards, a significant and similar relationship between time course of total hip and lumbar spine BMD changes and new vertebral fracture risk was observed in both patient populations.Time course of total hip BMD changes with denosumab was the best predictor for changes in fracture risk and explained 88% of the new vertebral fracture risk reduction in women with PMO and 91% in men with prostate cancer.Therefore, total hip BMD is a useful surrogate to measure the clinical impact of denosumab on fracture risk reduction in both patient populations.",0,0,0,0
23562353,"Influence of DNA copy number and mRNA levels on the expression of breast cancer related proteins.For a panel of cancer related proteins, the aim was to shed light on which molecular level the expression of each protein was mainly regulated in breast tumors, and to investigate whether differences in regulation were reflected in different molecular subtypes.DNA, mRNA and protein lysates from 251 breast tumor specimens were analyzed using appropriate microarray technologies.Data from all three levels were available for 52 proteins selected for their known involvement in cancer, primarily through the PI3K/Akt pathway.For every protein, in cis Spearman rank correlations between the three molecular levels were calculated across all samples and within each intrinsic gene expression subtype, enabling 63 comparisons altogether due to multiple gene probes matching to single proteins.Subtype-specific relationships between the three molecular levels were studied by calculating the variance of subtype-specific correlation and differences between overall and average subtype-specific correlation.The findings were validated in an external dataset comprising 703 breast tumor specimens.The proteins were sorted into four groups based on the calculated rank correlation values between the three molecular levels.Group A consisted of eight proteins with significant correlation between DNA copy number levels and mRNA expression, and between mRNA expression and protein expression (Bonferroni adjusted p < 0.05).Group B consisted of 14 proteins with significant correlation between mRNA expression and protein expression.Group C consisted of 15 proteins with significant correlation between copy number levels and mRNA expression.For the remaining 25 proteins (group D), no significant correlations was observed.Stratification of tumors according to intrinsic subtype enabled identification of positive correlations between copy number levels, mRNA and protein expression that were undetectable when considering the entire sample set.Protein pairings that either demonstrated high variance in correlation values between subtypes, or between subtypes and the total dataset were studied in particular.The protein expression of cleaved caspase 7 was most highly expressed, and correlated highest to CASP7 gene expression within the basal-like subtype, accompanied by the lowest amounts of hsa-miR-29c.Luminal A-like subtype demonstrated highest amounts of hsa-miR-29c (a miRNA with a putative target sequence in CASP7 mRNA), low expression of cleaved caspase 7 and low correlation to CASP7 gene expression.Such pattern might be an indication of hsa-miR-29c miRNA functioning as a repressor of translation of CASP7 within the luminal-A subtype.Across the entire cohort no correlation was found between CCNB1 copy number and gene expression.However, within most gene intrinsic subtypes, mRNA and protein expression of cyclin B1 was found positively correlated to copy number data, suggesting that copy number can affect the overall expression of this protein.Aberrations of cyclin B1 copy number also identified patients with reduced overall survival within each subtype.Based on correlation between the three molecular levels, genes and their products could be sorted into four groups for which the expression was likely to be regulated at different molecular levels.Further stratification suggested subtype-specific regulation that was not evident across the entire sample set.",0,0,0,0

25342504,"Metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma outcomes in patients on cisplatin with nolatrexed or 5-fluorouracil.BACKGROUND: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is one of the most common malignant tumors in southern China.In this study, we compared the clinical efficacy and toxicity of cisplatin with nolatrexed (LP) or 5-fluorouracil (FP) for NPC.PATIENTS AND METHODS: 33 patients with metastatic NPC were randomized to the LP and FP regimens.The LP regimen consisted of continuous intravenous infusions of 740 mg/m(2) nolatrexed on days 1-5 and 25 mg/m(2) intravenous cisplatin on days 2-4.The FP regimen consisted of continuous intravenous infusions of 600 mg/m(2) 5-fluorouracil on days 1-5 and 25 mg/m(2) intravenous cisplatin on days 2-4.Cycles were repeated every 3 weeks until disease progression or completion of a total of 6 courses.RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the response rates (RR), disease control rates (DCR), times to progression (TTP), and median survival times (MST) between the regimens.The toxicities of the two regimens were mostly grade I/II, but the stomatitis incidence in the patients on the LP regimen was significantly lower than that on the FP regimen.CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of the LP regimen was similar to that of the FP regimen.The LP regimen had lower toxicity.",1,1,1,1
22104618,"Does health-related quality of life improve for advanced pancreatic cancer patients who respond to gemcitabine? Analysis of a randomized phase III trial of the cancer and leukemia group B (CALGB 80303).CONTEXT: Gemcitabine for advanced pancreatic cancer (APC) is palliative and the prognosis is poor, making health-related quality of life (HRQOL) particularly important.OBJECTIVES: We evaluated HRQOL with the EuroQol (EQ-5D) in patients with APC participating in Cancer and Leukemia Group B 80303, a multicenter, double-blind, randomized trial comparing overall survival (OS) between two treatment arms: gemcitabine with bevacizumab or gemcitabine with placebo.METHODS: A consecutive subsample of patients was invited to complete the EQ-5D surveys.Because neither clinical nor HRQOL outcomes differed based on the study arm, analyses were pooled.Changes in mean scores from baseline to eight weeks and the prognostic value of the EQ-5D were evaluated.RESULTS: Mean index scores remained stable (0.78 at baseline [n=267], 0.79 at eight weeks [n=186], P=0.34, Wilcoxon signed rank test), attributable to a modest deterioration of physical function domain scores coincident with small improvements in pain and anxiety/depression scores.A small decline in visual analogue scale scores was observed (70.7 vs. 68.2, P=0.026).HRQOL changes within chemotherapy response strata revealed stable index scores but a trend of worsened physical function among patients with disease progression compared with those with stable or improved disease.Visual analogue scale scores trended downward over time irrespective of chemotherapy response status, with a statistically meaningful deterioration in patients who progressed (68.9 vs. 64.4, P=0.029).Baseline scores from both EQ-5D scales were significant predictors of OS in Cox proportional hazard models.CONCLUSION: Response to gemcitabine treatment in APC is not associated with appreciable improvement of global HRQOL.Small improvements in pain and mood are observed despite progressive functional decline.Those who respond to gemcitabine may experience a slight slowing of functional deterioration.",0,0,0,0

25057173,"EGFR biomarkers predict benefit from vandetanib in combination with docetaxel in a randomized phase III study of second-line treatment of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.BACKGROUND: ZODIAC was a randomized phase III study of second-line treatment in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that evaluated the addition of vandetanib to docetaxel.The study showed a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival and objective response rate, but not in overall survival for unselected patients.This study evaluated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutation, copy number gain, and protein expression, and KRAS gene mutation, in pretreatment tumor samples as potential biomarkers predicting benefit from vandetanib as second-line treatment of NSCLC.PATIENTS AND METHODS: After progression following first-line chemotherapy, 1391 patients with locally advanced or metastatic (stage IIIB/IV) NSCLC were randomized 1 : 1 to receive vandetanib (100 mg/day) plus docetaxel (75 mg/m(2) every 21 days) or placebo plus docetaxel in the ZODIAC study.Archival tumor samples (n = 570) were collected from consenting patients (n = 958) for predefined, prospective biomarker analyses.RESULTS: Of evaluable samples, 14% were EGFR mutation positive, 35% were EGFR FISH positive, 88% were EGFR protein expression positive, and 13% were KRAS mutation positive.Compared with the overall study population, in which progression-free survival (PFS) [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.79] but not OS (HR = 0.91) were significantly improved with vandetanib, there was greater relative clinical benefit for patients with EGFR mutation-positive tumors [PFS HR 0.51, confidence interval (CI) 0.25-1.06 and OS HR 0.46, CI 0.14-1.57] and EGFR FISH-positive tumors (PFS HR 0.61, CI 0.39-0.94 and OS HR 0.48, CI 0.28-0.84).Similarly, patients with EGFR mutation or FISH-positive tumor samples who received vandetanib had an increased chance of objective tumor response (odds ratios 3.34, CI 0.8-13.89, and 3.90, CI 1.02-14.82, respectively).There did not appear to be benefit for vandetanib in patients with KRAS mutation-positive tumors.CONCLUSIONS: High EGFR gene copy number or activating EGFR mutations may identify patient subgroups who receive increased clinical benefit from vandetanib in combination with docetaxel in second-line NSCLC.CLINICALTRIALSGOV: NCT00312377.",1,1,1,1
25228971,"The need for second-look endoscopy to prevent delayed bleeding after endoscopic submucosal dissection for gastric neoplasms: a prospective randomized trial.BACKGROUND/AIMS: Many authors recommend performing a second-look endoscopy (SLE) to reduce the frequency of delayed bleeding after endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for gastric neoplasms, but these recommendations have been made despite a lack of reliable evidence supporting the effectiveness of SLE.METHODS: From January 2012 to May 2013, we investigated 441 gastric neoplasms treated by ESD to assess the risk factors for delayed bleeding.Delayed bleeding occurred in four of these lesions within 1 postoperation day.Therefore, we enrolled the patients with the remaining 437 lesions to determine the utility of SLE performed on the morning of postoperative day 2.All lesions were randomly assigned to SLE (220 lesions) groups or non-SLE (217 lesions) groups.RESULTS: Delayed bleeding occurred in 18 lesions (4.1%).A large tumor size (>20 mm) was the only independent risk factor for delayed bleeding (p=0.007).The chance of delayed bleeding was not significantly different between the patients receiving a SLE (eight cases) and those patients not receiving a SLE (six cases, p=0.787).Furthermore, SLE for lesions with a large tumor size did not significantly decrease delayed bleeding (p=0.670).CONCLUSIONS: SLE had little or no influence on the prevention of delayed bleeding, irrespective of the risk factors.",0,0,0,0
24081946,"Randomized multicenter phase II trial comparing two schedules of etirinotecan pegol (NKTR-102) in women with recurrent platinum-resistant/refractory epithelial ovarian cancer.PURPOSE: Etirinotecan pegol (NKTR-102) is a unique, long-acting topoisomerase-I inhibitor with prolonged systemic exposure to SN38 (7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin), the active metabolite of irinotecan.This randomized phase II trial investigated two dosing schedules of etirinotecan pegol in patients with platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian carcinoma.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 71 eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive etirinotecan pegol 145 mg/m(2) every 14 or 21 days until progression or unacceptable adverse events (AEs).The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR) by RECIST (version 1.0).Secondary end points included response by Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup criteria, duration of ORR, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).RESULTS: The overall confirmed ORR was 20% (95% CI, 10% to 30%): 20% for once every 14 days, and 19% for once every 21 days.Median response duration was 4.1 months for once every 14 days and 4.0 months for once every 21 days.Median PFS for every 14 and every 21 days was 4.1 and 5.3 months, respectively, and median OS was 10.0 and 11.7 months, respectively.Etirinotecan pegol was well tolerated, with the most common grade 3 to 4 AEs being dehydration (24%) and diarrhea (23%).Diarrhea, dehydration, nausea, and neutropenia were less frequent with the schedule of once every 21 days than with that of once every 14 days.CONCLUSION: Both schedules of etirinotecan pegol showed activity in patients with heavily pretreated ovarian cancer, with encouraging ORR and PFS rates.The schedule of once every 21 days was better tolerated and had slightly longer PFS and OS rates.The treatment schedule of etirinotecan pegol 145 mg/m(2) once every 21 days was selected for the expanded phase II study and is preferred for future phase III studies.These findings provide support to directly compare etirinotecan pegol versus one of the approved drugs (eg, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or topotecan) in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.",1,1,1,1

24129868,"Effect of a web-based curriculum on primary care practice: basic skin cancer triage trial.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Primary care physicians (PCPs) are uniquely positioned to detect melanoma.Effective educational interventions targeted at PCPs may improve early melanoma detection.A previous in-person Basic Skin Cancer Triage (BSCT) 2-hour course demonstrated significant short-term improvement in provider practices, attitudes, ability, confidence, and knowledge.We conducted a randomized trial to test the efficacy of the BSCT course implemented as a web-based learning program, compared to a similar (control) web-based course on weight assessment.METHODS: We recruited a sample of 57 PCPs and 3,341 of their patients from four geographically diverse centers.Skin cancer control activities by PCPs were assessed by physician survey and by chart review and patient telephone interview about their recent visit to their PCP at baseline and at 1--2 months and 12 months after course completion.RESULTS: Some effect of intervention on skin cancer parameters was self-reported by physicians; this was not confirmed by patient survey or chart-extracted data.Rates of skin cancer control practices by PCPs were low across both groups before and after intervention.The positive changes in physician-reported behaviors (total body skin examination [TBSE]), intentions (discuss skin cancer detection), confidence (performing TBSE), office practices, and knowledge (58% skin versus 49% control) were neither matched by differences in practice reported by their patients, nor persisted in a longer term follow-up, hence may be attributable to physician recall bias due to the experience of the course or desire to please study investigators and were less dramatic as compared to our previously reported in-person BSCT intervention.Thus this approach by itself appears unlikely to result in improved PCP handling of skin cancer issues.CONCLUSIONS: Given previous success with our in-person course, the features required to make WBL a more effective tool for medical education must be further explored.",0,0,0,0

25018037,"Impact of baseline corticosteroids on survival and steroid androgens in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: exploratory analysis from COU-AA-301.BACKGROUND: Corticosteroids have been used to mitigate mineralocorticoid-related effects and restore sensitivity to abiraterone acetate.Corticosteroids may also mediate glucocorticoid receptor or mutated androgen receptor activation and adversely influence outcome.OBJECTIVE: This post hoc exploratory analysis investigated whether baseline corticosteroids were an independent prognostic factor and its level of contribution in the presence of other prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) in study COU-AA-301.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: COU-AA-301 was a randomised study of abiraterone plus prednisone versus prednisone in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients after docetaxel.INTERVENTION: Patients were randomised 2:1 to abiraterone 1000 mg plus prednisone 5mg by mouth twice daily versus prednisone.OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Association of OS with baseline corticosteroids was determined by univariate and multivariate Cox models.RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: At study entry, 33% of patients received corticosteroids, had worse disease characteristics (p<0.05 except liver metastases), and were more likely to have testosterone levels below the median (odds ratio:2.92; chi-square p<0.0001).Associations between prostate-specific antigen response as well as circulating tumour cell decline and higher baseline androgen levels were demonstrated.Patients taking baseline corticosteroids had inferior OS in univariate analysis (hazard ratio: 1.48; p<0.0001); however, in multivariate stepwise selection modelling, baseline corticosteroids did not add substantially to the model.This analysis is limited as a retrospective analysis and restricted to patients after docetaxel.CONCLUSIONS: In the COU-AA-301 study, baseline corticosteroids were associated with adverse prognostic features, inferior OS, and lower baseline androgen levels but did not add substantial information to the final prognostic model.Thus in these data from study COU-AA-301, concurrent baseline corticosteroids did not have an independent impact on OS.PATIENT SUMMARY: Baseline corticosteroids did not adversely affect abiraterone clinical benefit in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.Their use was associated with patients having worse disease characteristics.",1,1,1,1
24081946,"Randomized multicenter phase II trial comparing two schedules of etirinotecan pegol (NKTR-102) in women with recurrent platinum-resistant/refractory epithelial ovarian cancer.PURPOSE: Etirinotecan pegol (NKTR-102) is a unique, long-acting topoisomerase-I inhibitor with prolonged systemic exposure to SN38 (7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin), the active metabolite of irinotecan.This randomized phase II trial investigated two dosing schedules of etirinotecan pegol in patients with platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian carcinoma.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 71 eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive etirinotecan pegol 145 mg/m(2) every 14 or 21 days until progression or unacceptable adverse events (AEs).The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR) by RECIST (version 1.0).Secondary end points included response by Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup criteria, duration of ORR, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).RESULTS: The overall confirmed ORR was 20% (95% CI, 10% to 30%): 20% for once every 14 days, and 19% for once every 21 days.Median response duration was 4.1 months for once every 14 days and 4.0 months for once every 21 days.Median PFS for every 14 and every 21 days was 4.1 and 5.3 months, respectively, and median OS was 10.0 and 11.7 months, respectively.Etirinotecan pegol was well tolerated, with the most common grade 3 to 4 AEs being dehydration (24%) and diarrhea (23%).Diarrhea, dehydration, nausea, and neutropenia were less frequent with the schedule of once every 21 days than with that of once every 14 days.CONCLUSION: Both schedules of etirinotecan pegol showed activity in patients with heavily pretreated ovarian cancer, with encouraging ORR and PFS rates.The schedule of once every 21 days was better tolerated and had slightly longer PFS and OS rates.The treatment schedule of etirinotecan pegol 145 mg/m(2) once every 21 days was selected for the expanded phase II study and is preferred for future phase III studies.These findings provide support to directly compare etirinotecan pegol versus one of the approved drugs (eg, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or topotecan) in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.",1,1,1,1

23790994,"Online narratives and peer support for colorectal cancer screening: a pilot randomized trial.BACKGROUND: Delivering personal narratives and peer support for CRC screening in an online weight-loss community could be an efficient approach to engaging individuals at increased risk, because obesity is associated with excess colorectal cancer (CRC) mortality and lower screening rates.PURPOSE: Evaluate user engagement and impact of narratives and peer support for promoting CRC screening in an online weight-loss community.DESIGN: Pilot randomized trial.SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Members of an online weight-loss community who were not up-to-date with CRC screening were enrolled in the study in 2011.INTERVENTION: Basic and Enhanced groups (n=153 each) both received education.The Enhanced group also received narratives and peer support for CRC screening in online forums.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main measures were user engagement, psychosocial outcomes, and self-report CRC screening at 6 months.Analyses were conducted with (1) the full sample of participants and (2) a minimum dose sample of those who participated in their assigned intervention to a minimum degree.Analyses were completed in 2012.RESULTS: Participants were mostly female (92%) with a mean age of 56 years.More than 90% in both groups viewed the educational information.Only 57% in the Enhanced group joined the online team.The Enhanced group had greater improvement in motivation for screening than the Basic group at 1 month (p=0.03).In the full sample, there was no difference in CRC screening at 6 months (Enhanced 19% vs Basic 16%, adjusted OR=1.33, 95% CI=0.73, 2.42).In the minimum dose sample, fecal occult blood testing was higher in the Enhanced (14%) vs Basic (7%) group (adjusted OR=2.49, 95% CI=1.01, 6.17).CONCLUSIONS: Although no between-group differences in CRC screening were seen at 6 months, this study did demonstrate that it is feasible to deploy a narrative and peer support intervention for CRC screening in a randomized trial among members of an online community.However, modifications are needed to improve user engagement.TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01411826.",0,0,0,0
25284802,"Multicenter randomized controlled trial of percutaneous cryoablation versus radiofrequency ablation in hepatocellular carcinoma.UNLABELLED: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is considered a curative treatment option for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Growing data have demonstrated that cryoablation represents a safe and effective alternative therapy for HCC, but no randomized controlled trial (RCT) has been reported to compare cryoablation with RFA in HCC treatment.The present study was a multicenter RCT aimed to compare the outcomes of percutaneous cryoablation with RFA for the treatment of HCC.In all, 360 patients with Child-Pugh class A or B cirrhosis and one or two HCC lesions </= 4 cm, treatment-naive, without metastasis were randomly assigned to cryoablation (n = 180) or RFA (n = 180).The primary endpoints were local tumor progression at 3 years after treatment and safety.Local tumor progression rates at 1, 2, and 3 years were 3%, 7%, and 7% for cryoablation and 9%, 11%, and 11% for RFA, respectively (P = 0.043).For lesions >3 cm in diameter, the local tumor progression rate was significantly lower in the cryoablation group versus the RFA group (7.7% versus 18.2%, P = 0.041).The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates were 97%, 67%, and 40% for cryoablation and 97%, 66%, and 38% for RFA, respectively (P = 0.747).The 1-, 3-, and 5-year tumor-free survival rates were 89%, 54%, and 35% in the cryoablation group and 84%, 50%, and 34% in the RFA group, respectively (P = 0.628).Multivariate analyses demonstrated that Child-Pugh class B and distant intrahepatic recurrence were significant negative predictors for overall survival.Major complications occurred in seven patients (3.9%) following cryoablation and in six patients (3.3%) following RFA (P = 0.776).CONCLUSION: Cryoablation resulted in a significantly lower local tumor progression than RFA, although both cryoablation and RFA were equally safe and effective, with similar 5-year survival rates.",1,1,1,1
24560287,"A comparison of two methods for estimating DCE-MRI parameters via individual and cohort based AIFs in prostate cancer: a step towards practical implementation.Multi-parametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging, and specifically Dynamic Contrast Enhanced (DCE) MRI, play increasingly important roles in detection and staging of prostate cancer (PCa).One of the actively investigated approaches to DCE MRI analysis involves pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling to extract quantitative parameters that may be related to microvascular properties of the tissue.It is well-known that the prescribed arterial blood plasma concentration (or Arterial Input Function, AIF) input can have significant effects on the parameters estimated by PK modeling.The purpose of our study was to investigate such effects in DCE MRI data acquired in a typical clinical PCa setting.First, we investigated how the choice of a semi-automated or fully automated image-based individualized AIF (iAIF) estimation method affects the PK parameter values; and second, we examined the use of method-specific averaged AIF (cohort-based, or cAIF) as a means to attenuate the differences between the two AIF estimation methods.Two methods for automated image-based estimation of individualized (patient-specific) AIFs, one of which was previously validated for brain and the other for breast MRI, were compared.cAIFs were constructed by averaging the iAIF curves over the individual patients for each of the two methods.Pharmacokinetic analysis using the Generalized kinetic model and each of the four AIF choices (iAIF and cAIF for each of the two image-based AIF estimation approaches) was applied to derive the volume transfer rate (K(trans)) and extravascular extracellular volume fraction (ve) in the areas of prostate tumor.Differences between the parameters obtained using iAIF and cAIF for a given method (intra-method comparison) as well as inter-method differences were quantified.The study utilized DCE MRI data collected in 17 patients with histologically confirmed PCa.Comparison at the level of the tumor region of interest (ROI) showed that the two automated methods resulted in significantly different (p<0.05) mean estimates of ve, but not of K(trans).Comparing cAIF, different estimates for both ve, and K(trans) were obtained.Intra-method comparison between the iAIF- and cAIF-driven analyses showed the lack of effect on ve, while K(trans) values were significantly different for one of the methods.Our results indicate that the choice of the algorithm used for automated image-based AIF determination can lead to significant differences in the values of the estimated PK parameters.K(trans)estimates are more sensitive to the choice between cAIF/iAIF as compared to ve, leading to potentially significant differences depending on the AIF method.These observations may have practical consequences in evaluating the PK analysis results obtained in a multi-site setting.",0,0,0,0

24608924,"Influence of interferon-alpha combined with chemo (radio) therapy on immunological parameters in pancreatic adenocarcinoma.Prognosis of patients with carcinoma of the exocrine pancreas is particularly poor.A combination of chemotherapy with immunotherapy could be an option for treatment of pancreatic cancer.The aim of this study was to perform an immunomonitoring of 17 patients with pancreatic cancer from the CapRI-2 study, and tumor-bearing mice treated with combination of chemo (radio) therapies with interferon-2alpha.Low doses of interferon-2alpha led to a decrease in total leukocyte and an increase in monocyte counts.Furthermore, we observed a positive effect of interferon-2alpha therapy on the dendritic cells and NK (natural killer) cell activation immediately after the first injection.In addition, we recorded an increased amount of interferon-gamma and IL-10 in the serum following the interferon-2alpha therapy.These data clearly demonstrate that pancreatic carcinoma patients also show an immunomodulatory response to interferon-2alpha therapy.Analysis of immunosuppressive cells in the Panc02 orthotopic mouse model of pancreatic cancer revealed an accumulation of the myeloid-derived suppressor cells in spleens and tumors of the mice treated with interferon-2alpha and 5-fluorouracil.The direct effect of the drugs on myeloid-derived suppressor cells was also registered in vitro.These data expose the importance of immunosuppressive mechanisms induced by combined chemo-immunotherapy.",0,0,0,0
24787968,"Response to subsequent docetaxel in a patient cohort with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer after abiraterone acetate treatment.INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND: Docetaxel or AA are therapeutic options for mCRPC.We retrospectively analyzed clinical outcomes with subsequent docetaxel in patients with mCRPC after disease progression (DP) with AA to evaluate cross resistance between these therapies.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with chemotherapy-naive mCRPC who were treated with AA in previously reported phase I to III trials, who had DP, and were subsequently treated (not on study) with docetaxel, were included.Acquired AA resistance was defined as: PSA decline > 50% from baseline or radiographically stable disease for >/= 8 months, with subsequent DP.All other patients were defined as having primary AA resistance.Efficacy outcomes after docetaxel therapy were analyzed.RESULTS: We identified 23 patients who were treated with docetaxel after DP with AA, including 14 (61%) with acquired and 9 (39%) with primary AA resistance.Median duration between discontinuation of AA and docetaxel initiation was 2.7 months (range, 0.2-14.7 months).Subsequent docetaxel therapy led to >/= 30% PSA decline in 15 patients (65%) and >/= 50% PSA decline in 11 patients (48%).Median OS from date of first docetaxel dose was 12.4 months (95% confidence interval, 8.2-19.6).Patients with previous primary versus acquired AA resistance had similar outcomes with subsequent docetaxel therapy.CONCLUSION: In this retrospective analysis, the type of AA resistance did not appear to affect outcomes with subsequent docetaxel.The PSA response rates observed suggest a lack of cross-resistance between docetaxel and AA, but prospective studies are needed to evaluate for potential cross-resistance and optimize sequences of therapy in patients with mCRPC.",0,0,0,0

22357257,"A randomised trial of primary tamoxifen versus mastectomy plus adjuvant tamoxifen in fit elderly women with invasive breast carcinoma of high oestrogen receptor content: long-term results at 20 years of follow-up.BACKGROUND: Long-term analysis of a randomised trial in Nottingham comparing tamoxifen versus surgery as initial treatment demonstrated that in oestrogen receptor (ER)-unselected cases, surgery achieved better local control, with no difference in overall survival.It was suggested that for patients with ER-rich tumours, local control and survival may be comparable.We now present long-term follow-up of a randomised trial designed to address this clinical scenario.PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and fifty three fit elderly (>/=70 years) women with clinically node-negative primary invasive breast carcinoma <5 cm of high ER content [histochemical (H) score >/=100] were randomised 2:1 to primary tamoxifen (Tam) (N = 100) or mastectomy with adjuvant tamoxifen (Mx + Tam) (N = 53).RESULTS: With median follow-up of 78 months, there was no statistically significant difference in 10-year rates of regional recurrence (9.0% versus 7.5%), metastasis (8.0% versus 13.2%), breast cancer-specific survival (89.0% versus 86.8%) or overall survival (64.0% versus 66.0%) between Tam and Mx + Tam; however, local control was inferior with Tam (local failure rates 43.0% versus 1.9%; P < 0.001).CONCLUSION: Irrespective of the degree of ER positivity, surgery achieved better local control.However, there was excellent and similar survival in both groups.Tam could be considered in those who are 'frail', refuse or prefer not to initially undergo surgery.",1,1,1,1
25403578,"FOLFOX4 versus sequential dose-dense FOLFOX7 followed by FOLFIRI in patients with resectable metastatic colorectal cancer (MIROX): a pragmatic approach to chemotherapy timing with perioperative or postoperative chemotherapy from an open-label, randomized phase III trial.BACKGROUND: Perioperative FOLFOX4 (oxaliplatin plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin) chemotherapy is the current standard in patients with resectable metastases from colorectal cancer (CRC).We aimed to determine whether a sequential chemotherapy with dose-dense oxaliplatin (FOLFOX7) and irinotecan (FOLFIRI; irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin) is superior to FOLFOX4.The chemotherapy timing was not imposed, and was perioperative or postoperative.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this open-label, phase III trial, patients with resectable or resected metastases were randomly assigned either to 12 cycles of FOLFOX4 (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m(2)) or 6 cycles of FOLFOX7 (oxaliplatin 130 mg/m(2)) followed by 6 cycles of FOLFIRI (irinotecan 180 mg/m(2)).Randomization was done centrally, with stratification by chemotherapy timing, type of local treatment (surgery versus radiofrequency ablation with/without surgery), and Fong's prognostic score.The primary end point was 2-year disease-free survival (DFS).RESULTS: A total of 284 patients were randomized, 142 in each treatment group.Chemotherapy was perioperative in 168 (59.2%) patients and postoperative in 116 (40.8%) patients.Perioperative chemotherapy was preferentially proposed for synchronous metastases, whereas postoperative chemotherapy was more frequently used for metachronous metastases.Two-year DFS was 48.5% in the FOLFOX4 group and 50.0% in the FOLFOX7-FOLFIRI group.In the multivariable analysis, more than one metastasis [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.15] and synchronous metastases (HR = 1.63) were independent prognostic factors for shorter DFS.Five-year overall survival (OS) rate was 69.5% with FOLFOX4 versus 66.6% with FOLFOX7-FOLFIRI.CONCLUSIONS: FOLFOX7-FOLFIRI is not superior to FOLFOX4 in patients with resectable metastatic CRC.Five-year OS rates observed in both groups are the highest ever reported in this setting, possibly reflecting the pragmatic approach to chemotherapy timing.CLINICAL TRIALS NUMBER: NCT00268398.",1,1,1,1

22633317,"Prostate-specific antigen kinetics and outcomes in patients with bone metastases from castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with or without zoledronic acid.BACKGROUND: Zoledronic acid (ZOL) is a standard therapy for the prevention of skeletal-related events (SREs) in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).Although prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is an established marker for monitoring prostate cancer patients, correlations between PSA and disease outcomes during ZOL therapy are unclear.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationships among PSA kinetics, bone-directed therapy with ZOL, and clinical outcomes in men with bone metastases from CRPC using a ZOL phase 3 trial database.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Exploratory analyses from a phase 3 trial in men with bone metastases from CRPC (n=643) randomized to ZOL or placebo every 3 wk.OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: PSA levels during the first 3 mo of the study were evaluated in linear and logarithmic (log) models stratified using prognostic factors established in a ZOL phase 3 trial and a CRPC nomogram.Relative risks of SREs, bone disease progression (BDP), and death were calculated per 1 log (nanograms per milliliter) PSA increase.Baseline PSA models used the study median (PSA: 77.3 ng/ml) as the high/low cut-off point.RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: A total of 202 placebo- and 434 ZOL-treated patients were assessable.In both groups, PSA increases correlated with significantly increased risks of death, BDP, and first SRE.In the placebo and ZOL groups, associated increases in risk per 1 log (nanograms per milliliter) PSA increase were 29% (p<0.0001) and 10% (p<0.0074), respectively, for BDP, and 24% (p=0.0010) and 13% (p=0.0079), respectively, for first SRE.Limitations include the retrospective nature of these analyses and the potential confounding effects of concurrent antineoplastic therapies.CONCLUSIONS: PSA is an important prognostic tool for survival in patients with bone metastases from CRPC, and these analyses show that PSA is also prognostic for BDP and SREs regardless of bone-targeted therapy.",1,1,1,0
25018037,"Impact of baseline corticosteroids on survival and steroid androgens in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: exploratory analysis from COU-AA-301.BACKGROUND: Corticosteroids have been used to mitigate mineralocorticoid-related effects and restore sensitivity to abiraterone acetate.Corticosteroids may also mediate glucocorticoid receptor or mutated androgen receptor activation and adversely influence outcome.OBJECTIVE: This post hoc exploratory analysis investigated whether baseline corticosteroids were an independent prognostic factor and its level of contribution in the presence of other prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) in study COU-AA-301.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: COU-AA-301 was a randomised study of abiraterone plus prednisone versus prednisone in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients after docetaxel.INTERVENTION: Patients were randomised 2:1 to abiraterone 1000 mg plus prednisone 5mg by mouth twice daily versus prednisone.OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Association of OS with baseline corticosteroids was determined by univariate and multivariate Cox models.RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: At study entry, 33% of patients received corticosteroids, had worse disease characteristics (p<0.05 except liver metastases), and were more likely to have testosterone levels below the median (odds ratio:2.92; chi-square p<0.0001).Associations between prostate-specific antigen response as well as circulating tumour cell decline and higher baseline androgen levels were demonstrated.Patients taking baseline corticosteroids had inferior OS in univariate analysis (hazard ratio: 1.48; p<0.0001); however, in multivariate stepwise selection modelling, baseline corticosteroids did not add substantially to the model.This analysis is limited as a retrospective analysis and restricted to patients after docetaxel.CONCLUSIONS: In the COU-AA-301 study, baseline corticosteroids were associated with adverse prognostic features, inferior OS, and lower baseline androgen levels but did not add substantial information to the final prognostic model.Thus in these data from study COU-AA-301, concurrent baseline corticosteroids did not have an independent impact on OS.PATIENT SUMMARY: Baseline corticosteroids did not adversely affect abiraterone clinical benefit in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.Their use was associated with patients having worse disease characteristics.",1,1,1,1
21660669,"Light treatment prevents fatigue in women undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer.PURPOSE: Fatigue is one of the most disturbing complaints of cancer patients and is often the reason for discontinuing treatment.This randomized controlled study tested the hypothesis that increased morning bright light, compared to dim light, would result in less fatigue in women with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy.METHODS: Thirty-nine women newly diagnosed with stage I-III breast cancer were randomized to either bright white light (BWL) or dim red light (DRL) treatment and were instructed to use the light box for 30 min every morning throughout the first four cycles of chemotherapy.The Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory was administered prior to the start of chemotherapy (baseline), during the chemotherapy treatment week of cycle 1 (C1TW), the last week (recovery week) of cycle 1 (C1RW), the chemotherapy treatment week of cycle 4 (C4TW), and the last week (recovery week) of cycle 4 (C4RW).RESULTS: The DRL group reported increased fatigue at C1TW (p = 0.003) and C4TW (p < 0.001) compared to baseline, while there was no significant change from baseline in the BWL group.A secondary analysis showed that the increases in fatigue levels in the DRL group were not mediated through nor associated with changes in sleep or in circadian rhythms as measured with wrist actigraphy.CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that morning bright light treatment may prevent overall fatigue from worsening during chemotherapy.Although our hypothesis that overall fatigue would improve with bright light treatment was not supported, the lack of deterioration in total fatigue scores suggests that bright morning light may be a useful intervention during chemotherapy for breast cancer.",0,0,0,0

25701170,"Orteronel plus prednisone in patients with chemotherapy-naive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (ELM-PC 4): a double-blind, multicentre, phase 3, randomised, placebo-controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Orteronel is an investigational, partially selective inhibitor of CYP 17,20-lyase in the androgen signalling pathway, a validated therapeutic target for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.We assessed orteronel in chemotherapy-naive patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.METHODS: In this phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we recruited patients with progressive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and no previous chemotherapy from 324 study centres (ie, hospitals or large urologic or group outpatient offices) in 43 countries.Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 400 mg orteronel plus 5 mg prednisone twice daily or placebo plus 5 mg prednisone twice daily.Randomisation was done centrally with an interactive voice response system and patients were stratified by region (Europe, North America, and not Europe or North America) and the presence or absence of radiographic disease progression at baseline.The two primary endpoints were radiographic progression-free survival and overall survival, determined in the intention-to-treat population.This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01193244.FINDINGS: From Oct 31, 2010, to June 29, 2012, 2353 patients were assessed for eligibility.Of those, 1560 were randomly assigned to receive either orteronel plus prednisone (n=781) or placebo plus prednisone (n=779).The clinical cutoff date for the final analysis was Jan 15, 2014 (with 611 deaths).Median follow-up for radiographic progression-free survival was 8.4 months (IQR 3.7-16.6).Median radiographic progression-free survival was 13.8 months (95% CI 13.1-14.9) with orteronel plus prednisone and 8.7 months (8.3-10.9) with placebo plus prednisone (hazard ratio [HR] 0.71, 95% CI 0.63-0.80; p<0.0001).After a median follow-up of 20.7 months (IQR 14.2-25.4), median overall survival was 31.4 months (95% CI 28.6-not estimable) with orteronel plus prednisone and 29.5 months (27.0-not estimable) with placebo plus prednisone (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.79-1.08; p=0.31).The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events were increased lipase (137 [17%] of 784 patients in the orteronel plus prednisone group vs 14 [2%] of 770 patients in the placebo plus prednisone group), increased amylase (77 [10%] vs nine [1%]), fatigue (50 [6%] vs 14 [2%]), and pulmonary embolism (40 [5%] vs 27 [4%]).Serious adverse events were reported in 358 [46%] patients receiving orteronel plus prednisone and in 292 [38%] patients receiving placebo plus prednisone.INTERPRETATION: In chemotherapy-naive patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, radiographic progression-free survival was prolonged with orteronel plus prednisone versus placebo plus prednisone.However, no improvement was noted in the other primary endpoint, overall survival.Orteronel plus prednisone was associated with increased toxic effects compared with placebo plus prednisone.On the basis of these and other data, orteronel is not undergoing further development in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.FUNDING: Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc, a wholly owned subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited.",1,1,1,1
22357257,"A randomised trial of primary tamoxifen versus mastectomy plus adjuvant tamoxifen in fit elderly women with invasive breast carcinoma of high oestrogen receptor content: long-term results at 20 years of follow-up.BACKGROUND: Long-term analysis of a randomised trial in Nottingham comparing tamoxifen versus surgery as initial treatment demonstrated that in oestrogen receptor (ER)-unselected cases, surgery achieved better local control, with no difference in overall survival.It was suggested that for patients with ER-rich tumours, local control and survival may be comparable.We now present long-term follow-up of a randomised trial designed to address this clinical scenario.PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and fifty three fit elderly (>/=70 years) women with clinically node-negative primary invasive breast carcinoma <5 cm of high ER content [histochemical (H) score >/=100] were randomised 2:1 to primary tamoxifen (Tam) (N = 100) or mastectomy with adjuvant tamoxifen (Mx + Tam) (N = 53).RESULTS: With median follow-up of 78 months, there was no statistically significant difference in 10-year rates of regional recurrence (9.0% versus 7.5%), metastasis (8.0% versus 13.2%), breast cancer-specific survival (89.0% versus 86.8%) or overall survival (64.0% versus 66.0%) between Tam and Mx + Tam; however, local control was inferior with Tam (local failure rates 43.0% versus 1.9%; P < 0.001).CONCLUSION: Irrespective of the degree of ER positivity, surgery achieved better local control.However, there was excellent and similar survival in both groups.Tam could be considered in those who are 'frail', refuse or prefer not to initially undergo surgery.",1,1,1,1
25066875,"Prostate capsule sparing versus nerve sparing radical cystectomy for bladder cancer: results of a randomized, controlled trial.PURPOSE: Prostate capsule sparing and nerve sparing cystectomies are alternative procedures for bladder cancer that may decrease morbidity while achieving cancer control.However, to our knowledge the comparative effectiveness of these approaches has not been established.We evaluated functional and oncologic outcomes in patients undergoing these procedures.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a single institution trial in patients with bladder cancer in whom transurethral prostatic urethral biopsy and transrectal prostate biopsy were negative.Men were randomized to prostate capsule sparing or nerve sparing cystectomy with neobladder creation and stratified by Sexual Health Inventory for Men score (greater than 21 vs 21 or less).Our primary end point was 12-month overall urinary function as measured by Bladder Cancer Index.Secondary end points included sexual function, cancer control and complications.RESULTS: A total of 40 patients were enrolled in the study with 20 patients in each arm.Urinary function at 12 months decreased by 13 and 28 points in the prostate capsule and nerve sparing groups, respectively (p = 0.10).Sexual function followed a similar pattern (p = 0.06).There was no difference in recurrence-free, metastasis-free or overall survival (each p >0.05).The rate of incidentally detected prostate cancer was similar (p = 0.15).CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides a randomized comparison of prostate capsule sparing and nerve sparing cystectomy techniques.We found no difference in functional or oncologic outcomes between the 2 approaches, although our study was underpowered due to a lack of patient accrual.",0,0,0,0

23310947,"Body mass index at diagnosis and survival among colon cancer patients enrolled in clinical trials of adjuvant chemotherapy.BACKGROUND: Although obesity is an established risk factor for developing colon cancer, its prognostic impact and relation to patient sex in colon cancer survivors remains unclear.METHODS: The authors examined the prognostic and predictive impact of the body mass index (BMI) in patients with stage II and III colon carcinoma (N = 25,291) within the Adjuvant Colon Cancer Endpoints (ACCENT) database.BMI was measured at enrollment in randomized trials of 5-fluorouracil-based adjuvant chemotherapy.Association of BMI with the time to recurrence (TTR), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) were determined using Cox regression models.Statistical tests were 2-sided.RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 7.8 years, obese and underweight patients had significantly poorer survival compared with overweight and normal-weight patients.In a multivariable analysis, the adverse prognostic impact of BMI was observed among men but not among women (Pinteraction = .0129).Men with class 2 and 3 obesity (BMI >/= 35.0 kg/m(2) ) had a statistically significant reduction in DFS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.16; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.33; P = .0297) compared with normal-weight patients.Underweight patients had a significantly shorter TTR and reduced DFS (HR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.09-1.28; P < .0001) that was more significant among men (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.15-1.50; P < .0001) than among women (HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.01-1.23; P = .0362; Pinteraction = .0340).BMI was not predictive of a benefit from adjuvant treatment.CONCLUSIONS: Obesity and underweight status were associated independently with inferior outcomes in patients with colon cancer who received treatment in adjuvant chemotherapy trials.",0,0,0,0
23038965,"[The first results of treatment for adult acute myeloid leukemia according to the AML-01.10 protocol of the Research Group of the Hematology Centers of Russia].AIM: To give the preliminary results of the AML-01.10 Russian multicenter randomized trial to treat adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the basic principle of which is to use high-dose anthracycline antibiotics in induction/consolidation.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: By December 2011, 145 patients with AML had been randomized from 18 hematology centers of 15 cities and towns of the Russian Federation; the median age of all the patients was 44 years.Seventy-one patients were analyzed in August 2011 (a 1.5-year follow-up).RESULTS: The efficiency of 2 courses 7+3 using high-dose daunorubicin (60 mg/m2 per administration) and continuous infusion of cytarabine during the second course was high and comparable with that in the use of a high-dose HAM protocol as a second induction course and can achieve a complete remission in 74.6%.The protocol toxicity evaluated from its early mortality (11.3%) and its death in complete remission (16.6%) was permissible, particularly by taking into consideration the multicenter pattern of the trial.At the completion of analysis, 53 (68.8%) out of the 77 patients on whom the data on their vital status were available were alive.In this follow-up period, the frequency of recurrences was 19.2% (10/52).Only 3 (4.2%) patients out of the 71 patients in whom the efficiency of the protocol had been completely evaluated underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.CONCLUSION: The total high dose (720 mg/m2) of anthracycline antibiotics, which is used in the period of induction and consolidation, determines the long periods of myelosuppression and intercourse intervals.Protocol deviations (no course of consolidation therapy, lower-dose idarubicin during consolidation therapy, a course of low-dose cytarabine, between the courses of induction and consolidation chemotherapy, and very long intercourse intervals) were recorded in a total of 20 (28%) patients.",0,0,0,0
25688512,"Rationale and protocol of the MetNET-1 trial, a prospective, single center, phase II study to evaluate the activity and safety of everolimus in combination with octreotide LAR and metformin in patients with advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.Abnormal PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway signalling and autocrine activation of the mTOR pathway, mediated through insulin-like growth factor-1, have been implicated in the proliferation of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (pNET) cells.Everolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, has shown antitumor benefit in pNETs alone and in combination with octreotide LAR in RADIANT-1 and RADIANT-3 studies.Although everolimus-based phase II/III trials have improved progression-free survival for pNET, its use has not impacted on prolonging overall survival.Metformin has recently shown some anti-cancer activity in both in vitro and in vivo studies by its indirect properties to decrease insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels and by its antitumour effect to promote AMPK activation and consequently inhibition to TSC1-2/mTOR complex.In light of even more retrospective evidence of metformin's anticancer activity, a prospective evaluation is required to either confirm or discard these preliminary findings.With the aim to evaluate the antiproliferative effect of metformin in combination with everolimus and octreotide LAR in pancreatic well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor patients, a single arm, prospective, single center phase II study was designed (MetNET-1 trial, NCT 02294006).Forty-three patients are expected to be evaluated.The study is ongoing, and recruitment is estimated to be completed in August 2016.The results will be anticipated in 2017.",0,0,0,0

24123482,"Mediators of physical exercise for improvement in cancer survivors' quality of life.OBJECTIVE: Mediating mechanisms of a 12-week group-based exercise intervention on cancer survivors' quality of life (QoL) were examined to inform future exercise intervention development.METHODS: Two hundred nine cancer survivors >/= 3 months posttreatment (57% breast cancer) aged 49.5 (+/- 10.4) years were assigned to physical exercise (n = 147) or wait-list control (n = 62).QoL, fatigue, emotional distress, physical activity, general self-efficacy and mastery were assessed at baseline and post-intervention using questionnaires.Path analysis was conducted using Mplus to explore whether improved physical activity, general self-efficacy and mastery mediated the effects of exercise on fatigue and distress and consequently QoL. RESULTS: The intervention was associated with increased physical activity (beta = 0.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.14;0.59), general self-efficacy (beta = 2.41, 95%CI = 0.35;4.73), and mastery (beta = 1.75, 95%CI = 0.36;2.78).Further, the intervention had both a direct effect on fatigue (beta = -1.09, 95%CI = -2.12;0.01), and an indirect effect (beta = -0.54, 95%CI = -1.00;-0.21) via physical activity (beta = -0.29, 95%CI = -0.64;-0.07) and general self-efficacy (beta = -0.25, 95%CI = -0.61;-0.05).The intervention had a borderline significant direct effect on reduced distress (beta = -1.32, 95%CI = -2.68;0.11), and a significant indirect effect via increased general self-efficacy and mastery (beta = -1.06, 95%CI = -1.89;-0.38).Reductions in fatigue (beta = -1.33, 95%CI =-1.85;-0.83) and distress (beta = -0.86, 95%CI = -1.25;-0.52) were associated with improved QoL. Further, increased physical activity was directly associated with improved QoL (beta = 3.37, 95%CI = 1.01;5.54).CONCLUSION: The beneficial effect of group-based physical exercise on QoL was mediated by increased physical activity, general self-efficacy and mastery, and subsequent reductions in fatigue and distress.In addition to physical activity, future interventions should target self-efficacy and mastery.This may lead to reduced distress and fatigue, and consequently improved QoL of cancer survivors.",1,1,0,0

Part 2 assessed efficacy and safety of siltuximab plus M/P versus M/P alone.The primary end-point was progression-free survival (PFS).Progression was defined as progressive disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST), or >/= 3 new skeletal lesions with clinical deterioration or without deterioration confirmed by repeated bone scan.Rising prostate-specific antigen was not considered progression.RESULTS: Siltuximab plus M/P was well tolerated in Part 1 (n=9).In Part 2, 48 and 49 patients received siltuximab plus M/P or M/P alone, respectively.Enrolment was prematurely terminated by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee since an apparent imbalance in patient baseline characteristics (favoring the M/P only arm) made it unlikely that the study could achieve its primary efficacy end-point.Median PFS was 97 days with siltuximab combination and 228 days with M/P alone (hazard ratio, 1.72; P=0.043).Use of a novel non-validated PFS definition may have contributed to this result.Abnormal laboratory assessments were more frequent with the combination.Infection and febrile neutropenia rates were similar between groups.Greater C-reactive protein suppression was achieved during siltuximab combination treatment compared with M/P alone (P=0.0003).CONCLUSION: While siltuximab plus M/P appeared well tolerated, improvement in outcomes was not demonstrated.",0,0,0,0
23657629,"Activation, dysfunction and retention of T cells in vaccine sites after injection of incomplete Freund's adjuvant, with or without peptide.We conducted a randomized clinical trial in 45 patients with resected AJCC stage IIB-IV melanoma to characterize cellular and molecular events at sites of immunization with incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) alone, or a melanoma vaccine in IFA.At a primary vaccine site, all patients received a multi-peptide melanoma vaccine in IFA.At a replicate vaccine site, which was biopsied, group 1 received IFA only; group 2 received vaccine in IFA.Lymphocytes isolated from replicate vaccine site microenvironments (VSME) were compared to time-matched peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in ELISpot and flow cytometry assays.Compared to PBMC, the VSME had fewer naive and greater proportions of effector memory CD8(+) T cells (TCD8).The vast majority of TCD8 within the VSME were activated (CD69(+)), with a concentration of antigen-specific (tetramer(pos)) cells in the VSME, particularly in vaccine sites with peptide (group 2).CXCR3(+) lymphocytes were concentrated in the VSME of all patients, suggesting IFA-induced chemokine recruitment.TCD8 expression of retention integrins alphaEbeta7 and alpha1beta1 was elevated in VSME, with the highest levels observed in antigen-specific cells in VSME containing peptide (group 2).TCD8 retained in the VSME of both groups were strikingly dysfunctional, with minimal IFN-gamma production in response to peptide stimulation and few tetramer(pos) cells producing IFN-gamma.These data suggest that vaccine-induced selective retention and dysfunction of antigen-specific TCD8 within VSME may represent a significant mechanism underlying transient immune responses and low clinical response rates to peptide vaccines administered in IFA.",0,0,0,0
24323034,"Targeted androgen pathway suppression in localized prostate cancer: a pilot study.PURPOSE: Ligand-mediated activation of the androgen receptor (AR) is critical for prostate cancer (PCa) survival and proliferation.The failure to completely ablate tissue androgens may limit suppression of PCa growth.We evaluated combinations of CYP17A and 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors for reducing prostate androgen levels, AR signaling, and PCa volumes.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-five men with intermediate/high-risk clinically localized PCa were randomly assigned to goserelin combined with dutasteride (ZD), bicalutamide and dutasteride (ZBD), or bicalutamide, dutasteride, and ketoconazole (ZBDK) for 3 months before prostatectomy.Controls included patients receiving combined androgen blockade with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist and bicalutamide.The primary outcome measure was tissue dihydrotestosterone (DHT) concentration.RESULTS: Prostate DHT levels were substantially lower in all experimental arms (0.02 to 0.04 ng/g v 0.92 ng/g in controls; P < .001).The ZBDK group demonstrated the greatest percentage decline in serum testosterone, androsterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (P < .05 for all).Staining for AR and the androgen-regulated genes prostate-specific antigen and TMPRSS2 was strongly suppressed in benign glands and moderately in malignant glands (P < .05 for all).Two patients had pathologic complete response, and nine had </= 0.2 cm(3) of residual tumor (defined as a near-complete response), with the largest numbers of complete and near-complete responses in the ZBDK group.CONCLUSION: Addition of androgen synthesis inhibitors lowers prostate androgens below that achieved with standard therapy, but significant AR signaling remains.Tissue-based analysis of steroids and AR signaling is critical to informing the search for optimal local and systemic control of high-risk prostate cancer.",1,1,1,1

24105750,"A randomized study of interferon alpha-2b versus no treatment as consolidation after high dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation for patients with relapsed lymphoma.Patients with lymphoma who have experienced a first relapse or progression and have disease deemed sensitive to salvage chemotherapy nevertheless have a high likelihood of having a second relapse.To decrease the likelihood of a second relapse after high-dose therapy (HDT) and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT), interferon (IFN) alpha-2b was given in a prospective randomized international trial.Methods.In this trial, 221 patients with varying histologic diagnoses (8 small lymphocytic, 37 follicular, 9 mantle, 90 diffuse large B-cell, 20 peripheral T-cell, 3 high-grade B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and 54 Hodgkin lymphoma) were randomly assigned to receive no further treatment (arm A: 117 patients) or IFNalpha-2b, 3 MU three times weekly, for 18 months (arm B: 104 patients).Results.In arm B, 21 patients (20%) did not receive IFNalpha-2b because of early progression or absence of hematologic recovery, 29 patients (28%) completed the 18 months of treatment, and 54 patients (52%) interrupted treatment because of progression (23%) or toxicity (29%).Event-free survival and overall survival were not different between the two arms on an intent-to-treat analysis and also if analysis was restricted to patients who were alive and had not experienced disease progression three months after transplantation.The study was not sufficiently powered to evaluate effects in histologic subtypes.Conclusion.In this trial, post-autograft IFNalpha-2b did not improve outcomes in a heterogeneous group of patients with lymphoma.",1,1,1,1
23415048,"A prospective trial of real-time magnetic resonance-guided catheter placement in interstitial gynecologic brachytherapy.PURPOSE: To present outcome and toxicity results of the first real-time intraoperative MRI-guided interstitial approach to gynecologic cancer.METHODS AND MATERIALS: From February 2004 to December 2006, 25 patients with gynecologic malignancies were enrolled and treated in a prospective clinical trial of real-time MRI-guided interstitial brachytherapy.This was followed by a confirmatory CT imaging scan.Statistical analyses included Kaplan-Meier estimates for overall and relapse-free survival.RESULTS: MRI visualization of needles during placement permitted accurate placement with no inadvertent insertions.This prevented unnecessary normal-tissue perforation as confirmed by CT simulation.With a mean followup of 3.8 years (range, 2-6.8), 1-, 2-, and 3-year overall survival rates were 80%, 60% and 43%, respectively; corresponding relapse-free survival rates were 79%, 65%, and 59%, respectively.Actuarial acute toxicity rates for any grade were 0% at 0-14 days and 80% (all grade 1) at 14-90 days.Long-term (>180 days) actuarial toxicity rates were 8% gastrointestinal, 4% bladder and 4% vaginal.CONCLUSIONS: Real-time MRI guidance during insertion of interstitial needles followed by 3D-planning maximized opportunities for tumor targeting and sparing of normal tissues.Although image guidance requires additional anesthesia time, clinical outcomes indicate potential for a successful reduction in toxicity using 3D image-guided in addition to 3D image-planned brachytherapy.",0,0,0,0
23053638,"A randomized phase II trial of platinum salts in basal-like breast cancer patients in the neoadjuvant setting. Results from the GEICAM/2006-03, multicenter study.Chemotherapy remains as the only systemic treatment option available for basal-like breast cancer (BC) patients.Preclinical models and several phase II studies suggested that platinum salts are active drugs in this BC subtype though there is no randomized study supporting this hypothesis.This study investigates if the addition of carboplatin to a combination of an alkylating agent together with anthracyclines and taxanes is able to increase the efficacy in the neoadjuvant treatment context.Patients with operable breast cancer and immunophenotypically defined basal-like disease (ER-/PR-/HER2- and cytokeratin 5/6+ or EGFR+) were recruited.Patients were randomized to receive EC (epirubicin 90 mg/m(2) plus cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2) for 4 cycles) followed either by D (docetaxel 100 mg/m(2) x 4 cycles; EC-D) or DCb (docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) plus carboplatin AUC 6 x 4 cycles; EC-DCb).The primary end point was pathological complete response (pCR) in the breast following the Miller and Payne criteria.Ninety-four patients were randomized (46 EC-D, 48 EC-DCb).pCR rate in the breast was seen in 16 patients (35 %) with EC-D and 14 patients (30 %) with EC-DCb (P value = 0.61).pCR in the breast and axilla was seen in 30 % of patients in both arms.The overall clinical response rate was 70 % (95 % CI 56-83) in the EC-D arm and 77 % (95 % CI 65-87) in the EC-DCb arm.Grade 3/4 toxicity was similar in both arms.The addition of carboplatin to conventional chemotherapy with EC-D in basal-like breast cancer patients did not improve the efficacy probably because they had already received an alkylating agent.These findings should be taken into consideration when developing new agents for this disease.",1,1,1,1
24158787,"Everolimus plus exemestane in postmenopausal patients with HR(+) breast cancer: BOLERO-2 final progression-free survival analysis.INTRODUCTION: Effective treatments for hormone-receptor-positive (HR(+)) breast cancer (BC) following relapse/progression on nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI) therapy are needed.Initial Breast Cancer Trials of OraL EveROlimus-2 (BOLERO-2) trial data demonstrated that everolimus and exemestane significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) versus placebo plus exemestane alone in this patient population.METHODS: BOLERO-2 is a phase 3, double-blind, randomized, international trial comparing everolimus (10 mg/day) plus exemestane (25 mg/day) versus placebo plus exemestane in postmenopausal women with HR(+) advanced BC with recurrence/progression during or after NSAIs.The primary endpoint was PFS by local investigator review, and was confirmed by independent central radiology review.Overall survival, response rate, and clinical benefit rate were secondary endpoints.RESULTS: Final study results with median 18-month follow-up show that median PFS remained significantly longer with everolimus plus exemestane versus placebo plus exemestane [investigator review: 7.8 versus 3.2 months, respectively; hazard ratio = 0.45 (95% confidence interval 0.38-0.54); log-rank P < 0.0001; central review: 11.0 versus 4.1 months, respectively; hazard ratio = 0.38 (95% confidence interval 0.31-0.48); log-rank P < 0.0001] in the overall population and in all prospectively defined subgroups, including patients with visceral metastases, [corrected] and irrespective of age.The incidence and severity of adverse events were consistent with those reported at the interim analysis and in other everolimus trials.CONCLUSION: The addition of everolimus to exemestane markedly prolonged PFS in patients with HR(+) advanced BC with disease recurrence/progression following prior NSAIs.These results further support the use of everolimus plus exemestane in this patient population.ClinicalTrials.gov #NCT00863655.",1,1,1,1

22321061,"Effects of exemestane and tamoxifen on hormone levels within the Tamoxifen Exemestane Adjuvant Multicentre (TEAM) trial: results of a German substudy.AIM: The aim of this study was to compare the effects of exemestane and tamoxifen on hormone levels in postmenopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer within a Germany substudy of the Tamoxifen Exemestane Adjuvant Multinational (TEAM) trial.METHODS: Within the TEAM trial, patients were randomized to receive adjuvant treatment with exemestane for 5 years or tamoxifen for 2.5-3 years followed by exemestane for 2-2.5 years.Serum levels of testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and parathyroid hormone (PTH)-intact were measured at screening and after 3, 6 and 12 months of treatment.RESULTS: Data on hormone levels were available from 63 patients in the tamoxifen arm and 68 patients in the exemestane arm.Treatment with exemestane resulted in decreases from baseline in SHBG and PTH-intact levels, and increases from baseline in testosterone, DHEAS and FSH levels.Tamoxifen treatment resulted in increases from baseline in SHBG and PTH-intact, whereas levels of testosterone and FSH decreased and DHEAS levels did not change.At all time points assessed, the absolute change from baseline was significantly different between tamoxifen and exemestane for testosterone, SHBG, FSH and PTH-intact (all p < 0.0001).CONCLUSIONS: Exemestane and tamoxifen had statistically significantly different effects on hormone levels, including testosterone, SHBG, FSH and PTH-intact.",1,1,1,1
23233657,"High cereblon expression is associated with better survival in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma treated with thalidomide maintenance.Recently, cereblon (CRBN) expression was found to be essential for the activity of thalidomide and lenalidomide.In the present study, we investigated whether the clinical efficacy of thalidomide in multiple myeloma is associated with CRBN expression in myeloma cells.Patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma were included in the HOVON-65/GMMG-HD4 trial, in which postintensification treatment in 1 arm consisted of daily thalidomide (50 mg) for 2 years.Gene-expression profiling, determined at the start of the trial, was available for 96 patients who started thalidomide maintenance.In this patient set, increase of CRBN gene expression was significantly associated with longerprogression-free survival (P = .005).In contrast, no association between CRBN expression and survival was observed in the arm with bortezomib maintenance.We conclude that CRBN expression may be associated with the clinical efficacy of thalidomide.This trial has been registered at the Nederlands Trial Register (www.trialregister.nl) as NTR213; at the European Union Drug Regulating Authorities Clinical Trials (EudraCT) as 2004-000944-26; and at the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) as 64455289.",1,1,1,1

25239225,"Trabectedin as a single-agent treatment of advanced breast cancer after anthracycline and taxane treatment: a multicenter, randomized, phase II study comparing 2 administration regimens.BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of trabectedin for advanced breast cancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In an open-label, phase II, multicenter study, women with advanced breast cancer previously treated with </= 2 lines of chemotherapy for advanced disease, including both anthracyclines and taxanes, were randomized (1:1) to 3-hour infusions of trabectedin 1.3 mg/m(2) once every 3 weeks (1/3 treatment arm) or 0.58 mg/m(2) every week for 3 of 4 weeks (3/4 treatment arm).The primary end point was objective response.Secondary end points included time to progression (TTP), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).RESULTS: Fifty-two women (median age, 50 years; median chemotherapy agents, 4) were enrolled.Relative trabectedin dose intensities were 81% and 76% in the 1/3 and 3/4 treatment arms, respectively.Objective response rates were 12% (3 of 25) and 4% (1 of 27), respectively.Stable disease was observed in 14 (56%) and 11 (41%) patients in the 1/3 and 3/4 treatment arms, respectively, with median durations of 3.5 and 3.7 months.Median TTP and PFS were higher in the 1/3 treatment arm (3.1 months each) than in the 3/4 treatment arm (2.0 months each).At a median follow-up of 7 months in both treatment arms, median OS was not reached in the 1/3 treatment arm and was 9.4 months in the 3/4 treatment arm.The most frequent drug-related adverse events in the 1/3 and 3/4 treatment arms, respectively, were alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level increases (68% vs. 63%), nausea (56% vs. 59%), and asthenia (56% vs. 48%).Neutropenia and increases in ALT levels were the most frequent grade 3/4 events.Both types of events were usually transient and reversible.CONCLUSION: In the population studied, trabectedin showed a manageable safety profile for both regimens analyzed.There were higher objective response rates and a longer PFS in the 1/3 treatment arm compared with the 3/4 treatment arm.",0,0,0,0
23053638,"A randomized phase II trial of platinum salts in basal-like breast cancer patients in the neoadjuvant setting. Results from the GEICAM/2006-03, multicenter study.Chemotherapy remains as the only systemic treatment option available for basal-like breast cancer (BC) patients.Preclinical models and several phase II studies suggested that platinum salts are active drugs in this BC subtype though there is no randomized study supporting this hypothesis.This study investigates if the addition of carboplatin to a combination of an alkylating agent together with anthracyclines and taxanes is able to increase the efficacy in the neoadjuvant treatment context.Patients with operable breast cancer and immunophenotypically defined basal-like disease (ER-/PR-/HER2- and cytokeratin 5/6+ or EGFR+) were recruited.Patients were randomized to receive EC (epirubicin 90 mg/m(2) plus cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2) for 4 cycles) followed either by D (docetaxel 100 mg/m(2) x 4 cycles; EC-D) or DCb (docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) plus carboplatin AUC 6 x 4 cycles; EC-DCb).The primary end point was pathological complete response (pCR) in the breast following the Miller and Payne criteria.Ninety-four patients were randomized (46 EC-D, 48 EC-DCb).pCR rate in the breast was seen in 16 patients (35 %) with EC-D and 14 patients (30 %) with EC-DCb (P value = 0.61).pCR in the breast and axilla was seen in 30 % of patients in both arms.The overall clinical response rate was 70 % (95 % CI 56-83) in the EC-D arm and 77 % (95 % CI 65-87) in the EC-DCb arm.Grade 3/4 toxicity was similar in both arms.The addition of carboplatin to conventional chemotherapy with EC-D in basal-like breast cancer patients did not improve the efficacy probably because they had already received an alkylating agent.These findings should be taken into consideration when developing new agents for this disease.",1,1,1,1
25738668,"Goserelin for ovarian protection during breast-cancer adjuvant chemotherapy.BACKGROUND: Ovarian failure is a common toxic effect of chemotherapy.Studies of the use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists to protect ovarian function have shown mixed results and lack data on pregnancy outcomes.METHODS: We randomly assigned 257 premenopausal women with operable hormone-receptor-negative breast cancer to receive standard chemotherapy with the GnRH agonist goserelin (goserelin group) or standard chemotherapy without goserelin (chemotherapy-alone group).The primary study end point was the rate of ovarian failure at 2 years, with ovarian failure defined as the absence of menses in the preceding 6 months and levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in the postmenopausal range.Rates were compared with the use of conditional logistic regression.Secondary end points included pregnancy outcomes and disease-free and overall survival.RESULTS: At baseline, 218 patients were eligible and could be evaluated.Among 135 with complete primary end-point data, the ovarian failure rate was 8% in the goserelin group and 22% in the chemotherapy-alone group (odds ratio, 0.30; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.09 to 0.97; two-sided P=0.04).Owing to missing primary end-point data, sensitivity analyses were performed, and the results were consistent with the main findings.Missing data did not differ according to treatment group or according to the stratification factors of age and planned chemotherapy regimen.Among the 218 patients who could be evaluated, pregnancy occurred in more women in the goserelin group than in the chemotherapy-alone group (21% vs. 11%, P=0.03); women in the goserelin group also had improved disease-free survival (P=0.04) and overall survival (P=0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Although missing data weaken interpretation of the findings, administration of goserelin with chemotherapy appeared to protect against ovarian failure, reducing the risk of early menopause and improving prospects for fertility.(Funded by the National Cancer Institute and others; POEMS/S0230 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00068601.).",0,0,0,0
25038874,"HER2 screening data from ToGA: targeting HER2 in gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancer.BACKGROUND: In the Trastuzumab for GAstric cancer (ToGA) study, trastuzumab plus chemotherapy improved median overall survival by 2.7 months in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive [immunohistochemistry (IHC) 3+/fluorescence in situ hybridization-positive] gastric/gastroesophageal junction cancer compared with chemotherapy alone (hazard ratio 0.74).Post hoc exploratory analyses in patients expressing higher HER2 levels (IHC 2+/fluorescence in situ hybridization-positive or IHC 3+) demonstrated a 4.2-month improvement in median overall survival with trastuzumab (hazard ratio 0.65).The ToGA study provides the largest screening dataset available on HER2 overexpression/amplification in this indication.We further analyzed correlation(s) of HER2 overexpression/amplification with clinical and epidemiological factors.METHODS: HER2-positivity was analyzed by histological subtype, tumor location, geographic region, and specimen type.Exploratory efficacy analyses were performed.RESULTS: The HER2-positivity rate was 22.1 % across analyzed tumor samples.Rates were similar between European and Asian patients (23.6 % vs. 23.9 %), but higher in intestinal- vs. diffuse-type (31.8 % vs. 6.1 %), and gastroesophageal junction cancer versus gastric tumors (32.2 % vs. 21.4 %).Across all IHC scores, variability in HER2 staining (</=30 % stained cells) was observed in almost 50 % of cases, with increasing rates in lower IHC categories, and did not affect treatment outcome.The polysomy rate was 4 %.CONCLUSIONS: HER2 expression varies by tumor location and type.All patients with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer should be tested for HER2 status, preferably using IHC initially.Due to the unique characteristics of gastric cancer, specific testing/scoring guidelines should be adhered to.",0,0,0,0
23281805,"Randomized Phase II trial of paclitaxel and carboplatin followed by gemcitabine switch-maintenance therapy versus gemcitabine and carboplatin followed by gemcitabine continuation-maintenance therapy in previously untreated advanced non-small cell lung cancer.BACKGROUND: In recent years, maintenance chemotherapy is increasingly being recognized as a new treatment strategy to improve the outcome of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).However, the optimal maintenance strategy is still controversial.Gemcitabine is a promising candidate for single-agent maintenance therapy because of little toxicity and good tolerability.We have conducted a randomized phase II study to evaluate the validity of single-agent maintenance chemotherapy of gemcitabine and to compare continuation- and switch-maintenance.METHODS: Chemonaive patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC were randomly assigned 1:1 to either arm A or B. Patients received paclitaxel (200 mg/m2, day 1) plus carboplatin (AUC 6 mg/mL/min, day 1) every 3 weeks in arm A, or gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2, days 1 and 8) plus carboplatin (AUC 5 mg/mL/min, day1) every 3 weeks in arm B. Non-progressive patients following 3 cycles of induction chemotherapy received maintenance gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2, days 1 and 8) every 3 weeks.( TRIAL REGISTRATION: UMIN000008252)RESULTS: The study was stopped because of delayed accrual at interim analysis.Of the randomly assigned 50 patients, 49 except for one in arm B were evaluable.Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 4.6 months for arm A vs. 3.5 months for arm B (HR = 1.03; 95% CI, 0.45-2.27; p = 0.95) and median overall survival (OS) was 15.0 months for arm A vs. 14.8 months for arm B (HR = 0.79; 95% CI, 0.40-1.51; p = 0.60), showing no difference between the two arms.The response rate, disease control rate, and the transit rate to maintenance phase were 36.0% (9/25), 64.0% (16/25), and 48% (12/25) for arm A vs. 16.7% (4/24), 50.0% (12/24), and 33% (8/24) for arm B, which were also statistically similar between the two arms (p = 0.13, p = 0.32, and p = 0.30, respectively).Both induction regimens were tolerable, except that more patients experienced peripheral neuropathy in arm A. Toxicities during the maintenance phase were also minimal.CONCLUSION: Survival and overall response were not significantly different between the two arms.Gemcitabine may be well-tolerable and feasible for maintenance therapy.",1,1,1,1
23732774,"Equal efficacy of endoscopic and surgical cystogastrostomy for pancreatic pseudocyst drainage in a randomized trial.BACKGROUND & AIMS: Although surgery is the standard technique for drainage of pancreatic pseudocysts, use of endoscopic methods is increasing.We performed a single-center, open-label, randomized trial to compare endoscopic and surgical cystogastrostomy for pancreatic pseudocyst drainage.METHODS: Patients with pancreatic pseudocysts underwent endoscopic (n = 20) or surgical cystogastrostomy (n = 20).The primary end point was pseudocyst recurrence after a 24-month follow-up period.Secondary end points were treatment success or failure, complications, re-interventions, length of hospital stay, physical and mental health scores, and total costs.RESULTS: At the end of the follow-up period, none of the patients who received endoscopic therapy had a pseudocyst recurrence, compared with 1 patient treated surgically.There were no differences in treatment successes, complications, or re-interventions between the groups.However, the length of hospital stay was shorter for patients who underwent endoscopic cystogastrostomy (median, 2 days, vs 6 days in the surgery group; P < .001).Although there were no differences in physical component scores and mental health component scores (MCS) between groups at baseline on the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form General Survey questionnaire, longitudinal analysis showed significantly better physical component scores (P = .019) and mental health component scores (P = .025) for the endoscopy treatment group.The total mean cost was lower for patients managed by endoscopy than surgery ($7011 vs $15,052; P = .003).CONCLUSIONS: In a randomized trial comparing endoscopic and surgical cystogastrostomy for pancreatic pseudocyst drainage, none of the patients in the endoscopy group had pseudocyst recurrence during the follow-up period, therefore there is no evidence that surgical cystogastrostomy is superior.However, endoscopic treatment was associated with shorter hospital stays, better physical and mental health of patients, and lower cost.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00826501.",0,0,0,0

23871490,"2 years versus 1 year of adjuvant trastuzumab for HER2-positive breast cancer (HERA): an open-label, randomised controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Trastuzumab has established efficacy against breast cancer with overexpression or amplification of the HER2 oncogene.The standard of care is 1 year of adjuvant trastuzumab, but the optimum duration of treatment is unknown.We compared 2 years of treatment with trastuzumab with 1 year of treatment, and updated the comparison of 1 year of trastuzumab versus observation at a median follow-up of 8 years, for patients enrolled in the HERceptin Adjuvant (HERA) trial.METHODS: The HERA trial is an international, multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial comparing treatment with trastuzumab for 1 and 2 years with observation after standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy, adjuvant chemotherapy, or both in 5102 patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer.The primary endpoint was disease-free survival.The comparison of 2 years versus 1 year of trastuzumab treatment involved a landmark analysis of 3105 patients who were disease-free 12 months after randomisation to one of the trastuzumab groups, and was planned after observing at least 725 disease-free survival events.The updated intention-to-treat comparison of 1 year trastuzumab treatment versus observation alone in 3399 patients at a median follow-up of 8 years (range 0-10) is also reported.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00045032.FINDINGS: We recorded 367 events of disease-free survival in 1552 patients in the 1 year group and 367 events in 1553 patients in the 2 year group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.99, 95% CI 0.85-1.14, p=0.86).Grade 3-4 adverse events and decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction during treatment were reported more frequently in the 2 year treatment group than in the 1 year group (342 [20.4%] vs 275 [16.3%] grade 3-4 adverse events, and 120 [7.2%] vs 69 [4.1%] decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction, respectively).HRs for a comparison of 1 year of trastuzumab treatment versus observation were 0.76 (95% CI 0.67-0.86, p<0.0001) for disease-free survival and 0.76 (0.65-0.88, p=0.0005) for overall survival, despite crossover of 884 (52%) patients from the observation group to trastuzumab therapy.INTERPRETATION: 2 years of adjuvant trastuzumab is not more effective than is 1 year of treatment for patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer.1 year of treatment provides a significant disease-free and overall survival benefit compared with observation and remains the standard of care.FUNDING: F Hoffmann-La Roche (Roche).",1,1,1,1
22552048,"Efficacy of docetaxel-based chemotherapy following ketoconazole in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: implications for prior therapy in clinical trials.OBJECTIVES: Abiraterone acetate (AA) is a CYP17 inhibitor of androgen synthesis approved for use following docetaxel for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC); evaluation in the pre-docetaxel setting is ongoing.Given that the reported efficacy of AA is lower following docetaxel vs. pre-docetaxel, the potential exists for cross resistance given docetaxel's partly androgen receptor targeting activity.The efficacy of docetaxel following ketoconazole (KC), a weaker and nonspecific inhibitor of CYP17, may provide some insights into this potential interaction.We retrospectively evaluated the efficacy of every 3-week docetaxel with prednisone (DP) in mCRPC previously exposed to KC compared to KC-naive patients.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A randomized phase II trial of men with mCRPC treated with DP + AT-101 (bcl-2 inhibitor) vs. DP plus placebo was analyzed.Both arms were combined for analysis as no significant differences were seen.Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective response (ORR), pain, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rates were estimated with and without prior KC.Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate the effect of covariates on OS.RESULTS: Of 220 evaluable men, 40 (18.2%) received prior KC.The median OS with DP-based therapy of KC-naive patients (18.3 months, 95% CI: 15.0, 24.5) and post-KC patients (17.0 months, 95% CI: 9.9, 20.4) was not statistically different (P = 0.20).After controlling for prognostic classifications, analyses demonstrated consistent trends for worsening of OS after KC, with (hazard ratios (HRs) 1.33-1.46.Similar unfavorable trends were observed for ORR, PSA declines, and PFS.CONCLUSIONS: In this hypothesis-generating analysis, patients treated with docetaxel-based chemotherapy following prior KC had numerically and consistently worse outcomes than patients not exposed to prior KC.Although the estimated differences did not attain statistical significance, evaluation of outcomes with docetaxel in particular, and all classes of novel and emerging agents following AA, is of clinical importance, given its more potent androgen synthesis inhibition compared with KC.Drug development should take into account the potential impact of previous therapy.",0,0,0,0
24141008,"Improved survival with ursodeoxycholic acid prophylaxis in allogeneic stem cell transplantation: long-term follow-up of a randomized study.We report the long-term results of a prospective randomized study on the use of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) for prevention of hepatic complications after allogeneic stem cell transplantation.Two hundred forty-two patients, 232 with malignant disease, were randomized to receive (n = 123) or not to receive (n = 119) UDCA from the beginning of the conditioning until 90 days post-transplantation.The results were reported after 1-year follow-up.UDCA administration reduced significantly the proportion of patients developing high serum bilirubin levels as well as the incidence of severe acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), liver GVHD, and intestinal GVHD.In the UDCA prophylaxis group, nonrelapse mortality (NRM) was lower and overall survival better than in the control group.After a 10-year follow-up, the difference in the survival and NRM in favor of the UDCA-treated group, seen at 1 year, was maintained (survival 48% versus 38%, P = .037; NRM 28% versus 41%, P = .01).A landmark analysis in patients surviving at 1 year post-transplantation showed no significant differences between the study groups in the long-term follow-up in chronic GVHD, relapse rate, NRM, disease-free survival, or overall survival.These long-term results continue to support the useful role of UDCA in the prevention of transplant-related complications in allogeneic transplantation.",1,1,1,1

A prespecified interim analysis demonstrated an improvement in OS favoring the abiraterone acetate arm [HR, 0.79 (95% CI, 0.66-0.96)] but did not cross the O'Brien-Fleming boundary for statistical significance.Safety data confirmed the known adverse reaction profile of abiraterone acetate.Full approval was granted on the basis of a large magnitude of effect on rPFS, a favorable trend in OS, and internal consistency across multiple secondary endpoints and exploratory patient-reported pain data.This is the first drug approval for mCRPC to use rPFS as the primary endpoint.Importantly, this approval was granted in the context of a prior statistically significant OS benefit that formed the basis of the original April 28, 2011, approval of abiraterone acetate for patients with mCRPC who had received prior chemotherapy containing docetaxel.",0,0,0,0
24081946,"Randomized multicenter phase II trial comparing two schedules of etirinotecan pegol (NKTR-102) in women with recurrent platinum-resistant/refractory epithelial ovarian cancer.PURPOSE: Etirinotecan pegol (NKTR-102) is a unique, long-acting topoisomerase-I inhibitor with prolonged systemic exposure to SN38 (7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin), the active metabolite of irinotecan.This randomized phase II trial investigated two dosing schedules of etirinotecan pegol in patients with platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian carcinoma.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 71 eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive etirinotecan pegol 145 mg/m(2) every 14 or 21 days until progression or unacceptable adverse events (AEs).The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR) by RECIST (version 1.0).Secondary end points included response by Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup criteria, duration of ORR, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).RESULTS: The overall confirmed ORR was 20% (95% CI, 10% to 30%): 20% for once every 14 days, and 19% for once every 21 days.Median response duration was 4.1 months for once every 14 days and 4.0 months for once every 21 days.Median PFS for every 14 and every 21 days was 4.1 and 5.3 months, respectively, and median OS was 10.0 and 11.7 months, respectively.Etirinotecan pegol was well tolerated, with the most common grade 3 to 4 AEs being dehydration (24%) and diarrhea (23%).Diarrhea, dehydration, nausea, and neutropenia were less frequent with the schedule of once every 21 days than with that of once every 14 days.CONCLUSION: Both schedules of etirinotecan pegol showed activity in patients with heavily pretreated ovarian cancer, with encouraging ORR and PFS rates.The schedule of once every 21 days was better tolerated and had slightly longer PFS and OS rates.The treatment schedule of etirinotecan pegol 145 mg/m(2) once every 21 days was selected for the expanded phase II study and is preferred for future phase III studies.These findings provide support to directly compare etirinotecan pegol versus one of the approved drugs (eg, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or topotecan) in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.",1,1,1,1
23008288,"Association between circulating tumor cells and prognosis in patients with stage III melanoma with sentinel lymph node metastasis in a phase III international multicenter trial.PURPOSE: The outcomes of patients with melanoma who have sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastases can be highly variable, which has precluded establishment of consensus regarding treatment of the group.The detection of high-risk patients from this clinical setting may be helpful for determination of both prognosis and management.We report the utility of multimarker reverse-transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) detection of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in patients with melanoma diagnosed with SLN metastases in a phase III, international, multicenter clinical trial.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Blood specimens were collected from patients with melanoma (n = 331) who were clinically disease-free after complete lymphadenectomy (CLND) before entering onto a randomized adjuvant melanoma vaccine plus bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) versus BCG placebo trial from 30 melanoma centers (United States and international).Blood was assessed using a verified multimarker RT-qPCR assay (MART-1, MAGE-A3, and GalNAc-T) of melanoma-associated proteins.Cox regression analyses were used to evaluate the prognostic significance of CTC status for disease recurrence and melanoma-specific survival (MSS).RESULTS: Individual CTC biomarker detection ranged from 13.4% to 17.5%.There was no association of CTC status (zero to one positive biomarkers v two or more positive biomarkers) with known clinical or pathologic prognostic variables.However, two or more positive biomarkers was significantly associated with worse distant metastasis disease-free survival (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.13, P = .009) and reduced recurrence-free survival (HR = 1.70, P = .046) and MSS (HR = 1.88, P = .043) in a multivariable analysis.CONCLUSION: CTC biomarker status is a prognostic factor for recurrence-free survival, distant metastasis disease-free survival, and MSS after CLND in patients with SLN metastasis.This multimarker RT-qPCR analysis may therefore be useful in discriminating patients who may benefit from aggressive adjuvant therapy or stratifying patients for adjuvant clinical trials.",0,0,0,0
23532629,"Erythropoietin treatment in chemotherapy-induced anemia in previously untreated advanced esophagogastric cancer patients.BACKGROUND: The impact of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents in chemotherapy-induced anemia has been a constant topic of debate over recent years.We prospectively assessed the efficacy of epoetin beta (Epo-b) in improving hemoglobin (Hb) levels and outcome in patients within an open label, randomized clinical phase II trial with advanced or metastatic gastric/esophagogastric cancer.METHODS: Previously untreated patients were randomized to receive 3-weekly cycles of capecitabine (1000 mg/m(2) bid) for 14 days plus on day 1 either irinotecan 250 mg/m(2) or cisplatin 80 mg/m(2).Epo-b (30000 IU once weekly) was initiated in patients with Hb <11 g/dl and continued until Hb >/=12 g/dl was reached.If after 4 weeks the Hb increase was <0.5 g/dl, Epo-b was increased to 30000 IU, twice weekly.RESULTS: Of 118 patients enrolled, 32 received Epo-b treatment; of these, 65 % achieved an increase in Hb levels of at least 2 g/dl, with 74 % achieving the target Hb of >/=12 g/dl.Within the study population, patients receiving Epo-b showed better overall survival (median 14.5 vs. 8.0 months, P = 0.056) as well as a significantly improved disease control rate (78 vs. 55 %, P = 0.025).Patients in the irinotecan group profited significantly (P < 0.05) in terms of progression-free survival and overall survival under Epo-b treatment (median 6.5 vs 4.1 months and median 15.4 vs 8.4 months, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: Epo-b was effective in raising Hb levels in patients with advanced esophagogastric cancer.Patients receiving Epo-b had a significantly increased response to chemotherapy and a clear trend to improved survival.",1,1,1,1

25547902,"Intercalated Dosing Schedule of Erlotinib and Docetaxel as a Therapeutic Strategy to Avoid Antagonism and Optimize Its Benefits in Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer. A Randomized Phase II Clinical Trial.INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to assess whether an intercalated dosing schedule of erlotinib and docetaxel could avoid possible negative interactions and optimize the benefit obtained as second-line therapy in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A phase II randomized clinical trial was designed for advanced NSCLC patients in whom previous chemotherapy treatment had failed.The experimental arm with 33 patients consisted of erlotinib 150 mg/d orally, intermittent administration on days 2 to 16 every 21 days, combined with docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) every 21 days; the control arm with 35 patients consisted of erlotinib 150 mg/d orally, administered continuously.The study's primary end point was the proportion of patients who remained progression-free at 6 months in the 2 arms.RESULTS: The proportion of patients who remained progression-free at 6 months was of 5 patients (15%) in the intercalated arm and 3 patients (9%) in the erlotinib monotherapy arm respectively.Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 3.0 versus 2.1 months (hazard ratio [HR], 0.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.39-1.06; P = .086).Median overall survival (OS) was 7.5 and 5.2 months (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.41-1.19; P = .19).Disease control rates were 51.7% and 36.4%, respectively.No new safety signals were observed.CONCLUSION: Erlotinib and docetaxel with intermittent administration of erlotinib improved PFS, OS, and disease control rates compared with erlotinib alone.All of our results indicated that an intercalated dosing schedule of erlotinib and docetaxel could be more efficient than erlotinib treatment alone.Therefore, further studies should be developed in a larger number of patients.This study has shown the absence of antagonism between docetaxel and erlotinib when given in an intercalated fashion.",0,0,0,0
24241787,"Circulating hormones and breast cancer risk in premenopausal women: a randomized trial of low-dose tamoxifen and fenretinide.Tamoxifen and fenretinide have been extensively studied and exhibit breast cancer-preventing activity.We aimed to assess their effect on sex hormones, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and retinol, and their association with mammographic density (MD) and breast cancer events.In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, premenopausal women at risk for breast cancer were randomized to tamoxifen 5 mg/day, fenretinide, both agents, or placebo for 2 years.We measured MD and circulating concentrations of follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol, progesterone, testosterone, androstenedione, dehydro-epiandrosteronesulfate, prolactin, SHBG, and retinol at baseline and on yearly intervals.The associations with breast cancer events were evaluated through competing risk and Cox regression survival models.Low-dose tamoxifen markedly and enduringly increased SHBG, whereas the increases in testosterone, estradiol, and prolactin and reduction in LH weakened after 1 year.Fenretinide increased testosterone and androstenedione and decreased retinol.MD correlated directly with SHBG and inversely with retinol.After a median follow-up of 12 years, the 10-year cumulative incidence of breast cancer events was 37 % in women with SHBG </= 59.3 nmol/L, 22 % in women with SHBG between 59.3 and 101 nmol/L, and 19 % in women with SHBG > 101 nmol/L (P = 0.018).The difference among SHBG tertiles remained statistically significant at multivariable analysis: HR = 2.26 (95 % CI 1.04, 4.89) for the lowest versus the highest tertile.We conclude that low-dose tamoxifen or fenretinide exhibits favorable hormonal profiles as single agents, further supporting their administration for prevention of breast cancer in premenopause.Notably, SHBG levels were inversely associated with breast neoplastic events.",1,1,0,0
24881631,"Ibrutinib versus ofatumumab in previously treated chronic lymphoid leukemia.BACKGROUND: In patients with chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), a short duration of response to therapy or adverse cytogenetic abnormalities are associated with a poor outcome.We evaluated the efficacy of ibrutinib, a covalent inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase, in patients at risk for a poor outcome.METHODS: In this multicenter, open-label, phase 3 study, we randomly assigned 391 patients with relapsed or refractory CLL or SLL to receive daily ibrutinib or the anti-CD20 antibody ofatumumab.The primary end point was the duration of progression-free survival, with the duration of overall survival and the overall response rate as secondary end points.RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 9.4 months, ibrutinib significantly improved progression-free survival; the median duration was not reached in the ibrutinib group (with a rate of progression-free survival of 88% at 6 months), as compared with a median of 8.1 months in the ofatumumab group (hazard ratio for progression or death in the ibrutinib group, 0.22; P<0.001).Ibrutinib also significantly improved overall survival (hazard ratio for death, 0.43; P=0.005).At 12 months, the overall survival rate was 90% in the ibrutinib group and 81% in the ofatumumab group.The overall response rate was significantly higher in the ibrutinib group than in the ofatumumab group (42.6% vs. 4.1%, P<0.001).An additional 20% of ibrutinib-treated patients had a partial response with lymphocytosis.Similar effects were observed regardless of whether patients had a chromosome 17p13.1 deletion or resistance to purine analogues.The most frequent nonhematologic adverse events were diarrhea, fatigue, pyrexia, and nausea in the ibrutinib group and fatigue, infusion-related reactions, and cough in the ofatumumab group.CONCLUSIONS: Ibrutinib, as compared with ofatumumab, significantly improved progression-free survival, overall survival, and response rate among patients with previously treated CLL or SLL.(Funded by Pharmacyclics and Janssen; RESONATE ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01578707.).",1,1,1,1

Results from the GEICAM/2006-03, multicenter study.Chemotherapy remains as the only systemic treatment option available for basal-like breast cancer (BC) patients.Preclinical models and several phase II studies suggested that platinum salts are active drugs in this BC subtype though there is no randomized study supporting this hypothesis.This study investigates if the addition of carboplatin to a combination of an alkylating agent together with anthracyclines and taxanes is able to increase the efficacy in the neoadjuvant treatment context.Patients with operable breast cancer and immunophenotypically defined basal-like disease (ER-/PR-/HER2- and cytokeratin 5/6+ or EGFR+) were recruited.Patients were randomized to receive EC (epirubicin 90 mg/m(2) plus cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2) for 4 cycles) followed either by D (docetaxel 100 mg/m(2) x 4 cycles; EC-D) or DCb (docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) plus carboplatin AUC 6 x 4 cycles; EC-DCb).The primary end point was pathological complete response (pCR) in the breast following the Miller and Payne criteria.Ninety-four patients were randomized (46 EC-D, 48 EC-DCb).pCR rate in the breast was seen in 16 patients (35 %) with EC-D and 14 patients (30 %) with EC-DCb (P value = 0.61).pCR in the breast and axilla was seen in 30 % of patients in both arms.The overall clinical response rate was 70 % (95 % CI 56-83) in the EC-D arm and 77 % (95 % CI 65-87) in the EC-DCb arm.Grade 3/4 toxicity was similar in both arms.The addition of carboplatin to conventional chemotherapy with EC-D in basal-like breast cancer patients did not improve the efficacy probably because they had already received an alkylating agent.These findings should be taken into consideration when developing new agents for this disease.",1,1,1,1

25577838,"[Functional outcomes of transvesical single-site versus extraperitoneal laparoscopic radical prostatectomy for low-risk prostate cancer].OBJECTIVE: To compare the perioperative data, pathological results and functional outcomes of transvesical single- site laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (TVSSLRP) with those of nerve-sparing extraperitoneal laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (nsELRP) in the treatment of low-risk prostate cancer (PCa).METHODS: Fifty patients with low-risk organ-confined PCa were randomly assigned to two groups of equal number to receive TVSSLRP and nsELRP, respectively.Comparisons were made between the two groups of patients in such demographic and baseline data as age, comorbidity, body mass index (BMI), serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA), prostate volume, bioptic Gleason score, clinical stage, IIEF-5 score, nocturnal penile tumescence (NPT), penile brachial index (PBI), and penile arterial blood flow velocity as well as in such surgery-related parameters as operation duration, blood loss, blood transfusion, intraoperative complications, positive surgical margin, catheterization time, hospital stay, and postoperative Gleason score, pathologic stage, urinal pad use, PSA level, IIEF-5 score, NPT, PBI and PABFV.RESULTS: All the operations were successfully performed.There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups either in the demographic and baseline data or in intraoperative blood loss, blood transfusion rate, complications, and positive surgical margin.No intraoperative complications and positive surgical margins were found in either group.Compared with nsELRP, TVSSLRP achieved a significantly shorter operation duration ([151.46 +/- 40.68] min vs [105.92 +/- 26.21] min, P <0.05), catheterization time ([13.01 +/- 1.64] d vs [11.24 +/- 1.17] d, P <0.05), and hospital stay ([15.76 +/- 4.65] d vs [12.92 +/- 4.29] d, P <0.05).On the first day and at 1, 3 and 6 months after catheter removal, the urinary continence rates in the TVSSLRP and nsELRP groups were 84% vs 52% (P <0.05), 100% vs 84%, 100% vs 96%, and 100% vs 96%, respectively; and at 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery, the erectile potency rates were 48% vs 28% (P <0.05), 64% vs 52%, and 76% vs 68%, respectively, with an IIEF-5 score >/= 18, all evidently higher in the TVSSLRP than in the nsELRP group.The penile brachial index and arterial blood flow velocity of the two groups of patients exhibited no significant differences before and after surgery, nor did postoperative complications (grade II) between the TVSSLRP and nsELRP groups (32% vs 40%, P >0.05).The Gleason score and pathologic stage were increased after surgery, but with remarkable differences between the two groups (P >0.05).No biochemical recurrence was found in either group during a 12-month follow-up.CONCLUSION: With the advantages of safety and rapid postoperative recovery, both TVSSLRP and nsELRP are feasible for the treatment of low-risk organ-confined PCa, but the former may achieve an earlier recovery of urinary continence and erectile function than the latter.",0,0,0,0
25081390,"NY-ESO-1 specific antibody and cellular responses in melanoma patients primed with NY-ESO-1 protein in ISCOMATRIX and boosted with recombinant NY-ESO-1 fowlpox virus.Vaccination strategies based on repeated injections of NY-ESO-1 protein formulated in ISCOMATRIX particles (NY-ESO-1 ISCOMATRIX) have shown to elicit combined NY-ESO-1 specific antibody and T cell responses.However, it remains unclear whether heterologous prime-boost strategies based on the combination with NY-ESO-1 ISCOMATRIX with different NY-ESO-1 boosting reagents could be used to increase NY-ESO-1 CD8(+) or CD4(+) T cell responses.To address this question, we carried out a randomized clinical trial in 39 high-risk, resected melanoma patients vaccinated with NY-ESO-1 ISCOMATRIX, and then boosted with repeated injections of either recombinant fowlpox virus encoding full length NY-ESO-1 (rF-NY-ESO-1) (Arm A) or NY-ESO-1 ISCOMATRIX alone (Arm B).We have comprehensively analyzed NY-ESO-1 specific T cells and B cells response in all patients before and after vaccination for a total of seven time points per patient.NY-ESO-1 ISCOMATRIX alone elicited a strong NY-ESO-1 specific CD4(+) T cell and antibody response, which was maintained by both regiments at similar levels.However, CD8(+) T cell responses were significantly boosted in 3 out of 18 patients in Arm A after the first rF-NY-ESO-1 injection and such responses were maintained until the end of the trial, while no patients in Arm B showed similar CD8(+) T cell responses.In addition, our results clearly identified immunodominant regions in the NY-ESO-1 protein: NY-ESO-179-102 and NY-ESO-1115-138 for CD4+ T cells and NY-ESO-185-108 for CD8+ T cells in a large proportion of vaccinated patients.These regions of NY-ESO-1 protein should be considered in future clinical trials as immunodominant epitopes.",1,1,1,1
23190359,"Feasibility and efficacy of progressive resistance training and dietary supplements in radiotherapy treated head and neck cancer patients--the DAHANCA 25A study.BACKGROUND: Patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) often lose a considerable amount of muscle mass following the disease and treatment.This is an independent mortality predictor, lowering muscle strength and functional performance.Progressive resistance training (PRT) increases muscle mass among healthy individuals and groups of cancer patients, but it has not been investigated in HNSCC patients.Furthermore, studies in healthy subjects show an additive effect of protein and creatine supplementation following PRT.OBJECTIVES: Firstly, to investigate the feasibility of 12 weeks of PRT +/- protein and creatine supplementation among HNSCC patients.Secondly, to investigate group changes over time and group differences regarding lean body mass (LBM), muscle strength and functional performance following PRT +/- dietary supplementation.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty patients were randomized into two groups: a PROCR group undergoing a seven-day pre-trial creatine loading protocol followed by 12 weeks of PRT with creatine and protein supplementation and a PLA group undergoing a seven-day pre-trial placebo ingestion protocol followed by an identical PRT protocol with placebo supplementation.Before the pre-trial and pre- and post-PRT evaluation of LBM, maximal isometric and isokinetic muscle strength and functional performance were performed.RESULTS: Seventy percent of the patients completed the intervention and the PRT adherence rate was 97%.No significant group differences were found in any endpoints.From pre- to post-PRT, LBM increased significantly in the PROCR group by 2.6 +/- 2.2 kg (p < 0.0001) and increased in the PLA group (1.3 +/- 1.1 kg, p = 0.07).Maximal isometric and isokinetic muscle strength as well as functional performance increased significantly in both groups.CONCLUSION: PRT is feasible in radiotherapy treated HNSCC patients.Following PRT, lean body mass, muscle strength and functional performance increased significantly in both groups (LBM only borderline significant in PLA group) with no significant group difference in any endpoint.",1,1,0,0

24990160,"A feasibility study to examine the role of acupuncture to reduce symptoms of lymphoedema after breast cancer: a randomised controlled trial.OBJECTIVE: To determine the feasibility, acceptability and safety of using acupuncture to treat arm lymphoedema in women following treatment for breast cancer.METHODS: We conducted a randomised controlled trial of acupuncture compared with treatment as usual.Twenty women with stable unilateral intransient lymphoedema present for at least 6 months were recruited from Sydney, Australia.The women received 12 acupuncture treatments administered to body and arm points on the non-lymphoedematous limb over 8 weeks, twice weekly for 4 weeks then once weekly for 4 weeks.Outcome measures included an assessment of interest to participate in the trial, identification of successful recruitment strategies, the appropriateness of eligibility criteria and compliance with treatment attendance.Clinical outcomes were assessed at baseline and 8 weeks and included extracellular fluid, lymphoedema symptoms, well-being and safety.RESULTS: Acupuncture was an acceptable intervention in women with upper limb lymphoedema.Compliance with the treatment protocol was high, with nine women completing all 12 treatments.Outcome forms were completed by 17 women at 8 weeks.No major adverse occurrences, as defined by the study protocol, were reported from the acupuncture group although one woman found the needling uncomfortable, and no study participant experienced an increase in swelling of >10%.There was no change in extracellular fluid or any patient-reported outcome measurement.CONCLUSIONS: Lymphoedema is a persistent symptom experienced by women recovering from breast cancer.Our study suggests that acupuncture may stabilise symptoms and no major safety concerns were identified, so further research is needed.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, http://www.anzctr.org.au ACTRN12612000607875.",0,0,0,0
22575719,"Experiences with advanced cancer among Latinas in a public health care system.CONTEXT: Cultural dimensions related to illness are triggered at significant times in an illness trajectory, such as at illness onset or when death approaches.These factors influence views on how illness is understood and managed, which is likely more difficult for minority populations.Although Latinos experience barriers to high-quality health care, late-stage cancer diagnoses, and poor health outcomes, little is known about their experiences with advanced, life-threatening cancers.OBJECTIVES: We examined Latinas' experiences with advanced, metastatic cancers to identify sociocultural beliefs that influenced their care.METHODS: We interviewed 24 Latinas taking part in a randomized controlled trial focused on improving quality-of-life outcomes for co-occurring cancer and depression and explored their beliefs about the cause, course, and cure of cancer.This study used a phenomenological analytical approach to explore women's lived experiences of having advanced cancer.RESULTS: Themes revealed issues about experiencing advanced cancer that included the following: initial reactions to cancer, disbelief about the lack of pain, economic impact, beliefs about the cause, coping with cancer, beliefs about the cure, and confusion about cancer severity.Sociocultural factors influence misunderstanding and confusion about cancer care but also can be a source of strength.CONCLUSION: Providers need to become culturally sensitive to the needs of underserved Latinas.Denial or ignorance of these issues can create other problems, such as gaps in patient-centered decision making from diagnosis through the end of life.",0,0,0,0
22371400,"Dietary patterns as risk factors of differentiated thyroid carcinoma.UNLABELLED: Nutritional factors are known to be important in the development of different metabolic diseases.The history of nodular or diffuse goiter is closely related to risk of thyroid carcinoma.On account of the function of the thyroid gland, many studies focus on iodine intake.The aim of the study was to assess whether dietary patterns could be risk factors of differentiated thyroid carcinoma.MATERIAL/METHODS: The case-control study was based on a questionnaire, which included information about dietary patterns and was carried out on 284 patients comprising 30 males (mean age 58.4+/-13.7 years), and 254 females (mean age 52.1+/-13.8 years), as well as 345 randomly selected controls: 58 males (mean age 60.2+/-12 years) and 287 females (mean age 53.4+/-14.3 years) randomly selected from the Population Register and adjusted by age and gender to the group of TC.The main groups of nutritional products, i.e. starchy foods, meat, dairy products, vegetables, fruits, and beverages, were analyzed.RESULTS: Consumption of vegetables, fruits, saltwater fish and cottage cheese was significantly lower in patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma than in controls, quite the contrary to starchy foods, especially white bread.CONCLUSIONS: Dietary patterns appear to modify the risk of thyroid carcinoma.A diet rich in vegetables and fruit, as well as saltwater fish (a source of iodine) and low-fat meat, could be an important protective factor.",0,0,0,0
24315404,"A phase III randomized study comparing neoadjuvant chemotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy for locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma: updated long-term survival outcomes.OBJECTIVE: To determine whether concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) can improve survival rates compared to the neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) regimen in locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 338 patients with biopsy-proven NPC were randomly assigned to receive NACT followed by radical radiotherapy (RT) then adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) or CCRT followed by AC.RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 60 months, the 5-year overall survival (OS) rate did not differ significantly between two groups (75.5% vs 79.4% in CCRT and NACT group respectively, P=0.47, HR=0.84, 95%CI 0.53-1.33).Metastasis-free survival (MFS) rate was significantly improved by the CCRT (79.0% vs 86.9%, P=0.05, HR=0.59, 95%CI 0.35-1.00).Subgroup analysis indicated that the benefit of CCRT was derived from N0/N1 tumors (78.0% vs 93.5%, P=0.05, HR=0.35, 95%CI 0.12-0.99).Higher rates of mucositis (52.4% vs. 35.9% P=0.02) and vomiting (13.7% vs. 4.7% P=0.00) were noted in the CCRT arm.Late toxicities were similar in two groups.CONCLUSIONS: The updated results demonstrated no significant survival benefit of CCRT over NACT in patients with locoregionally advanced NPC.CCRT only showed significant MFS efficacy in T3-4N0-1 populations.",1,1,1,1
23281805,"Randomized Phase II trial of paclitaxel and carboplatin followed by gemcitabine switch-maintenance therapy versus gemcitabine and carboplatin followed by gemcitabine continuation-maintenance therapy in previously untreated advanced non-small cell lung cancer.BACKGROUND: In recent years, maintenance chemotherapy is increasingly being recognized as a new treatment strategy to improve the outcome of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).However, the optimal maintenance strategy is still controversial.Gemcitabine is a promising candidate for single-agent maintenance therapy because of little toxicity and good tolerability.We have conducted a randomized phase II study to evaluate the validity of single-agent maintenance chemotherapy of gemcitabine and to compare continuation- and switch-maintenance.METHODS: Chemonaive patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC were randomly assigned 1:1 to either arm A or B. Patients received paclitaxel (200 mg/m2, day 1) plus carboplatin (AUC 6 mg/mL/min, day 1) every 3 weeks in arm A, or gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2, days 1 and 8) plus carboplatin (AUC 5 mg/mL/min, day1) every 3 weeks in arm B. Non-progressive patients following 3 cycles of induction chemotherapy received maintenance gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2, days 1 and 8) every 3 weeks.( TRIAL REGISTRATION: UMIN000008252)RESULTS: The study was stopped because of delayed accrual at interim analysis.Of the randomly assigned 50 patients, 49 except for one in arm B were evaluable.Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 4.6 months for arm A vs. 3.5 months for arm B (HR = 1.03; 95% CI, 0.45-2.27; p = 0.95) and median overall survival (OS) was 15.0 months for arm A vs. 14.8 months for arm B (HR = 0.79; 95% CI, 0.40-1.51; p = 0.60), showing no difference between the two arms.The response rate, disease control rate, and the transit rate to maintenance phase were 36.0% (9/25), 64.0% (16/25), and 48% (12/25) for arm A vs. 16.7% (4/24), 50.0% (12/24), and 33% (8/24) for arm B, which were also statistically similar between the two arms (p = 0.13, p = 0.32, and p = 0.30, respectively).Both induction regimens were tolerable, except that more patients experienced peripheral neuropathy in arm A. Toxicities during the maintenance phase were also minimal.CONCLUSION: Survival and overall response were not significantly different between the two arms.Gemcitabine may be well-tolerable and feasible for maintenance therapy.",1,1,1,1
23355041,"A randomized phase II study of gemcitabine and S-1 combination therapy versus gemcitabine monotherapy for advanced biliary tract cancer.PURPOSE: In order to confirm the impact of adding S-1 to gemcitabine, we conducted a randomized phase II study to compare the combination therapy of gemcitabine plus S-1 to gemcitabine monotherapy in patients with advanced biliary tract cancer.METHODS: Sixty-two patients with advanced cholangiocarcinoma or gallbladder cancer were randomized to either the combination therapy of gemcitabine and S-1 (gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 15 and S-1 40 mg/m(2) b.i.d.on days 1-14, repeated every 4 weeks) or gemcitabine monotherapy (gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m(2) on days 1, 8, and 15, repeated every 4 weeks).The primary endpoint of this study was response rate, and the regimen which showed the better response rate was selected as a candidate of phase III study.Tumor response was assessed every two cycles using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria version 1.0.RESULTS: The response rates of the combination therapy and the monotherapy were 20.0 and 9.4 %, respectively.The median time-to-progressions and overall survivals of these two treatments were nearly the same (5.6 vs. 4.3 months; 8.9 vs. 9.2 months).Adverse events occurred more frequently in the combination arm.CONCLUSIONS: The combination therapy of gemcitabine and S-1 showed the better response rate, but the superiority of this combination therapy was not clear in total.Because the standard of care changed to the combination therapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin during this study, it is difficult to select this combination therapy with a 4-week regimen as a candidate of phase III study.",1,1,1,1

24953276,"The rate of operative success achieved with radioguided occult lesion localization and intraoperative ultrasonography in patients with recurrent papillary thyroid cancer.BACKGROUND: To investigate the rate of operative success in excision of nonpalpable lymph nodes with metastatic disease achieved with radioguided occult lesion localization (ROLL) and intraoperative ultrasonography (IOUS) in patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC).METHODS: Twenty consecutive PTC patients with nonpalpable lymph nodes with metastatic disease localized in previously operated fields were randomized to receive ROLL (n = 11) or IOUS (n = 9).Nodes were excised along with adjacent soft tissue to accomplish a compartment-oriented dissection.The duration of operation, rate of postoperative complications, pre- and postoperative serum thyroglobulin (Tg) levels, and the findings of postoperative neck ultrasonography and postablation scan were recorded in all patients.Measures of operative success included a postoperative Tg level <50% of preoperative Tg level and no abnormal lesions on postoperative imaging.RESULTS: Histopathologic examination confirmed the excision of all preoperatively identified metastatic nodes.Additional nodes also were excised (2.3 +/- 3.3 per specimen in the ROLL group and 1.6 +/- 1.8 per specimen in the IOUS group), 23% of which were metastatic.No postoperative complications occurred in either group.The duration of operation was similar in the 2 groups (P = .4).Postoperative imaging confirmed the clearance of suspicious nodes in all patients.The rate of operative success in ROLL and IOUS group were 100% and 89%, respectively.CONCLUSION: In patients with recurrent PTC, a high rate of operative success in excision of nonpalpable metastatic lymph nodes was achieved by both ROLL and IOUS.We recommend compartment-oriented dissection; this approach may maximize the removal of metastatic nodes not identified by preoperative imaging.",0,0,0,0
23871490,"2 years versus 1 year of adjuvant trastuzumab for HER2-positive breast cancer (HERA): an open-label, randomised controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Trastuzumab has established efficacy against breast cancer with overexpression or amplification of the HER2 oncogene.The standard of care is 1 year of adjuvant trastuzumab, but the optimum duration of treatment is unknown.We compared 2 years of treatment with trastuzumab with 1 year of treatment, and updated the comparison of 1 year of trastuzumab versus observation at a median follow-up of 8 years, for patients enrolled in the HERceptin Adjuvant (HERA) trial.METHODS: The HERA trial is an international, multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial comparing treatment with trastuzumab for 1 and 2 years with observation after standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy, adjuvant chemotherapy, or both in 5102 patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer.The primary endpoint was disease-free survival.The comparison of 2 years versus 1 year of trastuzumab treatment involved a landmark analysis of 3105 patients who were disease-free 12 months after randomisation to one of the trastuzumab groups, and was planned after observing at least 725 disease-free survival events.The updated intention-to-treat comparison of 1 year trastuzumab treatment versus observation alone in 3399 patients at a median follow-up of 8 years (range 0-10) is also reported.This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00045032.FINDINGS: We recorded 367 events of disease-free survival in 1552 patients in the 1 year group and 367 events in 1553 patients in the 2 year group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.99, 95% CI 0.85-1.14, p=0.86).Grade 3-4 adverse events and decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction during treatment were reported more frequently in the 2 year treatment group than in the 1 year group (342 [20.4%] vs 275 [16.3%] grade 3-4 adverse events, and 120 [7.2%] vs 69 [4.1%] decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction, respectively).HRs for a comparison of 1 year of trastuzumab treatment versus observation were 0.76 (95% CI 0.67-0.86, p<0.0001) for disease-free survival and 0.76 (0.65-0.88, p=0.0005) for overall survival, despite crossover of 884 (52%) patients from the observation group to trastuzumab therapy.INTERPRETATION: 2 years of adjuvant trastuzumab is not more effective than is 1 year of treatment for patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer.1 year of treatment provides a significant disease-free and overall survival benefit compared with observation and remains the standard of care.FUNDING: F Hoffmann-La Roche (Roche).",1,1,1,1
24323034,"Targeted androgen pathway suppression in localized prostate cancer: a pilot study.PURPOSE: Ligand-mediated activation of the androgen receptor (AR) is critical for prostate cancer (PCa) survival and proliferation.The failure to completely ablate tissue androgens may limit suppression of PCa growth.We evaluated combinations of CYP17A and 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors for reducing prostate androgen levels, AR signaling, and PCa volumes.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-five men with intermediate/high-risk clinically localized PCa were randomly assigned to goserelin combined with dutasteride (ZD), bicalutamide and dutasteride (ZBD), or bicalutamide, dutasteride, and ketoconazole (ZBDK) for 3 months before prostatectomy.Controls included patients receiving combined androgen blockade with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist and bicalutamide.The primary outcome measure was tissue dihydrotestosterone (DHT) concentration.RESULTS: Prostate DHT levels were substantially lower in all experimental arms (0.02 to 0.04 ng/g v 0.92 ng/g in controls; P < .001).The ZBDK group demonstrated the greatest percentage decline in serum testosterone, androsterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (P < .05 for all).Staining for AR and the androgen-regulated genes prostate-specific antigen and TMPRSS2 was strongly suppressed in benign glands and moderately in malignant glands (P < .05 for all).Two patients had pathologic complete response, and nine had </= 0.2 cm(3) of residual tumor (defined as a near-complete response), with the largest numbers of complete and near-complete responses in the ZBDK group.CONCLUSION: Addition of androgen synthesis inhibitors lowers prostate androgens below that achieved with standard therapy, but significant AR signaling remains.Tissue-based analysis of steroids and AR signaling is critical to informing the search for optimal local and systemic control of high-risk prostate cancer.",1,1,1,1

23281805,"Randomized Phase II trial of paclitaxel and carboplatin followed by gemcitabine switch-maintenance therapy versus gemcitabine and carboplatin followed by gemcitabine continuation-maintenance therapy in previously untreated advanced non-small cell lung cancer.BACKGROUND: In recent years, maintenance chemotherapy is increasingly being recognized as a new treatment strategy to improve the outcome of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).However, the optimal maintenance strategy is still controversial.Gemcitabine is a promising candidate for single-agent maintenance therapy because of little toxicity and good tolerability.We have conducted a randomized phase II study to evaluate the validity of single-agent maintenance chemotherapy of gemcitabine and to compare continuation- and switch-maintenance.METHODS: Chemonaive patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC were randomly assigned 1:1 to either arm A or B. Patients received paclitaxel (200 mg/m2, day 1) plus carboplatin (AUC 6 mg/mL/min, day 1) every 3 weeks in arm A, or gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2, days 1 and 8) plus carboplatin (AUC 5 mg/mL/min, day1) every 3 weeks in arm B. Non-progressive patients following 3 cycles of induction chemotherapy received maintenance gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2, days 1 and 8) every 3 weeks.( TRIAL REGISTRATION: UMIN000008252)RESULTS: The study was stopped because of delayed accrual at interim analysis.Of the randomly assigned 50 patients, 49 except for one in arm B were evaluable.Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 4.6 months for arm A vs. 3.5 months for arm B (HR = 1.03; 95% CI, 0.45-2.27; p = 0.95) and median overall survival (OS) was 15.0 months for arm A vs. 14.8 months for arm B (HR = 0.79; 95% CI, 0.40-1.51; p = 0.60), showing no difference between the two arms.The response rate, disease control rate, and the transit rate to maintenance phase were 36.0% (9/25), 64.0% (16/25), and 48% (12/25) for arm A vs. 16.7% (4/24), 50.0% (12/24), and 33% (8/24) for arm B, which were also statistically similar between the two arms (p = 0.13, p = 0.32, and p = 0.30, respectively).Both induction regimens were tolerable, except that more patients experienced peripheral neuropathy in arm A. Toxicities during the maintenance phase were also minimal.CONCLUSION: Survival and overall response were not significantly different between the two arms.Gemcitabine may be well-tolerable and feasible for maintenance therapy.",1,1,1,1

And the secondary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR) and overall survival (OS).RESULTS: They were randomized into gefitinib arm (n = 25) and paclitaxel/carboplatin arm (n = 26).The median PFS was 4.2 months in gefitinib arm and 8.3 months in paclitaxel/carboplatin arm (P = 0.422); ORR 36.0% in gefitinib arm and 42.3% in paclitaxel/carboplatin arm (P = 0.645); Median OS 14.4 months in gefitinib arm and 15.0 months in paclitaxel/carboplatin arm (P = 0.290).Multifactorial Cox regression analysis showed that age (P = 0.004), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutation status (P = 0.012) and subsequent treatments (platinum-based chemotherapy, P = 0.001; EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), P = 0.005) were the significant predictors of OS.CONCLUSIONS: No significant differences exist in terms of efficacy and survival between first-line gefitinib and paclitaxel/carboplatin for Chinese patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma who are non-smokers or former light smokers.And age, EGFR gene mutation status and subsequent treatments are significant predictor of OS.However, first-line gefitinib should not be recommended for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients only based on clinical factors, due to a very small sample-size in our study.",1,1,1,1
24699863,"Autologous tumor lysate-pulsed dendritic cell immunotherapy with cytokine-induced killer cells improves survival in gastric and colorectal cancer patients.Gastric and colorectal cancers (GC and CRC) have poor prognosis and are resistant to chemo- and/or radiotherapy.In the present study, the prophylactic effects of dendritic cell (DC) vaccination are evaluated on disease progression and clinical benefits in a group of 54 GC and CRC patients treated with DC immunotherapy combined with cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells after surgery with or without chemo-radiotherapy.DCs were prepared from the mononuclear cells isolated from patients using IL-2/GM-CSF and loaded with tumor antigens; CIK cells were prepared by incubating peripheral blood lymphocytes with IL-2, IFN-gamma, and CD3 antibodies.The DC/CIK therapy started 3 days after low-dose chemotherapy and was repeated 3-5 times in 2 weeks as one cycle with a total of 188.3 +/-79.8 x 10(6) DCs and 58.8 +/- 22.3 x 10(8) CIK cells.Cytokine levels in patients' sera before and after treatments were measured and the follow-up was conducted for 98 months to determine disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS).The results demonstrate that all cytokines tested were elevated with significantly higher levels of IFN-gamma and IL-12 in both GC and CRC cohorts of DC/CIK treated patients.By Cox regression analysis, DC/CIK therapy reduced the risk of post-operative disease progression (p<0.01) with an increased OS (<0.01).These results demonstrate that in addition to chemo- and/or radiotherapy, DC/CIK immunotherapy is a potential effective approach in the control of tumor growth for post-operative GC and CRC patients.",0,0,0,0

22795435,"American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z4099/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 1021: a randomized study of sublobar resection compared with stereotactic body radiotherapy for high-risk stage I non-small cell lung cancer.During the past decade, tremendous interest has arisen in the use of nonoperative therapies for patients with non-small cell lung cancer.Of these therapies, stereotactic body radiotherapy has become established as an effective modality for treating peripheral cancer in medically inoperable patients.Toxicity is low, and the treatment is effective, with excellent local control rates.Several investigators have suggested that stereotactic body radiotherapy could be effective for high-risk operable patients (usually treated with sublobar resection) and even perhaps for standard-risk operable patients (usually treated with lobectomy); however, this is less accepted.A direct comparison of stereotactic body radiotherapy and sublobar resection is difficult for a number of reasons.These include different definitions of recurrence, different populations of patients in these studies (with those undergoing stereotactic body radiotherapy tending to be the medically inoperable group), and different methods of classifying morbidity in the surgical and radiation oncology studies.Imaging follow-up has also not been standardized among the studies.Thus, a randomized study is necessary and timely.Investigators from the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group and the Radiation Therapy and Oncology Group have collaborated to develop a phase III randomized study comparing stereotactic body radiotherapy and sublobar resection (with or without brachytherapy) for high-risk operable patients with non-small cell lung cancer.This study (American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z4099/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 1021) has recently opened for accrual.It is hoped that this will help to better define the role of these therapies for patients with non-small cell lung cancer.",0,0,0,0

24960402,"A phase IIa dose-finding and safety study of first-line pertuzumab in combination with trastuzumab, capecitabine and cisplatin in patients with HER2-positive advanced gastric cancer.BACKGROUND: Pertuzumab plus trastuzumab provides a more comprehensive blockade of HER2 signalling than trastuzumab alone.Therefore, we conducted a phase IIa study of the pharmacokinetics and safety of pertuzumab plus trastuzumab and chemotherapy in advanced gastric cancer (aGC).METHODS: Patients received pertuzumab 840 mg for cycle 1 and 420 mg q3w for cycles 2-6 (Arm A) or pertuzumab 840 mg q3w for six cycles (Arm B).Trastuzumab, cisplatin and capecitabine were also given for six cycles, then trastuzumab q3w until disease progression or unmanageable toxicity.The co-primary endpoints were day 43 pertuzumab serum trough concentration (Cmin) and safety.RESULTS: Thirty patients were randomised.Mean pertuzumab Cmin at day 43 was 40.0 mug ml(-1) (s.d.: 17.3) in Arm A and 62.7 mug ml(-1) (29.1) in Arm B. Mean day 43 Cmin in Arm A was ~37% lower than that seen in metastatic breast cancer.The safety profiles were similar between arms and treatment was well tolerated.Partial responses were achieved by 86% and 55% of patients in Arms A and B, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the pharmacokinetic and safety data, the 840 mg q3w pertuzumab dose has been selected for a phase III study of pertuzumab, trastuzumab and chemotherapy in HER2-positive aGC.",1,1,1,1
23928139,"Tumor consistency of pituitary macroadenomas: predictive analysis on the basis of imaging features with contrast-enhanced 3D FIESTA at 3T.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Preoperative evaluation of pituitary macroadenoma tumor consistency is important for neurosurgery.Thus, we aimed to retrospectively assess the role of contrast-enhanced FIESTA in predicting the tumor consistency of pituitary macroadenomas.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-nine patients with pituitary macroadenomas underwent conventional MR imaging sequences and contrast-enhanced FIESTA before surgery.Two neuroradiologists assessed the contrast-enhanced FIESTA, contrast-enhanced T1WI, and T2WI.On the basis of surgical findings, the macroadenomas were classified by the neurosurgeons as either soft or hard.Finally, Fisher exact probability tests and unpaired t tests were used to compare predictions on the basis of the MR imaging findings with the tumor consistency, collagen content, and postoperative tumor size.RESULTS: The 29 pituitary macroadenomas were classified as either solid or mosaic types.Solid type was characterized by a homogeneous pattern of tumor signal intensity without intratumoral hyperintense dots, whereas the mosaic type was characterized by many intratumoral hyperintense dots on each MR image.Statistical analyses revealed a significant correlation between tumor consistency and contrast-enhanced FIESTA findings.Sensitivity and specificity were higher for contrast-enhanced FIESTA (1.00 and 0.88-0.92, respectively) than for contrast-enhanced T1WI (0.80 and 0.25-0.33, respectively) and T2WI (0.60 and 0.38-0.54, respectively).Compared with mosaic-type adenomas, solid-type adenomas tended to have a hard tumor consistency as well as a significantly higher collagen content and lower postoperative tumor size.CONCLUSIONS: Contrast-enhanced FIESTA may provide preoperative information regarding the consistency of macroadenomas that appears to be related to the tumor collagen content.",0,0,0,0
25057173,"EGFR biomarkers predict benefit from vandetanib in combination with docetaxel in a randomized phase III study of second-line treatment of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.BACKGROUND: ZODIAC was a randomized phase III study of second-line treatment in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that evaluated the addition of vandetanib to docetaxel.The study showed a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival and objective response rate, but not in overall survival for unselected patients.This study evaluated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutation, copy number gain, and protein expression, and KRAS gene mutation, in pretreatment tumor samples as potential biomarkers predicting benefit from vandetanib as second-line treatment of NSCLC.PATIENTS AND METHODS: After progression following first-line chemotherapy, 1391 patients with locally advanced or metastatic (stage IIIB/IV) NSCLC were randomized 1 : 1 to receive vandetanib (100 mg/day) plus docetaxel (75 mg/m(2) every 21 days) or placebo plus docetaxel in the ZODIAC study.Archival tumor samples (n = 570) were collected from consenting patients (n = 958) for predefined, prospective biomarker analyses.RESULTS: Of evaluable samples, 14% were EGFR mutation positive, 35% were EGFR FISH positive, 88% were EGFR protein expression positive, and 13% were KRAS mutation positive.Compared with the overall study population, in which progression-free survival (PFS) [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.79] but not OS (HR = 0.91) were significantly improved with vandetanib, there was greater relative clinical benefit for patients with EGFR mutation-positive tumors [PFS HR 0.51, confidence interval (CI) 0.25-1.06 and OS HR 0.46, CI 0.14-1.57] and EGFR FISH-positive tumors (PFS HR 0.61, CI 0.39-0.94 and OS HR 0.48, CI 0.28-0.84).Similarly, patients with EGFR mutation or FISH-positive tumor samples who received vandetanib had an increased chance of objective tumor response (odds ratios 3.34, CI 0.8-13.89, and 3.90, CI 1.02-14.82, respectively).There did not appear to be benefit for vandetanib in patients with KRAS mutation-positive tumors.CONCLUSIONS: High EGFR gene copy number or activating EGFR mutations may identify patient subgroups who receive increased clinical benefit from vandetanib in combination with docetaxel in second-line NSCLC.CLINICALTRIALSGOV: NCT00312377.",1,1,1,1
24158787,"Everolimus plus exemestane in postmenopausal patients with HR(+) breast cancer: BOLERO-2 final progression-free survival analysis.INTRODUCTION: Effective treatments for hormone-receptor-positive (HR(+)) breast cancer (BC) following relapse/progression on nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI) therapy are needed.Initial Breast Cancer Trials of OraL EveROlimus-2 (BOLERO-2) trial data demonstrated that everolimus and exemestane significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) versus placebo plus exemestane alone in this patient population.METHODS: BOLERO-2 is a phase 3, double-blind, randomized, international trial comparing everolimus (10 mg/day) plus exemestane (25 mg/day) versus placebo plus exemestane in postmenopausal women with HR(+) advanced BC with recurrence/progression during or after NSAIs.The primary endpoint was PFS by local investigator review, and was confirmed by independent central radiology review.Overall survival, response rate, and clinical benefit rate were secondary endpoints.RESULTS: Final study results with median 18-month follow-up show that median PFS remained significantly longer with everolimus plus exemestane versus placebo plus exemestane [investigator review: 7.8 versus 3.2 months, respectively; hazard ratio = 0.45 (95% confidence interval 0.38-0.54); log-rank P < 0.0001; central review: 11.0 versus 4.1 months, respectively; hazard ratio = 0.38 (95% confidence interval 0.31-0.48); log-rank P < 0.0001] in the overall population and in all prospectively defined subgroups, including patients with visceral metastases, [corrected] and irrespective of age.The incidence and severity of adverse events were consistent with those reported at the interim analysis and in other everolimus trials.CONCLUSION: The addition of everolimus to exemestane markedly prolonged PFS in patients with HR(+) advanced BC with disease recurrence/progression following prior NSAIs.These results further support the use of everolimus plus exemestane in this patient population.ClinicalTrials.gov #NCT00863655.",1,1,1,1
25557266,"Intermittent Chemotherapy as a Platform for Testing Novel Agents in Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Department of Defense Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Consortium Randomized Phase II Trial of Intermittent Docetaxel With Prednisone With or Without Maintenance GM-CSF.BACKGROUND: Immunotherapy with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), an agent that previously demonstrated antitumor activity, was evaluated within an intermittent chemotherapy framework of docetaxel with prednisone (D+P) in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).PATIENTS AND METHODS: mCRPC patients with >/= 50% prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline after 6 cycles of D+P were randomized to either GM-CSF or observation (Obs).At disease progression (PD), D+P was reinitiated for 6 cycles followed by the same ""off chemotherapy"" regimen in patients eligible for chemotherapy interruption.The sequence was repeated until PD during chemotherapy, lack of PSA response to chemotherapy, or unacceptable toxicity.The primary end point was time to chemotherapy resistance (TTCR).RESULTS: Of 125 patients enrolled, 52 (42%) experienced >/= 50% PSA decline on induction D+P and were randomized to GM-CSF (n = 27) or Obs (n = 25).The median time to PD was 3.3 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.4-3.5) and 1.5 months (95% CI, 1.5-2.4) during the initial course of GM-CSF and Obs, respectively.Twelve of 26 (46%) patients responded to a second course of D+P. Eleven randomized patients (21%) experienced PD during chemotherapy, precluding accurate assessment of TTCR.The remaining 41 randomized patients discontinued study for lack of PSA response to chemotherapy (n = 8), patient choice to not restart chemotherapy with PSA PD (n = 13), toxicity (n = 7), or study withdrawal (n = 13).CONCLUSION: Conducting a prospective study in mCRPC with maintenance immunotherapy within the framework of intermittent chemotherapy was feasible.The use of PSA instead of radiographic end points limited the number of evaluable patients.This study provides important insight into designing contemporary intermittent chemotherapy trials with maintenance immunotherapy in patients with advanced prostate cancer.",0,0,0,0
25332249,"Trastuzumab plus adjuvant chemotherapy for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast cancer: planned joint analysis of overall survival from NSABP B-31 and NCCTG N9831.PURPOSE: Positive interim analysis findings from four large adjuvant trials evaluating trastuzumab in patients with early-stage human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) -positive breast cancer were first reported in 2005.One of these reports, the joint analysis of North Central Cancer Treatment Group NCCTG N9831 (Combination Chemotherapy With or Without Trastuzumab in Treating Women With HER2-Overexpressing Breast Cancer) and the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project NSABP B-31 (Doxorubicin and Cyclophosphamide Plus Paclitaxel With or Without Trastuzumab in Treating Women With Node-Positive Breast Cancer That Overexpresses HER2), was updated in 2011.We now report the planned definitive overall survival (OS) results from this joint analysis along with updates on the disease-free survival (DFS) end point.METHODS: In all, 4,046 patients with HER2-positive operable breast cancer were enrolled to receive doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel with or without trastuzumab in both trials.The required number of events for the definitive statistical analysis for OS (710 events) was reached in September 2012.Updated analyses of overall DFS and related subgroups were also performed.RESULTS: Median time on study was 8.4 years.Adding trastuzumab to chemotherapy led to a 37% relative improvement in OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.63; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.73; P < .001) and an increase in 10-year OS rate from 75.2% to 84%.These results were accompanied by an improvement in DFS of 40% (HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.68; P < .001) and increase in 10-year DFS rate from 62.2% to 73.7%.All patient subgroups benefited from addition of this targeted anti-HER2 agent.CONCLUSION: The addition of trastuzumab to paclitaxel after doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide in early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer results in a substantial and durable improvement in survival as a result of a sustained marked reduction in cancer recurrence.",0,0,0,0
23222000,"Obesity-related hormones and endometrial cancer among postmenopausal women: a nested case-control study within the B~FIT cohort.Endometrial cancer risk is strongly influenced by obesity, but the mechanisms of action remain unclear.Leptin and adiponectin, secreted from adipose tissue, reportedly play a role in such carcinogenic processes as cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and insulin regulation.In this case-control study, nested within the Breast and Bone Follow-up of the Fracture Intervention Trial (n=15,595), we assessed pre-diagnostic serum leptin, total adiponectin, and high-molecular-weight (HMW) adiponectin in relation to endometrial cancer among postmenopausal women.During the 10-year follow-up, 62 incident endometrial cases were identified and matched to 124 controls on age, geographical site, time of fasting blood draw at baseline (1992-1993), and trial participation status.Adipokines and C-peptide were measured by ELISA.Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated via conditional logistic regression, with exposures categorized in tertiles (T).Multivariable models considered C-peptide, BMI (kg/m(2)), and estradiol (E2) as potential confounders.Endometrial cancer risk was significantly associated with higher leptin levels, adjusted for E2 and C-peptide (OR(T3 vs T1)=2.96; 95% CI, 1.21-7.25; P trend <0.01).After further adjustment for BMI, the estimates were attenuated and the positive trend was no longer statistically significant (OR(T3 vs T1)=2.11; 95% CI, 0.69-6.44; P trend=0.18).No significant associations were observed with adiponectin or HMW adiponectin and endometrial cancer.Our findings with leptin suggest that the leptin-BMI axis might increase endometrial cancer risk through mechanisms other than estrogen-driven proliferation.Continued exploration of these pathways in larger prospective studies may help elucidate mechanisms underlying observed obesity-endometrial cancer associations.",0,0,0,0

24571588,"Systematic analysis of 18F-FDG PET and metabolism, proliferation and hypoxia markers for classification of head and neck tumors.BACKGROUND: Quantification of molecular cell processes is important for prognostication and treatment individualization of head and neck cancer (HNC).However, individual tumor comparison can show discord in upregulation similarities when analyzing multiple biological mechanisms.Elaborate tumor characterization, integrating multiple pathways reflecting intrinsic and microenvironmental properties, may be beneficial to group most uniform tumors for treatment modification schemes.The goal of this study was to systematically analyze if immunohistochemical (IHC) assessment of molecular markers, involved in treatment resistance, and 18F-FDG PET parameters could accurately distinguish separate HNC tumors.METHODS: Several imaging parameters and texture features for 18F-FDG small-animal PET and immunohistochemical markers related to metabolism, hypoxia, proliferation and tumor blood perfusion were assessed within groups of BALB/c nu/nu mice xenografted with 14 human HNC models.Classification methods were used to predict tumor line based on sets of parameters.RESULTS: We found that 18F-FDG PET could not differentiate between the tumor lines.On the contrary, combined IHC parameters could accurately allocate individual tumors to the correct model.From 9 analyzed IHC parameters, a cluster of 6 random parameters already classified 70.3% correctly.Combining all PET/IHC characteristics resulted in the highest tumor line classification accuracy (81.0%; cross validation 82.0%), which was just 2.2% higher (p = 5.2x10-32) than the performance of the IHC parameter/feature based model.CONCLUSIONS: With a select set of IHC markers representing cellular processes of metabolism, proliferation, hypoxia and perfusion, one can reliably distinguish between HNC tumor lines.Addition of 18F-FDG PET improves classification accuracy of IHC to a significant yet minor degree.These results may form a basis for development of tumor characterization models for treatment allocation purposes.",0,0,0,0

Mean day 43 Cmin in Arm A was ~37% lower than that seen in metastatic breast cancer.The safety profiles were similar between arms and treatment was well tolerated.Partial responses were achieved by 86% and 55% of patients in Arms A and B, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the pharmacokinetic and safety data, the 840 mg q3w pertuzumab dose has been selected for a phase III study of pertuzumab, trastuzumab and chemotherapy in HER2-positive aGC.",1,1,1,1
24627237,"Quality of life in patients with advanced gastric cancer sequentially treated with docetaxel and irinotecan with 5-fluorouracil and folinic acid (leucovin).With a median overall survival of only 9-13 months in patients with advanced gastric cancer (GC), the quality of life (QoL) during the palliative treatment remains a key issue.Furthermore, when combinations of two or three drugs are used, the impact on QoL should be carefully evaluated.This was studied within the GATAC trial in patients sequentially treated with docetaxel and irinotecan with 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin (5-Fu/Lv).Patients with previously untreated advanced GC were randomly assigned to start with docetaxel 45 mg/m(2) (arm T) or irinotecan 180 mg/m(2) (arm C) with bolus and 44 h infusion of 5-Fu/Lv (D1, q2 weeks).After four courses, there was a prescheduled crossover to the alternative regimen for four additional courses.QoL was measured with the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire at the start of the treatment, at crossover and after completing treatment with both regimens.Eighty-one patients were randomized, and 78 patients started treatment.A total of 191 completed QoL questionnaires were collected.There were no statistically significant differences in QoL scores between the two treatment groups and no changes in mean scores during the 16 weeks of treatment.During the last 8 weeks of treatment, a significantly larger portion of patients with radiological response reported sustained or better QoL scores than those with no radiological response (82 vs. 50%, p = 0.007).Chemotherapy in advanced GC did not affect QoL average scores.Patients with non-responding tumours reported more often a decline in the global QoL score.The concept of the pre-scheduled switch of chemotherapy regimens prior to progression should be further studied in this disease, as it appears effective, tolerable and not to negatively affect QoL.",0,0,0,0
24963497,"Low-dose decitabine-based chemoimmunotherapy for patients with refractory advanced solid tumors: a phase I/II report.Aberrant DNA methylation is one of the main drivers of tumor initiation and progression.The reversibility of methylation modulation makes it an attractive target for novel anticancer therapies.Clinical studies have demonstrated that high-dose decitabine, a hypomethylating agent, results in some clinical benefits in patients with refractory advanced tumors; however, they are extremely toxic.Low doses of decitabine minimize toxicity while potentially improving the targeted effects of DNA hypomethylation.Based on these mechanisms, low-dose decitabine combined with chemoimmunotherapy may be a new treatment option for patients with refractory advanced tumors.We proposed the regimen of low-dose decitabine-based chemoimmunotherapy for patients with refractory advanced solid tumors.A favorable adverse event profile was observed in our trial that was highlighted by the finding that most of these adverse events were grades 1-2.Besides, the activity of our cohort was optimistic and the clinical benefit rate was up to 60%, and the median PFS was prolonged compared with PFS to previous treatment.We also identified a significant correlation between the PFS to previous treatment and clinical response.The low-dose DAC decitabine-based chemoimmunotherapy might be a promising protocol for improving the specificity and efficiency of patients with refractory advanced solid tumors.This trial is registered in the ClinicalTrials.gov database (identifier NCT01799083).",0,0,0,0

25057173,"EGFR biomarkers predict benefit from vandetanib in combination with docetaxel in a randomized phase III study of second-line treatment of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.BACKGROUND: ZODIAC was a randomized phase III study of second-line treatment in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that evaluated the addition of vandetanib to docetaxel.The study showed a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival and objective response rate, but not in overall survival for unselected patients.This study evaluated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutation, copy number gain, and protein expression, and KRAS gene mutation, in pretreatment tumor samples as potential biomarkers predicting benefit from vandetanib as second-line treatment of NSCLC.PATIENTS AND METHODS: After progression following first-line chemotherapy, 1391 patients with locally advanced or metastatic (stage IIIB/IV) NSCLC were randomized 1 : 1 to receive vandetanib (100 mg/day) plus docetaxel (75 mg/m(2) every 21 days) or placebo plus docetaxel in the ZODIAC study.Archival tumor samples (n = 570) were collected from consenting patients (n = 958) for predefined, prospective biomarker analyses.RESULTS: Of evaluable samples, 14% were EGFR mutation positive, 35% were EGFR FISH positive, 88% were EGFR protein expression positive, and 13% were KRAS mutation positive.Compared with the overall study population, in which progression-free survival (PFS) [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.79] but not OS (HR = 0.91) were significantly improved with vandetanib, there was greater relative clinical benefit for patients with EGFR mutation-positive tumors [PFS HR 0.51, confidence interval (CI) 0.25-1.06 and OS HR 0.46, CI 0.14-1.57] and EGFR FISH-positive tumors (PFS HR 0.61, CI 0.39-0.94 and OS HR 0.48, CI 0.28-0.84).Similarly, patients with EGFR mutation or FISH-positive tumor samples who received vandetanib had an increased chance of objective tumor response (odds ratios 3.34, CI 0.8-13.89, and 3.90, CI 1.02-14.82, respectively).There did not appear to be benefit for vandetanib in patients with KRAS mutation-positive tumors.CONCLUSIONS: High EGFR gene copy number or activating EGFR mutations may identify patient subgroups who receive increased clinical benefit from vandetanib in combination with docetaxel in second-line NSCLC.CLINICALTRIALSGOV: NCT00312377.",1,1,1,1
22965507,"Sclerotherapy of simple hepatic cysts by repeated aspiration and alcohol instillation.BACKGROUND/AIMS: The efficacy and safety of traditional alcohol sclerotherapy procedures are controversial in the management of large simple hepatic cysts.In this study, we aimed to develop and evaluate a novel alcohol sclerotherapy procedure, termed repeated aspiration and alcohol instillation sclerotherapy, for the treatment of simple hepatic cysts.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective, double-blind, randomized study was performed.Sixty-seven patients with large simple hepatic cysts were randomized into two groups to receive either single-session alcohol retention sclerotherapy (alcohol was instilled into the cyst cavity, kept for 20 minutes and aspirated) or repeated aspiration and alcohol instillation sclerotherapy (instillation of 30-70 ml of alcohol and immediate aspiration with repetition 3 to 6 times until the estimated alcohol concentration exceeded 80%).The cyst volume reduction was calculated to compare the efficacy of the two procedures.We evaluated the safety of the procedure by monitoring side effects and assaying blood alcohol concentrations at 0, 0.5, 1, 2 and 3 hours after sclerotherapy.RESULTS: The cyst volume reduction in patients undergoing repeated aspiration and alcohol instillation sclerotherapy was significantly higher than that in those receiving alcohol-retention sclerotherapy.The concentration of alcohol in the last aspirated cyst fluid was correlated with the mean volume reduction in patients undergoing repeated aspiration and alcohol instillation sclerotherapy but not in the alcohol-retention group.Only minor side effects occurred in both groups.Although elevated blood alcohol concentration was noted in all patients, it declined to normal levels within 2-3 hours after treatment.There were no significant differences in blood alcohol concentration between the two groups.CONCLUSIONS: Repeated aspiration and alcohol instillation sclerotherapy is superior to single-session alcohol-retention sclerotherapy in the management of large simple hepatic cysts.",0,0,0,0
24141008,"Improved survival with ursodeoxycholic acid prophylaxis in allogeneic stem cell transplantation: long-term follow-up of a randomized study.We report the long-term results of a prospective randomized study on the use of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) for prevention of hepatic complications after allogeneic stem cell transplantation.Two hundred forty-two patients, 232 with malignant disease, were randomized to receive (n = 123) or not to receive (n = 119) UDCA from the beginning of the conditioning until 90 days post-transplantation.The results were reported after 1-year follow-up.UDCA administration reduced significantly the proportion of patients developing high serum bilirubin levels as well as the incidence of severe acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), liver GVHD, and intestinal GVHD.In the UDCA prophylaxis group, nonrelapse mortality (NRM) was lower and overall survival better than in the control group.After a 10-year follow-up, the difference in the survival and NRM in favor of the UDCA-treated group, seen at 1 year, was maintained (survival 48% versus 38%, P = .037; NRM 28% versus 41%, P = .01).A landmark analysis in patients surviving at 1 year post-transplantation showed no significant differences between the study groups in the long-term follow-up in chronic GVHD, relapse rate, NRM, disease-free survival, or overall survival.These long-term results continue to support the useful role of UDCA in the prevention of transplant-related complications in allogeneic transplantation.",1,1,1,1
