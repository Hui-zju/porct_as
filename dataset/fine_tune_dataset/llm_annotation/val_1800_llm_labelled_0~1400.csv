28574779,"HELOISE: Phase IIIb Randomized Multicenter Study Comparing Standard-of-Care and Higher-Dose Trastuzumab Regimens Combined With Chemotherapy as First-Line Therapy in Patients With Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2-Positive Metastatic Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma.Purpose To compare standard-of-care (SoC) trastuzumab plus chemotherapy with higher-dose (HD) trastuzumab plus chemotherapy to investigate whether HD trastuzumab increases trastuzumab serum trough concentration (Ctrough) levels and increases overall survival (OS) in first-line human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.Patients and Methods Patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 2, no prior gastrectomy, and >/= two metastatic sites were randomly assigned at a one-to-one ratio to loading-dose trastuzumab 8 mg/kg followed by SoC trastuzumab maintenance 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks or loading-dose trastuzumab 8 mg/kg followed by HD trastuzumab maintenance 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks until progression; treatment in each arm was combined with cisplatin 80 mg/m(2) plus capecitabine 800 mg/m(2) twice per day in cycles 1 to 6.The primary objective was HD trastuzumab OS superiority (all randomly assigned patients [full-analysis set]).Final results are from an interim analysis for futility (boundary hazard ratio [HR] >/= 0.95) at 125 deaths.Results At clinical cutoff, 248 patients had been randomly assigned.A marked increase in mean trastuzumab Ctrough was observed after the first HD trastuzumab cycle versus SoC trastuzumab.In the full-analysis set, median OS was 12.5 months in the SoC trastuzumab arm and 10.6 months in the HD trastuzumab arm (stratified HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 0.86 to 1.78; P = .2401).Results were similar in the per-protocol set (cycle 1 trastuzumab Ctrough < 12 microg/mL).Safety was comparable between arms.Conclusion HD trastuzumab maintenance dosing was associated with higher trastuzumab concentrations, no increased efficacy, and no new safety signals.HELOISE confirms standard-dose trastuzumab (loading dose of 8 mg/kg followed by 6 mg/kg maintenance dose every 3 weeks) with chemotherapy as the SoC for first-line treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.",1,1,1,1
26282657,"Results of the Exercise and Nutrition to Enhance Recovery and Good Health for You (ENERGY) Trial: A Behavioral Weight Loss Intervention in Overweight or Obese Breast Cancer Survivors.PURPOSE: Obesity increases risk for all-cause and breast cancer mortality and comorbidities in women who have been diagnosed and treated for breast cancer.The Exercise and Nutrition to Enhance Recovery and Good Health for You (ENERGY) study is the largest weight loss intervention trial among survivors of breast cancer to date.METHODS: In this multicenter trial, 692 overweight/obese women who were, on average, 2 years since primary treatment for early-stage breast cancer were randomly assigned to either a group-based behavioral intervention, supplemented with telephone counseling and tailored newsletters, to support weight loss or a less intensive control intervention and observed for 2 years.Weight and blood pressure were measured at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months.Longitudinal mixed models were used to analyze change over time.RESULTS: At 12 months, mean weight loss was 6.0% of initial weight in the intervention group and 1.5% in the control group (P<.001).At 24 months, mean weight loss in the intervention and control groups was 3.7% and 1.3%, respectively (P<.001).Favorable effects of the intervention on physical activity and blood pressure were observed.The weight loss intervention was more effective among women older than 55 years than among younger women.CONCLUSION: A behavioral weight loss intervention can lead to clinically meaningful weight loss in overweight/obese survivors of breast cancer.These findings support the need to conduct additional studies to test methods that support sustained weight loss and to examine the potential benefit of intentional weight loss on breast cancer recurrence and survival.",0,0,0,0
22669453,"Tumor budding is an independent predictor of outcome in AJCC/UICC stage II colorectal cancer.BACKGROUND: In colorectal cancer, the morphology of the invasive tumor margin may reflect aggressiveness of tumor growth, thus providing important prognostic information.The tumor growth pattern according to Jass and the extent of tumor budding were analyzed in patients with American Joint Committee on Cancer/Union for International Cancer Control (AJCC/UICC) stage II disease.METHODS: Tumors of 120 randomly selected patients with AJCC/UICC stage II disease were retrospectively reviewed for tumor growth pattern (expanding vs. infiltrating) and the extent of tumor budding, with high-grade budding reflecting presence of 10 or more budding foci scattered at the invasive tumor margin.Progression-free and cancer-specific survivals were determined by the Kaplan-Meier method.For multivariable analysis, Cox's proportional hazards regression models were performed.RESULTS: The infiltrating growth pattern was significantly associated with histological subtype and lymphovascular invasion, while high-grade budding was significantly associated with tumor grade and lymphovascular invasion.High-grade budding, but not the infiltrating growth pattern, was significantly associated with outcome in univariable analysis.Cox's proportional hazards regression models proved tumor budding to be an independent predictor of disease progression (hazard ratio 3.91, 95 % confidence interval 1.3-11.77; P = 0.02) and cancer-related death (hazard ratio 5.90, 95 % confidence interval 1.62-21.51; P = 0.007).The combination of infiltrating growth pattern and high-grade budding did not have a stronger prognostic significance than tumor budding alone.CONCLUSIONS: Tumor budding independently predicted patient outcome in patients with AJCC/UICC stage II colorectal cancer and may therefore be used for accurate prognostication, patient counseling, and design of clinical trials by using integrated multimodal therapy.",0,0,0,0
31065111,"Eribulin versus dacarbazine in patients with leiomyosarcoma: subgroup analysis from a phase 3, open-label, randomised study.BACKGROUND: This subgroup analysis of a phase 3 study compares outcomes for eribulin versus dacarbazine in patients with leiomyosarcoma.METHODS: Patients >/=18 years old with advanced liposarcoma or leiomyosarcoma, ECOG PS </=2, and >/=2 prior treatment regimens were randomly assigned (1:1) to eribulin mesylate (1.4 mg/m(2) intravenously on day 1 and day 8) or dacarbazine (either 850, 1000, or 1200 mg/m(2) intravenously) every 21 days until disease progression.The primary end point was OS; additional end points were progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR).RESULTS: 309 Patients with leiomyosarcoma were included (eribulin, n = 157; dacarbazine, n = 152).Median age was 57 years; 42% of patients had uterine disease and 57% had nonuterine disease.Median OS was 12.7 versus 13.0 months for eribulin versus dacarbazine, respectively (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.93 [95% CI 0.71-1.20]; P = 0.57).Median PFS (2.2 vs 2.6 months, HR = 1.07 [95% CI 0.84-1.38]; P = 0.58) and ORR (5% vs 7%) were similar between eribulin- and dacarbazine-treated patients.Grade >/=3 TEAEs occurred in 69% of patients receiving eribulin and 59% of patients receiving dacarbazine.CONCLUSIONS: Efficacy of eribulin in patients with leiomyosarcoma was comparable to that of dacarbazine.Both agents had manageable safety profiles.",0,0,0,0
24987838,"Noninvasive image texture analysis differentiates K-ras mutation from pan-wildtype NSCLC and is prognostic.BACKGROUND: Non-invasive characterization of a tumor's molecular features could enhance treatment management.Quantitative computed tomography (CT) based texture analysis (QTA) has been used to derive tumor heterogeneity information, and the appearance of the tumors has been shown to relate to patient outcome in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and other cancers.In this study, we examined the potential of tumoral QTA to differentiate K-ras mutant from pan-wildtype tumors and its prognostic potential using baseline pre-treatment non-contrast CT imaging in NSCLC.METHODS: Tumor DNA from patients with early-stage NSCLC was analyzed on the LungCarta Panel.Cases with a K-ras mutation or pan-wildtype for 26 oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes were selected for QTA.QTA was applied to regions of interest in the primary tumor.Non-parametric Mann Whitney test assessed the ability of the QTA, clinical and patient characteristics to differentiate between K-ras mutation from pan-wildtype.A recursive decision tree was developed to determine whether the differentiation of K-ras mutant from pan-wildtype tumors could be improved by sequential application of QTA parameters.Kaplan-Meier survival analysis assessed the ability of these markers to predict survival.RESULTS: QTA was applied to 48 cases identified, 27 had a K-ras mutation and 21 cases were pan-wildtype.Positive skewness and lower kurtosis were significantly associated with the presence of a K-ras mutation.A five node decision tree had sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy values (95% CI) of 96.3% (78.1-100), 81.0% (50.5-97.4), and 89.6% (72.9-97.0); respectively.Kurtosis was a significant predictor of OS and DFS, with a lower kurtosis value linked with poorer survival.CONCLUSIONS: Lower kurtosis and positive skewness are significantly associated with K-ras mutations.A QTA feature such as kurtosis is prognostic for OS and DFS.Non-invasive QTA can differentiate the presence of K-ras mutation from pan-wildtype NSCLC and is associated with patient survival.",0,0,0,0
22377820,"Early enteral nutrition reduces the rate of life-threatening complications after thoracic esophagectomy in patients with esophageal cancer.BACKGROUND: Early postoperative enteral nutrition has been suggested to improve the nutritional status of patients after esophageal surgery.However, whether enteral nutrition decreases rates of surgical complications and increases the completion rate of the clinical management pathway is unclear.METHODS: We analyzed 154 patients who were randomly assigned to either an enteral or parenteral nutrition group after undergoing esophagectomy, compared the incidence of surgical complications, and evaluated the completion rate of the clinical pathway.In these 2 patient groups, perioperative management was performed through identical clinical pathways, except for nutrition.RESULTS: The overall rate of surgical complications of any type did not differ between patients who received early enteral nutrition and those who did not (p = 0.50); however, the rate of life-threatening surgical complications was significantly lower in patients who received early enteral nutrition (p = 0.02).The rate of non-life-threatening surgical complications did not differ between the groups (p = 0.98).In patients who received enteral nutrition, the completion rate of the clinical pathway was higher (p = 0.03), and the postoperative hospital stay was shorter (p = 0.04).CONCLUSIONS: Early enteral nutrition reduces the incidence of life-threatening surgical complications and improves the completion rate of the clinical pathway for thoracic esophagectomy.",0,0,0,0
23136318,"Association of speculum lubrication with pain and Papanicolaou test accuracy.PURPOSE: To determine the effects of lubrication of the vaginal speculum before insertion during a Papanicolaou test on perceived pain and quality of the cytology specimen.METHODS: Four hundred eligible women participating in cervical cancer screening and an early detection program were randomized with respect to lubricant gel use before speculum insertion.Perceived pain during speculum insertion and cytology results were assessed in study groups.RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 45.7 years (range, 23-77 years).Pain score of the NO GEL group was significantly higher than that of the GEL group (2.3 and 1.6, respectively; P < .05).For premenopausal women, lubricant gel use significantly reduced the pain scores of the participants (P < .05).Cytological interpretations of the Papanicolaou test specimens were comparable among all groups.CONCLUSIONS: During the collection of Papanicolaou test specimens, lubrication of the vaginal speculum with a small amount of K-Y Jelly (a water-soluble lubricant gel) decreases the pain associated with insertion of the vaginal speculum among postmenopausal women without obscuring the cytological interpretation of conventional or liquid-based cytology.In women of reproductive age, lubrication of the speculum with K-Y Jelly does not cause a meaningful effect with respect to perceived pain.",0,0,0,0
22774206,"A multiinstitutional phase 2 trial of pazopanib monotherapy in advanced anaplastic thyroid cancer.CONTEXT/OBJECTIVES: Pazopanib, an inhibitor of kinases including vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, demonstrated impressive activity in progressive metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer, prompting its evaluation in anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC).DESIGN/SETTING/PATIENTS/INTERVENTIONS/OUTCOME MEASURES: Preclinical studies, followed by a multicenter single arm phase 2 trial of continuously administered 800 mg pazopanib daily by mouth (designed to provide 90% chance of detecting a response rate of >20% at the 0.10 significance level when the true response rate is >5%), were undertaken.The primary trial end point was Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) response.RESULTS: Pazopanib displayed activity in the KTC2 ATC xenograft model, prompting clinical evaluation.Sixteen trial patients were enrolled; 15 were treated: 66.7% were female, median age was 66 yr (range 45-77 yr), and 11 of 15 had progressed through prior systemic therapy.Enrollment was halted, triggered by a stopping rule requiring more than one confirmed RECIST response among the first 14 of 33 potential patients.Four patients required one to two dose reductions; severe toxicities (National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria-Adverse Events version 3.0 grades >3) were hypertension (13%) and pharyngolaryngeal pain (13%).Treatment was discontinued because of the following: disease progression (12 patients), death due to a possibly treatment-related tumor hemorrhage (one patient), and intolerability (radiation recall tracheitis and uncontrolled hypertension, one patient each).Although transient disease regression was observed in several patients, there were no confirmed RECIST responses.Median time to progression was 62 d; median survival time was 111 d. Two patients are alive with disease 9.9 and 35 months after the registration; 13 died of disease.CONCLUSIONS: Despite preclinical in vivo activity in ATC, pazopanib has minimal single-agent clinical activity in advanced ATC.",0,0,0,0
30624128,"FSH suppression and tumour control in patients with prostate cancer during androgen deprivation with a GnRH agonist or antagonist.BACKGROUND: Gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonists suppress follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) to lower levels than GnRH agonists.This may partially explain the differences between these agents on prostate cancer outcomes.In this post-hoc analysis, FSH and prostate specific antigen (PSA) responses and the impact of cross-over from leuprolide to degarelix were evaluated from a 1-year comparative study (CS21) and its extension study (CS21A).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Overall, 610 patients were enrolled in CS21, wherein PSA and FSH levels were evaluated monthly.CS21A evaluated 386 patients, including those previously treated with degarelix (n = 251) who continued to receive degarelix, and those previously treated with leuprolide (n = 135) who crossed-over to receive degarelix.PSA and FSH levels were evaluated in CS21A for 3 months after cross-over.The associations between measurements were assessed using Spearman's correlation coefficient.The impact of class variables on FSH suppression were evaluated using Analysis of Variance.RESULTS: Rapid PSA and FSH suppression was observed and maintained in the degarelix arm (CS21 and CS21A), while patients on leuprolide experienced rising PSA during CS21.Patients crossed-over from leuprolide to degarelix achieved a suppression of FSH and a significant PSA decrease.PSA and FSH levels were significantly (p < .05) correlated at months 1, 3, 6, 12 and 13 in the degarelix arm.CONCLUSIONS: Significant FSH suppression with GnRH antagonists may explain its advantage over GnRH agonists in terms of better prostate cancer control.The effect of profound FSH suppression is analogous to the need for profound testosterone suppression for tumor control.",0,0,0,0
22397774,"Three different techniques for administering analgesia during transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy: a comparative study.PURPOSE: The efficacy of three different analgesic techniques during transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guided prostate biopsy, including (i) periprostatic blockage (PPB), (ii) intrarectal gel instillation, and (iii) sedoanalgesia were compared.MATERIAL AND METHODS: During a period of five months, 100 consecutive men were enrolled in this study.A 10-point linear visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to assess the pain scores during (VAS 1), immediately after (VAS 2) and one hour after (VAS 3) the needle biopsy procedure.The relationship between the level of pain, prostate volume, age and PSA was determined.RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between the four groups in terms of mean age and PSA values.The pain scores were significantly lower in sedoanalgesia and PPB groups (p = 0.0001).There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in terms of complications.CONCLUSIONS: In this study, it was shown that patient comfort is better and it is possible to get decreased pain scores with PPB or sedoanalgesia.However, PPB is a preferable method in TRUS-guided prostate biopsy since it is much more practical in outpatient clinics.",0,0,0,0
25057084,"[Effect of S-1 maintenance chemotherapy following DCF regimen in patients with advanced gastric cancer].OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy and adverse effect of DCF regimen with subsequent S-1 maintenance chemotherapy in patients with advanced gastric cancer (AGC).METHODS: Sixty AGC patients without disease progression after 4 to 6 cycles of DCF regimen as the first-line chemotherapy were randomized into maintenance group and control group (30 patients each).The patients in the maintenance group received maintenance chemotherapy with S-1 (40 mg/m(2), twice daily for 14 days; 21 days for a treatment cycle) until disease progression or with intolerant toxicity, and those in the control group received optimal supportive care.RESULTS: The response rate (CR+PR) was 33.3% in the maintenance group, significantly higher than that in the control group (3.33%, P<0.05), and the disease control rate (CR+PR+SD) also differed significantly between the two groups (73.3% vs 46.7%, P<0.05).The median time to progression was 7.9 months in the maintenance group and 6.8 months in the control group, with median overall survival time of 13.8 and 11.7 months, respectively (P>0.05).The most common adverse effect in the maintenance group included nausea, vomiting, leucocytopenia, and hand-foot syndrome; no death occurred in relation to the therapy.CONCLUSION: S-1 maintenance chemotherapy, with a tolerable toxicity profile, can improve the RR, DCR and median time to progression in AGC patients who respond to DCF regimen, but its efficacy still awaits further evaluation.",1,1,1,0
31274657,"Clinical Evaluation of Intraoperative Near Misses in Laparoscopic Rectal Cancer Surgery.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the frequency, nature, and severity of intraoperative adverse near miss events within advanced laparoscopic surgery and report any associated clinical impact.BACKGROUND: Despite implementation of surgical safety initiatives, the intraoperative period is poorly documented with evidence of underreporting.Near miss analyses are undertaken in high-risk industries but not in surgical practice.METHODS: Case video and data from 2 laparoscopic total mesorectal excision randomized controlled trials were analyzed (ALaCaRT ACTRN12609000663257, 2D3D ISRCTN59485808).Intraoperative adverse events were identified and categorized using the observational clinical human reliability analysis technique.The EAES classification was applied by 2 blinded assessors.EAES grade 1 events (nonconsequential error, no damage, or need for correction) were considered near misses.Associated clinical impact was assessed with early morbidity and histopathology outcomes.RESULTS: One hundred seventy-five cases contained 1113 error events.Six hundred ninety-eight (62.7%) were near misses (median 3, IQR 2-5, range 0-15) with excellent inter-rater and test-retest reliability (kappa=0.86, 95% CI 0.83-0.89, P < 0.001 and kappa=0.88, 95% CI 0.85-0.9, P < 0.001 respectively).Significantly more near misses were seen in patients who developed early complications (4 (3-6) vs. 3 (2-4), P < 0.001).Higher numbers of near misses were seen in patients with more numerous (P = 0.002) and more serious early complications (P = 0.003).Cases containing major intraoperative adverse events contained significantly more near misses (5 (3-7) vs. 3 (2-5), P < 0.001) with a major event observed for every 19.4 near misses.CONCLUSION: Intraoperative adverse events and near misses can be reliably and objectively captured in advanced laparoscopic surgery.Near misses are commonplace and closely associated with morbidity outcomes.",0,0,0,0
28679349,"Relationships between thermal dose parameters and the efficacy of definitive chemoradiotherapy plus regional hyperthermia in the treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer: data from a multicentre randomised clinical trial.PURPOSE: To evaluate the contribution of the thermal dose parameters during regional hyperthermia (HT) treatment to the clinical outcomes in patients with cervical carcinoma (CC) who received chemoradiotherapy (CRT) plus HT.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from a multicentre randomised clinical trial of concurrent CRT + HT vs. CRT alone were used to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this combination therapy in the CC patients.The intrarectal temperatures of patients undergoing HT were recorded.The complete thermal data of 47 (92%) of the 51 patients in the CRT + HT group were available for the thermal analysis.Thus, 47 patients who received CRT + HT were included in the present study.RESULTS: Among the patients who received CRT + HT, a higher CEM43T90 (>/=1 min) value (a thermal dose parameter) was significantly associated with better local relapse-free survival in both univariate (p = 0.024) and multivariate (p = 0.0097) analyses.The disease-free survival of the patients with higher CEM43T90 (>/=1 min) values tended to be better in comparison to patients with lower CEM43T90 (<1 min) value (p = 0.071).A complete response tended to be associated with the CEM43T90 (p = 0.056).Disease-free survival, local relapse-free survival and complete response rate for patients with higher CEM43T90 (>/=1) were significantly better than those for patients with CRT alone (p = 0.036, p = 0.036 and p = 0.048).CONCLUSIONS: Dose-effect relationships between thermal dose parameters and clinical outcomes were confirmed in the CC patients treated with a combination of CRT + HT.This study also confirmed that HT with lower CEM43T90 is insufficient to achieve a significant hyperthermic sensitisation to CRT.",0,0,0,0
23031619,"Breast density as indicator for the use of mammography or MRI to screen women with familial risk for breast cancer (FaMRIsc): a multicentre randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: To reduce mortality, women with a family history of breast cancer often start mammography screening at a younger age than the general population.Breast density is high in over 50% of women younger than 50 years.With high breast density, breast cancer incidence increases, but sensitivity of mammography decreases.Therefore, mammography might not be the optimal method for breast cancer screening in young women.Adding MRI increases sensitivity, but also the risk of false-positive results.The limitation of all previous MRI screening studies is that they do not contain a comparison group; all participants received both MRI and mammography.Therefore, we cannot empirically assess in which stage tumours would have been detected by either test.The aim of the Familial MRI Screening Study (FaMRIsc) is to compare the efficacy of MRI screening to mammography for women with a familial risk.Furthermore, we will assess the influence of breast density.METHODS/DESIGN: This Dutch multicentre, randomized controlled trial, with balanced randomisation (1:1) has a parallel grouped design.Women with a cumulative lifetime risk for breast cancer due to their family history of >/=20%, aged 30-55 years are eligible.Identified BRCA1/2 mutation carriers or women with 50% risk of carrying a mutation are excluded.Group 1 receives yearly mammography and clinical breast examination (n = 1000), and group 2 yearly MRI and clinical breast examination, and mammography biennially (n = 1000).Primary endpoints are the number and stage of the detected breast cancers in each arm.Secondary endpoints are the number of false-positive results in both screening arms.Furthermore, sensitivity and positive predictive value of both screening strategies will be assessed.Cost-effectiveness of both strategies will be assessed.Analyses will also be performed with mammographic density as stratification factor.DISCUSSION: Personalized breast cancer screening might optimize mortality reduction with less over diagnosis.Breast density may be a key discriminator for selecting the optimal screening strategy for women < 55 years with familial breast cancer risk; mammography or MRI.These issues are addressed in the FaMRIsc study including high risk women due to a familial predisposition.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Netherland Trial Register NTR2789.",1,1,0,0
31036088,"A multicenter phase III study comparing Simultaneous Integrated Boost (SIB) radiotherapy concurrent and consolidated with S-1 versus SIB alone in elderly patients with esophageal and esophagogastric cancer - the 3JECROG P-01 study protocol.BACKGROUND: The importance of definitive radiotherapy for elderly patients with esophageal and esophagogastric-junction cancer is pronounced.However, little is known in terms of the best way to combine radiotherapy with other treatment options.This study aims to compare the efficiency of SIB radiotherapy alone with SIB radiotherapy concurrent and consolidated with S-1 for elderly patients.Comprehensive geriatric assessment is also incorporated in the procedure of treatment.METHODS/DESIGN: The study is a two arm, open, randomized multicenter Phase III trial with patients over 70 years old with stage IIA-IVB (UICC 2002, IVB only with metastasis to supraclavicular or celiac lymph nodes) squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma of esophagus or gastroesophageal junction.A total of 300 patients will be randomized using a 1:1 allocation ratio stratified by disease stage and study site.Patients allocated to the SIB arm will receive definitive SIB radiotherapy (95%PTV/PGTV 50.4Gy/59.92Gy/28f) while those randomized to SIB + S-1 arm will receive definitive SIB radiotherapy concurrent and consolidated with S-1.The primary endpoint of the trial is 1-year overall survival.Secondary objectives include progression-free survival, recurrence-free survival (local-regional and distant), disease failure pattern, toxicity profile as well as quality of life.Besides, detailed radiotherapy protocol and quality assurance procedure have been incorporated into this trial.DISCUSSION: The proportion of elderly patients in esophageal cancer is now growing, but there is a lack of evidence in term of treatment standard for this group of patients, which is what we aim to obtain through this prospective phase III study.TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov NCT02979691 .Registered November 22, 2016.",1,1,1,0
22565002,"Randomized phase II trial of everolimus in combination with tamoxifen in patients with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative metastatic breast cancer with prior exposure to aromatase inhibitors: a GINECO study.PURPOSE: Cross-talk between signal transduction pathways likely contributes to hormone resistance in metastatic breast cancer (mBC).Everolimus, an oral inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin, has restored sensitivity in endocrine-resistance models and shown anticancer activity in early-phase mBC clinical trials.This analysis evaluated efficacy and safety of everolimus in combination with tamoxifen in patients with mBC resistant to aromatase inhibitors (AIs).PATIENTS AND METHODS: This open-label, phase II study randomly assigned postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative, AI-resistant mBC to tamoxifen 20 mg/d plus everolimus 10 mg/d (n = 54) or tamoxifen 20 mg/d alone (n = 57).Randomization was stratified by primary and secondary hormone resistance.Primary end point was clinical benefit rate (CBR), defined as the percentage of all patients with a complete or partial response or stable disease at 6 months.No formal statistical comparison between groups was planned.RESULTS: The 6-month CBR was 61% (95% CI, 47 to 74) with tamoxifen plus everolimus and 42% (95% CI, 29 to 56) with tamoxifen alone.Time to progression (TTP) increased from 4.5 months with tamoxifen alone to 8.6 months with tamoxifen plus everolimus, corresponding to a 46% reduction in risk of progression with the combination (hazard ratio [HR], 0.54; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.81).Risk of death was reduced by 55% with tamoxifen plus everolimus versus tamoxifen alone (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.24 to 0.81).The main toxicities associated with tamoxifen plus everolimus were fatigue (72% v 53% with tamoxifen alone), stomatitis (56% v 7%), rash (44% v 7%), anorexia (43% v 18%), and diarrhea (39% v 11%).CONCLUSION: This study suggests that tamoxifen plus everolimus increased CBR, TTP, and overall survival compared with tamoxifen alone in postmenopausal women with AI-resistant mBC.",1,1,1,1

26686313,"Anastrozole versus tamoxifen for the prevention of locoregional and contralateral breast cancer in postmenopausal women with locally excised ductal carcinoma in situ (IBIS-II DCIS): a double-blind, randomised controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Third-generation aromatase inhibitors are more effective than tamoxifen for preventing recurrence in postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive invasive breast cancer.However, it is not known whether anastrozole is more effective than tamoxifen for women with hormone-receptor-positive ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).Here, we compare the efficacy of anastrozole with that of tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive DCIS.METHODS: In a double-blind, multicentre, randomised placebo-controlled trial, we recruited women who had been diagnosed with locally excised, hormone-receptor-positive DCIS.Eligible women were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio by central computer allocation to receive 1 mg oral anastrozole or 20 mg oral tamoxifen every day for 5 years.Randomisation was stratified by major centre or hub and was done in blocks (six, eight, or ten).All trial personnel, participants, and clinicians were masked to treatment allocation and only the trial statistician had access to treatment allocation.The primary endpoint was all recurrence, including recurrent DCIS and new contralateral tumours.All analyses were done on a modified intention-to-treat basis (in all women who were randomised and did not revoke consent for their data to be included) and proportional hazard models were used to compute hazard ratios and corresponding confidence intervals.This trial is registered at the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN37546358.RESULTS: Between March 3, 2003, and Feb 8, 2012, we enrolled 2980 postmenopausal women from 236 centres in 14 countries and randomly assigned them to receive anastrozole (1449 analysed) or tamoxifen (1489 analysed).Median follow-up was 7.2 years (IQR 5.6-8.9), and 144 breast cancer recurrences were recorded.We noted no statistically significant difference in overall recurrence (67 recurrences for anastrozole vs 77 for tamoxifen; HR 0.89 [95% CI 0.64-1.23]).The non-inferiority of anastrozole was established (upper 95% CI <1.25), but its superiority to tamoxifen was not (p=0.49).A total of 69 deaths were recorded (33 for anastrozole vs 36 for tamoxifen; HR 0.93 [95% CI 0.58-1.50], p=0.78), and no specific cause was more common in one group than the other.The number of women reporting any adverse event was similar between anastrozole (1323 women, 91%) and tamoxifen (1379 women, 93%); the side-effect profiles of the two drugs differed, with more fractures, musculoskeletal events, hypercholesterolaemia, and strokes with anastrozole and more muscle spasm, gynaecological cancers and symptoms, vasomotor symptoms, and deep vein thromboses with tamoxifen.CONCLUSIONS: No clear efficacy differences were seen between the two treatments.Anastrozole offers another treatment option for postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive DCIS, which may be be more appropriate for some women with contraindications for tamoxifen.Longer follow-up will be necessary to fully evaluate treatment differences.FUNDING: Cancer Research UK, National Health and Medical Research Council Australia, Breast Cancer Research Fund, AstraZeneca, Sanofi Aventis.",1,1,1,1
26335704,"Managing Cancer And Living Meaningfully: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: We have developed a novel and brief semi-structured psychotherapeutic intervention for patients with advanced or metastatic cancer, called Managing Cancer And Living Meaningfully.We describe here the methodology of a randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of this treatment to alleviate distress and promote well-being in this population.METHODS/DESIGN: The study is an unblinded randomized controlled trial with 2 conditions (intervention plus usual care versus usual care alone) and assessments at baseline, 3 and 6 months.The site is the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, part of the University Health Network, in Toronto, Canada.Eligibility criteria include: >/= 18 years of age; English fluency; no cognitive impairment; and diagnosis of advanced cancer.The 3-6 session intervention is manualized and allows for flexibility to meet individual patients' needs.It is delivered over a 3-6 month period and provides reflective space for patients (and their primary caregivers) to address 4 main domains: symptom management and communication with health care providers; changes in self and relations with close others; sense of meaning and purpose; and the future and mortality.Usual care at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre includes distress screening and referral as required to in-hospital psychosocial and palliative care services.The primary outcome is frequency of depressive symptoms and the primary endpoint is at 3 months.Secondary outcomes include diagnosis of major or minor depression, generalized anxiety, death anxiety, spiritual well-being, quality of life, demoralization, attachment security, posttraumatic growth, communication with partners, and satisfaction with clinical interactions.DISCUSSION: Managing Cancer And Living Meaningfully has the potential to relieve distress and promote psychological well-being in patients with advanced cancer and their primary caregivers.This trial is being conducted to determine its benefit and inform its dissemination.The intervention has cross-national relevance and training workshops have been held thus far with clinicians from North and South America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia and Africa.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01506492 4 January 2012.",0,0,0,0
23727419,"Clinical evaluation of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization with 2-day-soluble gelatin sponge particles for hepatocellular carcinoma-comparison with insoluble gelatin sponge particles.PURPOSE: To compare therapeutic effect, adverse events, and embolized hepatic artery impairment in transcatheter arterial chemoembolization between Lipiodol plus insoluble gelatin sponge particles (Gelpart) and Lipiodol plus 2-day-soluble gelatin sponge particles (2DS-GSPs).MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a single-center, prospective, randomized controlled trial, patients with hepatocellular carcinoma were assigned to the 2DS-GSP group or the Gelpart group.Radiographic response at 3 months per modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors was evaluated as the primary endpoint; secondary endpoints were safety (per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0) within 3 months and hepatic branch artery impairment at the time of repeat chemoembolization (grade 0, no damage; grade I, mild vessel wall irregularity; grade II, overt stenosis; grade III, occlusion of more peripheral branch artery than subsegmental artery; grade IV, occlusion of subsegmental artery).Grade II, III, or IV indicated significant hepatic artery impairment.RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients with 143 nodules were randomized to the 2DS-GSP group and 36 patients with 137 nodules were randomized to the Gelpart group.No significant differences in patient background existed between groups.Target lesion response and overall tumor response in the 2DS-GSP and Gelpart groups were 77.7% versus 76.9% and 78.3% versus 77.8%, respectively, with no significant differences.No significant difference in adverse events existed between groups.Hepatic artery impairment was observed in 5% of patients in the 2DS-GSP group (n = 32) and in 16% in the Gelpart group (n = 33; P< .001).CONCLUSIONS: Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization with 2DS-GSPs resulted in the same therapeutic and adverse effects as chemoembolization with Gelpart while causing significantly less hepatic artery impairment.",0,0,0,0

22065199,"Temozolomide plus radiotherapy for glioblastoma in a Canadian province: efficacy versus effectiveness and the impact of O6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase promoter methylation.BACKGROUND: Radiotherapy with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide has been the standard of care for newly diagnosed glioblastoma in adults since the pivotal trial by Roger Stupp and colleagues.The effectiveness of this regimen has not been evaluated in Canada.Additionally, the impact of O6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation on patient survival has not been confirmed.Hence, survival outcomes and MGMT predictive value were compared for the patients in Alberta versus the Stupp trial population.METHODS: Retrospective chart review of 215 adult glioblastoma patients who started radiotherapy and temozolomide between January 2007 and December 2010 at the Cross Cancer Institute (Edmonton, Alberta) or the Tom Baker Cancer Centre (Calgary, Alberta).RESULTS: In the Alberta population, median overall survival was 14.3 months (vs. 14.6 months in trial, p = NS) and median progression-free survival was 5.8 months (vs. 6.9 months in trial, p = NS).However, unlike the trial, the Alberta MGMT subgroup analysis for overall survival was not statistically significant, despite a hazard ratio of 0.65 in favor of the methylated group.More Alberta patients received corticosteroids (p < 0.0001) and fewer underwent complete resection (p = 0.0001) or a postprogression second surgery (p = 0.01) than the Stupp population, but characteristics were otherwise similar.CONCLUSION: Current practice in Alberta enables patients to achieve overall and progression-free survival similar to the clinical trial.Further follow-up is required to confirm the predictive value of the MGMT assay.Until that is clarified or better treatments are developed, it is reasonable to continue offering this treatment regimen to patients regardless of MGMT methylation status.",0,0,0,0
26620555,"A safety study of transumbilical single incision versus conventional laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) is an emerging minimally invasive surgery to reduce abdominal incisions.However, despite the increasing clinical application of SILS, no evidence from large-scale, randomized controlled trials is available for assessing the feasibility, short-term safety, oncological safety, and potential benefits of SILS compared with conventional laparoscopic surgery (CLS) for colorectal cancer.METHODS/DESIGN: This is a single-center, open-label, noninferiority, randomized controlled trial.A total of 198 eligible patients will be randomly assigned to transumbilical single incision plus one port laparoscopic surgery (SILS plus one) group or to a CLS group at a 1:1 ratio.Patients ranging in age from 18 to 80 years with rectosigmoid cancer diagnosed as cT1-4aN0-2 M0 and a tumor size no larger than 5 cm are considered eligible.The primary endpoint is early morbidity, as evaluated by an independent investigator.Secondary outcomes include operative outcomes (operative time, estimated blood loss, and incision length), pathologic outcomes (tumor size, length of proximal and distal resection margins, and number of harvested lymph nodes), postoperative inflammatory and immune responses (white blood cells [WBC], neutrophil percentage [NE %], C-reactive protein [CRP], interleukin-6 [IL-6], and tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-alpha]), postoperative recovery (time to first ambulation, flatus, liquid diet, soft diet, and duration of hospital stay), pain intensity, body image and cosmetic assessment, 3-year disease free survival (DFS), and 5-year overall survival (OS).Follow-up visits are scheduled for 1 and 3 months after surgery, then every 3 months for the first 2 years and every 6 months for the next 3 years.DISCUSSION: This trial will provide valuable clinical evidence for the objective assessment of the feasibility, safety, and potential benefits of SILS plus one compared with CLS for the radical resection of rectosigmoid cancer.The hypothesis is that SILS plus one is feasible for the radical resection of rectosigmoid cancer and offers short-term safety and long-term oncological safety comparable to that of CLS, and that SILS plus one offers better cosmetic results and faster convalescence compared to CLS.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02117557 (registered on 16 April 2014).",0,0,0,0
26549819,"Randomized controlled clinical trial comparing radioguided occult lesion localization with wire-guided lesion localization to evaluate their efficacy and accuracy in the localization of nonpalpable breast lesions.PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to compare the radioguided occult lesion localization (ROLL) technique with the wire-guided lesion localization (WGLL) technique to assess their efficacy and accuracy in the localization of nonpalpable breast lesions in patients at a unique reference medical center.These patients' reports were negative for malignancy but included highly suspicious imaging findings.METHODS: A controlled clinical trial was designed to compare the WGLL and ROLL techniques in women presenting with breast lesions diagnosed by mammography or ultrasonography at the Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia in Bogota, Colombia, from March 2006 to June 2011.RESULTS: This study examined 129 patients; 64 (49.6%) patients were treated with ROLL, and 65 (51.4%) were treated with WGLL.The ROLL technique achieved better median lesion centricity (ROLL = 11.7 and WGLL = 15.4; P = .038).No significant differences were found regarding demographic variables, operative specimen characteristics, the need to extend margins, operative complications, the degree of difficulty, or patient or surgeon satisfaction.CONCLUSION: The ROLL technique is as effective as WGLL for the localization of nonpalpable breast lesions.In our study, ROLL achieved better lesion centricity.Therefore, we propose that this technique could be used as a standard procedure in the detection of nonpalpable breast lesions at experienced centers.",0,0,0,0
23185750,"[Effects of qisheng mixture on chemotherapy induced myelosuppression in patients with colorectal cancer].OBJECTIVE: To observe the intervention of Qisheng Mixture (QM) on the chemotherapy induced myelosuppression in patients with colorectal cancer.METHODS: One hundred and twenty patients with colorectal cancer at Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine were randomly assigned to the pure chemotherapy group (as the control group) and the QM + chemotherapy group (as the treatment group), 60 in each group.All patients received FOLFOX4 or XELOX regimen for totally 6 cycles.Patients in the treatment group took QM 150 mL at the end of chemotherapy, once in the morning and once in the evening for 7 successive days, totally 6 therapeutic courses.The total and average dosages of using granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) were observed in all patients.The changes of white blood cell (WBC) counts were determined before chemotherapy and after the 6th chemotherapy.The hemoglobin (Hb), red blood cell (RBC), and platelet (PLT) counts were observed before chemotherapy, before the 4th chemotheray, and after the 6th chemotherapy.The clinical symptoms integrals (fatigue, liability to catch cold, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngalgia, pale complexion, poor appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, and so on) and the safety indicators (the functions of the liver and kidney, urine routines) were observed.The grading toxic and adverse reactions, KPS scoring, body weight, and the efficacy of the symptoms integrals were compared between the two groups.RESULTS: During the treatment period the total and average dosages of G-CSF used were larger in the control group than in the treatment group (P<0.01).After treatment the WBC count of the two groups were reduced with statistical difference (P<0.01).The WBC counts were higher in the treatment group than in the control group in the whole therapeutic process except the first chemotherapy (P<0.01, P<0.05).Compared with before treatment in the same group, RBC and PLT were reduced in the two groups before the 4th chemotherapy, RBC, Hb, and PLT were reduced after treatment (P<0.05, P<0.01).Better effects on body weight were obtained in the treatment group than in the control group with statistical difference (P<0.01).Compared with the control group, the clinical symptoms integrals such as fatigue, liability to catch cold, pharyngalgia, pale complexion, poor appetite, vomiting, and diarrhea were reduced (P<0.01).Compared with the control group, the toxic and adverse reactions were reduced in the treatment group before the 4th chemotherapy (P<0.01).CONCLUSIONS: QM could effectively intervene chemotherapy induced myelosuppression in patients with colorectal cancer.It was a safe Chinese medicine compound with lower toxicity.",0,0,0,0
24571588,"Systematic analysis of 18F-FDG PET and metabolism, proliferation and hypoxia markers for classification of head and neck tumors.BACKGROUND: Quantification of molecular cell processes is important for prognostication and treatment individualization of head and neck cancer (HNC).However, individual tumor comparison can show discord in upregulation similarities when analyzing multiple biological mechanisms.Elaborate tumor characterization, integrating multiple pathways reflecting intrinsic and microenvironmental properties, may be beneficial to group most uniform tumors for treatment modification schemes.The goal of this study was to systematically analyze if immunohistochemical (IHC) assessment of molecular markers, involved in treatment resistance, and 18F-FDG PET parameters could accurately distinguish separate HNC tumors.METHODS: Several imaging parameters and texture features for 18F-FDG small-animal PET and immunohistochemical markers related to metabolism, hypoxia, proliferation and tumor blood perfusion were assessed within groups of BALB/c nu/nu mice xenografted with 14 human HNC models.Classification methods were used to predict tumor line based on sets of parameters.RESULTS: We found that 18F-FDG PET could not differentiate between the tumor lines.On the contrary, combined IHC parameters could accurately allocate individual tumors to the correct model.From 9 analyzed IHC parameters, a cluster of 6 random parameters already classified 70.3% correctly.Combining all PET/IHC characteristics resulted in the highest tumor line classification accuracy (81.0%; cross validation 82.0%), which was just 2.2% higher (p = 5.2x10-32) than the performance of the IHC parameter/feature based model.CONCLUSIONS: With a select set of IHC markers representing cellular processes of metabolism, proliferation, hypoxia and perfusion, one can reliably distinguish between HNC tumor lines.Addition of 18F-FDG PET improves classification accuracy of IHC to a significant yet minor degree.These results may form a basis for development of tumor characterization models for treatment allocation purposes.",0,0,0,0
26447153,"Prospective associations between vitamin D status, vitamin D-related gene polymorphisms, and risk of tobacco-related cancers.BACKGROUND: Experimental evidence has suggested that vitamin D may be protective against tobacco-related cancers through the inhibition of the formation of tumors induced by tobacco carcinogens.To our knowledge, only one previous epidemiologic study investigated the association between vitamin D status and tobacco-related cancer risk, and no study has focused on vitamin D-related gene polymorphisms.OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to prospectively study the association between plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations, vitamin D-related gene polymorphisms, and risk of tobacco-related cancers.DESIGN: A total of 209 tobacco-related cancers were diagnosed within the SU.VI.MAX (Supplementation en vitamines et mineraux antioxydants) cohort (1994-2007) and were matched with 418 controls as part of a nested case-control study.Tobacco-related cancers (i.e., cancers for which tobacco is one of the risk factors) included several sites in the respiratory, digestive, reproductive, and urinary systems.Total plasma 25(OH)D was assessed with the use of an electrochemoluminescent assay.Polymorphisms were determined with the use of a TaqMan assay.Conditional logistic regression models were computed.RESULTS: A 25(OH)D concentration >/=30 ng/mL was associated with reduced risk of tobacco-related cancers (OR for >/=30 compared with <30 ng/mL: 0.59; 95% CI 0.35, 0.99; P = 0.046).This association was observed in former and current smokers (OR for >/=30 compared with <30 ng/mL: 0.43; 95% CI: 0.23, 0.84; P = 0.01) but not in never smokers (P = 0.8).The vitamin D receptor (VDR) FokI AA genotype and retinoid X receptor (RXR) rs7861779 TT genotype were associated with increased risk of tobacco-related cancers [OR for homozygous mutant type (MT) compared with wild type (WT): 1.87; 95% CI: 1.08, 3.23; P-trend = 0.02; OR for heterozygous type (HT) plus MT compared with WT: 1.60; 95% CI: 1.07, 2.38; P = 0.02].CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective study, high vitamin D status [25(OH)D concentration >/=30 ng/mL] was associated with decreased risk of tobacco-related cancers, especially in smokers.These results, which are supported by mechanistic plausibility, suggest that vitamin D may contribute to the prevention of tobacco-induced cancers in smokers and deserve additional investigation.The SU.VI.MAX trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00272428.",0,0,0,0

30606137,"A phase II randomized controlled trial of three exercise delivery methods in men with prostate cancer on androgen deprivation therapy.BACKGROUND: Existing evidence demonstrates that 1:1 personal training (PT) improves many adverse effects of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).Whether less resource-intensive exercise delivery models are as effective remains to be established.We determined the feasibility of conducting a multi-center non-inferiority randomized controlled trial comparing PT with supervised group (GROUP) and home-based (HOME) exercise programs, and obtained preliminary efficacy estimates for GROUP and HOME compared to PT on quality of life (QOL) and physical fitness.METHODS: Men with prostate cancer on ADT were recruited from one of two experienced Canadian centres and randomized 1:1:1 to PT, GROUP, or HOME.Randomization was stratified by length of ADT use and site.Participants completed moderate intensity aerobic and resistance exercises 4-5 days per week for 6 months with a target 150 min per week of exercise.Exercise prescriptions were individualized and progressed throughout the trial.Feasibility endpoints included recruitment, retention, adherence, and participant satisfaction.The efficacy endpoints QOL, fatigue, and fitness (VO2 peak, grip strength, and timed chair stands) in GROUP and HOME were compared for non-inferiority to PT.Descriptive analyses were used for feasibility endpoints.Between-group differences for efficacy endpoints were examined using Bayesian linear mixed effects models.RESULTS: Fifty-nine participants (mean age 69.9 years) were enrolled.The recruitment rate was 25.4% and recruitment was slower than projected.Retention was 71.2%.Exercise adherence as measured through attendance was high for supervised sessions but under 50% by self-report and accelerometry.Satisfaction was high and there was no difference in this measure between all three groups.Between-group differences (comparing both GROUP and HOME to PT) were smaller than the minimum clinically important difference on most measures of QOL, fatigue, and fitness.However, two of six outcomes for GROUP and four of six outcomes for HOME had a > 20% probability of being inferior for GROUP.CONCLUSIONS: Feasibility endpoints were generally met.Both GROUP and HOME interventions in men with PC on ADT appeared to be similar to PT for multiple efficacy outcomes, although conclusions are limited by a small sample size and cost considerations have not been incorporated.Efforts need to be targeted to improving recruitment and adherence.A larger trial is warranted.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02046837 .Date of registration: January 20, 2014.",0,0,0,0

26291768,"Docetaxel Alone or in Combination With a Therapeutic Cancer Vaccine (PANVAC) in Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer: A Randomized Clinical Trial.IMPORTANCE: Previous phase 1 and 2 trials of PANVAC, a poxviral-based cancer vaccine, have suggested clinical efficacy in some patients with breast, ovarian, and colorectal cancer and have shown evidence of immunologic activity.Preclinical data have shown that docetaxel can modify tumor phenotype, making tumor cells more amenable to T cell-mediated killing.OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to determine if the treatment combination of docetaxel and PANVAC improves clinical outcomes in patients with metastatic breast cancer compared with docetaxel treatment alone.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Between May 2006 and February 2012, this open-label, phase 2 randomized clinical trial enrolled 48 patients with metastatic breast cancer of all subtypes, without limitation on other lines of previous therapy, to receive treatment with either docetaxel with PANVAC (arm A) or docetaxel alone (arm B).Final clinical data were collected on September 16, 2013.All patients were treated at either the National Cancer Institute or the Department of Breast Medical Oncology, MD Anderson Cancer Center.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS), using a phase 2.5 statistical design, with the intent of identifying a trend toward benefit (defined as 1-sided P</=.10) to guide a larger trial design.Secondary end points included safety and immunologic correlative studies.RESULTS: Forty-eight participants were enrolled: 25 were randomized to the combination treatment arm A, and 23 to arm B. No patient remained in the study at the time of the final analysis.Patient and tumor characteristics were well matched.Analysis of adverse events in both treatment arms demonstrated very little difference between the 2 groups.In the combination treatment arm (arm A), statistically significant increases were noted in the frequency of grades 1 and 2 edema (P=.02, likely related to greater median number of docetaxel cycles) and injection-site reactions (P<.001).In the final data analysis, median PFS was 7.9 months in arm A vs 3.9 months in arm B (hazard ratio, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.34-1.14]; P=.09).CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results suggest that the combination of PANVAC with docetaxel in metastatic breast cancer may provide a clinical benefit.This study was hypothesis generating and provides both rationale and statistical assumptions for a larger definitive randomized study.TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00179309.",1,1,1,0

Five-Year Outcomes of the RACS Sentinel Node Biopsy Versus Axillary Clearance (SNAC) 1 Trial: Assessment and Incidence of True Lymphedema.PURPOSE: To determine whether the benefits of sentinel-node-based management (SNBM) over routine axillary clearance (RAC) persisted to 5 years.METHODS: A total of 1088 women with breast cancer less than 3 cm in diameter and clinically negative axillary nodes were randomized to SNBM with axillary clearance if the sentinel node was positive or RAC preceded by sentinel-node biopsy.The outcomes were: (1) objectively measured change in the volume of the operated and contralateral nonoperated arms; (2) the proportion with an increase in arm volume <15%; and (3) subjectively assessed arm morbidity for the domains swelling, symptoms, dysfunction, and disability.Assessments were performed at 1 and 6 months after surgery and then annually.RESULTS: Limb volume increased progressively in the operated and nonoperated arms for 2 years and persisted unchanged to year 5, accompanied by weight gain.Correction by change in the nonoperated arm showed a mean volume increase of 70 mL in the RAC group and 26 mL in the SNBM group (P < 0.001) at 5 years.Only 28 patients (3.3%) had a corrected increase >15% from baseline (RAC 5.0% vs. SNBM 1.7%).Significant predictors were surgery type (RAC vs. SNBM), obesity, diabetes, palpable tumor, and weight gain exceeding 10% of baseline value.CONCLUSIONS: Subjective assessments revealed persisting patient concerns about swelling and symptoms but not overall disability at 5 years.Subjective scores were only moderately correlated with volume increase.SNAC1 has demonstrated that objective morbidity and subjective morbidity persist for 5 years after surgery and that SNBM significantly lowers the risk of both.",0,0,0,0
27983774,"Cost-effectiveness of indwelling pleural catheter compared with talc in malignant pleural effusion.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Malignant pleural effusion is associated with morbidity and mortality.A randomized controlled trial previously compared clinical outcomes and resource use with indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) and talc pleurodesis in this population.Using unpublished quality of life data, we estimate the cost-effectiveness of IPC compared with talc pleurodesis.METHODS: Healthcare utilization and costs were captured during the trial.Utility weights produced by the EuroQol Group five-dimensional three-level questionnaire and survival were used to determine quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained.The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated over the 1-year trial period.Sensitivity analysis used patient survival data and modelled additional nursing time required per week for catheter drainage.RESULTS: Utility scores, cost and QALYs gained did not differ significantly between groups.The ICER for IPC compared with talc was favorable at $US10 870 per QALY gained.IPC was less costly with a probability exceeding 95% of being cost-effective when survival was <14 weeks, and was more costly when 2-h nursing time per week was assumed for catheter drainage.CONCLUSION: IPC is cost-effective when compared with talc, although substantial uncertainty exists around this estimate.IPC appears most cost-effective in patients with limited survival.If significant nursing time is required for catheter drainage, IPC becomes less likely to be cost-effective.Either therapy may be considered as a first-line option in treating malignant pleural effusion in patients without history of prior pleurodesis, with consideration for patient survival, support and preferences.",0,0,0,0

29030001,"The occurrence and characteristics of endoscopically unexpected malignant degeneration in large rectal adenomas.BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Large non-pedunculated rectal polyps are most commonly resected by endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) or transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM).Despite pre-procedural diagnostics, unexpected rectal cancer is incidentally encountered within the resected specimen.This study aimed to compare the diagnostic assessment and procedural characteristics of lesions with and without unexpected submucosal invasion.METHODS: A post-hoc analysis of a multicenter randomized trial (TREND study) was performed in which patients with a non-pedunculated rectal polyp of >/=3 cm without endoscopic suspicion of invasive growth were randomized between EMR and TEM.RESULTS: Unexpected rectal cancer was detected in 13% (27/203) of patients; 15 after EMR and 12 after TEM.Most consisted of low-risk T1 cancers (78%, n = 18).There were no differences in the diagnostic assessment between lesions with and without unexpected submucosal invasion.Diagnostic biopsies revealed similar rates of high-grade dysplasia (28% [7/25] vs 18% [26/144]).When compared with EMR of adenomas, EMR procedures of unexpected cancers had a lower success rate of submucosal lifting (60% vs 93%, P < .001), were more often assessed as endoscopically incomplete (33% vs 10%, P = .01), and were more frequently terminated prematurely (60% vs 8%, P = .001).CONCLUSIONS: Diagnostic assessment of large non-pedunculated rectal polyps revealed similar characteristics between unexpected cancers and adenomas.Unexpected cancers during EMR were non-lifting in 40%, endoscopically assessed as incomplete in 33%, and terminated prematurely in 60%.In treatment-naive patients, these factors should raise suspicion of malignancy and need discussion in a multidisciplinary team meeting for decision on further treatment strategies.",0,0,0,0
25320361,"Tadalafil reduces myeloid-derived suppressor cells and regulatory T cells and promotes tumor immunity in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.PURPOSE: Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and regulatory T cells (Treg) play a key role in the progression of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).On the basis of our preclinical data demonstrating that phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibition can modulate these cell populations, we evaluated whether the PDE5 inhibitor tadalafil can revert tumor-induced immunosuppression and promote tumor immunity in patients with HNSCC.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: First, we functionally and phenotypically characterized MDSCs in HNSCCs and determined, retrospectively, whether their presence at the tumor site correlates with recurrence.Then, we performed a prospective single-center, double-blinded, randomized, three-arm study in which patients with HNSCC undergoing definitive surgical resection of oral and oropharyngeal tumors were treated with tadalafil 10 mg/day, 20 mg/day, or placebo for at least 20 days preoperatively.Blood and tumor MDSC and Treg presence and CD8(+) T-cell reactivity to tumor antigens were evaluated before and after treatment.RESULTS: MDSCs were characterized in HNSCC and their intratumoral presence significantly correlates with recurrence.Tadalafil treatment was well tolerated and significantly reduced both MDSCs and Treg concentrations in the blood and in the tumor (P < 0.05).In addition, the concentration of blood CD8(+) T cells reactive to autologous tumor antigens significantly increased after treatment (P < 0.05).Tadalafil immunomodulatory activity was maximized at an intermediate dose but not at higher doses.Mechanistic analysis suggests a possible off-target effect on PDE11 at high dosages that, by increasing intracellular cAMP, may negatively affect antitumor immunity.CONCLUSIONS: Tadalafil seems to beneficially modulate the tumor micro- and macro-environment in patients with HNSCC by lowering MDSCs and Tregs and increasing tumor-specific CD8(+) T cells in a dose-dependent fashion.",0,0,0,0
31606897,"Extending venous thromboembolism secondary prevention with apixaban in cancer patients: The EVE trial.BACKGROUND: Cancer-associated venous thromboembolism (VTE) carries a high rate of recurrence and death.Guidelines recommend continued anticoagulation therapy as long as active cancer persists.Apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily is the FDA-approved dose for secondary prevention regardless of VTE causation.Whether this apixaban dose is appropriate for secondary VTE prevention in cancer patients is not clear.The rationale and design of this investigator initiated phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, trial assessing apixaban 2.5 mg vs 5 mg twice daily for 12 months for the secondary VTE prevention in cancer patients (n = 370) who have completed 6 months (but no more than 12 months) of anticoagulation is provided (NCT03080883).METHODS/DESIGN: The primary study objective is to estimate differences in the combined rate of major plus clinically relevant non-major bleeding for apixaban 2.5 mg vs 5 mg twice daily.Secondary efficacy outcome is to assess rates of venous or arterial thromboembolism.Participating centers are chosen from the Academic and Community Cancer Research United (ACCRU) consortium.CONCLUSION: We anticipate these trial results to provide evidence supporting low-dose apixaban as a safe agent for secondary prevention of cancer-associated VTE for patients who have already completed 6-12 months of anticoagulation.",0,0,0,0
23652840,"The Liverpool Care Pathway for cancer patients dying in hospital medical wards: a before-after cluster phase II trial of outcomes reported by family members.BACKGROUND: Hospital is the most common place of cancer death but concerns regarding the quality of end-of-life care remain.AIM: Preliminary assessment of the effectiveness of the Liverpool Care Pathway on the quality of end-of-life care provided to adult cancer patients during their last week of life in hospital.DESIGN: Uncontrolled before-after intervention cluster trial.SETTINGS/PARTICIPANTS: The trial was performed within four hospital wards participating in the pilot implementation of the Italian version of the Liverpool Care Pathway programme.All cancer patients who died in the hospital wards 2-4 months before and after the implementation of the Italian version of Liverpool Care Pathway were identified.A total of 2 months after the patient's death, bereaved family members were interviewed using the Toolkit After-Death Family Interview (seven 0-100 scales assessing the quality of end-of-life care) and the Italian version of the Views of Informal Carers - Evaluation of Services (VOICES) (three items assessing pain, breathlessness and nausea-vomiting).RESULTS: An interview was obtained for 79 family members, 46 (73.0%) before and 33 (68.8%) after implementation of the Italian version of Liverpool Care Pathway.Following Italian version of Liverpool Care Pathway implementation, there was a significant improvement in the mean scores of four Toolkit scales: respect, kindness and dignity (+16.8; 95% confidence interval = 3.6-30.0; p = 0.015); family emotional support (+20.9; 95% confidence interval = 9.6-32.3; p < 0.001); family self-efficacy (+14.3; 95% confidence interval = 0.3-28.2; p = 0.049) and coordination of care (+14.3; 95% confidence interval = 4.2-24.3; p = 0.007).No significant improvement in symptom' control was observed.CONCLUSIONS: These results provide the first robust data collected from family members of a preliminary clinically significant improvement, in some aspects, of quality of care after the implementation of the Italian version of Liverpool Care Pathway programme.The poor effect for symptom control suggests areas for further innovation and development.",0,0,0,0
28962948,"Randomized Phase II Trial Comparing Chemoradiotherapy with Chemotherapy for Completely Resected Unsuspected N2-Positive Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.INTRODUCTION: We investigated whether concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) would increase survival in patients with completely resected unsuspected N2-positive NSCLC versus in patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy alone.METHODS: Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to either the CCRT arm or the chemotherapy arm.In the CCRT arm, patients received concurrent thoracic radiotherapy (50 Gy in 25 fractions) with five cycles of weekly paclitaxel (50 mg/m(2)) and cisplatin (25 mg/m(2)), followed by two additional cycles of paclitaxel (175 mg/m(2)) plus cisplatin (80 mg/m(2)) at 3-week intervals.In the chemotherapy arm, patients received four cycles of adjuvant paclitaxel (175 mg/m(2)) and carboplatin (area under the curve = 5.5) every 3 weeks.The primary end point was disease-free survival.RESULTS: We enrolled and analyzed 101 patients (51 received CCRT and 50 received chemotherapy).In all, 74 and 27 patients were preoperatively staged as N0 and N1 diseases, respectively.The baseline characteristics were well balanced between the two arms.The median disease-free survival of the CCRT arm was 24.7 months, which was not significantly different from that of the chemotherapy arm (21.9 months) (hazard ratio = 0.94, 95% confident interval: 0.58-1.52, p = 0.40).There was no difference in overall survival (74.3 months in CCRT arm and 83.5 months in the chemotherapy arm) (hazard ratio = 1.33, 95% confident interval: 0.71-2.49).CONCLUSIONS: There was no survival benefit from adjuvant CCRT compared with from platinum-based chemotherapy alone for completely resected unsuspected N2-positive NSCLC.However, the role of sequential radiotherapy administered after adjuvant chemotherapy is being evaluated, and further study is needed to evaluate the optimal radiotherapy approach for completely resected N2-positive NSCLC.",0,0,0,0
26531235,"Randomized prospective comparison of midline and off-midline closure techniques in pilonidal sinus surgery.BACKGROUND: Pilonidal sinus is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the intergluteal sulcus.The disorder often negatively affects patients' quality of life, and there are numerous possible methods of operative treatment for pilonidal sinus.The aim of our study was to compare the results of 3 different operative procedures (tension-free primary closure, Limberg flap, and Karydakis technique) used in the treatment of pilonidal disease.METHODS: The study was conducted via a prospective randomized design.The patients were randomized into 3 groups via a closed envelope method.Patients were included in the study after admission to our clinic with pilonidal sinus disease and operative treatment already were planned.The 2 main outcomes of the study were early complications from the methods used and later recurrences of the disease.RESULTS: A total of 150 patients were included in the study, and the groups were similar in terms of age, sex, and American Society of Anesthesiologists scores.The median follow-up time of the study was 24.2 months (range, 18.5-34.27) postsurgery.The recurrence rates were 6% for both the Limberg and Karydakis groups and 4% for the tension-free primary closure group.Therefore, there was no substantial difference in the recurrence rates.CONCLUSION: The search for an ideal treatment modality for pilonidal sinus disease is still ongoing.The main conclusion of our study is that a tension-free healing side is much more important than a midline suture line.Also, tension-free primary closure is as effective as a flap procedure, and it is also easier to perform.",0,0,0,0
24386491,"Neuromuscular electrical stimulation of the quadriceps in patients with non-small cell lung cancer receiving palliative chemotherapy: a randomized phase II study.BACKGROUND: A reduced exercise capacity is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Therapeutic exercise can be beneficial and neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) of the quadriceps muscles may represent a practical approach.The primary aim of this study was to determine the acceptability of NMES of the quadriceps to patients with NSCLC used alongside palliative chemotherapy.Secondary aims explored aspects of safety and efficacy of NMES in this setting.METHODS: Patients with advanced NSCLC due to receive first-line palliative chemotherapy were randomized to usual care with or without NMES.They were asked to undertake 30 minute sessions of NMES, ideally daily, but as a minimum, three times weekly.For NMES to be considered acceptable, it was predetermined that >/=80% of patients should achieve this minimum level of adherence.Qualitative interviews were held with a subset of patients to explore factors influencing adherence.Safety was assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events.Quadriceps muscle strength, thigh lean mass, and physical activity level were assessed at baseline and after three cycles of chemotherapy.RESULTS: 49 patients (28 male, median (IQR) age 69 (64-75) years) participated.Of 30 randomized to NMES, 18 were eligible for the primary endpoint, of whom 9 (50% [90% CI, 29 to 71]) met the minimum level of adherence.Adherence was enhanced by incorporating sessions into a daily routine and hindered by undesirable effects of chemotherapy.There were no serious adverse events related to NMES, nor significant differences in quadriceps muscle strength, thigh lean mass or physical activity level between groups.CONCLUSIONS: NMES is not acceptable in this setting, nor was there a suggestion of benefit.The need remains to explore NMES in patients with cancer in other settings.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN 42944026 www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN42944026.",0,0,0,0
23467957,"Use of irradiate animal pericardium membrane for prevention of Frey's syndrome after parotidectomy.BACKGROUND: Frey syndrome is a common complication that appears few months after parotid surgery with flushing and sweating of the parotid-temporal area during mastication.It presumably originates from an aberrant nervous regeneration in which the parasympathetic fibers of the parotid gland would combine themselves with the sympathetic fibers of the sweat glands and with the cutaneous vessels.AIM: In the present study we analyze the effectiveness of a collagenous membrane derived from animal pericardium (APM) to prevent Frey's syndrome after parotidectomy.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied a total of 40 patients with benign tumors of the parotid gland, including 30 patients with pleomorphic adenoma, 7 patients with Warthin tumor and 3 with basal cells adenoma.The patients were divided into 2 groups: group 1 (experimental n=20) executed superficial parotidectomy with replacement of bovine pericardial matrix (BPM); group 2 (control n=20) underwent superficial parotidectomy followed by reposition of superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS) flap.All patients were questioned over their subjective symptom and tested with Minor's test after 12 months from the intervention and introduced in a follow-up of 3 years.RESULTS: Subjectively Frey syndrome was referred in 5% of patients in group 1 and in 10% in group 2, while 0 cases were observed in group 1 after the starch-iodine test, 2 cases in group 2 (10%).CONCLUSIONS: Considering the present results, although this study needs further implementation, we can affirm that BPM is a valid option in preventing Frey's syndrome whereas SMAS flap is not available.",0,0,0,0

27433356,"Race or Resource? BMI, Race, and Other Social Factors as Risk Factors for Interlimb Differences among Overweight Breast Cancer Survivors with Lymphedema.Introduction.High BMI is a risk factor for upper body breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) onset.Black cancer survivors are more likely to have high BMI than White cancer survivors.While observational analyses suggest up to 2.2 times increased risk of BCRL onset for Black breast cancer survivors, no studies have explored race or other social factors that may affect BCRL severity, operationalized by interlimb volume difference (ILD).Materials and Methods.ILD was measured by perometry for 296 overweight (25 > BMI < 50) Black (n = 102) or White (n = 194) breast cancer survivors (>6 months from treatment) in the WISER Survivor trial.Multivariable linear regression examined associations between social and physical factors and ILD.Results.Neither Black race (-0.26, p = 0.89) nor BMI (0.22, p = 0.10) was associated with ILD.Attending college (-4.89, p = 0.03) was the strongest factor associated with ILD, followed by having more lymph nodes removed (4.75, p = 0.01), >25% BCRL care adherence (4.10, p = 0.01), and years since treatment (0.55, p < 0.001).Discussion.Neither race nor BMI was associated with ILD among overweight cancer survivors.Education, a proxy for resource level, was the strongest factor associated with greater ILD.Tailoring physical activity and weight loss interventions designed to address BCRL severity by resource rather than race should be considered.",0,0,0,0

24953276,"The rate of operative success achieved with radioguided occult lesion localization and intraoperative ultrasonography in patients with recurrent papillary thyroid cancer.BACKGROUND: To investigate the rate of operative success in excision of nonpalpable lymph nodes with metastatic disease achieved with radioguided occult lesion localization (ROLL) and intraoperative ultrasonography (IOUS) in patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC).METHODS: Twenty consecutive PTC patients with nonpalpable lymph nodes with metastatic disease localized in previously operated fields were randomized to receive ROLL (n = 11) or IOUS (n = 9).Nodes were excised along with adjacent soft tissue to accomplish a compartment-oriented dissection.The duration of operation, rate of postoperative complications, pre- and postoperative serum thyroglobulin (Tg) levels, and the findings of postoperative neck ultrasonography and postablation scan were recorded in all patients.Measures of operative success included a postoperative Tg level <50% of preoperative Tg level and no abnormal lesions on postoperative imaging.RESULTS: Histopathologic examination confirmed the excision of all preoperatively identified metastatic nodes.Additional nodes also were excised (2.3 +/- 3.3 per specimen in the ROLL group and 1.6 +/- 1.8 per specimen in the IOUS group), 23% of which were metastatic.No postoperative complications occurred in either group.The duration of operation was similar in the 2 groups (P = .4).Postoperative imaging confirmed the clearance of suspicious nodes in all patients.The rate of operative success in ROLL and IOUS group were 100% and 89%, respectively.CONCLUSION: In patients with recurrent PTC, a high rate of operative success in excision of nonpalpable metastatic lymph nodes was achieved by both ROLL and IOUS.We recommend compartment-oriented dissection; this approach may maximize the removal of metastatic nodes not identified by preoperative imaging.",0,0,0,0
25611313,"Paclitaxel/carboplatin with or without belinostat as empiric first-line treatment for patients with carcinoma of unknown primary site: A randomized, phase 2 trial.BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of belinostat, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, when added to paclitaxel/carboplatin in the empiric first-line treatment of patients with carcinoma of unknown primary site (CUP).METHODS: In this randomized phase 2 trial, previously untreated patients with CUP were randomized to receive belinostat plus paclitaxel/carboplatin (group A) or paclitaxel/carboplatin alone (group B) repeated every 21 days.Patients were re-evaluated every 2 cycles, and those without disease progression continued treatment for 6 cycles.Patients in group A then continued receiving single-agent belinostat, whereas patients in group B stopped treatment.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS): The authors postulated that the addition of belinostat would improve PFS from 5 months (expected with paclitaxel/carboplatin) to 8 months.RESULTS: In total, 89 patients were randomized (group A, n = 44; group B, n = 45), and the demographics and disease characteristics were balanced between the 2 groups.The addition of belinostat to paclitaxel/carboplatin did not improve PFS (group A, 5.4 months [95% confidence interval, 3.0-6.0 months]; group B, 5.3 months [95% confidence interval, 2.8-6.6 months]; P = .85).Overall survival was 12.4 months for group A versus 9.1 months for group B (P = .20).The response rate favored the belinostat group (45% vs 21%; P = .02).Belinostat resulted in a modest increase in treatment toxicity.CONCLUSIONS: The addition of belinostat to paclitaxel/carboplatin did not improve the PFS of patients with CUP who were receiving first-line therapy, although the patients who received belinostat had a higher investigator-assessed response rate.Future trials in CUP should focus on specific subsets, defined either by the predicted tissue of origin or by the identification of targetable molecular abnormalities.",0,0,0,0
30486814,"A process and mechanism of action evaluation of the effect of early and intensive nutrition care, delivered via telephone or mobile application, on quality of life in people with upper gastrointestinal cancer: a study protocol.BACKGROUND: Cancers of the upper gastrointestinal tract commonly result in malnutrition, which increases morbidity and mortality.Current nutrition best practice lacks a mechanism to provide early and intensive nutrition support to these patients.A 3-arm parallel randomised controlled trial is testing the provision of a tailored, nutritional counselling intervention delivered using a synchronous, telephone-based approach or an asynchronous, mobile application-based approach to address this problem.This protocol outlines the design and methods that will be used to undertake an evaluation of the implementation process, which is imperative for successful replication and dissemination.METHODS: A concurrent triangulation mixed methods comparative analysis will be undertaken.The nutrition intervention will be provided using best practice behaviour change techniques and communicated either via telephone or via mHealth.The implementation outcomes that will be measured are: fidelity to the nutrition intervention protocol and to the delivery approach; engagement; acceptability and contextual factors.Qualitative data from recorded telephone consultations and written messages will be analysed through a coding matrix against the behaviour change techniques outlined in the standard operating procedure, and also thematically to determine barriers and enablers.Negative binomial regression will be used to test for predictive relationships between intervention components with health-related quality of life and nutrition outcomes.Post-intervention interviews with participants and health professionals will be thematically analysed to determine the acceptability of delivery approaches.NVivo 11 Pro software will be used to code for thematic analysis.STATA version 15 will be used to perform quantitative analysis.DISCUSSION: The findings of this process evaluation will provide evidence of the core active ingredients that enable the implementation of best practice nutrition intervention for people with upper gastrointestinal cancer.Elucidation of the causal pathways of successful implementation and the important relationship to contextual delivery are anticipated.With this information, a strategy for sustained implementation across broader settings will be developed which impact the quality of life and nutritional status of individuals with upper gastrointestinal cancer.TRIAL REGISTRATION: 27th January 2017 Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry ( ACTRN12617000152325 ).",0,0,0,0

28756902,"Bevacizumab for advanced cervical cancer: final overall survival and adverse event analysis of a randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 3 trial (Gynecologic Oncology Group 240).BACKGROUND: On Aug 14, 2014, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the antiangiogenesis drug bevacizumab for women with advanced cervical cancer on the basis of improved overall survival (OS) after the second interim analysis (in 2012) of 271 deaths in the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) 240 trial.In this study, we report the prespecified final analysis of the primary objectives, OS and adverse events.METHODS: In this randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 3 trial, we recruited patients with metastatic, persistent, or recurrent cervical carcinoma from 81 centres in the USA, Canada, and Spain.Inclusion criteria included a GOG performance status score of 0 or 1; adequate renal, hepatic, and bone marrow function; adequately anticoagulated thromboembolism; a urine protein to creatinine ratio of less than 1; and measurable disease.Patients who had received chemotherapy for recurrence and those with non-healing wounds or active bleeding conditions were ineligible.We randomly allocated patients 1:1:1:1 (blocking used; block size of four) to intravenous chemotherapy of either cisplatin (50 mg/m(2) on day 1 or 2) plus paclitaxel (135 mg/m(2) or 175 mg/m(2) on day 1) or topotecan (0.75 mg/m(2) on days 1-3) plus paclitaxel (175 mg/m(2) on day 1) with or without intravenous bevacizumab (15 mg/kg on day 1) in 21 day cycles until disease progression, unacceptable toxic effects, voluntary withdrawal by the patient, or complete response.We stratified randomisation by GOG performance status (0 vs 1), previous radiosensitising platinum-based chemotherapy, and disease status (recurrent or persistent vs metastatic).We gave treatment open label.Primary outcomes were OS (analysed in the intention-to-treat population) and adverse events (analysed in all patients who received treatment and submitted adverse event information), assessed at the second interim and final analysis by the masked Data and Safety Monitoring Board.The cutoff for final analysis was 450 patients with 346 deaths.This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00803062.FINDINGS: Between April 6, 2009, and Jan 3, 2012, we enrolled 452 patients (225 [50%] in the two chemotherapy-alone groups and 227 [50%] in the two chemotherapy plus bevacizumab groups).By March 7, 2014, 348 deaths had occurred, meeting the prespecified cutoff for final analysis.The chemotherapy plus bevacizumab groups continued to show significant improvement in OS compared with the chemotherapy-alone groups: 16.8 months in the chemotherapy plus bevacizumab groups versus 13.3 months in the chemotherapy-alone groups (hazard ratio 0.77 [95% CI 0.62-0.95]; p=0.007).Final OS among patients not receiving previous pelvic radiotherapy was 24.5 months versus 16.8 months (0.64 [0.37-1.10]; p=0.11).Postprogression OS was not significantly different between the chemotherapy plus bevacizumab groups (8.4 months) and chemotherapy-alone groups (7.1 months; 0.83 [0.66-1.05]; p=0.06).Fistula (any grade) occurred in 32 (15%) of 220 patients in the chemotherapy plus bevacizumab groups (all previously irradiated) versus three (1%) of 220 in the chemotherapy-alone groups (all previously irradiated).Grade 3 fistula developed in 13 (6%) versus one (<1%).No fistulas resulted in surgical emergencies, sepsis, or death.INTERPRETATION: The benefit conferred by incorporation of bevacizumab is sustained with extended follow-up as evidenced by the overall survival curves remaining separated.After progression while receiving bevacizumab, we did not observe a negative rebound effect (ie, shorter survival after bevacizumab is stopped than after chemotherapy alone is stopped).These findings represent proof-of-concept of the efficacy and tolerability of antiangiogenesis therapy in advanced cervical cancer.FUNDING: National Cancer Institute.",0,0,0,0
27283862,"Occurrence and lung cancer probability of new solid nodules at incidence screening with low-dose CT: analysis of data from the randomised, controlled NELSON trial.BACKGROUND: US guidelines now recommend lung cancer screening with low-dose CT for high-risk individuals.Reports of new nodules after baseline screening have been scarce and are inconsistent because of differences in definitions used.We aimed to identify the occurrence of new solid nodules and their probability of being lung cancer at incidence screening rounds in the Dutch-Belgian Randomized Lung Cancer Screening Trial (NELSON).METHODS: In the ongoing, multicentre, randomised controlled NELSON trial, between Dec 23, 2003, and July 6, 2006, 15 822 participants who had smoked at least 15 cigarettes a day for more than 25 years or ten cigarettes a day for more than 30 years and were current smokers, or had quit smoking less than 10 years ago, were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive either screening with low-dose CT (n=7915) or no screening (n=7907).From Jan 28, 2004, to Dec 18, 2006, 7557 individuals underwent baseline screening with low-dose CT; 7295 participants underwent second and third screening rounds.We included all participants with solid non-calcified nodules, registered by the NELSON radiologists as new or smaller than 15 mm(3) (study detection limit) at previous screens.Nodule volume was generated semiautomatically by software.We calculated the maximum volume doubling time for nodules with an estimated percentage volume change of 25% or more, representing the minimum growth rate for the time since the previous scan.Lung cancer diagnosis was based on histology, and benignity was based on histology or stable size for at least 2 years.The NELSON trial is registered at trialregister.nl, number ISRCTN63545820.FINDINGS: We analysed data for participants with at least one solid non-calcified nodule at the second or third screening round.In the two incidence screening rounds, the NELSON radiologists registered 1222 new solid nodules in 787 (11%) participants.A new solid nodule was lung cancer in 49 (6%) participants with new solid nodules and, in total, 50 lung cancers were found, representing 4% of all new solid nodules.34 (68%) lung cancers were diagnosed at stage I. Nodule volume had a high discriminatory power (area under the receiver operating curve 0.795 [95% CI 0.728-0.862]; p<0.0001).Nodules smaller than 27 mm(3) had a low probability of lung cancer (two [0.5%] of 417 nodules; lung cancer probability 0.5% [95% CI 0.0-1.9]), nodules with a volume of 27 mm(3) up to 206 mm(3) had an intermediate probability (17 [3.1%] of 542 nodules; lung cancer probability 3.1% [1.9-5.0]), and nodules of 206 mm(3) or greater had a high probability (29 [16.9%] of 172 nodules; lung cancer probability 16.9% [12.0-23.2]).A volume cutoff value of 27 mm(3) or greater had more than 95% sensitivity for lung cancer.INTERPRETATION: Our study shows that new solid nodules are detected at each screening round in 5-7% of individuals who undergo screening for lung cancer with low-dose CT.These new nodules have a high probability of malignancy even at a small size.These findings should be considered in future screening guidelines, and new solid nodules should be followed up more aggressively than nodules detected at baseline screening.FUNDING: Zorgonderzoek Nederland Medische Wetenschappen and Koningin Wilhelmina Fonds Kankerbestrijding.",0,0,0,0

25524261,"Comparison of colonoscopic performance between medical and nurse endoscopists: a non-inferiority randomised controlled study in Asia.OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that trained nurse endoscopists are not inferior to medical endoscopists in finding adenomas during colonoscopy.DESIGN: This is a prospective, randomised, single-blind, non-inferiority study comparing nurses with medical endoscopists in performing screening colonoscopy.The nurse endoscopists had been trained according to the British Joint Advisory Group on GI Endoscopy curriculum and had completed at least 140 colonoscopic procedures prior to the study.The primary endpoint was the adenoma detection rate.Secondary endpoints included the caecal intubation rate, intubation time, complication rate, patient pain and satisfaction scores.RESULTS: We enrolled and analysed a total of 731 patients over a 15-month period.At least one adenoma was found in 159 (43.8%) of 363 patients by nurse endoscopists and 120 (32.7%) of 367 patients by medical endoscopists and a proportion difference of +11.1% compared with the medical endoscopists (95% CI 4.1% to 18.1%).The withdrawal time was, however, significantly longer among nurses (998 vs 575 s, p<0.001).After adjusting for differences in a regression analysis, colonoscopy by nurses was associated with a lower adenoma detection rate (OR 0.475: 95% CI 0.311 to 0.725).Nurse endoscopists had a lower caecal intubation rate (97.3% vs 100%), received better pain and satisfaction scores and had a high rate of patient acceptance.CONCLUSIONS: In this pragmatic trial, nurses can perform screening colonoscopy but require a longer procedural time to achieve a comparable adenoma detection rate as medical endoscopists.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT01923155.",0,0,0,0
28514458,"Effect of Expedited Microneedle-Assisted Photodynamic Therapy for Field Treatment of Actinic Keratoses: A Randomized Clinical Trial.Importance: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an effective and cosmetically favorable treatment modality for actinic keratoses (AKs).However, prolonged incubation times and pain associated with treatment are burdensome to the patient and a hindrance to widespread use of PDT as standard field therapy for AK.Objective: To evaluate efficacy and pain associated with microneedle expedited PDT.Design, Setting, and Participants: The Microneedle Photodynamic Therapy II (MNPDT-II) study was a randomized, single-blinded, split-face controlled, 2-arm clinical trial.Thirty-three participants with AK on the face were recruited in a university dermatology outpatient clinic from 2015 to 2016, and 32 participants completed the study.Interventions: Participants were randomized into 2 incubations arms, either 10-minute or 20-minute aminolevulinic acid (ALA) incubation times, after pretreatment with a microneedle roller (200 um) vs a sham roller.They were blinded to the laterality of microneedle and sham roller assignments.After incubation, they were exposed to blue light (Blu-U, Dusa Pharmaceuticals) for 1000 seconds for a total fluence of 10 J/cm2.Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was to quantitatively measure AK resolution, and the secondary outcome was to assess pain associated with microneedle pretreatment.Results: Thirty-three individuals were recruited and randomized to either the 20-minute or the 10-minute incubation arm.Thirty-two participants completed the study with a mean follow-up time of 34.5 days in the 20-minute group, and 30.2 days in the 10-minute group.For the 20-minute incubation arm, average AK clearance was 76% vs 58% on the sham side (P < .01), including 3 patients with complete clearance, although not statistically significant (P = .25).Pain assessment on the visual analog scale (VAS) during blue light illumination was not significantly different between the microneedle and sham sides (0.7 and 0.4; P = .28), respectively.For the 10-minute incubation arm AK clearance for the microneedle pretreated side was 43% compared with 38% on the sham side (P = .66).Pain during the blue light exposure was not significantly different between the microneedle and sham sides, 4.5 mm and 3.4 mm (P = .21), respectively.Conclusions and Relevance: Photodynamic therapy with microneedle pretreatment at a 20-minute ALA incubation time significantly improved AK clearance with efficacy similar to that of a conventional 1-hour ALA incubation time.The additional advantage to expedited treatment was that the procedure was virtually painless.However, expedited exposure of a 10-minute ALA incubation time did not reach significantly different AK clearance from the sham control.Trial Registration: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02594644.",0,0,0,0
29522362,"Quality of Life During Treatment With Chemohormonal Therapy: Analysis of E3805 Chemohormonal Androgen Ablation Randomized Trial in Prostate Cancer.Purpose Chemohormonal therapy with docetaxel and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT+D) for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer improves overall survival as compared with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) alone.We compared the quality of life (QOL) between patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer who were treated with ADT+D and those who were treated with ADT alone.Methods Men were randomly assigned to ADT+ D (six cycles) or to ADT alone.QOL was assessed by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P), FACT-Taxane, Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue, and the Brief Pain Inventory at baseline and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to examine changes over time.Mixed-effect models compared the QOL between arms at each time point.Results Seven hundred ninety men were randomly assigned (ADT+D [n = 397] and ADT[ n = 393]) and completed FACT-P (90% at baseline, 86% at 3 months, 83% at 6 months, 78% at 9 months, and 77% at 12 months).ADT+D patients reported a statistically significant decline in FACT-P at 3 months ( P < .001) but FACT-P did not differ significantly between baseline and 12 months ( P = .38).ADT+D FACT-P scores were significantly lower at 3 months ( P = .02) but significantly higher at 12 months ( P = .04) when compared with ADT FACT-P scores.Differences did not exceed the minimal clinically important difference at any time point.ADT+D patients reported significantly lower Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue scores at 3 months than did ADT patients ( P < .001).Over time, both arms reported significantly poorer FACT-Taxane scores ( P < .001) when compared with baseline.Brief Pain Inventory scores were similar between arms.Conclusion Although ADT+D was associated with statistically worse QOL at 3 months, QOL was better at 12 months for ADT+D patients than for ADT patients.Both arms reported a similar minimally changed QOL over time, suggesting that ADT+D is not associated with a greater long-term negative impact on QOL.",1,1,1,1
23835819,"Telephone outreach to increase colon cancer screening in medicaid managed care organizations: a randomized controlled trial.PURPOSE: Health Plans are uniquely positioned to deliver outreach to members.We explored whether telephone outreach, delivered by Medicaid managed care organization (MMCO) staff, could increase colorectal cancer (CRC) screening among publicly insured urban women, potentially reducing disparities.METHODS: We conducted an 18-month randomized clinical trial in 3 MMCOs in New York City in 2008-2010, randomizing 2,240 MMCO-insured women, aged 50 to 63 years, who received care at a participating practice and were overdue for CRC screening.MMCO outreach staff provided cancer screening telephone support, educating patients and helping overcome barriers.The primary outcome was the number of women screened for CRC during the 18-month intervention, assessed using claims.RESULTS: MMCO staff reached 60% of women in the intervention arm by telephone.Although significantly more women in the intervention (36.7%) than in the usual care (30.6%) arm received CRC screening (odds ratio [OR] = 1.32; 95% CI, 1.08-1.62), increases varied from 1.1% to 13.7% across the participating MMCOs, and the overall increase was driven by increases at 1 MMCO.In an as-treated comparison, 41.8% of women in the intervention arm who were reached by telephone received CRC screening compared with 26.8% of women in the usual care arm who were not contacted during the study (OR = 1.84; 95% CI, 1.38, 2.44); 7 women needed to be reached by telephone for 1 to become screened.CONCLUSIONS: The telephone outreach intervention delivered by MMCO staff increased CRC screening by 6% more than usual care among randomized women, and by 15.1% more than usual care among previously overdue women reached by the intervention.Our research-based intervention was successfully translated to the health plan arena, with variable effects in the participating MMCOs.",0,0,0,0
28383379,"Effect of a pH-Balanced Vaginal Gel on Dyspareunia and Sexual Function in Breast Cancer Survivors Who Were Premenopausal at Diagnosis: A Randomized Controlled Trial.OBJECTIVE: To assess whether a pH-balanced vaginal gel containing lactic acid is more effective than a placebo (lactate-free gel) in improving dyspareunia and sexual function among breast cancer survivors who were premenopausal at diagnosis and had dyspareunia after adjuvant chemotherapy.METHODS: In a single-center, double-blind, randomized trial, a pH-balanced gel or placebo was administered three times per week at bedtime as well as during sexual intercourse for 8 weeks.The primary outcome was the improvement of dyspareunia measured by pain score of the Female Sexual Function Index after the treatment.Secondary outcomes included the total and individual domains of Female Sexual Function Index score, sexual dysfunction (a total Female Sexual Function Index score less than 25.0), vaginal pH, vaginal maturation index, and adverse events related to the intervention.A sample size of 47 per group was planned to achieve 80% power to detect a 19% difference in the primary outcome.RESULTS: From October 2009 and March 2013, 167 women were screened and 136 were randomized: 69 to a pH-balanced gel and 67 to placebo.Baseline characteristics were similar in both groups.Although there was no difference between the two groups, both experienced a significant improvement of dyspareunia.The increase in median pain score from baseline was 1.2 in both groups (median [interquartile range] from 2.8 [2.0-4.0] to 4.0 [2.8-4.8] in the pH-balanced group and from 3.2 [2.0-4.0] to 4.4 [3.2-4.8] in the placebo group; all P<.01).Overall Female Sexual Function Index score and the frequency of sexual dysfunction also did not differ between the two groups although there was a significant improvement.On the other hand, vaginal pH and vaginal maturation index were slightly but significantly improved only in the pH-balanced group.There were no severe adverse events in either group.CONCLUSION: The pH-balanced vaginal gel is not superior to the placebo in improving dyspareunia and overall sexual function.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, https://www.clinicaltrials.gov, NCT00981305.",0,0,0,0
23388205,"A preliminary exploration of the feasibility of offering men information about potential prostate cancer treatment options before they know their biopsy results.BACKGROUND: A small pre-test study was conducted to ascertain potential harm and anxiety associated with distributing information about possible cancer treatment options at the time of biopsy, prior to knowledge about a definitive cancer diagnosis.Priming men about the availability of multiple options before they have a confirmed diagnosis may be an opportunity to engage patients in more informed decision-making.METHODS: Men with an elevated PSA test or suspicious Digital Rectal Examination (DRE) who were referred to a urology clinic for a biopsy were randomized to receive either the clinic's usual care (UC) biopsy instruction sheet (n = 11) or a pre-biopsy educational (ED) packet containing the biopsy instruction sheet along with a booklet about the biopsy procedure and a prostate cancer treatment decision aid originally written for newly diagnosed men that described in detail possible treatment options (n = 18).RESULTS: A total of 62% of men who were approached agreed to be randomized, and 83% of the ED group confirmed they used the materials.Anxiety scores were similar for both groups while awaiting the biopsy procedure, with anxiety scores trending lower in the ED group: 41.2 on a prostate-specific anxiety instrument compared to 51.7 in the UC group (p = 0.13).ED participants reported better overall quality of life while awaiting biopsy compared to the UC group (76.4 vs. 48.5, p = 0.01).The small number of men in the ED group who went on to be diagnosed with cancer reported being better informed about the risks and side effects of each option compared to men diagnosed with cancer in the UC group (p = 0.07).In qualitative discussions, men generally reported they found the pre-biopsy materials to be helpful and indicated having information about possible treatment options reduced their anxiety.However, 2 of 18 men reported they did not want to think about treatment options until after they knew their biopsy results.CONCLUSIONS: In this small sample offering pre-biopsy education about potential treatment options was generally well received by patients, appeared to be beneficial to men who went on to be diagnosed, and did not appear to increase anxiety unnecessarily among those who had a negative biopsy.",0,0,0,0
31730474,"The feasibility of web surveys for obtaining patient-reported outcomes from cancer survivors: a randomized experiment comparing survey modes and brochure enclosures.BACKGROUND: Central cancer registries are often used to survey population-based samples of cancer survivors.These surveys are typically administered via paper or telephone.In most populations, web surveys obtain much lower response rates than paper surveys.This study assessed the feasibility of web surveys for collecting patient-reported outcomes via a central cancer registry.METHODS: Potential participants were sampled from Utah Cancer Registry records.Sample members were randomly assigned to receive a web or paper survey, and then randomized to either receive or not receive an informative brochure describing the cancer registry.We calculated adjusted risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals to compare response likelihood and the demographic profile of respondents across study arms.RESULTS: The web survey response rate (43.2%) was lower than the paper survey (50.4%), but this difference was not statistically significant (adjusted risk ratio = 0.88, 95% confidence interval = 0.72, 1.07).The brochure also did not significantly influence the proportion responding (adjusted risk ratio = 1.03, 95% confidence interval = 0.85, 1.25).There were few differences in the demographic profiles of respondents across the survey modes.Older age increased likelihood of response to a paper questionnaire but not a web questionnaire.CONCLUSIONS: Web surveys of cancer survivors are feasible without significantly influencing response rates, but providing a paper response option may be advisable particularly when surveying older individuals.Further examination of the varying effects of brochure enclosures across different survey modes is warranted.",0,0,0,0

26839145,"Prognostic Impact of IL6 Genetic Variants in Patients with Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Treated with Bevacizumab-Based Chemotherapy.PURPOSE: The IL6/STAT3 axis promotes inflammation, angiogenesis, and cancer.The effect of genetic variants within this pathway on benefit from antiangiogenic cancer therapy is unknown.We tested whether SNPs in genes involved in IL6/STAT3 signaling can predict efficacy of bevacizumab-based chemotherapy in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Associations between potentially functional IL6 (rs2069837 and rs1800795) and STAT3 (rs744166 and rs4796793) SNPs and clinical outcomes [progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival, and tumor response rate] were evaluated in mCRC patients receiving first-line FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab in two randomized phase III trials: TRIBE (n = 223, training cohort) and FIRE-3 (n = 288, validation cohort).Patients receiving FOLFIRI plus cetuximab in FIRE-3 (n = 264) served as a control cohort.The interaction between genotype and primary tumor location with clinical outcomes was examined.Genomic DNA isolated from whole blood or tumor tissue was analyzed by PCR-based direct sequencing.RESULTS: Patients with an IL6 rs2069837 G allele treated with FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab had an inferior PFS than those with the A/A genotype in TRIBE [9.4 vs. 11.1 months; HR = 1.53; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.12-2.10; P = 0.004] and FIRE-3 (8.8 vs. 10.9 months; HR = 1.40; 95% CI, 1.06-1.85; P = 0.015).These associations were confirmed in multivariable analyses and were not seen in the control cohort.In subgroup analysis, the effect of IL6 rs2069837 on PFS was present only in patients with left-sided cancers, but the test for interaction was not significant.CONCLUSIONS: IL6 rs2069837 genotype is a clinically relevant prognostic factor in mCRC patients treated with first-line bevacizumab-based chemotherapy.Clin Cancer Res; 22(13); 3218-26.(c)2016 AACR.",0,0,0,0
23632052,"Guided paravertebral blocks with versus without clonidine for women undergoing breast surgery: a prospective double-blinded randomized study.BACKGROUND: Paravertebral blocks (PVBs) have been introduced as an alternative to general anesthesia for breast cancer surgeries.The addition of clonidine as an adjuvant in PVBs may enhance quality and duration of analgesia and significantly reduce the consumption of analgesics after breast surgery.In this prospective randomized double-blind study, we assessed the significance of adding clonidine to the anesthetic mixture for women undergoing mastectomy.METHODS: Sixty patients were randomized equally into 2 groups, both of which received PVB block, either with or without clonidine.Analgesic consumption was noted up to 2 weeks after the operation.A visual analog scale was used to assess pain postoperatively during the hospital stay, and a numeric rating scale was used when patients were discharged.RESULTS: Analgesic consumption was significantly lower in the clonidine group 48 hours postoperatively with 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference (-69.5% to -6.6%).Pain scores at rest showed significant reduction in the clonidine group during the period from 24 to 72 hours postoperatively with 95% CI for the ratios of 2 means (1.09-3.61), (2.04-9.04), and (2.54-16.55), respectively, with shoulder movement at 24, 48, and 72 hours postoperatively 95% CI for the ratio of 2 means (1.10-3.15), (1.32-6.38), and (1.33-8.42), respectively.The time needed to resume daily activity was shorter in the clonidine group compared with the control group with 95% CI for the ratio of 2 means (1.14-1.62).CONCLUSION: The addition of clonidine enhanced the analgesic efficacy of PVB up to 3 days postoperatively for patients undergoing breast surgery.",1,1,0,0
26964032,"Long-term impact of preeclampsia on maternal endometrial cancer risk.BACKGROUND: Endometrial cancer is mainly dependent on oestrogen exposure.Preeclampsia has shown to reduce oestrogen levels hence preeclampsia may affect later endometrial cancer risk.METHODS: We conducted a case-control study of 523 Danish women with endometrial cancer and 52 299controls during 1978-2010.The association between preeclampsia and later endometrial cancer was evaluated overall and according to preeclampsia onset and type of endometrial cancer in conditional logistic regression models.RESULTS: We observed no overall association between preeclampsia and endometrial cancer risk (OR=1.11 (95% CI 0.68-1.81)).This was true for all endometrial cancer subtypes.In an analysis of preeclampsia onset, however, we report a markedly increased risk of endometrial cancer following early-onset preeclampsia (OR=2.64 (95% CI 1.29-5.38)).CONCLUSIONS: Although we report no obvious association between preeclampsia and endometrial cancer, studying the subset of early-onset preeclampsia may prove fruitful in further understanding the aetiology of endometrial cancer.",0,0,0,0

30998694,"""Hey, that could be me"": The role of similarity in narrative persuasion.Stories are often used in health communication because of accumulating evidence of their potential to affect people's attitudes and health behavioral intentions.Similarity between the reader and the story's protagonist appears to positively influence narrative persuasion, but the exact role of similarity on persuasive outcomes is debated, as some research finds clear effects of similarity manipulations whereas others do not.Possibly, these mixed results were found because the similarity manipulations were not always relevant to the topic of the story.We conducted an experiment (N = 582) in which we varied the age and gender of the protagonist, features that were of central relevance to the story's topic, namely breast cancer versus testicular cancer.There were two groups of participants: 324 students (mean age: 21.46 years) and 258 older adults (mean age: 56.83 years).Age similarity (but not gender similarity) had an effect on identification with the protagonist, transportation (i.e. the experience of being absorbed into a story), and the intention to donate, but only for students.For older adults, age or gender of the protagonist did not seem to matter, as nearly no differences in persuasive measures were found.As far as the underlying mechanism is concerned, the results of structural equation modeling showed that the concept of 'perceived similarity' would be a relevant addition to models of narrative persuasion, as it was significantly related to the narrative processes of transportation and identification, which, in turn, predicted attitudes and behavioral intentions, both directly-in the case of transportation-or indirectly, via the emotion of compassion.We conclude that both manipulated and perceived similarity are important for narrative persuasion, and that it should be kept on the research agenda of health communication.",0,0,0,0

22520631,"Ability of C-reactive protein to complement multiple prognostic classifiers in men with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer receiving docetaxel-based chemotherapy.UNLABELLED: What's known on the subject? and What does the study add?Serum C-reactive protein (C-reactive protein) is emerging as a potential novel prognostic factor in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).In the present study, a prospective trial was investigated retrospectively and a significant prognostic impact for C-reactive protein that was independent of multiple published prognostic models was identified in men receiving docetaxel-based chemotherapy for mCRPC.Prospective validation is warranted.OBJECTIVE: * Given the recent emergence of C-reactive protein levels as a novel prognostic factor in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), we sought to evaluate the independent prognostic ability of C-reactive protein in the context of published prognostic nomograms, risk grouping and disease state models in men receiving docetaxel-based chemotherapy for mCRPC.PATIENTS AND METHODS: * A large randomized phase II trial (CS-205) of mCRPC patients who received docetaxel-prednisone + AT-101 (Bcl-2 inhibitor) or docetaxel-prednisone + placebo was analyzed retrospectively (n= 220).* Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and measures of discriminatory ability were assessed in a hypothesis-generating analysis using Cox regression and concordance probabilities.* Patients from both treatment groups were combined for this analysis because no significant differences in outcomes were observed.* Because some factors used in nomograms were not collected or defined differently, risk was estimated based on slightly modified versions of nomograms.RESULTS: * C-reactive protein was independently prognostic for OS and PFS (P </= 0.002) after adjusting for all modeled risk estimates and classifiers.* C-reactive protein showed a concordance probability of 0.65 for both OS and PFS.* A 10-factor modified prognostic model based on the TAX327 trial had the greatest observed discrimination ability for OS and PFS (concordance probability = 0.623 and 0.603, respectively) among the modified nomograms or classifiers.* Adding the TAX327 model risk estimates to C-reactive protein did not substantially increase discrimination ability over C-reactive protein alone.CONCLUSIONS: * Current prognostic classifications provide modest discrimination of outcomes in mCRPC receiving docetaxel-based chemotherapy, highlighting the need for improved risk-based models.* Baseline C-reactive protein appears to be an useful, independent prognostic factor and prospective external validation is warranted.",0,0,0,0

28504995,"Remote Ischemic Preconditioning Decreases Oxidative Lung Damage After Pulmonary Lobectomy: A Single-Center Randomized, Double-Blind, Controlled Trial.BACKGROUND: During lobectomy in patients with lung cancer, the operated lung is often collapsed and hypoperfused.Ischemia/reperfusion injury may then occur when the lung is re-expanded.We hypothesized that remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) would decrease oxidative lung damage and improve gas exchange in the postoperative period.METHODS: We conducted a single-center, randomized, double-blind trial in patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer undergoing elective lung lobectomy.Fifty-three patients were randomized to receive limb RIPC immediately after anesthesia induction (3 cycles: 5 minutes ischemia/5 minutes reperfusion induced by an ischemia cuff applied on the thigh) and/or control therapy without RIPC.Oxidative stress markers were measured in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) and arterial blood immediately after anesthesia induction and before RIPC and surgery (T0, baseline); during operated lung collapse, immediately before resuming two-lung ventilation (TLV) (T1); immediately after resuming TLV (T2); and 120 minutes after resuming TLV (T3).The primary outcome was 8-isoprostane levels in EBC at T1, T2, and T3.Secondary outcomes included the following: NO2+NO3, H2O2 levels, and pH in EBC and in blood (8-isoprostane, NO2+NO3) and pulmonary gas exchange variables (PaO2/FiO2, A-aDO2, a/A ratio, and respiratory index).RESULTS: Patients subjected to RIPC had lower EBC 8-isoprostane levels when compared with controls at T1, T2, and T3 (differences between means and 95% confidence intervals): -15.3 (5.8-24.8), P = .002; -20.0 (5.5-34.5), P = .008; and -10.4 (2.5-18.3), P = .011, respectively.In the RIPC group, EBC NO2+NO3 and H2O2 levels were also lower than in controls at T2 and T1-T3, respectively (all P < .05).Blood levels of 8-isoprostane and NO2+NO3 were lower in the RIPC group at T2 (P < .05).The RIPC group had better PaO2/FiO2 compared with controls at 2 hours, 8 hours, and 24 hours after lobectomy in 95% confidence intervals for differences between means: 78 (10-146), 66 (14-118), and 58 (12-104), respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Limb RIPC decreased EBC 8-isoprostane levels and other oxidative lung injury markers during lung lobectomy.RIPC also improved postoperative gas exchange as measured by PaO2/FiO2 ratio.",1,1,0,0
23636449,"Prophylaxis of catheter-related deep vein thrombosis in cancer patients with low-dose warfarin, low molecular weight heparin, or control: a randomized, controlled, phase III study.PURPOSE: Whether an anticoagulant prophylaxis is needed for patients with cancer with a central venous catheter is a highly controversial subject.We designed a study to compare different prophylactic strategies over 3 months of treatment.METHODS: We performed a phase III prospective, open-label randomized trial.After the insertion of a central venous access device, consecutive patients with planned chemotherapy for cancer were randomized to no anticoagulant prophylaxis, low molecular weight heparin [low molecular weight heparin (LMWH); with isocoagulation doses], or warfarin 1 mg/day.Treatments were given over the first 3 months.Doppler ultrasound and venographies were performed on days 1 and 90, respectively, or sooner in case of clinical presumption of thrombosis.RESULTS: A total of 420 patients were randomized, and 407 were evaluable.Forty-two catheter-related deep vein thrombosis (DVT) occurred (10.3 %), 20 in those with no anticoagulation, 8 in those receiving warfarin, and 14 in those receiving LMWH.Nine additional non-related catheter deep vein thrombosis (CDVT) occurred.Anticoagulation significantly reduced the incidence of catheter-related DVT (p = 0.035) and catheter non-related DVT (p = 0.007), with no difference between warfarin and LMWH.Safety was good (3.4 % of attributable events) but compliance with randomized prophylaxis was lower than expected.CONCLUSIONS: Prophylaxis showed a benefit regarding catheter-related and non-catheter-related DVT with no increase in serious side effects.",0,0,0,0
27112319,"Protocol of a randomized controlled trial of the fear of recurrence therapy (FORT) intervention for women with breast or gynecological cancer.BACKGROUND: Clinically significant levels of fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) affect up to 49% of cancer survivors and are more prevalent among women.FCR is associated with psychological distress, lower quality of life, and increased use of medical resources.Despite its prevalence, FCR is poorly addressed in clinical care.To address this problem, we first developed, and pilot tested a 6-week, 2 h, Cognitive-existential group intervention therapy that targeted FCR in survivors of breast or gynecological cancer.Following the positive outcome of the pilot, we are now testing this approach in a randomized clinical trial (RCT).Goal and hypotheses: This multicenter, prospective RCT aims to test the efficacy of the intervention.The study hypotheses are that, compared to a control group, cancer survivors participating in the intervention (1) will have less FCR, (2) will show more favorable outcomes on the following measures: cancer-specific distress, quality of life, illness uncertainty, intolerance of uncertainty, perceived risk of cancer recurrence, and coping skills.We further postulate that the between-group differences will persist three and 6 months post-intervention.METHODS: Sixteen groups of seven to nine women are being allocated to the intervention or the control group.The control group receives a 6-week, 2 h, structurally equivalent support group.We are recruiting 144 cancer survivors from four hospital sites in three Canadian cities.The sample size was based on the moderate pre/post-test changes found in our pilot study and adjusted to the drop-out rates.MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome, FCR, is measured by the Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory.Secondary outcomes measured include cancer-specific distress, perceived risk of cancer recurrence, illness uncertainty, intolerance of uncertainty, coping, and quality of life.We use reliable and recognized valid scales.Participants are to complete the questionnaire package at four times: before the first group session (baseline), immediately after the sixth session, and 3 and 6 months post-intervention.ANALYSIS: In the descriptive analysis, comparison of group equivalent baseline variables, identification of confounding/intermediate variables and univariate analysis are planned.Each participant's trajectory is calculated using Generalized Estimating Equation models to determine the time and group effects, after considering the correlation structures of the groups.An intent-to-treat analysis approach may be adopted.DISCUSSION: Our Fear of Recurrence Therapy (FORT) intervention has direct implications for clinical service development to improve the quality of life for patients with breast (BC) and gynecological cancer (GC).Based on our pilot data, we are confident that the FORT intervention can guide the development of effective psychosocial cancer survivorship interventions to reduce FCR and improve psychological functioning among women with BC or GC.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Dr. Christine Maheu registered the trial with ISRCTN registry (Registration number: ISRCTN83539618, date assigned 03/09/2014).",0,0,0,0
29709558,"Bursectomy versus omentectomy alone for resectable gastric cancer (JCOG1001): a phase 3, open-label, randomised controlled trial.BACKGROUND: The role of bursectomy, in which the peritoneal lining covering the pancreas and the anterior plane of the transverse mesocolon are dissected, has long been controversial for preventing peritoneal metastasis.We investigated the survival benefit of bursectomy in patients with resectable gastric cancer.METHODS: This phase 3, open-label, randomised controlled trial was done at 57 hospitals in Japan.Patients aged 20-80 years who had cT3(SS)-cT4a(SE) histologically proven gastric adenocarcinoma with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 and body-mass index less than 30 kg/m(2) and who did not have distant metastasis or bulky lymph nodes were randomly assigned (1:1) during surgery to receive omentectomy alone (non-bursectomy) or bursectomy.Randomisation was done by telephone or website to the Japan Clinical Oncology Group Data Center and used a minimisation method with a random component to adjust for institution, cT status (T3 vs T4a), and type of gastrectomy (distal vs total).Both groups had total or distal gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy.The primary endpoint was overall survival, analysed in the intention-to-treat population.The study is registered with UMIN-CTR, number UMIN000003688.FINDINGS: Between June 1, 2010, and March 30, 2015, 1503 patients were enrolled based on preoperative inclusion and exclusion criteria.Intraoperative inclusion and exclusion criteria were met in 1204 patients, of which 602 were allocated to the non-bursectomy group and 602 were allocated to the bursectomy group.At the planned second interim analysis on Sept 17, 2016, the JCOG Data and Safety Monitoring Committee independently reviewed the results and recommended their early publication on the basis of futility because overall survival was lower in the bursectomy group than the non-bursectomy group, and because the predictive probability of overall survival being significantly higher in bursectomy than non-bursectomy patients at the final analysis was only 12.7%.5-year overall survival was 76.7% (95% CI 72.0-80.6) in the non-bursectomy group and 76.9% (72.6-80.7) in the bursectomy group (hazard ratio 1.05, 95% CI 0.81-1.37, one-sided p=0.65).64 (11%) of 601 in the non-bursectomy group and 77 (13%) of 600 patients in the bursectomy group had grade 3-4 operative morbidity.Pancreatic fistula was significantly more common in the bursectomy group than in the non-bursectomy group (29 [5%] vs 15 [2%]; p=0.032).Six deaths occurred either in hospital or within 1 month of surgery: five in the non-bursectomy group and one in the bursectomy group.INTERPRETATION: Bursectomy did not provide a survival advantage over non-bursectomy.D2 dissection with omentectomy alone should be done as a standard surgery for resectable cT3-T4a gastric cancer.FUNDING: Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan, and the National Cancer Centre Research and Development Fund.",0,0,0,0

23222500,"When does an episode of care for cancer begin?BACKGROUND: Little is known about the medical care resources devoted to diagnosing and treating cancer-related symptoms before a definitive cancer diagnosis.Previous research using SEER-Medicare data to measure incremental costs and utilization associated with cancer started with the date of diagnosis.We hypothesized that health care use increases before diagnosis of a new primary cancer.METHODS: We used a longitudinal case-control design to estimate incremental medical care utilization rates.Cases were 121,293 persons enrolled between January 2000 and December 2008 with >/=1 primary cancers.We selected 522,839 controls randomly from among all health plan members who had no tumor registry evidence of cancer before January 2009, and we frequency matched controls to cancer cases on a 5:1 ratio by age group, sex, and having health plan eligibility in the year of diagnosis of the index cancer case.Utilization data were extracted for all cases and controls for the period 2000 to 2008 from standardized distributed data warehouses.To determine when and the extent to which patterns of medical care use change preceding a cancer diagnosis, we compute hospitalization rates, hospital days, emergency department visits, same-day surgical procedures, ambulatory medical office visits, imaging procedures, laboratory tests, and ambulatory prescription dispensings per 1000 persons per month within integrated delivery systems.RESULTS: One- to 3-fold increases in monthly utilization rates were observed during the 3 to 5 months before a cancer diagnosis, compared with matched noncancer control groups.This pattern was consistent for both aged and nonaged cancer patients.Aged cancer patients had higher utilization rates than nonaged cancer patients throughout the year before a cancer diagnosis.CONCLUSIONS: The prediagnosis phase is a resource-intensive component of cancer care episodes and should be included in cost of cancer estimates.More research is needed to determine whether reliable prognostic markers can be identified as the start of a cancer episode before a pathology-based diagnosis.",0,0,0,0

26897518,"TOPical Imiquimod treatment of high-grade Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (TOPIC trial): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) is the premalignant condition of cervical cancer.Whereas not all high grade CIN lesions progress to cervical cancer, the natural history and risk of progression of individual lesions remain unpredictable.Therefore, high-grade CIN is currently treated by surgical excision: large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ).This procedure has potential complications, such as acute haemorrhage, prolonged bleeding, infection and preterm birth in subsequent pregnancies.These complications could be prevented by development of a non-invasive treatment modality, such as topical imiquimod treatment.The primary study objective is to investigate the efficacy of topical imiquimod 5% cream for the treatment of high-grade CIN and to develop a biomarker profile to predict clinical response to imiquimod treatment.Secondary study objectives are to assess treatment side-effects, disease recurrence and quality of life during and after different treatment modalities.METHODS/DESIGN: The study design is a randomized controlled trial.One hundred forty women with a histological diagnosis of high-grade CIN (CIN 2-3) will be randomized into two arms: imiquimod treatment during 16 weeks (experimental arm) or immediate LLETZ (standard care arm).Treatment efficacy will be evaluated by colposcopy with diagnostic biopsies at 20 weeks for the experimental arm.Successful imiquimod treatment is defined as regression to CIN 1 or less, successful LLETZ treatment is defined as PAP 1 after 6 months.Disease recurrence will be evaluated by cytology at 6, 12 and 24 months after treatment.Side-effects will be evaluated using a standardized report form.Quality of life will be evaluated using validated questionnaires at baseline, 20 weeks and 1 year after treatment.Biomarkers, reflecting both host and viral factors in the pathophysiology of CIN, will be tested at baseline with the aim of developing a predictive biomarker profile for the clinical response to imiquimod treatment.DISCUSSION: Treatment of high-grade CIN lesions with imiquimod in a selected patient population may diminish complications as a result of surgical intervention.More knowledge on treatment efficacy, side effects and long-term recurrence rates after treatment is necessary.TRIAL REGISTRATION: EU Clinical Trials Register EU-CTR2013-001260-34 .Registered 18 March 2013.Medical Ethical Committee approval number: NL44336.068.13 (Medical Ethical Committee Maastricht University Hospital, University of Maastricht).Affiliation: Maastricht University Hospital.Registration number ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02329171.",1,1,1,1

30357310,"Dose tailoring of adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer based on hematologic toxicities: further results from the prospective PANTHER study with focus on obese patients.Background: Adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) for breast cancer improves relapse-free survival (BCRFS) and overall survival.Differences in terms of efficacy and toxicity could partly be explained by the significant interpatient variability in pharmacokinetics which cannot be captured by dosing according to body surface area.Consequently, tailored dosing was prospectively evaluated in the PANTHER trial.Patients and methods: PANTHER is a multicenter, open-label, randomized phase III trial which compared tailored, dose-dense (DD) epirubicin/cyclophosphamide (E/C) and tailored docetaxel (D) (tDD) with standard interval 5-fluorouracil/E/C and D. The primary end point was BCRFS and the primary efficacy analysis has been previously published.In this secondary analysis, we aimed to retrospectively explore the concept of dose tailoring.Our two hypotheses were that BCRFS would not vary depending on the cumulative administered epirubicin dose; and that dose tailoring would lead to appropriate dosing and improved outcomes for obese patients, who are known to have worse prognosis and increased toxicity after DD ACT.Results: Patients treated with tDD had similar BCRFS regardless of the cumulative epirubicin dose (P = 0.495), while obese patients in this group [body mass index (BMI) >/=30] had improved BCRFS compared with nonobese ones (BMI <30) [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.30-0.89, P = 0.02].Moreover, tDD was associated with improved BCRFS compared with standard treatment only in obese patients (HR = 0.49, 95% CI 0.26-0.90, P = 0.022) but not in nonobese ones (HR = 0.79, 95% CI 0.60-1.04, P = 0.089).The differences were not formally statistically significant (P for interaction 0.175).There were no differences in terms of toxicity across the epirubicin dose levels or the BMI groups.Conclusions: Dose tailoring is a feasible strategy that can potentially improve outcomes in obese patients without increasing toxicity and should be pursued in further clinical studies.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00798070.",0,0,0,0

And S-1 alone with the combination of radiotherapy treatment effect is good, and achieved good clinical remission rate.The purpose of this trial is compare the efficacy and toxicity of combining S-1 or S-1 plus cisplatin with radiotherapy for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.METHODS/DESIGN: The study is a randomized, controlled, multicenter trial, comparing S-1 versus S-1 plus cisplatin concurrent radiotherapy for patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.Eighty-eight patients with unresectable or medically unfit for surgery esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (clinical stage I to III), will randomly assigned to receive four cycles (2 concomitant and 2 postradiotherapy) S-1 or S-1 plus cisplatin along with radiotherapy 60-66 Gy/30 to 33 fractions.The primary outcome is complete response rate of primary tumor which will be measured by endoscopy and computer screen at 3 months after the completion of treatment.Secondary outcomes include survival and toxicity.DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this study protocol is the first to test the effect between S-1 versus S-1 plus cisplatin concurrent intensity modulated radiation therapy in the treatment of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.If the result will be the same effect and fewer side effects and less costly in S-1 plus radiotherapy.It will supply more treatment selection for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.",0,0,0,0
29275118,"Rituximab maintenance versus observation following abbreviated induction with chemoimmunotherapy in elderly patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL 2007 SA): an open-label, randomised phase 3 study.BACKGROUND: Most patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia relapse after initial therapy combining chemotherapy with rituximab.We assessed the efficacy and safety of rituximab maintenance treatment versus observation for elderly patients in remission after front-line abbreviated induction by fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR).METHODS: This randomised, open-label, multicentre phase 3 trial at 89 centres in France enrolled treatment-naive and fit patients aged 65 years or older with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia without del(17p).Eligible patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1 and adequate renal and hepatic function.Patients in response to complete induction treatment with four monthly courses of full-dose FCR with two interim rituximab doses on day 14 of cycles 1 and 2 (oral fludarabine [40 mg/m(2) per day] and oral cyclophosphamide [250 mg/m(2) per day] for the first 3 days of each cycle, rituximab at 375 mg/m(2) intravenously on day 0 of cycle 1 and subsequently at 500 mg/m(2) on day 14 of cycle 1, days 1 and 14 of cycle 2, and day 1 of cycles 3 and 4) were eligible for randomisation.Recovery from FCR toxicity and patient willingness to continue the trial were mandatory.We randomly assigned (1:1) patients to either receive intravenous rituximab (500 mg/m(2)) every 8 weeks for up to 2 years or undergo observation, with a central computer-generated randomisation list using randomly permuted blocks of variable sizes.Randomisation was stratified by IGHV mutational status, the presence or absence of del(11q), and response level to induction treatment.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, with the objective to assess the superiority of rituximab maintenance relative to observation.The final analysis was done in the intention-to-treat population.Safety was analysed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug in the rituximab group and in all patients in the observation group.This trial is closed to accrual whilst continuing patient follow-up.The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00645606.FINDINGS: Between Dec 14, 2007, and Feb 18, 2014, 542 patients were enrolled, of whom 525 started FCR induction.Between June 10, 2008, and Aug 14, 2014, 409 (78%) patients were randomly assigned to rituximab maintenance (n=202) or observation (n=207).Four (2%) patients in the rituximab group did not receive the allocated treatment (progressive disease [n=1], adverse events [n=3]).After a median follow-up of 47.7 months (IQR 30.4-65.8), median progression-free survival in the rituximab group (59.3 months, 95% CI 49.6-not estimable) was improved compared with the observation group (49.0 months, 39.9-60.5; hazard ratio 0.55, 95% CI 0.40-0.75; p=0.0002).Neutropenia and grade 3-4 infections were more common with rituximab maintenance (105 [53%] of 198 patients vs 74 [36%] of 207 patients and 38 [19%] vs 21 [10%], respectively) during the study.The most common grade 3-4 infection was lower respiratory tract infection (24 [12%] vs eight [4%]).The incidence of second cancers, except basal cell carcinoma, was similar in both groups (29 [15%] vs 23 [11%]).Deaths were related to adverse events for 23 (11%) patients in the rituximab group and 16 (8%) in the observation group.INTERPRETATION: 2-year maintenance rituximab in selected elderly patients improves progression-free survival and shows an acceptable safety profile.Immunotherapy maintenance strategy is a relevant option in front-line treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, even in the age of targeted therapy.FUNDING: French National Cancer Institute (INCa), Roche, Chugai.",0,0,0,0
30796651,"Strong impact of MammaPrint and BluePrint on treatment decisions in luminal early breast cancer: results of the WSG-PRIMe study.PURPOSE: The WSG-PRIMe Study prospectively evaluated the impact of the 70-gene signature MammaPrint(R) (MP) and the 80-gene molecular subtyping assay BluePrint(R) on clinical therapy decisions in luminal early breast cancer.METHODS: 452 hormone receptor (HR)-positive and HER2-negative patients were recruited (N0, N1).Physicians provided initial therapy recommendations based on clinicopathological factors.After prospective risk classification by MammaPrint/BluePrint was revealed, post-test treatment recommendations and actual treatment were recorded.Decisional Conflict and anxiety were measured by questionnaires.RESULTS: Post-test switch (in chemotherapy (CT) recommendation) occurred in 29.1% of cases.Overall, physician adherence to MP risk assessment was 92.3% for low-risk and 94.3% for high-risk MP scores.Adherence was remarkably high in ""discordant"" groups: 74.7% of physicians initially recommending CT switched to CT omission following low-risk MP scores; conversely, 88.9% of physicians initially recommending CT omission switched to CT recommendations following high-risk MP scores.Most patients (99.2%) recommended to forgo CT post-test and 21.3% of patients with post-test CT recommendations did not undergo CT; among MP low-risk patients with pre-test and post-test CT recommendations, 40% did not actually undergo CT.Luminal subtype assessment by BluePrint was discordant with IHC assessment in 34% of patients.Patients' State Anxiety scores improved significantly overall, particularly in MP low-risk patients.Trait Anxiety scores increased slightly in MP high risk and decreased slightly in MP low-risk patients.CONCLUSIONS: MammaPrint and BluePrint test results strongly impacted physicians' therapy decisions in luminal EBC with up to three involved lymph nodes.The high adherence to genetically determined risk assessment represents a key prerequisite for achieving a personalized cost-effective approach to disease management of early breast cancer.",0,0,0,0
23732774,"Equal efficacy of endoscopic and surgical cystogastrostomy for pancreatic pseudocyst drainage in a randomized trial.BACKGROUND & AIMS: Although surgery is the standard technique for drainage of pancreatic pseudocysts, use of endoscopic methods is increasing.We performed a single-center, open-label, randomized trial to compare endoscopic and surgical cystogastrostomy for pancreatic pseudocyst drainage.METHODS: Patients with pancreatic pseudocysts underwent endoscopic (n = 20) or surgical cystogastrostomy (n = 20).The primary end point was pseudocyst recurrence after a 24-month follow-up period.Secondary end points were treatment success or failure, complications, re-interventions, length of hospital stay, physical and mental health scores, and total costs.RESULTS: At the end of the follow-up period, none of the patients who received endoscopic therapy had a pseudocyst recurrence, compared with 1 patient treated surgically.There were no differences in treatment successes, complications, or re-interventions between the groups.However, the length of hospital stay was shorter for patients who underwent endoscopic cystogastrostomy (median, 2 days, vs 6 days in the surgery group; P < .001).Although there were no differences in physical component scores and mental health component scores (MCS) between groups at baseline on the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form General Survey questionnaire, longitudinal analysis showed significantly better physical component scores (P = .019) and mental health component scores (P = .025) for the endoscopy treatment group.The total mean cost was lower for patients managed by endoscopy than surgery ($7011 vs $15,052; P = .003).CONCLUSIONS: In a randomized trial comparing endoscopic and surgical cystogastrostomy for pancreatic pseudocyst drainage, none of the patients in the endoscopy group had pseudocyst recurrence during the follow-up period, therefore there is no evidence that surgical cystogastrostomy is superior.However, endoscopic treatment was associated with shorter hospital stays, better physical and mental health of patients, and lower cost.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00826501.",0,0,0,0

24044803,"Hypofractionated whole breast irradiation for patients with large breasts: a randomized trial comparing prone and supine positions.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Comparison of acute toxicity of whole-breast irradiation (WBI) in prone and supine positions.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This non-blinded, randomized, prospective, mono-centric trial was undertaken between December 29, 2010, and December 12, 2012.One hundred patients with large breasts were randomized between supine multi beam (MB) and prone tangential field (TF) intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT).Dose-volume parameters were assessed for the breast, heart, left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD), ipsilateral lung and contralateral breast.The primary endpoint was acute moist skin desquamation.Secondary endpoints were dermatitis, edema, pruritus and pain.RESULTS: Prone treatment resulted in: improved dose coverage (p<0.001); better homogeneity (p<0.001); less volumes of over-dosage (p=0.001); reduced acute skin desquamation (p<0.001); a 3-fold decrease of moist desquamation p=0.04 (chi-square), p=0.07 (Fisher's exact test)); lower incidence of dermatitis (p<0.001), edema (p=0.005), pruritus (p=0.06) and pain (p=0.06); 2- to 4-fold reduction of grades 2-3 toxicity; lower ipsilateral lung (p<0.001) and mean LAD (p=0.007) dose; lower, though statistically non-significant heart and maximum LAD.CONCLUSIONS: This study provides level I evidence for replacing the supine standard treatment by prone IMRT for whole-breast irradiation in patients with large breasts.A confirmatory trial in a multi-institutional setting is warranted.",0,0,0,0
25891302,"The effect, moderators, and mediators of resistance and aerobic exercise on health-related quality of life in older long-term survivors of prostate cancer.BACKGROUND: The current study examined effects, moderators (for whom), and mediators (working mechanisms) of 12 months of exercise on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in older long-term survivors of prostate cancer.METHODS: In total, 100 men aged 71.7 years (standard deviation, 6.4 years) were randomly assigned to 6 months of supervised aerobic and resistance exercise followed by 6 months of a home-based exercise maintenance program (EX group) or printed education material regarding physical activity for 12 months (PA group).Assessments took place at baseline and after 6 and 12 months.Generalized estimating equations were used to study the effects of EX versus PA on HRQoL at 6 and 12 months, adjusting for baseline HRQoL. The authors examined potential sociodemographic and clinical moderators by adding interaction terms, and potential physical and psychological mediators using the product-of-coefficients test.RESULTS: At 6 months, significant beneficial effects were found for global QoL, physical function, and social function in the EX group compared with the PA group.For physical function, beneficial effects were sustained at 12 months.Moderation analyses demonstrated larger effects of EX versus PA for patients who were married, started exercising sooner after their diagnosis, and previously used bisphosphonates.Changes in lower body functional performance significantly mediated the effect of EX on global QoL, physical function, and social function.No mediating effects on HRQoL were found for aerobic fitness, physical activity, fatigue, distress, or falls self-efficacy.CONCLUSIONS: Aerobic and resistance exercise appears to have beneficial effects on HRQoL among older, long-term survivors of prostate cancer.Effects were moderated by marital status, time since diagnosis, and use of bisphosphonates, and were mediated by lower body functional performance.",0,0,0,0
29439278,"Delineation of the extent of early gastric cancer by magnifying narrow-band imaging and chromoendoscopy: a multicenter randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Accurate delineation of tumor margins is necessary for curative resection of early gastric cancer (EGC).The objective of this multicenter, randomized, controlled study was to compare the accuracy with which magnifying narrow-band imaging (M-NBI) and indigo carmine chromoendoscopy delineate EGC margins.METHODS: Patients with EGC >/= 10 mm undergoing endoscopic or surgical resection were enrolled.The oral-side margins of the lesions were first evaluated with conventional white-light endoscopy in both groups and then delineated by either chromoendoscopy or M-NBI.Biopsies were taken from noncancerous and cancerous mucosa, each at 5 mm from the margin.Accurate delineation was judged to have been achieved when the histological findings in all biopsy samples were consistent with endoscopic diagnoses.The primary end point was the difference in rate of accurate delineation between the two techniques.RESULTS: Data on 343 patients were analyzed.The accurate delineation rate (95 % confidence interval) was 85.7 % (80.4 - 91.0) in the chromoendoscopy group (n = 168), and 88.0 % (83.2 - 92.8) in the M-NBI group (n = 175; P = 0.63).Lower third tumor location (odds ratio [OR] 2.9; P = 0.01), nonflat macroscopic type (OR 4.4; P < 0.01), and high diagnostic confidence (OR 3.6; P < 0.001) were associated with accurate delineation, whereas use of M-NBI was not (OR 1.2; P = 0.39).Even after adjustment for identified confounders, the difference in accurate delineation between the groups was not significant (OR 1.0; P = 0.82).CONCLUSIONS: M-NBI does not offer superior delineation of EGC margins compared with chromoendoscopy; the two methods appear to be clinically equivalent.",0,0,0,0

23358966,"Postinduction dexamethasone and individualized dosing of Escherichia Coli L-asparaginase each improve outcome of children and adolescents with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia: results from a randomized study--Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ALL Consortium Protocol 00-01.PURPOSE: We assessed the toxicity and efficacy of dexamethasone and a novel dosing method of Escherichia coli L-asparaginase (EC-Asnase) in children and adolescents with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients achieving complete remission (CR) on Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ALL Consortium Protocol 00-01 were eligible for random assignment to 1) dexamethasone or prednisone, administered as 5-day pulses, every 3 weeks, and 2) weekly EC-Asnase, administered as a 25,000 IU/m(2) fixed dose (FD) or individualized dose (ID) starting at 12,500-IU/m(2), adjusted every 3 weeks based on nadir serum asparaginase activity (NSAA) determinations.RESULTS: Between 2000 and 2004, 492 evaluable patients (ages 1 to 18 years) enrolled; 473 patients (96%) achieved CR.Four hundred eight patients (86%) participated in the corticosteroid randomization and 384 patients (81%) in the EC-Asnase randomization.With 4.9 years of median follow-up, dexamethasone was associated with superior 5-year event-free survival (EFS; 90% v 81% for prednisone; P = .01) but higher rates of infection (P = .03) and, in older children, higher cumulative incidence of osteonecrosis (P = .02) and fracture (P = .06).ID EC-Asnase had superior 5-year EFS (90% v 82% for FD; P = .04), but did not reduce the frequency of asparaginase-related toxicity.Multivariable analysis identified both dexamethasone and ID EC-Asnase as independent predictors of favorable EFS.CONCLUSION: There was no overall difference in skeletal toxicity by corticosteroid type; dexamethasone was associated with more infections and, in older children, increased incidence of osteonecrosis and fracture.There was no difference in asparaginase-related toxicity by EC-Asnase dosing method.Dexamethasone and ID EC-Asnase were each associated with superior EFS.Monitoring NSAA during treatment with EC-Asnase may be an effective strategy to improve outcome in pediatric ALL.",1,1,1,1
28463161,"Feasibility of Patient Reporting of Symptomatic Adverse Events via the Patient-Reported Outcomes Version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE) in a Chemoradiotherapy Cooperative Group Multicenter Clinical Trial.PURPOSE: To assess the feasibility of measuring symptomatic adverse events (AEs) in a multicenter clinical trial using the National Cancer Institute's Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE).METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients enrolled in NRG Oncology's RTOG 1012 (Prophylactic Manuka Honey for Reduction of Chemoradiation Induced Esophagitis-Related Pain during Treatment of Lung Cancer) were asked to self-report 53 PRO-CTCAE items representing 30 symptomatic AEs at 6 time points (baseline; weekly x4 during treatment; 12 weeks after treatment).Reporting was conducted via wireless tablet computers in clinic waiting areas.Compliance was defined as the proportion of visits when an expected PRO-CTCAE assessment was completed.RESULTS: Among 226 study sites participating in RTOG 1012, 100% completed 35-minute PRO-CTCAE training for clinical research associates (CRAs); 80 sites enrolled patients, of which 34 (43%) required tablet computers to be provided.All 152 patients in RTOG 1012 agreed to self-report using the PRO-CTCAE (median age 66 years; 47% female; 84% white).Median time for CRAs to learn the system was 60 minutes (range, 30-240 minutes), and median time for CRAs to teach a patient to self-report was 10 minutes (range, 2-60 minutes).Compliance was high, particularly during active treatment, when patients self-reported at 86% of expected time points, although compliance was lower after treatment (72%).Common reasons for noncompliance were institutional errors, such as forgetting to provide computers to participants; patients missing clinic visits; Internet connectivity; and patients feeling ""too sick."" CONCLUSIONS: Most patients enrolled in a multicenter chemoradiotherapy trial were willing and able to self-report symptomatic AEs at visits using tablet computers.Minimal effort was required by local site staff to support this system.The observed causes of missing data may be obviated by allowing patients to self-report electronically between visits, and by using central compliance monitoring.These approaches are being incorporated into ongoing studies.",0,0,0,0

26715229,"Long-Term Effects of Two Formats of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia Comorbid with Breast Cancer.STUDY OBJECTIVES: The goal of this randomized controlled trial, conducted in breast cancer patients, was to assess the long-term efficacy of a video-based cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (VCBT-I), as compared to a professionally administered intervention (PCBT-I) and to a no-treatment group (CTL).An earlier report revealed that, at posttreatment, VCBT-I patients showed significantly greater sleep improvements than CTL, but that PCBT-I produced superior effects than VCBT-I on some sleep and secondary outcomes.In this report, long-term effects are compared.METHODS: Two hundred forty-two women with breast cancer and with insomnia symptoms or using hypnotic medications participated to this three-arm randomized controlled trial: (1) PCBT-I (n = 81); (2) VCBT-I (n = 80); or (3) no treatment (CTL; n = 81) group.PCBT-I was composed of six weekly, individual sessions of approximately 50 min, whereas VCBT-I comprised a 60-min animated video and six booklets.RESULTS: Study measures (sleep and secondary variables) were administered at pretreatment and posttreatment, and at a 3-, 6-, and 12-mo follow-up.Treatment gains were well sustained at follow-up in both PCBT-I and VCBT-I. As at posttreatment, the remission rate of insomnia at follow-up was greater in PCBT-I than in VCBT-I, which was greater than in CTL.CONCLUSIONS: Although face-to-face therapy remains the optimal format to efficaciously administer CBT for insomnia in cancer patients, a minimal intervention, such as the video-based intervention tested in this study, produces significant and sustainable treatment effects.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00674830.",1,1,0,0
22493375,"Intra-arterial infusion of irinotecan-loaded drug-eluting beads (DEBIRI) versus intravenous therapy (FOLFIRI) for hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer: final results of a phase III study.BACKGROUND: Metastases to the liver receive most of their blood supply from the arterial route, therefore for patients with hepatic metastases from large bowel cancer, hepatic arterial infusion adopting drug-eluting beads preloaded with irinotecan (DEBIRI) may offer a chance of cure.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a multi-institutional study, 74 patients were randomly assigned to receive DEBIRI (36) versus systemic irinotecan, fluorouracil and leucovorin (FOLFIRI, 38).The primary end-point was survival; secondary end points were response, recurrence, toxicity, quality of life, cost and influence of molecular markers.RESULTS: At 50 months, overall survival was significantly longer for patients treated with DEBIRI than for those treated with FOLFIRI (p=0.031, log-rank).Median survival was 22 (95% Confidence Interval CI=21-23) months, for DEBIRI and 15 (95% CI=12-18) months for FOLFIRI.Progression-free survival was 7 (95% CI=3-11) months in the DEBIRI group compared to 4 (95% CI=3-5) months in the FOLFIRI group and the difference between groups was statistically significant (p=0.006, log-rank).Extrahepatic progression had occurred in all patients by the end of the study, at a median time of 13 (95% CI=10-16) months in the DEBIRI group compared to 9 (95% CI 5-13) months in the FOLFIRI group.A statistically significant difference between groups was not observed (p=0.064, log-rank).The median time for duration of improvement to quality of life was 8 (95% CI=3-13) months in the DEBIRI group and 3 (95% CI=2-4) months in the FOLFIRI group.The difference in duration of improvement was statistically significant (p=0.00002, log-rank).CONCLUSION: This study showed a statistically significant difference between DEBIRI and FOLFIRI for overall survival (7 months), progression-free survival (3 months) and quality of life (5 months).In addition, a clinically significant improvement in time to extrahepatic progression (4 months) was observed for DEBIRI, a reversal of the expectation for a regional treatment.This suggests a benefit of DEBIRI treatment over standard chemotherapy and serves to establish the expected difference between these two treatment options for planning future large randomized studies.",1,1,1,1

A 15- to 20-point change in global QoL and functional scale scores predicted change in tumour status as did change in fatigue, pain and appetite loss scores.Smaller QoL changes (5-15 points) predicted PS change.Results were similar in patients regardless of baseline disease measurability.CONCLUSIONS: Our study underscores the importance of disease control for maintaining or improving QoL. These data could improve future trial design and routine clinical care for patients receiving therapy for previously treated gastric cancer.NCT00917384, NCT01170663.",0,0,0,0
25788030,"Methods of reconstruction after esophagectomy on long-term health-related quality of life: a prospective, randomized study of 5-year follow-up.The health-related quality of life (HRQL) is generally accepted as an important parameter for patients undergoing oncologic surgery.We conducted this prospective, randomized study to compare the effect of narrow gastric tube (NGT) reconstruction and whole-stomach (WS) reconstruction on the long-term HRQL in patients after esophagectomy.One hundred and four patients undergoing esophagectomy were enrolled in our study from 2007 to 2008, with 52 in NGT group and 52 in WS group.A questionnaire with reference to the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 and QLQ-OES18 was used to assess the HRQL at 3 weeks, 6 months, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years after esophagectomy.Data collection and follow-up were performed regularly.No significant difference was found between NGT group and WS group in the patients' baseline characteristics.Patients in NGT group had decreased risk of postoperative reflux esophagitis by comparison with those in WS group.The 5-year cumulative survival rate was 42 % (NGT) and 27 % (WS), respectively.Compared with WS group, a significant increased survival rate (P = 0.027) was found in NGT group.Additionally, patients had lower dysphagia scores (better) in NGT group than those in WS group at 5 years after esophagectomy (P < 0.05).However, the scores of the other scales did not show statistical difference at 5-year follow-up.NGT is a better option for the reconstruction after esophagectomy because of decreased risk of postoperative complication, increased survival rate, and better HRQL, and NGT should be preferred to be recommended for patients undergoing esophagectomy.",0,0,0,0
28658162,"A multidisciplinary team approach for nutritional interventions conducted by specialist nurses in patients with advanced colorectal cancer undergoing chemotherapy: A clinical trial.BACKGROUND & AIMS: Nutritional interventions for malnutrition in cancer patients can be helpful.However, concise intervention recommendations remain controversial.Thus, the aim of this study was to report on a nutrition intervention conducted by a multidisciplinary team of specialist nurses and to explore the effect of nutritional intervention on cancer patients.METHODS: This prospective clinical trial study enrolled 110 colorectal cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.The patients were evaluated upon admission using the 2002 Nutritional Risk Screening system (NRS-2002).The patients were randomly divided into intervention and control groups including 55 patients each.Patients in the control group were administered a normal diet, while those in the intervention group received individual recipes developed by a team of professional nurses, clinical doctors, dietitian, family caregivers, and the patients themselves.Patient weight and serum albumin and prealbumin levels were compared between the 2 groups at different time points.RESULTS: There was a significant difference in patient weight and serum albumin and prealbumin levels before and after nutrition intervention in the intervention group (P < .05).In the control group, weight did not change during ordinary diet guidance.Serum albumin level was slightly improved after 12 cycles of chemotherapy, similar to the prealbumin results.There were statistically significant differences in serum albumin and prealbumin levels between the intervention and control groups after nutrition intervention (P < .05).However, there was no statistically significant difference in weight between the groups after nutrition intervention (P > .05).CONCLUSION: A multidisciplinary team approach for nutrition intervention conducted by specialist nurses improved prealbumin levels in colorectal cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, with no weight change.",0,0,0,0
23812551,"Randomized clinical trial of arginine-supplemented enteral nutrition versus standard enteral nutrition in patients undergoing gastric cancer surgery.PURPOSE: Significant malnutrition exists in a high percentage of patients with gastric cancer.It is, therefore, crucial to establish an effective means to provide nutrition for these patients.This prospective, randomized, double-blinded clinical trial aims to assess the long-term survival of arginine-supplementation enteral nutrition versus standard enteral nutrition in malnourished patients with gastric cancer.METHODS: The control group (36 cases) received postoperative standard enteral nutrition.Meanwhile, the arginine-supplementation group (37 cases) adopted the same nutrition product but enriched with arginine (9.0 g/L).The primary study objective was overall survival (OS).Secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS); serum parameters including total protein, albumin, proalbumin, and transferrin obtained on preoperative day 1, postoperative day 2, and day 12; CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, immunoglobulin M (IgM), and immunoglobulin G (IgG) obtained on preoperative day 1 and postoperative day 7.RESULTS: No significant differences in baseline characteristics were observed between groups.The group receiving arginine-enriched nutrition had a significantly better OS (P = 0.03, 41 vs. 30.5 months) and better PFS (P = 0.02, 18 vs. 11.5 months).On postoperative day 7, CD4(+) T cells, NK cells, IgM and IgG levels of the arginine-supplemented group increased prominently and were significantly higher than those of the control group and those on preoperative day 1.There is no significant difference in the serum total protein, albumin, proalbumin, and transferrin levels between the two arms.CONCLUSIONS: Arginine-supplemented enteral nutrition significantly improves long-term survival and restores immunity in malnourished gastric cancer.",0,0,0,0
28341958,"Randomized phase II study comparing weekly docetaxel-cisplatin vs. gemcitabine-cisplatin in elderly or poor performance status patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.BACKGROUND: Docetaxel/cisplatin (DP) and gemcitabine/cisplatin (GP) are standard treatment regimens for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).In spite of potent efficacy, the conventional 1-day DP is regarded as having more toxicity as compared with GP.There is increasing interest in a biweekly split administration of DP to reduce its toxicity.Hypothesis was that first-line biweekly DP is as safe as GP in the elderly or poor performance status (PS) patients.METHODS: Chemotherapy-naive patients with advanced NSCLC (IIIB/IV) who were elderly (65<) or PS (ECOG 2) were randomized to DP or GP arm by balancing for ECOG (0-1 vs. 2) and stage (IIIB vs. IV).DP comprised docetaxel (35 mg/m(2))/cisplatin (30 mg/m(2)) iv on days 1 and 8, every 3 weeks.GP comprised gemcitabine (1000 mg/m(2))/cisplatin (30 mg/m(2)) iv on days 1 and 8, every 3 weeks.Chemotherapy lasted up to 4-6 cycles or until progression.Primary endpoint was safety (proportion of grade 3/4 toxicities).Planned sample size was 49 patients in each arm.RESULTS: From November 2009 to August 2012, a total of 99 patients were randomized (DP 50/GP 49) from nine institutions.Adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma were observed in 62% and 33% of patients, respectively.Toxicity profiles were comparable for both arms and the differences were not statistically significant except for anemia and leucocytopenia.Any grade of anemia (86 vs. 98%) and of leucocytopenia (18 vs. 43%) was more common in the GP arm with statistical significance.Oral mucositis tended to be predominant in the DP arm.Patients in the DP arm (51%) suffered grade 3 or higher toxicities as did 47% in the GP arm (47%).The most common grade 3 or higher toxicities were as follows: In the DP arm, neutropenia (8%), leucopenia (8%), anemia (4%), pneumonia with normal ANC (4%) and febrile neutropenia (2%) were observed.In the GP arm, anemia (15%), neutropenia (15%), pneumonia with normal ANC (4%), thrombocytopenia (4%) and leucopenia (2%) were observed.The best overall response rates (CR + PR) for the DP and GP arms were 20.0 and 21% with no CR, respectively, and disease control rates (CR + PR + SD) were 70.0 and 76%, respectively.Median progression-free survival and median overall survival were 3.7 and 14.9 months in the DP arm and 5.6 and 20.8 months in the GP arm, respectively.CONCLUSION: This study showed that DP is similar to GP in terms of efficacy and toxicity in treatment of elderly or poor performance patients.Both regimens showed similar grade 3/4 toxicities with different profiles.",1,1,1,0
28646893,"Clinical features of serous retinopathy observed with cobimetinib in patients with BRAF-mutated melanoma treated in the randomized coBRIM study.BACKGROUND: Serous chorioretinopathy has been associated with MEK inhibitors, including cobimetinib.We describe the clinical features of serous retinopathy observed with cobimetinib in patients with BRAF (V600)-mutated melanoma treated in the Phase III coBRIM study.METHODS: In the coBRIM study, 493 patients were treated in two randomly assigned treatment groups: cobimetinib and vemurafenib (n = 247) or vemurafenib (n = 246).All patients underwent prospective ophthalmic examinations at screening, at regular intervals during the study, and whenever ocular symptoms developed.Patients with serous retinopathy were identified in the study database using a group of relevant and synonymous adverse event terms.RESULTS: Eighty-six serous retinopathy events were reported in 70 patients (79 events in 63 cobimetinib and vemurafenib-treated patients vs seven events in seven vemurafenib-treated patients).Most patients with serous retinopathy identified by ophthalmic examination had no symptoms or had mild symptoms, among them reduced visual acuity, blurred vision, dyschromatopsia, and photophobia.Serous retinopathy usually occurred early during cobimetinib and vemurafenib treatment; median time to onset was 1.0 month.Most events were managed by observation and continuation of cobimetinib without dose modification and resolved or were resolving by the data cutoff date (19 Sept 2014).CONCLUSIONS: Cobimetinib treatment was associated with serous retinopathy in patients with BRAF (V600)-mutated melanoma.Retinopathy was generally asymptomatic or mild.Periodic ophthalmologic evaluations at regular intervals and at the manifestation of any visual disturbance are recommended to facilitate early detection and resolution of serous retinopathy while patients are taking cobimetinib.Trial Registration Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01689519).First received: September 18, 2012.",1,1,1,1
24916951,"Inflammation and psychosocial factors mediate exercise effects on sleep quality in breast cancer survivors: pilot randomized controlled trial.OBJECTIVE: To improve mechanistic understanding, this pilot randomized controlled trial examined mediators of an exercise intervention effects on sleep in breast cancer survivors (BCS).METHODS: Forty-six postmenopausal BCS (</=Stage II, off primary treatment) were randomized to a 3-month exercise intervention or control group.Intervention included 160 min/week of moderate intensity aerobic walking, twice weekly resistance training (resistance bands), and six discussion groups (to improve adherence).Blinded assessments at baseline and post-intervention included sleep disturbance (PSQI and PROMIS(R)), objective sleep quality (accelerometer), serum cytokines, accelerometer physical activity, cardiorespiratory fitness, body composition, fatigue, and psychosocial factors.Mediation was tested using Freedman-Schatzkin difference-in-coefficients tests.RESULTS: When compared with control, the intervention group demonstrated a significant increase in PSQI sleep duration (i.e., fewer hours of sleep/night) (d = 0.73, p = .03).Medium to large but non-significant standardized effect sizes were noted for PSQI daytime somnolence (d = -0.63, p = .05) and accelerometer latency (d = -0.49, p = .14).No statistically significant mediators were detected for PSQI sleep duration score or accelerometer latency.Daytime somnolence was mediated by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (mediated 23% of intervention effect, p < .05), interleukin (IL)-6:IL-10 (16%, p < .01), IL-8:IL-10 (26%, p < .01), and fatigue (38%, p < .05).Mediating or enhancing relationships for several of the sleep outcomes were noted for accelerometer physical activity, PROMIS(R) fatigue, exercise social support, and/or physical activity enjoyment.CONCLUSIONS: Inflammation and psychosocial factors may mediate or enhance sleep response to our exercise intervention.Further study is warranted to confirm our results and translate our findings into more effective interventions aimed at improving sleep quality in BCS.",0,0,0,0
29370781,"The PANDA study: a randomized phase II study of first-line FOLFOX plus panitumumab versus 5FU plus panitumumab in RAS and BRAF wild-type elderly metastatic colorectal cancer patients.BACKGROUND: Few data are available regarding the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer elderly patients with anti-EGFR agents in combination with chemotherapy.FOLFOX plus panitumumab is a standard first-line option for RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer.Slight adjustments in chemo-dosage are commonly applied in clinical practice to elderly patients, but those modified schedules have never been prospectively tested.Clinical definition of elderly (>/=70 years old) patients that may deserve a more or less intensive combination therapy is still debated.Several geriatric screening tools have been developed to predict survival and risk of toxicity from treatment.Among those, the G8 screening tool has been tested in cancer patients showing the strongest prognostic value for overall survival, while the CRASH score can stratify patients according to an estimated risk of treatment-related toxicities.METHODS: The PANDA study is a prospective, open-label, multicenter, randomized phase II trial of first-line therapy with panitumumab in combination with dose-adjusted FOLFOX or with 5-fluorouracil monotherapy, in previously untreated elderly patients (>/=70 years) with RAS and BRAF wild-type unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer.RAS and BRAF analyses are centralized.Geriatric assessment by means of G8 and CRASH score is planned at baseline and G8 will be re-evaluated at disease progression.The primary endpoint is duration of progression-free survival in both arms.Secondary endpoints include prospective evaluation of the prognostic role of G8 score and the correlation of CRASH risk categories with toxicity.DISCUSSION: The PANDA study aims at exploring safety and efficacy of panitumumab in combination with FOLFOX or with 5FU/LV in elderly patients affected by RAS and BRAF wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer, to identify the most promising treatment strategy in this setting.Additionally, this is the first trial in which the prognostic role of the G8 score will be prospectively evaluated.Results of this study will drive further experimental developments for one or both combinations.TRIAL REGISTRATION: PANDA is registered at Clinicaltrials.gov : NCT02904031 , July 11, 2016.PANDA is registered at EudraCT-No.: 2015-003888-10, September 3, 2015.",1,1,1,1
30646153,"Effect of Positron Emission Tomography Imaging in Women With Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer: A Randomized Clinical Trial.Importance: In women with locally advanced cancer of the cervix (LACC), staging defines disease extent and guides therapy.Currently, undetected disease outside the radiation field can result in undertreatment or, if disease is disseminated, overtreatment.Objective: To determine whether adding fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) to conventional staging with CT of the abdomen and pelvis affects therapy received in women with LACC.Design, Setting, and Participants: A randomized clinical trial was conducted.Women with newly diagnosed histologically confirmed International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IB to IVA carcinoma of the cervix who were candidates for chemotherapy and radiation therapy (CRT) were allocated 2:1 to PET-CT plus CT of the abdomen and pelvis or CT alone.Enrollment occurred between April 2010 and June 2014 at 6 regional cancer centers in Ontario, Canada.The PET-CT scanners were at 6 associated academic institutions.The median follow-up at the time of the analysis was 3 years.The analysis was conducted on March 30, 2017.Interventions: Patients received either PET-CT plus CT of the abdomen and pelvis or CT of the abdomen and pelvis.Main Outcomes and Measures: Treatment delivered, defined as standard pelvic CRT vs more extensive CRT, ie, extended field radiotherapy or therapy with palliative intent.Results: One hundred seventy-one patients were allocated to PET-CT (n = 113) or CT (n = 58).The trial stopped early before the planned target of 288 was reached because of low recruitment.Mean (SD) age was 48.1 (11.2) years in the PET-CT group vs 48.9 (12.7) years in the CT group.In the 112 patients who received PET-CT, 68 (60.7%) received standard pelvic CRT, 38 (33.9%) more extensive CRT, and 6 (5.4%) palliative treatment.The corresponding data for the 56 patients who received CT alone were 42 (75.0%), 11 (19.6%), and 3 (5.4%).Overall, 44 patients (39.3%) in the PET-CT group received more extensive CRT or palliative treatment compared with 14 patients (25.0%) in the CT group (odds ratio, 2.05; 95% CI, 0.96-4.37; P = .06).Twenty-four patients in the PET-CT group (21.4%) received extended field radiotherapy to para-aortic nodes and 14 (12.5%) to common iliac nodes compared with 8 (14.3%) and 3 (5.4%), respectively, in the CT group (odds ratio, 1.64; 95% CI, 0.68-3.92; P = .27).Conclusions and Relevance: There was a trend for more extensive CRT with PET-CT, but the difference was not significant because the trial was underpowered.This trial provides information on the utility of PET-CT for staging in LACC.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00895349.",0,0,0,0

23562353,"Influence of DNA copy number and mRNA levels on the expression of breast cancer related proteins.For a panel of cancer related proteins, the aim was to shed light on which molecular level the expression of each protein was mainly regulated in breast tumors, and to investigate whether differences in regulation were reflected in different molecular subtypes.DNA, mRNA and protein lysates from 251 breast tumor specimens were analyzed using appropriate microarray technologies.Data from all three levels were available for 52 proteins selected for their known involvement in cancer, primarily through the PI3K/Akt pathway.For every protein, in cis Spearman rank correlations between the three molecular levels were calculated across all samples and within each intrinsic gene expression subtype, enabling 63 comparisons altogether due to multiple gene probes matching to single proteins.Subtype-specific relationships between the three molecular levels were studied by calculating the variance of subtype-specific correlation and differences between overall and average subtype-specific correlation.The findings were validated in an external dataset comprising 703 breast tumor specimens.The proteins were sorted into four groups based on the calculated rank correlation values between the three molecular levels.Group A consisted of eight proteins with significant correlation between DNA copy number levels and mRNA expression, and between mRNA expression and protein expression (Bonferroni adjusted p < 0.05).Group B consisted of 14 proteins with significant correlation between mRNA expression and protein expression.Group C consisted of 15 proteins with significant correlation between copy number levels and mRNA expression.For the remaining 25 proteins (group D), no significant correlations was observed.Stratification of tumors according to intrinsic subtype enabled identification of positive correlations between copy number levels, mRNA and protein expression that were undetectable when considering the entire sample set.Protein pairings that either demonstrated high variance in correlation values between subtypes, or between subtypes and the total dataset were studied in particular.The protein expression of cleaved caspase 7 was most highly expressed, and correlated highest to CASP7 gene expression within the basal-like subtype, accompanied by the lowest amounts of hsa-miR-29c.Luminal A-like subtype demonstrated highest amounts of hsa-miR-29c (a miRNA with a putative target sequence in CASP7 mRNA), low expression of cleaved caspase 7 and low correlation to CASP7 gene expression.Such pattern might be an indication of hsa-miR-29c miRNA functioning as a repressor of translation of CASP7 within the luminal-A subtype.Across the entire cohort no correlation was found between CCNB1 copy number and gene expression.However, within most gene intrinsic subtypes, mRNA and protein expression of cyclin B1 was found positively correlated to copy number data, suggesting that copy number can affect the overall expression of this protein.Aberrations of cyclin B1 copy number also identified patients with reduced overall survival within each subtype.Based on correlation between the three molecular levels, genes and their products could be sorted into four groups for which the expression was likely to be regulated at different molecular levels.Further stratification suggested subtype-specific regulation that was not evident across the entire sample set.",0,0,0,0

22855138,"A randomized phase II study to compare oxaliplatin plus 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin (FOLFOX4) versus oxaliplatin plus raltitrexed (TOMOX) as first-line chemotherapy for advanced colorectal cancer.INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to compare TOMOX versus FOLFOX4 as first-line treatment of advanced colorectal cancer (CRC).MATERIALS AND METHODS: 191 chemotherapy-naive patients were randomized to receive TOMOX or FOLFOX4.Patients were evaluated every 3 months and chemotherapy was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.Overall response rate was the primary endpoint.RESULTS: 183 patients were included in the intent-to-treat analysis (92 TOMOX and 91 FOLFOX4).Overall response rate was 45.6 and 36.3 % (p = 0.003) for TOMOX and FOLFOX4, respectively.No statistically significant differences were observed in overall survival (15.6 and 17.2 months; p = 0.475); progression-free survival (7.7 and 8.7 months; p = 0.292), and response duration (6.4 and 7.6 months; p = 0.372) for TOMOX and FOLFOX4, respectively.Grades 3 and 4 neutropenia (p < 0.0001) and leukopenia (p = 0.028) were more common with the FOLFOX4 regimen, while hepatic disorders and asthenia were higher in TOMOX group (p = ns).There were two treatment-related deaths in the FOLFOX4 arm and one in the TOMOX arm.Quality of life analysis based on the SF-36 revealed differences between the two regimens for physical and mental composite scores after 6 weeks, and for body pain and emotional role functioning after 6 and 12 weeks; all of these favored the FOLFOX4 arm (p </= 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: TOMOX and FOLFOX4 seem to have similar efficacy and are well tolerated in the first-line treatment for advanced CRC with different profiles of toxicity.The convenient TOMOX regimen may offer an alternative to fluoropyrimidine-based regimens.",0,0,0,0
31699709,"Combined Vaccination with NY-ESO-1 Protein, Poly-ICLC, and Montanide Improves Humoral and Cellular Immune Responses in Patients with High-Risk Melanoma.Given its ability to induce both humoral and cellular immune responses, NY-ESO-1 has been considered a suitable antigen for a cancer vaccine.Despite promising results from early-phase clinical studies in patients with melanoma, NY-ESO-1 vaccine immunotherapy has not been widely investigated in larger trials; consequently, many questions remain as to the optimal vaccine formulation, predictive biomarkers, and sequencing and timing of vaccines in melanoma treatment.We conducted an adjuvant phase I/II clinical trial in high-risk resected melanoma to optimize the delivery of poly-ICLC, a TLR-3/MDA-5 agonist, as a component of vaccine formulation.A phase I dose-escalation part was undertaken to identify the MTD of poly-ICLC administered in combination with NY-ESO-1 and montanide.This was followed by a randomized phase II part investigating the MTD of poly-ICLC with NY-ESO-1 with or without montanide.The vaccine regimens were generally well tolerated, with no treatment-related grade 3/4 adverse events.Both regimens induced integrated NY-ESO-1-specific CD4(+) T-cell and humoral responses.CD8(+) T-cell responses were mainly detected in patients receiving montanide.T-cell avidity toward NY-ESO-1 peptides was higher in patients vaccinated with montanide.In conclusion, NY-ESO-1 protein in combination with poly-ICLC is safe, well tolerated, and capable of inducing integrated antibody and CD4(+) T-cell responses in most patients.Combination with montanide enhances antigen-specific T-cell avidity and CD8(+) T-cell cross-priming in a fraction of patients, indicating that montanide contributes to the induction of specific CD8(+) T-cell responses to NY-ESO-1.",0,0,0,0
28468736,"Prevention of non-melanoma skin cancers with nicotinamide in transplant recipients: a case-control study.Nicotinamide is the precursor of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), an essential cofactor for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production.It has recently been reported to be effective in reducing the rates of new non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs) and actinic keratosis (AKs).We studied the efficacy of oral nicotinamide as treatment for AKs in transplant recipients.We recruited 38 transplant (eight liver and 30 kidney) patients with single or multiple AKs.Nineteen patients were randomly assigned to Group 1 and took nicotinamide 500 mg/daily (cases); the other 19 patients were randomly assigned to Group 2 without nicotinamide (controls).At baseline, AKs were identified, measured, and photographed for follow-up.Five patients underwent an AK biopsy for histopathology.Statistical analyses were performed using the Student t test.At baseline, no statistically significant differences were observed regarding AK size between the two groups.After six months, among the cases, AKs had significantly decreased in size in 18/19 patients (88%).Among these 18 patients, seven patients (42%) had shown complete clinical regression and no patient developed new AKs.Conversely, among the controls, 91% showed an increase in AK size and/or developed new AKs.Seven pre-existing AKs progressed to squamous-cell carcinoma.Nicotinamide appears to be effective in preventing and treating AKs, although the mechanisms are still unclear.Further studies with a larger sample of organ transplant recipients and a longer follow-up period are needed to further support our conclusions.",0,0,0,0
24608924,"Influence of interferon-alpha combined with chemo (radio) therapy on immunological parameters in pancreatic adenocarcinoma.Prognosis of patients with carcinoma of the exocrine pancreas is particularly poor.A combination of chemotherapy with immunotherapy could be an option for treatment of pancreatic cancer.The aim of this study was to perform an immunomonitoring of 17 patients with pancreatic cancer from the CapRI-2 study, and tumor-bearing mice treated with combination of chemo (radio) therapies with interferon-2alpha.Low doses of interferon-2alpha led to a decrease in total leukocyte and an increase in monocyte counts.Furthermore, we observed a positive effect of interferon-2alpha therapy on the dendritic cells and NK (natural killer) cell activation immediately after the first injection.In addition, we recorded an increased amount of interferon-gamma and IL-10 in the serum following the interferon-2alpha therapy.These data clearly demonstrate that pancreatic carcinoma patients also show an immunomodulatory response to interferon-2alpha therapy.Analysis of immunosuppressive cells in the Panc02 orthotopic mouse model of pancreatic cancer revealed an accumulation of the myeloid-derived suppressor cells in spleens and tumors of the mice treated with interferon-2alpha and 5-fluorouracil.The direct effect of the drugs on myeloid-derived suppressor cells was also registered in vitro.These data expose the importance of immunosuppressive mechanisms induced by combined chemo-immunotherapy.",0,0,0,0
28076829,"Comparing the effect of aromatase inhibitor (letrozole) + cabergoline (Dostinex) and letrozole alone on uterine myoma regression,a randomized clinical trial.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of letrozole in combination with cabergoline and letrozole alone on regression of symptomatic uterine myomas in women of reproductive age.DESIGN: Randomized controlled clinical trial.SETTING: University hospital.PATIENTS: Ninety-one women of reproductive age were enrolled in the study and 88 women were eligible.Eight participants were excluded from the study.INTERVENTIONS: Eighty women of reproductive age with symptomatic myomas >4cm were evaluated in two groups.Participants in Group 1 received 2.5mg letrozole once daily and cabergoline 0.5mg/week from the first day of the menstrual cycle for 12 weeks, and participants in Group 2 received letrozole alone.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes in uterine size and volume; myoma size, volume and number; and side effects of treatment.RESULTS: Overall, 76 patients completed the study.Compared with baseline values, mean uterine volume was reduced significantly in both groups (p=0.01), and there was no significant difference between groups (p=0.99).The mean number of dominant myomas was reduced significantly in both groups (p=0.03), with no significant difference between groups (p=0.6).The mean volume of myomas was reduced significantly in both groups (p=0.01), with no significant difference between groups (p=0.45).Although a significant decrease in number and volume of myomas was documented in each group (p<0.05), the intergroup analyses did not reveal significant differences between the two groups in terms of the change in number (p=0.28) and volume (p=0.96) of myomas.Headache was significantly more common in the letrozole+cabergoline group (nine vs two cases, p=0.02), but the two groups were comparable for the remaining minor side effects.CONCLUSION: This study showed that 12 weeks of treatment with letrozole with and without cabergoline improved the size and volume of the uterus and myomas, led to symptom improvement, and could be used for short-term treatment prior to surgery or fertility programmes.CONDENSATION: Condensation letrozole in combination with cabergoline in the management of uterine fibroids.",0,0,0,0
25066875,"Prostate capsule sparing versus nerve sparing radical cystectomy for bladder cancer: results of a randomized, controlled trial.PURPOSE: Prostate capsule sparing and nerve sparing cystectomies are alternative procedures for bladder cancer that may decrease morbidity while achieving cancer control.However, to our knowledge the comparative effectiveness of these approaches has not been established.We evaluated functional and oncologic outcomes in patients undergoing these procedures.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a single institution trial in patients with bladder cancer in whom transurethral prostatic urethral biopsy and transrectal prostate biopsy were negative.Men were randomized to prostate capsule sparing or nerve sparing cystectomy with neobladder creation and stratified by Sexual Health Inventory for Men score (greater than 21 vs 21 or less).Our primary end point was 12-month overall urinary function as measured by Bladder Cancer Index.Secondary end points included sexual function, cancer control and complications.RESULTS: A total of 40 patients were enrolled in the study with 20 patients in each arm.Urinary function at 12 months decreased by 13 and 28 points in the prostate capsule and nerve sparing groups, respectively (p = 0.10).Sexual function followed a similar pattern (p = 0.06).There was no difference in recurrence-free, metastasis-free or overall survival (each p >0.05).The rate of incidentally detected prostate cancer was similar (p = 0.15).CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides a randomized comparison of prostate capsule sparing and nerve sparing cystectomy techniques.We found no difference in functional or oncologic outcomes between the 2 approaches, although our study was underpowered due to a lack of patient accrual.",0,0,0,0
25764091,"Predictive Accuracy of the PanCan Lung Cancer Risk Prediction Model -External Validation based on CT from the Danish Lung Cancer Screening Trial.OBJECTIVES: Lung cancer risk models should be externally validated to test generalizability and clinical usefulness.The Danish Lung Cancer Screening Trial (DLCST) is a population-based prospective cohort study, used to assess the discriminative performances of the PanCan models.METHODS: From the DLCST database, 1,152 nodules from 718 participants were included.Parsimonious and full PanCan risk prediction models were applied to DLCST data, and also coefficients of the model were recalculated using DLCST data.Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves and area under the curve (AUC) were used to evaluate risk discrimination.RESULTS: AUCs of 0.826-0.870 were found for DLCST data based on PanCan risk prediction models.In the DLCST, age and family history were significant predictors (p = 0.001 and p = 0.013).Female sex was not confirmed to be associated with higher risk of lung cancer; in fact opposing effects of sex were observed in the two cohorts.Thus, female sex appeared to lower the risk (p = 0.047 and p = 0.040) in the DLCST.CONCLUSIONS: High risk discrimination was validated in the DLCST cohort, mainly determined by nodule size.Age and family history of lung cancer were significant predictors and could be included in the parsimonious model.Sex appears to be a less useful predictor.KEY POINTS: * High accuracy in logistic modelling for lung cancer risk stratification of nodules.* Lung cancer risk prediction is primarily based on size of pulmonary nodules.* Nodule spiculation, age and family history of lung cancer are significant predictors.* Sex does not appear to be a useful risk predictor.",0,0,0,0
29117336,"Clinical and genetic predictors of paclitaxel neurotoxicity based on patient- versus clinician-reported incidence and severity of neurotoxicity in the ICON7 trial.Background: Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a dose-limiting toxicity of paclitaxel, with no reliable method to identify at-risk patients.We investigated the incidence and risk factors including genetic polymorphisms associated with the development of CIPN based on clinician and patient reporting of neuropathic symptoms.Patients and methods: Risk factors for the development of CIPN were examined in 454 patients treated with paclitaxel/carboplatin from the International Collaboration on Ovarian Neoplasms 7 (ICON7) trial.Neuropathy was graded by clinicians by standard adverse event reporting and by patients utilising OV28 questionnaire.Genetic risk factors were examined by selecting six single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes associated with microtubule function.Risk factors were assessed via dose-to-event cox regression models.Results: Grade >2 neuropathy was reported by clinicians in 28% of patients, while 67% of patients reported 'quite a bit' or 'very much' tingling or numbness.Agreement between clinicians and patients was poor (kappa = 0.236, 95% confidence interval, 0.177-0.296, P < 0.001).Older age, bevacizumab treatment and bowel resection were associated with clinician reported CIPN, while older age and volume of residual disease were associated with patient-reported neuropathy.There were no significant associations between clinician-reported neuropathy or patient-reported neuropathy and TUBB2, CEP72 or individual MAPT or GSK3B SNPs, however MAPT additive polymorphisms were associated with patient-reported neuropathy and GSK3B additive polymorphisms were associated with clinician reported CIPN.Conclusions: There was significant discordance between patient- and clinician-reported neurotoxicity.The lack of consensus regarding optimal outcome measures and whose opinion with regard to CIPN takes precedence is a limitation in the investigation of risk factors for CIPN.Care must be taken to select and include patient-reported outcome measures in CIPN assessment to enable accurate identification of genetic and other risk factors for neuropathy.",0,0,0,0
24080607,"New harmonic scalpel versus conventional hemostasis in right colon surgery: a prospective randomized controlled clinical trial.BACKGROUND: The Harmonic Scalpel (HS) is a device that uses vibrations to coagulate and cut tissues simultaneously.Its advantages are represented by minimal lateral thermal tissue damage, less smoke formation, no neuromuscular stimulation and no transmission of electricity to the patient.METHODS: A total of 211 consecutive patients (113 men, 98 women; mean age 64 years) undergoing hemicolectomy for cancer of the right colon were divided into two groups, namely those in whom the operation was performed using a new HS handpiece (NHS; 108 patients) and those assigned to conventional hemostasis (CH; 103 patients).The two surgical groups were compared regarding patients' age and sex, tumor size, location, histotype and local invasiveness assessed by American Joint Cancer Committee stage, operative time, fluid content in the suction balloon (drainage volume) during the first 1-3 days after surgery, hospital stay and complications.RESULTS: Ultrasonic energy delivered through an HS has been shown to be safe and to produce minimal damage to the surrounding tissues because of its minimal heat production.Electrical devices allow hemostatic control in vessels up to 3 mm in diameter, while HS can coagulate vessels up to 5 mm in diameter; thus, HS allows not only better control of bleeding but also of lymphorrhea.In fact, the amount of fluid collected in the drainage was significantly lower in the NHS group compared to the CH group.Protein depletion influences the patient's regenerative capacity and thus also the occurrence of complications and recovery time.CONCLUSION: NHS is a useful device in colon surgery; it facilitates surgical maneuvers and reduces operative times and blood and lymphatic losses, allowing satisfactory maintenance of protein storage.This results in a lower incidence of complications and faster recovery by patients.",0,0,0,0

29696328,"Does Intermittent Pringle Maneuver Increase Postoperative Complications After Hepatectomy for Hepatocellular Carcinoma? A Randomized Controlled Trial.BACKGROUND: In a previous study, we have shown that intermittent Pringle maneuver (IPM) might increase postoperative complications after hepatectomy for various indications.Complications which thought to be related to IPM were ascites, pleural effusion, wound infection and intra-abdominal collection.The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that applying IPM during hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) could increase postoperative complications.METHODS: Between January 2013 and October 2016, eligible patients who received elective open hepatectomy for HCC were randomized to have IPM or no Pringle maneuver (NPM).Occurrence of various types of postoperative complications was specifically looked for.A routine postoperative day 5 abdominal ultrasound examination and chest X-ray were done to detect and grade any radiological ascites, pleural effusion and intra-abdominal collection.RESULTS: Fifty IPM and 50 NPM patients with histological proven HCC were recruited for final analysis.Demographics and operative parameters were comparable between the two groups.The postoperative complication rates were similar (IPM 36.0 vs. NPM 28.0%, P = 0.391).However, in the IPM group, more patients developed radiological posthepatectomy ascites (42.0 vs. 22.0%, P = 0.032) and pleural effusion (66.0 vs. 38.0%, P = 0.005).In patients with histologically proven cirrhosis, there were 28 IPM and 25 NPM patients.Again, there was no difference in postoperative complication rate but more radiological posthepatectomy ascites and pleural effusion in the IPM group.CONCLUSION: This trial was not able to detect a difference in postoperative complications whether IPM was applied or not, but use of IPM was associated with more subclinical ascites and pleural effusion.(ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01759901).TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01759901.",0,0,0,0
25738668,"Goserelin for ovarian protection during breast-cancer adjuvant chemotherapy.BACKGROUND: Ovarian failure is a common toxic effect of chemotherapy.Studies of the use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists to protect ovarian function have shown mixed results and lack data on pregnancy outcomes.METHODS: We randomly assigned 257 premenopausal women with operable hormone-receptor-negative breast cancer to receive standard chemotherapy with the GnRH agonist goserelin (goserelin group) or standard chemotherapy without goserelin (chemotherapy-alone group).The primary study end point was the rate of ovarian failure at 2 years, with ovarian failure defined as the absence of menses in the preceding 6 months and levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in the postmenopausal range.Rates were compared with the use of conditional logistic regression.Secondary end points included pregnancy outcomes and disease-free and overall survival.RESULTS: At baseline, 218 patients were eligible and could be evaluated.Among 135 with complete primary end-point data, the ovarian failure rate was 8% in the goserelin group and 22% in the chemotherapy-alone group (odds ratio, 0.30; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.09 to 0.97; two-sided P=0.04).Owing to missing primary end-point data, sensitivity analyses were performed, and the results were consistent with the main findings.Missing data did not differ according to treatment group or according to the stratification factors of age and planned chemotherapy regimen.Among the 218 patients who could be evaluated, pregnancy occurred in more women in the goserelin group than in the chemotherapy-alone group (21% vs. 11%, P=0.03); women in the goserelin group also had improved disease-free survival (P=0.04) and overall survival (P=0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Although missing data weaken interpretation of the findings, administration of goserelin with chemotherapy appeared to protect against ovarian failure, reducing the risk of early menopause and improving prospects for fertility.(Funded by the National Cancer Institute and others; POEMS/S0230 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00068601.).",0,0,0,0

22104618,"Does health-related quality of life improve for advanced pancreatic cancer patients who respond to gemcitabine? Analysis of a randomized phase III trial of the cancer and leukemia group B (CALGB 80303).CONTEXT: Gemcitabine for advanced pancreatic cancer (APC) is palliative and the prognosis is poor, making health-related quality of life (HRQOL) particularly important.OBJECTIVES: We evaluated HRQOL with the EuroQol (EQ-5D) in patients with APC participating in Cancer and Leukemia Group B 80303, a multicenter, double-blind, randomized trial comparing overall survival (OS) between two treatment arms: gemcitabine with bevacizumab or gemcitabine with placebo.METHODS: A consecutive subsample of patients was invited to complete the EQ-5D surveys.Because neither clinical nor HRQOL outcomes differed based on the study arm, analyses were pooled.Changes in mean scores from baseline to eight weeks and the prognostic value of the EQ-5D were evaluated.RESULTS: Mean index scores remained stable (0.78 at baseline [n=267], 0.79 at eight weeks [n=186], P=0.34, Wilcoxon signed rank test), attributable to a modest deterioration of physical function domain scores coincident with small improvements in pain and anxiety/depression scores.A small decline in visual analogue scale scores was observed (70.7 vs. 68.2, P=0.026).HRQOL changes within chemotherapy response strata revealed stable index scores but a trend of worsened physical function among patients with disease progression compared with those with stable or improved disease.Visual analogue scale scores trended downward over time irrespective of chemotherapy response status, with a statistically meaningful deterioration in patients who progressed (68.9 vs. 64.4, P=0.029).Baseline scores from both EQ-5D scales were significant predictors of OS in Cox proportional hazard models.CONCLUSION: Response to gemcitabine treatment in APC is not associated with appreciable improvement of global HRQOL.Small improvements in pain and mood are observed despite progressive functional decline.Those who respond to gemcitabine may experience a slight slowing of functional deterioration.",0,0,0,0
